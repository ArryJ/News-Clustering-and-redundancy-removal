0,2020/03/26,India paddler stuck in Spain after lockdown,"Takeme’s return flight was on March 24

India No. 14 and Railways table tennis player Takeme Sarkar is stranded in Spain because of the lockdown in Europe owing to the novel coronavirus.

Takeme had gone to Spain to train and play a few matches for Hotel Museo Patria Chica, a club which takes part in the Spanish league.

“I came here on February 25 and my club had arranged for the return tickets on March 24. My flight got cancelled because of the lockdown and now I can return only on May 11,” said Takeme from Priego de Cordoba in Spain. “The club is taking great care of me. I am in constant touch with my family and coaches Amit Dam and Tapan Chandra, who have been giving me the courage to endure this difficult situation.”

Fake news

A few days ago, India No. 22 Raj Mondal landed in trouble after returning from Spain, where he had been playing in the league. Some social media posts claimed he had tested positive for coronavirus and had been taken away by the police.

Mondal, who put himself in self-quarantine, said he had to approach the police authorities to stop the fake news from spreading.

“I want you to know I am safe under home quarantine and I don’t have any symptoms of the virus. He also mentioned that some people are “trying to create panic” by spreading false news about him.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/whu5o1/article31176352.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27TT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/india-paddler-stuck-in-spain-after-lockdown/article31176353.ece
1,2020/03/26,Olympics | Fresh dates needed to proceed further,"New Tokyo task force meets to discuss the next course of action

The Tokyo Olympics needs new dates for the Opening and Closing ceremonies in 2021. Nothing much can get done until those dates are worked out by the International Olympic Committee, the Japanese government and Tokyo organisers.

“We must decide this soon, otherwise it will be hard to decide on other things to follow,” Toshiro Muto, the CEO of the organising committee, told his senior directors on Thursday.

Two days after the unprecedented postponement was announced, the “Tokyo 2020 New Launch Task Force” must put the Games back together.

Pep talk

Muto and the president of the organising committee, Yoshiro Mori, each gave pep speeches. Mori, an 82-year-old former Japanese Prime Minister, drew on war memories from his youth to summon the resolve to redo in a few months what was seven years in the planning.

Muto ran off a condensed string of issues to be resolved: ticketing, security, venues, merchandise, accommodation, the Athletes Village, transportation and lining up unpaid volunteers.

He added he was looking at “thousands of contracts” and the interests of broadcasters, sponsors, the IOC, world sports federations and national Olympic committees.

“I didn’t imagine at all we’d be tested to this degree,” he acknowledged.

Massive expenses

He also voiced another reality. “Additional expenses are going to be quite massive we assume,” Muto said.

The Japanese financial newspaper Nikkei has estimated added costs due to the delay of $2.7 billion.

This would go on top of an official budget of $12.6 billion.

IOC President Thomas Bach said Wednesday that “all options are on the table” for new dates.

He said next year’s Olympics don’t have to be restricted to summer in the Northern Hemisphere and might occur sooner.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/m5ysqt/article31176104.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27MUTO,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/olympics-fresh-dates-needed-to-proceed-further/article31176105.ece
2,2020/03/26,Five legends for whom 2021 could be a bit too far,"All, except Tiger Woods, have won gold medals in the Games gone by

With the 2020 Olympics postponed until 2021, there are fears the delay will shatter the gold medal hopes of many ageing athletes. A looks at five evergreen stars for whom a delayed Tokyo Games might be a step too far.

ROGER FEDERER: The 20-time Grand Slam champion, who will be 40 in August 2021, won the Olympic gold when he partnered Stan Wawrinka to the men’s doubles title at the 2008 Beijing Games.

Federer was a quarterfinalist in singles in China, silver medallist in 2012 in London before injury forced him to skip the 2016 Games in Rio.

In Sydney, in 2000, Federer made the semifinals in singles but he still remembers Australia fondly as the place where he first started his romance with Mirka Vavrinec, who is now his wife.

“Overall, it was probably the most unbelievable Olympics I ever had,” said Federer, who was also Switzerland’s flag-bearer in Beijing and in Athens in 2004 where he had exited in the second round.

SERENA WILLIAMS: The US great will be 40 in September next year although her desire to play in Tokyo might not be as pressing as that of Federer’s. Serena already has four gold medals — singles at London in 2012 and women’s doubles with sister Venus in 2000, 2008 and 2012.

The sisters lost their opening round match in Rio in 2016 while Serena’s gold medal defence in singles ended at the hands of Elina Svitolina in the third round.

TIGER WOODS: Woods, who will turn 45 this December, would have struggled to make the US team for the Games had it had remained in its 2020 slot. He is currently only the sixth-ranked American, with just the top four guaranteed to make the squad.

Woods, the winner of 15 Majors, has been fighting a recurrence of a back injury so at least the delay to 2021 for the Olympics gives him renewed hope of a golden swansong. Organisers would be desperate for Woods to play after he missed the return of golf at the 2016 Games in Rio due to injury.

LIN DAN: The colourful and controversial Chinese badminton superstar will be 37 by the time the next Games roll around. Lin already has gold from Beijing and London to add to his five World titles.

However, there is a hint of unfinished business for Lin who was defeated in the bronze medal match in Rio in 2016 by great rival Lee Chong Wei, the man he had beaten in two finals.

ALLYSON FELIX: The only female track and field athlete in history to win six Olympic gold medals, Felix had spent the last two years preparing for a golden farewell at the Tokyo Olympics.

Felix, who turns 35 at the end of this year, will be racing against Father Time as she attempts to improve her tally in what will be her fifth consecutive Olympics appearance. The American star can take comfort from the fact she is by no means the oldest woman to chase Olympic glory in sprint events. Merlene Ottey was 40 when she anchored Jamaica’s 4x100m relay team to a bronze medal in 2000.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ulc6it/article31175892.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27FED,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/five-legends-for-whom-2021-could-be-a-bit-too-far/article31175895.ece
3,2020/03/26,Olympics 2021: India set to retain foreign coaches,"But the Games will have to wait for a year thanks to the raging COVID-19 pandemic.

Their stints were supposed to wind up after the Olympics this year but with the mega-event postponed till 2021, several foreign coaches training Indian athletes for Tokyo are set for extended tenures as they seek to complete their “unfinished mission”.

Whether it’s women’s wrestling coach Andrew Cook, shooting’s celebrated pistol coach Pavel Smirnov, boxing’s duo of Santiago Nieva and Rafaelle Bergamasco or athletics’ high performance director Volker Herrmann, their contracts were to end after the Games.

But the Games will have to wait for a year thanks to the raging COVID-19 pandemic. This translates into contract extension for India’s coaching imports in the “interest of continuity” and the process will be initiated once the national lockdown to combat the pandemic comes to an end.

“It’s the Sports Authority of India (SAI) which pays their salaries. We have to speak with them...They also know that these are extraordinary circumstances, so I don’t see any problem in getting extension in contracts for them,” Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) Secretary VN Prasood told PTI.

The WFI had roped in American Cook for women wrestlers and Georgian Temo Gabishvili for the Greco-Roman grapplers. Recently, the WFI had also taken the celebrated Bajrang Punia’s Georgian coach Shako Bentinidis under its wings.

“The situation will be clear once this 21-day lockdown is complete,” Prasood added.

The national governing body of shooting — NRAI — also does not foresee any problem in getting longer contracts for Smirnov and rifle coach Oleg Mikahilov. Their tenures were to end in August this year as the Olympics was scheduled from July 24 to August 9.

“There will be a review for sure. Naturally we will likely approach them (SAI) to give our coaches extension of their contracts. The president (Raninder Singh) will decide once the office opens but we would like them to continue with us,” an NRAI official said.

But are the coaches ready to accept these extended tenures? At least, those involved with boxing are.

“My contract with SAI runs out in December but I will stay back if offered an extension. It’s taken a lot to get the results and can’t really leave without crossing the line, can we? I will accept a longer contract if offered,” said Nieva.

The Boxing Federation of India said it is happy to oblige given that an unprecedented nine pugilists made the Tokyo cut in the very first qualifier tournament.

“All foreign coaches associated with us will get extensions. In fact, the Ministry wanted us to have them till the 2024 Games for continuity. So, it won’t be a problem but we have to wait for the lockdown to end,” said a top BFI officials.

“The paperwork will have to wait a few weeks.”

Athletics Federation of India president Adille Sumariwalla had a simple response to PTI’s query on extension for Volker.

“It is common sense.”

A step ahead of the rest in this case, Hockey India has already put in a plea to SAI, seeking longer tenures for men’s coach Graham Reid and women’s in-charge Sjoerd Marijne

“We have sent a request to SAI to extend the contracts of all support staff associated with both men’s and women’s teams, including foreign coaches,” Hockey India CEO Elena Norman said.

“We have spoken to all the foreign coaches and they have assured us that they are all committed to their jobs till Tokyo Games,” she added.

So far, close to 80 Indian athletes have qualified for the Games, the new dates for which are not yet out.

The strength of India’s contingent for Tokyo is expected to increase once the qualifiers are restarted.

But that will take a while to be figured out as the world battles travel restrictions and lockdowns in wake of the pandemic, which has led to more than 21,000 deaths till now.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/sj2j9l/article31172610.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OLYMPICS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/olympics-2021-india-set-to-retain-foreign-coaches/article31172611.ece

World champion shuttler P.V. Sindhu on Thursday donated ₹5 lakh each to the Chief Minister’s Relief Funds of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to fight the dreaded COVID-19 pandemic, which has claimed over 21,000 lives globally.

The number of positive cases in India has surpassed the 600-mark, while 13 deaths have been reported so far, prompting the government to put the country under lockdown till April 14 to halt the spread of the virus.

“I hereby donate an amount of ₹5,00,000/- each (₹5 lakhs ) towards the Chief Ministers Relief Fund for the States of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to fight against COVID-19,” the Hyderabad-born shuttler wrote on her twitter handle.

Telangana was created out of Andhra Pradesh in 2014.

The deadly disease, which has infected more than 4,00,000 people worldwide, has brought all sporting activities across the globe to a grinding halt, disrupting the Olympic qualifiers before pushing the Tokyo Games to next year.

Sindhu, who claimed a silver at the Rio Olympics, is assured of a spot at the Tokyo Games based on her rankings but has to wait for next year to compete in her second Olympics.

5,2020/03/26,Indian shuttlers for freeze in rankings,"Seek clarity about qualification process for the Tokyo Games

The Olympics postponement brought some relief but Indian shuttlers, including B. Sai Praneeth, are still wondering why the Badminton World Federation (BWF) is yet to freeze the rankings and sought clarity about the qualification process of the Tokyo Games.

The BWF had suspended all HSBC BWF World Tour events post the All England Championships due to the COVID-19 pandemic and there were calls for the extension of the Olympic qualification period which falls on April 28.

This is the time

But now with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) postponing the Olympics to next year, shuttlers believe its time BWF immediately freezes the ranking.

“Our points are getting deducted even though the tournaments were postponed by BWF due to the coronavirus. Swiss Open got postponed but my points got deducted.

“So like this, if they keep slashing the points for all the qualifiers which were postponed, I don’t know what will happen,” Praneeth said.

“BWF should at least freeze the rankings, later they can decide about the qualification depending on the the dates of Olympics but as of now there is no clarity.”

Praneeth, who was set to make his Olympic debut, said he is not sure about his participation as he will have to fight again for points.

Process will start again

“If Olympics would have happened in July, I would have been sure about my qualification but since it is now a year to go, so the process will again be on and I will have to fight for ranking points again.

“It is not easy to maintain that ranking. I can’t say what will happen after one year,” he said.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/hb2d0x/article31167401.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26SAI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/indian-shuttlers-for-freeze-in-rankings/article31167402.ece
6,2020/03/26,Indian TT players get more time,"Olympics postponement will help them prepare better

The postponement of Tokyo Olympics to next year due to the COVID-19 pandemic has given India’s table tennis squad more time to prepare and given the current scenario, the sport’s governing body TTFI is looking to fill the head coach’s position locally rather than hiring a foreign coach.

The head coach position has been lying vacant since the 2018 Asian Games due to multiple factors.

The Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) had tried to rope in Canadian Dejan Papic last year, but things did not work out as the latter decided to undergo a knee surgery when he was expected to join the squad.

“We can only look at an Indian coach now. There is no activity at the moment, but when things get better, I doubt a foreign coach would like to come here considering the global situation (due to coronavirus),” TTFI secretary-general M.P. Singh said.

Former national champions Soumyadeep Roy and Arup Basak have been working with the men’s and women’s teams respectively for more than a year.

No clarity

With the entire world sporting scene coming to a standstill due to the pandemic, there is lack of clarity over the Olympic qualification events.

The Asian qualifier was supposed to take place next month but world body ITTF has suspended all activity until the end of April.

“We are waiting for the ITTF to give us more details about the future. The Olympic qualifying events need to be rescheduled and may be fresh rankings will have to be considered for qualification,” Singh added.

India’s highest-ranked player G. Sathiyan, who is in line to qualify alongside veteran Sharath Kamal, said it is still too early to talk about the game.

“Decision can only be made after the world is able to contain the virus. Indian coach is an option but will have to discuss with TTFI and SAI when the time comes and take a call,” said Sathiyan.

The country is fighting a war against the novel coronavirus and the aim is to win it in 21 days, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Wednesday, a day after he announced a national lockdown of three weeks to combat the pandemic. Interacting with people in his Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi through videoconference, Mr. Modi said: “The Mahabharata war was won in 18 days, this war the whole country is fighting against coronavirus will take 21 days.”

Spain's COVID-19 death toll overtook that of China on Wednesday, rising to 3,434, after 738 people died over the past 24 hours, the government said. The spiralling number of deaths came as Spain entered the 11th day of an unprecedented lockdown to try and rein in the COVID-19 epidemic that has now infected 47,610 people, the health ministry said.

Many e-commerce firms were forced to suspend deliveries to their customers in major cities across the country on Wednesday with local authorities unable to ensure the safety of delivery persons on the first day of the 21-day nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the coronavirus pandemic.

There is scientific basis and epidemiological significance for the 21-day lockdown period announced by PM Modi.

The Union Health Ministry on Wednesday said there was “no community transmission yet,” with the country registering 606 coronavirus (COVID-19) positive cases with 10 deaths. The Ministry’s data indicate that 563 Indians and 43 foreigners have tested positive, with 553 active cases. “So far, 15,24,266 passengers have been screened at our airports and 22,928 samples collected,” it said.

A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide 21-day lockdown, the government too tried to get adjusted to this very changed reality. While Mr. Modi himself held a meeting of his Cabinet trying to maintain appropriate social distance, his colleague, Home Minister Amit Shah, is said to have cancelled all appointments with people other than Ministry related, and that too, only if the issue cannot be resolved over the phone.

Senior Congress leader P. Chidambaram on Wednesday called Prime Minister Narendra Modi's nationwide lockdown announcement a “watershed moment” in the country’s fight against Coronavirus and appealed to people to be the foot soldiers of Mr. Modi, whom he described as the ‘commander’ of the fight.

India strongly condemned Wednesday’s terror strike on a Gurudwara in Kabul, and pledged to help the Sikh and Hindu communities of Afghanistan. The attack began at 7.45 in the morning and continued till midday which left at least 11 dead. The attackers temporarily took around 200 devotees hostage during this time.

These are the National AIDS Research Institute, Pune; the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, Kolkata; and the National Institute of Pathology, New Delhi.

The death toll in Spain surged to 4,089 after 655 people died within 24 hours, the Health Ministry said on Thursday.

It was a 19% rise on figures released on Wednesday in Spain, which has the world’s second highest death toll from the disease after Italy. The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 rose to 56,188.

Despite a lockdown imposed on March 14, which Parliament on Thursday agreed to extend until April 11, both deaths and infections have continued to mount. But the rise in the number of new deaths was smaller than that recorded on Wednesday, when the figure rose by 738.

Health authorities are hoping it will soon become clear whether the lockdown is having the desired effect.

The Madrid region has suffered the brunt of the epidemic with 17,166 infections – just under a third of the total – and 2,090 deaths, or 51% of the national figure.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, whose wife is infected with the virus, has said this is the country's most difficult moment since its 1936-39 civil war.

“Only the oldest, who knew the hardships of the civil war and its aftermath, can remember collective situations that were harsher than the current one.

10,2020/03/26,Chinese city eases lockdown but life is far from normal,"Warnings remind people that the virus still poses a threat

Banners warning that playing cards together is suicide and guards yelling at crowds to separate: a Chinese city near the coronavirus (COVID-19) ground zero remains far from normal even after emerging from a two-month lockdown.

Huanggang, home to 7.5 million people, was among the worst-affected areas in Hubei, the province where the new coronavirus first emerged late last year.

Travel restrictions were loosened on Wednesday and — if healthy — people were allowed to leave Hubei, where more than 50 million people were placed under lockdown in January to prevent the spread of the virus.

‘Not safe’

But warnings were prominently displayed across Huanggang city to remind people that the virus still posed a threat. “If you don’t wear a mask, the virus will fall in love with you,” said a banner.

Restaurants re-opened — but diners weren’t allowed to eat inside. Instead, delivery drivers collected takeout orders, as a handful of customers ate at tables outside.

Nearly 3,000 people were infected and 125 died in Huanggang, which is now considered a low-risk area.

Like other regions in the province, people can travel in and out of the city if they have a “green” health status on a special phone app.

But despite the easing of restrictions, Huanggang is still on edge, and officials repeatedly said the situation was still “not safe”.

A closed field hospital is a testament to the vast changes the city has already gone through. The Dabieshan Medical Center was under construction when the epidemic broke out, but new walls and equipment were rapidly drafted in to make it suitable for treating infectious diseases. The final patients were discharged last week and now the empty hospital is dark and deserted. Protective equipment lay on the ground, with abandoned quilts and flasks next to beds in empty wards.

Du Zhiqiang, who is in charge of the hospital’s construction, said the power had been turned off after it was decommissioned as a COVID-19 facility.

Many Huanggang residents, however, jumped at the chance to go out.

The World Health Organization’s European office said on Thursday it saw “encouraging signs” as Italy reported a lower rate of infections of the new coronavirus (COVID-19), cautioning it was too soon to say whether the worst had passed.

“While the situation remains very serious, we are starting to see some encouraging signs,” WHO Regional Director for Europe, Hans Kluge, told a press conference. “Italy, which has the highest number of cases in the region, has just seen a slightly lower rate of increase, though it is still too early to say that the pandemic is peaking in that country,” he added.

WHO Europe said that to date over 220,000 cases of COVID-19 had been reported on the continent, along with 11,987 deaths.

That means that globally, roughly six out of every 10 cases and seven out of 10 deaths have been reported in Europe, with the number of confirmed infections worldwide now over 4,00,000.

As the new coronavirus has spread across the continent, many European countries have adopted severe measures to curb the outbreak, including imposing lockdown measures and closing businesses and borders, as well as limiting public gatherings.

According to Mr. Kluge they will soon be able to determine the degree to which those measures have had an impact.

The leaders agreed to have more interactions of G-20 Foreign Ministers, health officials and the respective Sherpas before the Riyadh Summit of the G-20 nations in November 2020.

Strong signal

In his opening remarks King Salman spoke of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global growth and financial markets. He said that the G-20 must send a “strong signal to restore confidence in the global economy by resuming, as soon as possible, the normal flow of goods and services, especially vital medical supplies.” In the effort to control the pandemic, most countries have acted individually he said, stressing the need for a more coordinated effort.

Prime Minister Modi, who had first suggested the video-conference, also called for a bigger mandate and more funding for the World Health Organisation, which he said had failed to “adapt itself to deal with the new challenges the international community has faced.”

WHO’s “failure”

Many countries have been critical of WHO’s failure to alert the world quickly enough of the potential threat from the pandemic, even after it had been informed of its spread in Wuhan by China on December 31 last year. Others, most notably the United States, have been particularly critical of China for not having been transparent and shared information about the pandemic, and have even called for the virus to be named the “Chinese virus” or the “Wuhan virus,” a move China has opposed strongly.

Finally, there have been differences in the approach by G-20 countries towards lockdowns in order to control the pandemic spread through social distancing. Last week, Mr. Trump had hinted that he wanted to lift the shutdown in the US as it was impacting the economy, saying that the “cure cannot be worse than the problem itself.”

Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has called state-imposed lockdowns a “crime,” while countries like India have imposed a stringent 21-day lockdown across the country.

Differences

When asked about all the differences, sources privy to the deliberations said that there had been no “effort to ascribe blame or responsibility” for the pandemic, and the focus for the G-20 leadership was on how to handle the global challenge and help the rest of the world deal with it.

13,2020/03/26,U.S. indicts Maduro for ‘narco-terrorism’,"Also indicted were more than a dozen other officials of the Maduro regime, including members of the Venezuelan military and judiciary, including the country’s Chief Justice.

The US Justice Department announced the indictment on Thursday of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and offered a $15 million reward for information leading to his capture.

The Justice Department called Mr. Maduro the head of a cocaine trafficking group called “The Cartel of the Suns” that exported hundreds of tonnes of drugs working hand in hand with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, which the U.S. has officially labelled a “terrorist organization.”

Also indicted were more than a dozen other officials of the Maduro regime, including members of the Venezuelan military and judiciary, including the country’s Chief Justice.

The indictments were issued in multiple U.S. jurisdictions including New York and Miami, with charges running from “conspiracy to narco-terrorism” to money laundering.

“For more than 20 years, Maduro and a number of high-ranking colleagues allegedly conspired with the FARC, causing tons of cocaine to enter and devastate American communities,” said Attorney General Bill Barr. “It’s time to call out this regime for what it is,” he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1ha6kk/article31176048.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THRDMADURO1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-indicts-maduro-for-narco-terrorism/article31176049.ece
14,2020/03/26,Sri Lanka frees soldier who killed 8 Tamils,"In 2015, Staff Sergeant Sunil Ratnayake was convicted for the killings in Mirusuvil, Jaffna Peninsula, and sentenced to death.

Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Thursday pardoned and released an Army man who was on death row for killing eight Tamil civilians, including a five-year-old and two teenagers, in 2000 during the civil war.

“The President has instructed the Ministry of Justice to release Sgt Ratnayake from prison,” a spokeswoman at the Presidential Media Division said.

In 2015, Staff Sergeant Sunil Ratnayake was convicted for the killings in Mirusuvil, Jaffna Peninsula, and sentenced to death.

In 2019, the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence.

TNA condemns pardon of murder convict

The Tamil National Alliance (TNA), Sri Lanka’s main party representing Tamils of the north and east, condemned President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s decision to pardon and release the Army officer.

“If true, we condemn the opportunistic action of Prez @GotabayaR under guise of dealing with the issue of prisoners at a time like this. This is one case in which a person was actually convicted. Other cases weren’t even prosecuted or were acquitted,” the TNA tweeted.

Sri Lanka has been on a near-total lockdown and enforced curfew for a week now, with a total of 104 COVID-19 patients reported so far.

In 2015, Staff Sergeant Sunil Ratnayake was tried before a three-member bench at the Colombo High Court. He was convicted for the murder in Mirusuvil, Jaffna Peninsula, and sentenced to death. In 2019, the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and the sentence.

Rare instance

The case is widely cited as a rare instance of accountability, amid lingering concerns over impunity for war-crimes committed during Sri Lanka's three-decade civil war.

Issuing a statement, rights watchdog Amnesty International said using the pandemic as an opportunity to release those convicted for heinous crimes is reprehensible. “Victims have a right to justice, and Sri Lanka has an obligation to ensure that justice is done.

Semblance of justice

After many long years, the victims of the Mirusuvil massacre from 2000 finally got a semblance of justice in 2015. It is despicable to have that justice reversed through an arbitrary executive decision,” Amnesty regional director Biraj Patnaik said.

Asked to comment on the Presidential pardon, Nimal Siripala de Silva, Minister of Justice, Human Rights and Legal Reforms, said a report had been called from his Ministry. “The final decision is with the President. He can overrule anything. He has the absolute power to grant pardon, no one can question him,” he told The Hindu, adding that the constitutionally mandated procedure for the pardon was followed.

M.A. Sumanthiran, former Jaffna MP and a senior lawyer, said the executive pardon in the “rarest of rare cases” that ended in a conviction confirms that the Sri Lankan state “will never” exercise accountability for war-time atrocities.

“All the institutions of the state will eventually conspire together and let the offenders go free,” he told The Hindu.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/irlma0/article31177306.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Gotabaya,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tna-condemns-pardon-of-murder-convict/article31176027.ece
15,2020/03/26,Ex-FBI agent missing for 13 years died in Iran: kin,"President Donald Trump did not confirm Bob Levinson’s death, saying that Iran had not communicated any news on the former agent, who would have turned 72 this month.

A former FBI agent who mysteriously vanished in 2007 died in Iranian custody, his family has concluded, saying U.S. intelligence had made them give up 13 years of hope.

President Donald Trump did not confirm Bob Levinson’s death, saying that Iran had not communicated any news on the former agent, who would have turned 72 this month.

But Mr. Levinson’s family said on Wednesday that it had learned that he was dead, although it gave no information on how or when. “We recently received information from the U.S. officials that has led both them and us to conclude that our wonderful husband and father died while in Iranian custody,” the family said in a statement.

“We don’t even know when, or even if, his body would be returned to us. This is the very definition of cruelty.” The family said Levinson died before the coronavirus pandemic, which has hit Iran hard and led authorities to release thousands of prisoners temporarily.

Levinson is one of a number of Americans who have disappeared in arch-enemy Iran, but his case has been among the most perplexing, with his family until now insisting he was alive.

The father of seven vanished in March 2007 in Kish, an island that has more lenient visa rules than the rest of Iran, and was said to have been investigating cigarette counterfeiting.

But The Washington Post reported in 2013 that Mr. Levinson, who had retired from the FBI, was working for the CIA and had gone on a rogue mission aimed at gathering intelligence on Iran.

It said at the time that the CIA paid $2.5 million to Mr. Levinson’s wife Christine, accepting responsibility for his disappearance.

Iran implicitly denied on Thursday that Mr. Levinson had died in its custody, restating its longstanding position that he left the Islamic republic “years ago”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ex-fbi-agent-missing-for-13-years-died-in-iran-kin/article31176001.ece
16,2020/03/26,Coronavirus | Germany says low death rate is due to widespread testing,"The country has over 36,000 declared cases of COVID-19, among the highest in Europe, but Germany’s death rate is 0.54% while Italy and Spain have around 10% and 7.3% respectively.

Germany is testing up to 500,000 people a week for the new coronavirus, a virologist said Thursday, adding that early detection has been key in keeping the country’s death rate relatively low.

The country has more than 36,000 declared cases of the virus, among the highest in Europe, but has managed to avoid the high death rates seen in hard-hit Italy and Spain. Experts say widespread testing and tracing of COVID-19 cases is key to limiting the spread of the disease, an approach adopted in South Korea and Singapore where the outbreak has largely been contained.

In Germany, virologist Christian Drosten said it had helped to keep the death rate under control. “The reason why Germany has so few deaths compared to the number of infected people can be explained by the fact that we carry out an extremely large number of laboratory diagnostic tests,” said Mr. Drosten, who heads the Institute of Virology at Berlin’s Charite University Hospital.

“Estimates from the last days show that we are carrying out half a million tests a week,” he said. He added that a vast network of laboratories across the country had helped with the widespread testing.

Germany’s Health Minister Jens Spahn confirmed that between 300,000 and 500,000 tests were carried out in Germany last week alone, with about 10% coming back positive. “That’s likely to be the most tests of any country in the world, in both absolute and relative terms,” he said.

Among Germany’s population of 83 million, 36,508 are confirmed infected, including 198 who have died from the disease, according to official data compiled by the disease control agency Robert Koch Institute.

Search for treatment

At 0.54%, Germany’s death rate is far lower than Italy’s rate of around 10% and Spain’s fatality rate of 7.3%. France’s death rate is about 5.2%. Besides the large-scale testing, experts in Germany also said the virus has largely affected a younger, healthier section of the population compared to elsewhere.

At the same time, experts have repeatedly warned that in the country where almost a quarter of the population is over 60, the number of deaths could still skyrocket if people do not stick to measures to help halt the contagion. Lockdown measures are in place across Germany, preventing people from leaving their homes except for essential trips, while most shops, restaurants and bars are closed.

Berlin’s Research Ministry said it would commit 150 million euros ($164 million) to improve communication between hospitals and laboratories about coronavirus patients’ health data, hoping the information exchange could feed into development of a vaccine.

Mr. Drosten suggested that some rules on clinical research could be loosened in the search for a coronavirus treatment. But he downplayed the use of anti-malarial drug chloroquine — hyped by U.S. President Donald Trump — for infected patients.

“There are substances that are much more promising,” he said, using the example of Favipiravir, a flu medication.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/gn5wzz/article31175607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001PV1H1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-germany-says-low-death-rate-is-due-to-widespread-testing/article31175604.ece

During an video conference of the world's major economies, the leaders said they were committed to restoring confidence, preserving financial stability and reviving growth.

They said they were committed to resolving disruptions to global supply chains and asked finance ministers and central bank governors to coordinate regularly together and with international organisations to develop an action plan in response to the pandemic.

G20 leaders said they were ready to strengthen global financial safety nets, called for more private sector coordination and said “we will overcome this” together.

“We are gravely concerned with the serious risks posed to all countries, particularly developing and least developed countries, and notably in Africa and small island states,” the leaders said in a statement, adding that refugees and displaced persons face “particular risk”.

Saudi king to G20: let's unite against coronavirus

Saudi Arabia's King Salman called on Thursday for G20 leaders to boost funding for a coronavirus vaccine, resume the normal flow of goods and services as soon as possible, and help developing countries overcome the global health crisis.

His remarks came at the opening of an extraordinary, 90-minute video conference convened by the world's major economies to coordinate action over the outbreak that has infected more than 470,000 people and killed more than 21,000 worldwide.

“We must have an effective and coordinated response to this pandemic,” the king said. “On the trade front, the G20 must send a strong signal to restore confidence in the global economy by resuming, as soon as possible, the normal flow of goods and services, especially vital medical supplies.”

The G20, currently chaired by Saudi Arabia, has faced criticism of a slow response to the worsening crisis, which is expected to trigger a global recession.

Some member countries have announced economic stimulus packages to offset broad suspensions of air travel and shutdowns of many businesses.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged G20 leaders to match a pledge by countries like Australia and Canada to keep supply chains open and avoid export controls.

World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was to address the G20 to seek support for ramping up funding and production of personal protection equipment for health workers amid a global shortage.

“We have a global responsibility as humanity and especially those countries like the G20,” Tedros told a news conference in Geneva late on Wednesday. “They should be able to support countries all over the world.”

Frictions

King Salman urged cooperation in financing research and development for therapeutics and a vaccine, ensuring the availability of vital medical supplies and equipment, and helping less developed countries build capacities.

Chinese President Xi Jinping followed him, advocating joint macroeconomic policies to stop the world from entering recession and stabilise the global industrial supply chain by facilitating trade and removing barriers.

Despite calls for cooperation, the G20 risks entanglement in an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia and frictions between the United States and China over the origin of the virus.

In preparatory meetings, Beijing and Washington agreed to call a timeout on their coronavirus blame game, the South China Morning Post reported, citing diplomatic sources.

But talks among U.N. Security Council nations have stalled over U.S. insistence that any joint statement call attention to the coronavirus' origins in China, NBC News reported.

The United States administration has said that H-1B visa (skilled temporary) workers can expect to be treated with “very reasonable consideration,” for requests to telework as part of their companies’ current work policies, a senior official in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said on a briefing call with reporters earlier this week.

U.S. companies across many States have moved to teleworking in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The official, who was responding to a question from Asian News International (ANI) news agency, said that while they would not be able to comment on the specific direction of policy without consulting the United States Citizenship Information Service (USCIS), they expected it to have a “very reasonable” view of the situation.

“… we are supporting, across the department, steps for safer working environments in light of the Coronavirus, so I would be expecting to see that extended to the terms and conditions enforced with respect to H-1B visas,” he said.

“I think you can expect to have a very reasonable consideration from USCIS in all of these sort of circumstances that are only caused by the Coronavirus.”

Generally, an amended or new H-1B petition needs to be filed prior to a worker starting work at a new site. Once the amendment is filed, the worker can start working at the new location immediately, without having to wait for a final decision on the petition.

USCIS offices have been closed to the public since March 18 and will remain shut until April 17, unless the pandemic situation does not permit it. Emergency appointments may be scheduled via the USCIS contact centre.

Visa over-stayers

If you are in the U.S. now and your visa is expiring and you are unable to leave because there are no flights to your home country due to the pandemic , you can apply for an extension to the USCIS, the official said.

“So visas, for instance, where an extension is being requested today and you’re going to a country where the flights have been taken down, can readily be expected to be favorably received by USCIS, whereas say two months ago that would not have been the case. If flights are available and your visa’s coming to an end, you’d have been expected to get on one of those flights and return home.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/n58mqw/article31171752.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HOMELANDSECURITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-to-consider-favourably-teleworking-for-h1-b-workers/article31171753.ece
19,2020/03/26,UN condemns terrorist attack on Sikhs in Afghanistan,"A statement from UN chief said that attacks against civilians are unacceptable and those who carry out such crimes must be held accountable

The United Nations has condemned the terrorist attack on a Gurudwara in Kabul that killed at least 25 people, with the UN chief calling for the perpetrators of such crimes to be held accountable and the world body emphasising that there can be no justification for the killing of civilians at a religious house.

At least 25 worshippers were killed and eight others injured when a heavily armed suicide bomber stormed his way into a prominent Gurudwara on Wednesday in the heart of Afghanistan’s capital of Kabul, in one of the deadliest attacks on the minority Sikh community in the strife-torn country.

The Islamic State (IS) terror group, which has targeted Sikhs before in Afghanistan, claimed responsibility for the attack on the Gurudwara in Shor Bazar area at about 7.45 a.m. (local time) as 150 worshippers were inside the building.

The Secretary-General condemns the attack in Kabul on a Sikh-Hindu temple in which dozens of civilians were killed and injured. He expresses his deepest sympathies to the families of the victims and wishes a speedy recovery to those injured, Secretary General Guterres’ spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement on Wednesday.

It added that the Secretary-General reiterates that attacks against civilians are unacceptable and those who carry out such crimes must be held accountable.

“The United Nations stands in solidarity with the people and the Government of Afghanistan and will continue supporting efforts to bring peace to their country, the statement said.

In a tweet, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said it is “outraged” by the attack.

“There can be no justification for the killing of civilians at a religious house. Our condolences to the victims and their families.”

High Representative for the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC) Miguel Angel Moratinos expressed his “dismay” at the terrorist attack at the Gurudwara, which killed 25 victims, including a child.

The “despicable attack comes at a time when the world is facing a pandemic which adversely impacts all of us, requiring us to stand together as “One Humanity”, Moratinos said.

He stressed that attacks targeting sacred sites and worshippers are intolerable and have to stop. Recalling the UN Plan of Action to Safeguard Religious Sites, he called on all governments and relevant stakeholders to support the implementation of the plan to guarantee the sanctity of worship places and the safety of worshipers.

Moratinos said the latest attack adds to an expanding number of attacks targeting various faith communities around the world. He reiterated that such outrageous acts of terror should not dissuade us from working together to promote solidarity, respect, and peace globally.

On behalf of the UNAOC, the High Representative expressed his condolences to the victims’ families and conveys his solidarity to the people and the Government of Afghanistan.

India’s ambassador to Afghanistan visits gurudwara

India’s Ambassador to Afghanistan Vinay Kumar on Thursday visited the Sikh gurudwara and offered condolences to families of the victims of the horrific attack.

“Amb @vkumar1969 visited the gurudwara and met community leaders, elders and families of the victims of terrorist attack. He shared their grief and offered condolences. He was told that the injured are receiving satisfactory treatment,” the Indian embassy in Afghanistan said in a tweet.

The embassy also said it was working for the return of the mortal remains of Tian Singh, one of the deceased from Delhi, whose family wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to help them bringing back the mortal remains.

“@IndianEmbKabul is working for the return of the mortal remains of Shri Tian Singh. @IndianEmbKabul will continue to provide all assistance to the community and families as may be required in these difficult days,” it said.

Prime Minister Modi said on Wednesday that he was “saddened” by the attack on the gurudwara when 150 worshippers were inside the building.

“I am saddened by today’s terror attack at Gurudwara in Kabul. I express my condolences to the families of all the deceased,” he said in a tweet.

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) also condemned the attack that lasted for about six hours, terming it cowardly and reflective of a “diabolical mindset”.

“Such cowardly attacks on places of religious worship of the minority community, especially at this time of the COVID-19 pandemic, is reflective of the diabolical mindset of the perpetrators and their backers, it said in a statement.

The MEA said India stood in solidarity with the people, the government and the security forces of Afghanistan in their efforts for bringing peace and security to the country.

“We commend the brave Afghan security forces for their valorous response to the attack and their exemplary courage and dedication to protect the Afghan people and secure the country,” it said.

21,2020/03/26,Filipino shares his experiences as coronavirus survivor,"He tells about how does it feel like to be a patient, his scariest moment among other things.

When Carlo Navarro, his wife and 15-year-old daughter visited Japan from the Philippines in February, they knew they were taking a chance with the coronavirus, but thought they would be spared if they took precautions. They wore masks and gloves and always had alcohol handy to sanitize their hands.

But Mr. Navarro, a 48-year-old tax lawyer, began showing symptoms after they returned home. He was the fourth case in the Philippines, but the first Filipino to be confirmed with the disease.

An enhanced community quarantine has been in place since March 16 in the northern third of the Philippines, which nationwide had 636 cases with 38 deaths and 26 recoveries from COVID-19 as of Wednesday.

Mr. Navarro is among those who have recovered, and as someone who felt he had been close to death, he has vowed to spread awareness. AP asked Mr. Navarro five questions about his experience in a Skype video interview as he continues his self-quarantine on his farm in Lipa, Philippines.

Q: Where do you suspect you got the virus?

A: “The entire time that we were in Japan, there was really no contact with anyone that had a cough or cold. But on our way back ... I was seated in front of a person, a Filipino person who was coughing vigorously. My daughter told me, ‘Dad, I think it’s dangerous to sit there. You need to move right now.’ I couldn’t move because the plane was about to take off. So it took me another 20 minutes before I could transfer to another seat. And true enough, seven days after we arrived back in the Philippines, I started to develop chills and my temperature was fluctuating. And that night of March 3, I started coughing vigorously. So the following morning, I decided to go to St. Luke’s (hospital) ... to have myself tested. That’s the start of my journey as a COVID-19 patient.”

Q: What does it feel like to be a patient?

A: “In the hospital, the coughing persisted. The chills were still there. And then there were muscle pains. My entire body was aching. On the third day, it started to disappear. Like the muscle pains are gone. The chills ... they came and went. But my cough was still there. It was on the fifth or sixth day that I started to have diarrhea. And the doctor got scared. ... That evening, they X-rayed me and they were able to confirm that pneumonia was beginning to develop in my lungs. By then, the chills were back. And then, that evening of the sixth day, I got a fever. ... Those were the symptoms that I was experiencing.”

Q: How were you able to cope?

A: “I was alone in the hospital room because nobody can visit you, not even your family members. So we are really in isolation. It’s a negative pressure room. My wife and I had video calls almost every hour. She was checking on me to make sure that I’ve eaten, that I drank enough water. ... And every time I felt fear, I would immediately call my wife and my daughter just to suspend the reality that I was in a hospital.”

Q: What was the scariest moment for you?

A: “The scariest moment was maybe starting on the fourth day when people who got admitted at the same time as me started dying early in the morning. You know, you would hear people crying or wailing because they had lost their loved ones.. ... I could hear the running of the nurses and doctors outside of my room. And that really scared me. When I asked the nurses,’’How are the other patients doing?” one of them said, ‘Sir, number 5. number 6, they died already.’ And they were just beside me. That was the most frightening moment of my life.”

Q: What’s the message you want to share with the public about your experience?

A: “I want you to know that once you have symptoms, you need to immediately isolate yourself. There’s no way you can take the risk that the elderly or high-risk groups in your family will get contaminated or will get the virus. You need to go to the hospital to get yourself tested. If they don’t have the testing kits, you just need to stay home and isolate yourself. It’s important that people know that they should not fear going to the hospital and that’s the only way you can protect your loved ones.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bvkp8k/article31170148.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRUSOUTBREAKPHILIPPINESCOVIDSURVIVOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/filipino-shares-his-experiences-as-coronavirus-survivor/article31170149.ece

As of Wednesday, the overall confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland had reached 81,285, this included 3,287 people died of the disease, 3,947 patients still being treated and 74,051 patients discharged after recovery, the NHC said.

So far, 410 confirmed cases, including four deaths have been reported in Hong Kong 30 confirmed cases in the Macao SAR, and 235 in Taiwan including two deaths, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

China on Wednesday downgraded the risk level of the coronavirus in its epicentre Wuhan from high to medium and resumed bus services within the city for the first time since the nine-week lockdown.

China has decided to lift the three-month lockdown on more than 56 million people in the central Hubei province. However, the prolonged lockdown of Hubei’s capital Wuhan will end on April 8, lifting the mass quarantine over the city with a population of over 11 million.

Also, Wuhan will resume commercial flights from April 8, excluding international flights and flights to and from Beijing.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/y758lj/article31170069.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUSCHINA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-china-reports-67-new-imported-cases/article31170070.ece
23,2020/03/26,U.S. Senate unanimously passes $2.2 trillion coronavirus rescue package,"The 880-page measure is the largest economic relief bill in U.S. history.

The U.S. Senate late Wednesday passed an unparalleled $2.2 trillion economic rescue package steering aid to businesses, workers and health care systems engulfed by the coronavirus pandemic.

The unanimous vote came despite misgivings on both sides about whether it goes too far or not far enough and capped days of difficult negotiations as Washington confronted a national challenge unlike it has ever faced.

The 880-page measure is the largest economic relief bill in U.S. history. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared somber and exhausted as he announced the vote - and he released senators from Washington until April 20, though he promised to recall them if needed.

""The legislation now before us now is historic because it is meant to match a historic crisis,” said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. “Our health care system is not prepared to care for the sick. Our workers are without work. Our businesses cannot do business. Our factories lie idle. The gears of the American economy have ground to a halt.”

The package is intended as relief for an economy spiraling into recession or worse and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that’s killed nearly 20,000 people worldwide. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, asked how long the aid would keep the economy afloat, said- “We’ve anticipated three months. Hopefully, we won’t need this for three months.”

Underscoring the effort’s sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion annual federal budget.

Insistently optimistic, U.S. President Donald Trump said of the greatest public-health emergency in anyone’s lifetime, “I don’t think its going to end up being such a rough patch” and anticipated the economy soaring “like a rocket ship” when it’s over.

The drive by leaders to speed the bill through the Senate was slowed as four conservative Republican senators from states who economies are dominated by low-wage jobs demanded changes, saying the legislation as written might give workers like store clerks incentives to stay on unemployment instead of returning return to their jobs since they may earn more money if they’re laid off than if they’re working. They settled for a failed vote to modify the provision.

Other objections floated in from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has become a prominent Democrat on the national scene as the country battles the pandemic. Cuomo, whose state has seen more deaths from the pandemic than any other, said, “I’m telling you, these numbers don’t work.”

Ardent liberals like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were restless as well, but top Washington Democrats assured them that a additional coronavirus legislation will follow this spring and signaled that delaying the pending measure would be foolish.

The sprawling measure is the third coronavirus response bill produced by Congress and by far the largest. It builds on efforts focused on vaccines and emergency response, sick and family medical leave for workers, and food aid.

Senate passage delivered the legislation to the Democratic-controlled House, which will most likely pass it Friday.

The package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion programme for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home.

It includes a controversial, heavily negotiated $500 billion programme for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well.

Six days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress’ top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure is not an option, nor is starting over, which permitted both sides to include their priorities.

The bill would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child.

A huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks to an estimated $130 billion. Another $45 billion would fund additional relief through the Federal Emergency Management Agency for local response efforts and community services.

Democrats said the package would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time.

Businesses controlled by members of Congress and top administration officials - including Mr. Trump and his immediate family members - would be ineligible for the bill’s business assistance.

Europe is enacting its own economic recovery packages, with huge amounts of credit guarantees, government spending and other support.

Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, has agreed to commit over 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) in fiscal stimulus and support - roughly 30% of that nation’s entire annual output. France, Spain and Italy have launched similar programs.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.

24,2020/03/26,Indian-American hoteliers offer free accommodation to stranded Indian students,"The Indian Embassy have been running a round-the-clock helpline since last week for the students in the US, who number over 2,50,000.

Indian-American hoteliers have come forward to rescue the stranded Indian students in the U.S. following implementation of lockdown measures in the country in response to the rapidly-spreading coronavirus pandemic, offering them free accommodation and free meals.

With the students scrambling for a roof over their heads after being asked to vacate their hostels and India banning international flights for a week from March 22 due to the coronavirus pandemic, more than 6,000 rooms in nearly 700 hotels were offered to them by Wednesday following a call from the Indian Embassy.

The Indian Embassy have been running a round-the-clock helpline since last week for the students in the US, who number over 2,50,000.

Most of these hotels offered are in and around universities and colleges, but the hotel owners from across the country have come up in large numbers to the call given by community leaders, who have roped in Asian American Hotel Owners Association (AAHOA) for the purpose.

India’s Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu said in a tweet, “It is heartening to see that Indian; Indian-American and other hotel owners are coming forward to help people with accommodation in these testing times. Together we can overcome the fight against COVID19!”

“The Indian community has come together to help the student and many hotel owners have offered their rooms free of cost to them. Many of them are also offering free meals to these students,” Chicago-based community leader Nirav Patel told PTI.

Indian-American hotelier couple K.K. Mehta and Chandra Mehta have offered more than 100 rooms to Indian students at their two prime properties each near the Times Square and Barclays Center in New York City, said Jaipur Foot USA chairman Prem Bhandari on behalf of the hotels.

The Indian Consulate in New York had contacted them about this 10 days ago, he said.

“These students are the future of both India and the United States. All the top Indian-American CEOs, scientists and doctors came to this country as a student. It’s our moral duty to help them with our resources,” Mr. Bhandari said.

Regional director of AAHOA Upper Midwest Kalpesh Joshi said they had created a master list of the availability hotel rooms, which was being constantly updated.

Free accommodation would be allocated in coordination with the Indian Embassy and its consulates, he said.

“The Indian Embassy and its consulates are working tirelessly to get these students rooms,” he added.

Mr. Joshi has also sent out a video message to his hotelier colleagues: “Because of the coronavirus outbreak, our Indian students in the US are out of shelter. Let’s work together. As a hotelier, I would like to request all my hotelier friends to come forward... let’s provide some rooms to the students.”

Boston-based Computer Society of India (North America) has collaborated with AAHOA to help students and Indian IT professionals searching for emergency accommodation due to the COVID-19 lockdown.

Anyone who is having financial hardship will be given hotel accommodation either free of cost or the rates will not be more than USD 50, said the Computer Society of India (North America).

Minesh Patel, the chairman of Virginia Asian American Store Association, said between Richmond, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach, Indian-American hotel owners can help in arranging accommodation for over 500 Indian students.

Florida-based Vipul Patel, the national president of Asian American Store Owners Association, said support for the Indian students have been pouring in from the Indian-American hoteliers.

“I have not come across any hotel owner who said no to us,” Mr. Patel said.

Rooms would be allocated to students on the recommendation of the Indian Embassy and its consulates in Houston, Chicago, Atlanta, San Francisco and New York.

The Indian Consulate in New York was the first to take a lead in this regard. It has worked with Hammock Worldwide Hotels and Resorts to provide temporary accommodation for the students at a flat rate of $50 per night.

Mr. Joshi said that initially there was a suggestion to charge a convenience fee of $20-25 per day from the students. “But when a few of them offered free rooms and free meals, everyone agreed to it,” he said.

26,2020/03/26,"Coronavirus | Locked-down no longer, China's Hubei begins return to normal","The lockdown of Hubei's capital Wuhan will be lifted on April 8, a milestone in China's war against the epidemic.

Life started returning to normal on Wednesday after two months of lockdown in Hubei province, epicentre of China's coronavirus outbreak, with traffic controls lifted, construction resuming and people catching buses and trains across once-shut borders.

Mainland China also reported a drop in new confirmed coronavirus cases to 47 on Tuesday, all of them in travellers returning home, down from 78 infections reported a day earlier.

Hubei, a central province that is home to some 60 million people, had announced on Tuesday that it was removing travel restrictions at midnight.

“I booked my ticket this morning after hearing the news,” said Chen Ting, who was accompanied by her three-year-old son among about 40 people getting off a train in Hubei's Xianning city.

The 28-year-old had travelled from Qingyuan city in the southern province of Guangdong, where she runs a wholesale business. The coronavirus had forced her to cancel plans to visit her parents in February, after the Lunar New Year.

“I am so desperate to go back home now to see all of them there,” she said as she waited for her father to pick them up and drive to the family home in the nearby city of Huangshi.

On Wednesday evening in Xianning, residents strolled outside, carrying groceries or buying takeaway. Restaurants were only serving food for takeaway. Loudspeakers blared out promotions like buy one get one free. Everyone wore masks.

The lockdown of Hubei's capital Wuhan will be lifted on April 8, a milestone in China's war against the epidemic as Beijing shifts its focus towards stemming imported cases and rebooting the economy.

In Wuhan, there were also signs of normal life returning. Men in protective masks worked on a bridge as construction projects resumed, and residents waved from their apartment windows as a visiting medical team prepared to leave the city.

Back to work

The Hubei government on Wednesday told workers who had been quarantined at home to go back to work as soon as possible. The Wudang Mountains, a top scenic site, reopened for visitors.

Hubei Party Secretary Ying Yong said the government would continue to work hard to prevent a rebound in infections as population movements increase.

Travellers arriving in Xianning were subject to checks that lasted about 30 minutes and asked to show health codes on their mobile phones that proved they had not been in a high-risk area in the last fourteen days.

Passengers disregarded pleas to stand two metres apart.

Reflecting growing concern over imported cases, railway staff and police repeatedly said that those who had travelled from overseas needed to identify themselves.

“If you dont report we will find out anyway, said one officer. And there will be trouble.

Some people in the city expressed concern over reports on Tuesday that a man in Foshan in Guangdong province who had been in Xianning had tested positive for the virus. The official People's Daily, which reported the case, did not say how he was able to drive out of Hubei province on March 17 with a friend.

Screening

Even as the lockdown in Hubei is eased, strict measures to control infections from abroad continue to be put in place.

The Hubei government said anyone arriving in the province from abroad must inform authorities of their medical and travel history two days prior to travel.

To prevent a surge in imported cases, China is ramping up quarantine and screening rules for all international arrivals.

The city of Quanzhou in Fujian province will cancel all international and regional flights, starting on March 26, after four imported cases from the Philippines were found on Tuesday, the provincial government said.

Beijing has already diverted flights to other cities where passengers will be screened and quarantined.

New imported cases in Beijing, Guangdong and Fujian declined, though the daily tally of new imported infections rose to a record 19 cases in the financial hub of Shanghai.

27,2020/03/26,"Coronavirus | In Spain’s capital, ice rink turned into makeshift mortuary as number of cases soar","According to officials, nearly 14% of cases are health workers.

Nurses and doctors demanded action after Spain reported its sharpest daily increase in coronavirus cases on Tuesday and said about 14% of the nearly 40,000 infections were among health workers.

Nursing union SATSE said Madrid's hospitals were on “the verge of collapse” and needed urgent support, while a doctors' union said it had filed a lawsuit demanding protective equipment within 24 hours.

The capital's Palacio de Hielo mall, home to an Olympic-sized ice rink, began operating as a makeshift mortuary after authorities said facilities were unable to cope.

Police stood guard on Wednesday outside the rink, normally a popular venue for children's birthday parties, as hearses arrived at the building.

The Health Ministry reported around 6,600 new cases and 500 deaths overnight. Spain is Europe's worst-hit country after Italy and has recorded 3,434 deaths.

Health emergency chief Fernando Simon attributed the nearly 14% infection rate among medical staff to limited availability of protective equipment and several early clusters of the virus occurring in hospitals.

He said pressure on intensive-care units would continue even after transmission of the virus among the general population had peaked.

Madrid's AMYTS doctors' union said it had filed a lawsuit to force the regional health authority to deliver scrubs, masks and goggles to hospitals and other health centres. A spokesperson for the authority declined to comment.

Meanwhile, the government approved a burden-sharing scheme to help banks cope with loan non-payments as a result of the crisis. The state guaranteed around 80% of unpaid loans owed by small- to medium-sized companies and self-employed workers, and released an initial tranche of 20 billion euros.

The measures are part of an unprecedented 200 billion euros package approved last week to help companies and workers cope with mass stoppages.

Industry Minister Reyes Maroto said the government was working to help companies adapt their production lines to start large-scale production of kit that would help manage the crisis, including masks, disposable robes and ventilators.

Zara owner Inditex offered last week to make hospital gowns.

Nursing home crisis

Prosecutors in Catalonia opened an investigation into two nursing homes, the prosecutor general's office said, after at least 13 residents died of the virus at a home in Capellades and nine more at a home in Olesa de Montserrat.

Olesa's local government warned of a critical situation due to a lack of staff.

Military units dispatched to help care homes comply with sanitary regulations disinfected 179 facilities on Monday and planned to clean another 96 on Tuesday, officials said.

The state prosecutor launched a separate investigation after the army found unattended bodies at some homes.

In the southern region of Andalusia, the mayor of a small town pleaded for help after reporting 38 of 42 residents at the local nursing home had tested positive for the virus, along with 60% of staff.

“We need oxygen, ambulances and hospitals,” Alcala del Valle's Mayor Rafael Aguilera said in a video posted on the town's Facebook page. “A person died in our arms because we couldn't get hold of oxygen.”

Madrid long accounted for around half of Spain's coronavirus cases but data published on Tuesday showed it now had just under a third of the total, a sign the epidemic is spreading throughout the country.

28,2020/03/26,Christchurch shootings: New Zealand mosque shooter changes plea to guilty,"No reason was given for the change, which means he will no longer stand trial.

In an unexpected reversal, the Australian accused of murdering 51 Muslim worshippers in last year's mass shooting at two New Zealand mosques pleaded guilty to all charges on Thursday.

Brenton Tarrant, 29, had previously denied 51 charges of murder, 40 of attempted murder and one of engaging in a terrorist act but changed his plea after a hurriedly arranged court hearing.

“Yes, guilty,” Tarrant told Christchurch High Court via videolink from Auckland Prison as the charges were read out to him.

Tarrant, wearing a grey top, stared intently at the camera while making his plea.

No reason was given for the change, which means Tarrant will no longer stand trial, a process authorities had feared he would use as a platform to promote his racist ideology.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the admission of guilt would provide some relief to the many people whose lives were shattered in the attack.

“These guilty pleas and conviction bring accountability for what happened and also save the families who lost loved ones, those who were injured, and other witnesses, the ordeal of a trial,” she said.

Judge Cameron Mander recorded convictions on all charges and said Tarrant would be sentenced at a date yet to be determined.

“The guilty pleas represent a very significant step towards bringing finality to this criminal proceeding,” he said.

The plea came with New Zealand in its first day of a four-week COVID-19 lockdown.

Mander said sentencing would take place “at a time when victims and their families can attend the court in person”, he said.

The judge said advance reporting that Thursday's hearing was taking place was suppressed in case Tarrant changed his mind at the last minute and maintained his innocence.

'The right direction'

Tarrant's trial had been due to start on June 2 and last some six weeks and police commissioner Mike Bush said Thursday's hearing was hastily arranged after the gunman contacted his lawyers on Tuesday.

“Police appreciate this news will come as a surprise to the victims and the public, some of whom may have wished to be present in the courtroom,” he said in a statement.

Bush said imams from the Al Noor and Linwood mosques, the ones targeted by Tarrant, were among only 17 people allowed in court to hear the revised plea.

There was relief in New Zealand's small and tight-knit Muslim community that they would not have to endure a drawn-out trial raking over painful details of the worst mass shooting in modern New Zealand history.

“I have been praying for him and he has taken the right direction,” Farid Ahmed, whose wife Husna was killed, told TVNZ.

“I am pleased he is feeling guilty. It is a good start.”

Tarrant armed himself with an arsenal of semi-automatic weapons and attacked the Al Noor mosque first, before moving on to the Linwood prayer centre, livestreaming the killings as he went.

His victims were all Muslim and included children, women and the elderly.

In a rambling manifesto posted online before the killing spree, Tarrant said he had moved to New Zealand with the specific aim of conducting an atrocity against Muslims.

His actions prompted Ardern, who has vowed never to say the killer's name, to tighten New Zealand's gun laws and launch a campaign to curb online extremism.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/plt9cl/article29092251.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-BRENTONTARRANT-REUTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/christchurch-shootings-new-zealand-mosque-shooter-changes-plea-to-guilty/article31169048.ece

30,2020/03/26,"Gautham Menon on turning actor, ‘Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu 2’ and waiting to work with Fahadh Faasil","‘Trance’ and ‘Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal’ have launched the popular filmmaker as an actor in recent times

It’s not easy for one used to giving instructions to suddenly take them from someone else. There’s also the creative dilemma you have to deal with. Gautham Menon has directed some of the most talented actors around, but it took a couple of creators to perceive an effortless performer lurking in him. Even as he’s gently being pulled out of a financial quagmire and his fans are awaiting ‘Dhruva Natchathiram’, he’s earned admirers for his performances in ‘Trance’ and ‘Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal’.

Then again, most cinema fans are waiting with bated breath for an official announcement that he will be directing Kamal again in Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu 2’. Trusted sources tell me Kamal is kicked about the plot and has given the nod. Meanwhile Gautham can enjoy a paid holiday in front of the camera, that seems to like him in front too.

Are directors basically frustrated actors?

(Laughs) What a way to start. Not in any of the films I’ve directed so far. I’ve never felt I have to go and do it. Just to enhance I have dubbed for a few of the characters. I’ve never felt frustrated with anyone from Madhavan to Ajith, Surya, Simbu or Kamal sir. You have to work around them of course, like Vikram seems to not be listening to while you talk to him. Maybe it’s the eagerness to get things going. It’s not arrogance. It’s his way of saying I know what you want.

The first take may be different from what you have in mind, but you can tell him. It’s just that recently I’ve been meeting people like Anwar Rasheed and Fahadh Fasil who suggested acting and it’s just a window and I’m trying to poke my head in. I don’t want to let go of the opportunity. I’ve had a couple of really good experiences and a bad one where I had to walk out.

The question must be why me, when there are so many talented character actors around?

I’ve asked this of everyone who’s approached me, even Desingh (Kannum Kannum...). I have been offered full length roles before that film, but I’ve refused. I asked Anwar too. He said he liked the way I handle my interviews and the way I spoke. Some people see a negative streak in me.

It must be intimidating for the young director too, like imagine if you were directing Mani Ratnam...

Oh my God, yes. I did interview Mani sir for a series and I know how I felt. He did make me feel comfortable, but…

Interviewing him is different from casting a director you admire in your film...

Correct. With Desingh he was always talking about ‘Kaakha Kaakha’ and ‘Vaaranam Aayiram’ and told me about the scripts he had. He was more like a fanboy who was anxious about my opinion. I kept assuring him he was doing fine. I told him I was there to do his bidding. With Anwar who’s a contemporary, there was a lot of learning from my side too. I’ve admired his work. He was never intimidated. I liked the way they worked with live sound.

Were you tempted to make creative suggestions?

No, not till I felt it would be outside my comfort zone as an actor. There was the last scene in ‘Trance’ where I was to be killed. It was a close-up and I had to simulate expressions. It was difficult and I did suggest an alternative way. In Desingh’s film I had to step out of a car and confront goons chasing me. They’d planned a fight sequence with me in a dhoti. That’s the introduction you write for a ‘mass’ hero. He kept insisting but I gave him an alternative and he wrote the scene. There was a fight planned at the airport too, but I gently told him that as a top cop I shouldn’t indulge in fisticuffs. He was kind enough to agree.

One of the most watched introduction scenes online is Kamal in ‘Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu’. Your intro scene too seems to be going viral!

That’s blasphemy if you ask me you know. I am a huge fanboy who wrote that scene even though the rest of the film was not like that, just for the audience to celebrate this man. You step aside from the filmmaker you are momentarily. That was a fan’s tribute. ‘Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu 2’ also has a similar opening scene and I’m really looking forward to shoot that.

When people who know you watch ‘Kannum Kannum’, it’s like you’re just being yourself, but even that is difficult when the camera is on.

You’re absolutely right, you have to lose your inhibitions, not be conscious of the surrounding, know where to look and the close-ups are not easy. I completely admire actors who let go and are themselves in front of the camera. I’m basically conscious even while having a selfie taken. People ask why I look glum. So being oneself is not easy too in front of the camera.

Have you been tempted to write a character for yourself?

No, but I’ve recently asked a couple of others to write something full- fledged for me within my comfort zone. I don’t mind characters with negative shades.

A lot of directors like Manivannan, Manobala and Soundarrajan turned successful actors. Probably it’s an easier job and you’re not blamed for the fate of the film then?

I don’t look at it that way. It was towards the twilight of their career. It’s like a shift. I want to make films for as long as possible as well as act in the odd one too.

Recently you’ve shared screen-space with two of the most talented actors in Indian cinema, Fahadh Fasil and Dulquer. When you are on the set, are your creative juices flowing thinking of films with them?

Oh absolutely. I’ve been a big admirer of Fahadh even before I met him. On the set, he internalizes for 20 minutes before the shot. He goes quiet no matter what the scene is. That mood is transmitted to the rest. He draws you into the mood without instructions. I have material for him. He’s promised he’ll approach me and we’ll shoot. That’s the way he works. I’ll wait for him.

31,2020/03/26,Pioneering chef Floyd Cardoz inspired many to experiment with cuisine,"He broke stereotypes and mentored many in the industry

He sat at an outer table, quiet and unobtrusive, eating dinner with his two companions at the then newly launched Farzi Café in Gurgaon one monsoon evening in 2014, when someone pointed him out to me as the chef behind Tabla, New York.

Till then, I had known Floyd Cardoz by reputation alone. To those of us who wrote on Indian gastronomy, he was a well-known name — the Mumbai-raised, Goan chef who had put Indian food on the map in the U.S., marrying regional flavours to local produce to come up with contemporary plates.

Chef Cardoz died of COVID-19 on Wednesday. He had tested positive on March 18 and was being treated at Mountainside Medical Centre, New Jersey. He was 59.

A chef par excellence, Cardoz was the co-founder of Hunger Inc, the company that runs restaurants such as The Bombay Canteen and O Pedro.

The loss is unbearable, stunning all of us in the world of food in India, a community that for all its squabbles and differences is also closely knit. Just in the beginning of the month, when Cardoz was in Mumbai for the launch of the Bombay Sweet Shop (also by Hunger Inc), he had attended events with much of the restaurant and writing community in attendance. He flew back to New York, and according to his Facebook post admitted himself to a hospital in New Jersey on Mach 18 after feeling feverish.

My abiding memory of Cardoz will be of that monsoon evening in 2014, when Floyd had come back to India, having earned his accolades abroad, on a mission to push the envelope even further. That evening as he and his two dining companions, Yash Bhanage and Sameer Seth, sat at Farzi Café, they had been discussing their plans to start a new restaurant in Mumbai.

Passion project

Bhanage and Seth had been mentored by Cardoz as young hospitality professionals in the U.S. Now, with their guide and father figure in tow, it was fitting that they should plan a passion project meticulously.

A year later, the trio launched The Bombay Canteen and invited me over.

Many of the dishes — devilled eggs flavoured with Goan masala, arbi tuk (colocasia) and kamal kakdi (lotus stem) chips — paid a tribute to Cardoz’s memories of a Bombay he had grown up in. His stories about feema (kheema) pao at the St. Xavier’s College canteen, the crab curry and Goan sausage at home had obviously seeped into the spirit and cooking of the restaurant. As he sat remembering things past, two young men were manning the kitchen, executing his dishes, passing food out through a small service window. Chefs Thomas Zacharias and Hussain Shahzad were being mentored by Cardoz.

The two are leading restaurant chefs in India today; their own dishes define the menus of The Bombay Canteen and its sister outlet O Pedro (that opened in 2017). And their creativity is independent of their mentor’s. But both did start out under the able guidance of Cardoz, a chef and man, whose most remarkable ability may have been not just to cook in inspired ways but to mentor younger creative people. There was a generosity in letting them soar independently, unshackled. It is a testimony to Cardoz’s talent and leadership that all his protégées have carved out creative niches for themselves and are taking his legacy forward.

For all his soft spokenness, Cardoz didn’t mince his words. When I asked him to write a piece for my blog, he wrote with passion and candour as to how the standard of restaurant cooking in India needed to be much higher. Few chefs would have publicly called out low quality in the industry.

His own cooking was strongly rooted in his roots though sometimes, dishes could stop you in your tracks with their ingenuity. The dish I will always remember him for is a red snapper sol kadi ceviche. He had initially conceptualised it for Paowalla, his Soho outing that unfortunately shut. The konkani flavours of sol kadi replacing the acidity of lime, was a stroke of genius. That genius is now lost to the world of gastronomy.

32,2020/03/26,"Photographer Nemai Ghosh, the man who never missed a moment","'Goopi Gyne Bagha Byne' (1969) onwards, he was the still photographer for all of Satyajit Ray’s works till his last film 'Agantuk' (1991)

For someone best remembered as the visual biographer of legendary filmmaker Satyajit Ray and a documentarian of the making of his astounding body of work, an interesting aspect about Nemai Ghosh was that he started off as an actor with actor-director Utpal Dutt’s Little Theatre Group in Kolkata.

Arts critic and publisher-editor Samik Bandopadhyay remembers one such play that he acted in: the landmark Angar (1959) about the exploitation of coal miners. It had music by Ravi Shankar and complex sets (Nirmal Guha Ray) and lighting design (Tapas Sen) with an entire sequence of a mine getting submerged under water. “He was an impressive and formidable figure on stage but was never so interested in photography then,” recalls Mr. Bandopadhyay.

Nemai Ghosh passed away in Kolkata on Wednesday. He was 85.

Ghosh’s interest in photography was kindled entirely by chance in 1966 when he found an abandoned camera and started tinkering and playing around with it. Being a great lover of cinema himself, he wanted to shoot the process of filmmaking which is when his path crossed with that of Ray. Initially just “tolerant” of his presence, as he once recalled, Ray discovered Ghosh’s talent by and by to have him become a part of his unit. Goopi Gyne Bagha Byne (1969) onwards, he was the still photographer for all of Ray’s works till his last film Agantuk (1991). “The only other parallel I can draw is Raghu Rai’s photographs of Indira Gandhi,” says photographer Chirodeep Chaudhuri of an imagemaker’s consistent collaboration and engagement with a personality.

Ray’s son and filmmaker Sandip Ray remembers meeting him on the sets of Goopi… “He was a part of the family. He was always there, not just on the shoot, but our home as well,” he says.

Black and white

The magic of his black and white images lay in the specific fleeting instants that they managed to capture, that too without flash, in natural light. “He never missed a moment, captured the right moment,” says Sandip Ray. “His work in theatre gave him a sense of the moment,” says Mr. Bandopadhyay.

Filmmaker Sujoy Ghosh compares his frames to videography. “Each of his photos tells a story to me. Like Jaya Bachchan in Kalighat, teeka on the forehead, prasad in hand, happy… I see many things in the process. It’s instructive and informative about the process of filmmaking itself,” he says.

Mr. Chaudhuri points out the candidness in his frames unlike the “manufactured PR images and ‘behind the scenes’, ‘making of’ balderdash” where the stars are perennially performing or posing.

“There was an endearing quality about his photos. You could see his love for theatre and cinema [reflected in them],” says Mr. Chaudhuri.

Apart from Ray, Ghosh also chronicled some of Mrinal Sen’s films and he was the still photographer on Mira Nair’s The Namesake. “His portraits of my father were absolutely brilliant,” says Mr. Ray. Sujoy Ghosh remembers him shooting on the sets of his own film Kahaani. “I fell at his feet. It was such an honour that he considered our film,” he says.

On theatre

Beyond Ray and films, a major part of his work was on the theatre in Bengal and about Kolkata itself. His work was a reference point for Sujoy Ghosh when he went shooting in Kolkata for Kahaani. “It was an amazing inspiration. Every photographer and painter has a [unique] way of looking at places, objects, people which is different from ours,” he says.

Mr. Chaudhuri remembers him showing rare colour photos of Ray when he visited Ghosh at his home couple of years back. “He was so excited going through the folders and files of his work on the computer,” he says. One of Ghosh’s disappointments, according to Mr. Chaudhuri, was not being given space by the State government to archive his work. Later, he gave away most of it to the Delhi Art Gallery.

In the latter half, he was passionately documenting painters at work and musicians in performance. According to Mr. Bandopadhyay, Ghosh had clicked some exclusive pictures of the ailing Italian maestro Michelangelo Antonioni, some of them in his hotel room, when the latter had come to Kolkata for the retrospective of his work at the International Film Festival of India in 1994. Impressed with his images, Mr Antonioni, who had taken to painting in his later years, had invited him for his exhibition to Italy. Ghosh took pictures of Antonioni moving around in the exhibition on a wheelchair. Having been witness to and documented the maestro’s painting phase, Ghosh wanted to preserve them in the form of a book. Sadly there were no takers for it in the commercial publishing world.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/2wjb9j/article31168316.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26TH-NEMAI,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/photographer-nemai-ghosh-the-man-who-never-missed-a-moment/article31168317.ece
33,2020/03/26,Quarantine tales: How Bengalureans are coping with lockdown,"From impromptu balcony concerts to blasting kids’ favourites through a radio, residents of this apartment complex in Bengaluru are finding innovative ways to keep themselves entertained amid lockdown

At 6.07 pm on a Wednesday, keyboard tunes to Kishore Kumar’s ‘Yeh Shaam Mastaani’ reverberated in a gated community in Bengaluru. The occasion: self-isolation.

It all started as a call for ideas to entertain oneself during self isolation, on the WhatsApp group comprising residents of the apartment complex. Balcony antakshari was a suggestion that amused many. The one who proposed it, explained the concept in tweet-sized instructions: “We just pick a time, get to the balcony and play antaksharifor a bit.” Yet another resident offered for her son to play the keyboard which would be attached to speakers. That sealed it.

And so it was decided: It would be a 20-minute session when people would come to their balconies that look into a common courtyard and croon. A few minutes past 6 pm floated a familiar tune. One of the songs was the apt and relatable number ‘Mere Samne Wali Khidki Mein’ (which translates to, in the window opposite mine). And thus, balcony antakshari turned into a balcony concert. The evening ended with ‘Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna’ (that translates to ‘never say goodbye’).

Next evening, a German lady whose father was an opera singer in Austria, offered to play his CDs from her balcony. And the day after that, a stereo blasted kids’ favorites like ‘Prince Ali’ from Aladdin, ‘Sunflower’ from Spiderman, and ‘We Will Rock You’ by Queen.

Keep up the spirit

Another resident introduced a cocktail she had concocted and christened Corona Cashaya. The creative that left others on the group drooling, had the beverage served on the rocks with a blob of ginger and a whole lemon artistically placed next to it.

She had bottled three of the same and declared them free for grabs. “Will just drop it at your doorstep and leave,” she offered generously. “Important to keep spirits up!” the post ended with a smiley. And thus began the auction on the same WhatsApp group that lasted nine minutes. This left some, who missed the window, enraged. And so, the next batch was promised.

Then came Sunday, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged everyone across the nation to follow Janta Curfew i.e. to remain in their houses during the day as a drill for the future lockdown. And the occupants in my residential complex did everything prescribed which was to do nothing at all.

Save the usual measures like sanitizers at the gate, recording temperature of anyone who comes from outside, and closing access to common areas of the club-house like gym and pool, as of now, COVID-19 has helped us discover music lovers and mixologists in my community.

34,2020/03/26,Crafting paper homes and building a community of togetherness through the ‘Coveed Project’,"Coveed, a project in which people craft paper houses and post pictures of them co-existing, co-living, co-cooking, and even co-fighting

This is not a punishment, says social entrepreneur Lakshmi Menon of the 21-day lockdown. “We should not let Covid 19 take over our lives, so let’s make positivity viral.”

After the Prime Minister ordered a lockdown until April 14, she has created Coveed, a project in which people craft paper houses and post pictures of their homes, their paper homes and of them co-existing, co-living, co-cooking, and even co-fighting on the website Loka2020.in.

“The house is the safest place on earth. We can travel and live in the fanciest of resorts but the love and safety of a home is irreplaceable. It will be reaffirmed in this period of isolation,” says Lakshmi who has made four models of paper houses.

Lakshmi started the Coveed project on March 21 when 10,000 virtual plots went online for ₹25 each. “We allocate plots and share plot numbers, mark each area with a colour and share a screenshot with the owner. Its all done digitally. Based on that’, they send their art, which will be displayed on their plot and on the bigger Loka canvas,” says Lakshmi.

So far she has sold 6,044 plots in three days. With the money, they bought and distributed hand sanitisers to autorickshaw drivers, KSRTC bus drivers and street vendors. “They had bought a bottle for their homes but could not afford one on themselves,” says Kochi-based Lakshmi, who runs Pure Living, a social organisation, associated with SHOHM (Social Health One Health Movement) Trust. Lakshmi is also one of the brains behind the Chekutty dolls, which became a symbol of Kerala’s resilience and resurgence after the devastating floods of 2018.

Once social distancing came into force, Lakshmi asked her volunteers to stop public work and introduced a creative time pass for house-bound folks in an attempt to recognise and reaffirm the strength of co-existence.

She posted her idea at midnight after the PM’s speech with a demo video. “I selected an easy-to-do video of an origami papercraft house and have already begun receiving photos of paper houses.” She has received photos of houses that reflect people’s interests including some elaborate ones with gardens, fences and lawns.

After the Kerala Chief Minister’s declaration that nobody will go hungry during the lockdown period, Lakshmi added another dimension to the Coveed idea. “The measure of a Coveed is 18 x 6 cms. A rectangular paper of this area can hold 1/3 cup of rice or grain. In 21 days this amount will be quite substantial. Let people appreciate the joy of living inside the home,” says Lakshmi adding that the grains could be donated to an orphanage or old age home after the lockdown is lifted. “We are building a real community of togetherness, from the heart of our homes.”

35,2020/03/26,Birdwatchers see rise in bird sightings during COVID-19 lockdown,"‘Cockarakooo’: I wake up to this call every morning these days. No, I do not live in a village by the fields. I am in an extremely urban setup. Which is why I cannot explain in words my joy when I am actually woken up by a rooster. There’s an empty strip of land near my apartment, which is home to hens, roosters, and cows. They’ve always been there. But now that everyone is home due to the 21-day lockdown and noise levels are low, I can hear them clearly. In fact, I can discern around eight different birdcalls early in the day. Are there more birds in my neighbourhood these days or am I paying more attention to them?

“Both,” laughs Coimbatore birder K Mohan Raj. “Noise pollution is minimal and as a result, there is more bird movement even in urban areas.” He mentions how a bulbul is building a nest in the verandah of his home in Kanuvai, Coimbatore. “This bird is quite rare to be spotted in the city,” he adds. Mohan says now is the best time to appreciate the natural world around us. “Birds seem to be happily calling out to each other from long distances.” Go to your backyard, balcony, terrace, look out your window. “There’s so much to see; birding makes one happy, a much-needed thing at the moment,” he says.

Mohan says that one can spot at least 10 bird species from urban homes that have some green cover. These include the house sparrow whose falling numbers have been worrying experts; tailor bird, sunbird, Asian koel; the white-throated kingfisher can be spotted too, and are commonly seen around waterbodies. Mohan points out that those with a keen eye can see the booted warbler, a migratory species. March being the flowering season for plenty of trees such as sakkarai pazham (muntingia), flowerpeckers flock them to feed on the sweet berries. Golden oriole and barbets head to peepul and banyan trees to feed on their fruit.

“This is among the best seasons for Nature watch,” Mohan explains. “Neem trees have flowered, bees buzz about. In my neighbourhood, I even spotted the gorgeous paradise flycatcher.” At night, keep your ears pricked for calls of the francolin. “Owls come out, and you can also see bats swooping down to eat mosquitoes.”

Some people, such as P Jeganathan, a scientist with Nature Conservation Foundation, find birding something as necessary as their daily yoga or meditation sessions. “I do it for 15 minutes every day, no matter where I am,” he says. He is now in Tirupur and continues to do so from home, and documents the species spotted on the eBird portal.

“The birds are like my neighbours now,” he says. “I have learned their behaviours well over these days.” Jeganathan also does “season watch”, which is essentially keeping track of the trees in his surroundings; note which of them are flowering, and what birds each trees attract. “Neem, for instance, attracts coppersmith barbets when it flowers. I even heard the Blyth’s reed warbler, a migrant bird from the northern hemisphere. Its call is distinct, and I was able to hear it since there was no other noise around.” Jeganathan also points out some inexplicable phenomena due to the lockdown. “I see a lot of crows milling around…I don’t know why.”

“Usually in March, I’m walking around the palash trees and other flowering trees. This year, I am stuck at home, with just one flowering neem tree in view,” says Chennai-based naturalist Yuvan M. Fortunately for Yuvan, everyone else is stuck at home as well, which means even the shier birds are coming out to frolic. “The other day, on the road before my house, I saw a pair of skulky crow pheasants foraging freely along the entire length of the road divider. Usually, these birds just hide in the bushes.” He also saw a barn owl near his apartment for the very first time.

Others reaping the benefit of absentee humans, include songbirds. “They usually need very quiet surroundings before they come out and sing. In the past few days, I have been seeing as well as hearing pied wagtails and pied bushchats nearby,” he says, adding, “I even saw a group of about 200 starlings from my balcony, which I haven’t seen before. They did a mild murmur here, even though there are very few flowering trees nearby and it is almost time for them to fly back to Europe.” Maybe the peace and calm we left behind is encouraging them to stay back.

Suhel Quader, a birder from Bengaluru, decided to study the effects of low noise levels on birds during Sunday’s curfew. “It was my 12-year-old daughter’s idea, actually,” he says. “Using an app, we recorded noise levels and also kept track of the number of birds.” They did so on Saturday and Sunday, from 7 am to 7 pm, and interestingly, they found that more birds were audible on the day of curfew. Suhel continues this exercise from his home. “Birders from several other cities and villages across India are doing this,” he says, adding that they are now brainstorming on the approach to be taken and what to do with the information at hand.

Birding can be therapeutic. Jeganathan adds that there are studies that show that the exercise can have a “healing effect on people with depression.” “There are plenty of resources online to help too,” he points out. Meanwhile, I can hear a ‘keekee’ outside my balcony as I type this. Excuse me while I step out to see who that is.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/f79mf8/article31172533.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27MPSUNBIRDFEASTING,https://www.thehindu.com/society/and-the-birds-fly-free/article31172534.ece
36,2020/03/26,My first ever lockdown shopping venture,"My mother called me early in the morning on Wednesday, the first day of the 21-day national lockdown. She demanded to know what groceries I had in my kitchen. I listed out the contents of my kitchen shelf and she was worried. “That won’t be enough for you to survive for three weeks!” Her questions were many and I could not quite calm her down. I tried to tell her that the grocery stores would function, but she refused to be appeased and insisted I go out and see what I could buy. She followed up that phone call with a list of items — pulses, potato, coconut, bread, eggs, rice and oil.

Fearing my mom more than the lockdown, I stepped out armed with my cloth bag and hand sanitizer. It was the first time in days and I took a deep breath, sent up a prayer and started my scooter. What would it be like? Will the police stop me? Perhaps not. My destination was a local departmental store. The roads were empty and the salons, ice cream parlours, bakery, and textile stores were closed. I did not spot any policeman on the road thankfully. The shutters of the departmental store were half-closed. I checked with the man in charge if there were any pulses. The store had run out of it and the stock that was supposed to arrive had not reached yet. “Come back tomorrow,” he told me.

Disappointed, I decided to head back home. On my way, I noticed that the medical stores and the milk booths were open. I also spotted a small grocery store that was functioning. There were helpful markings made of kolam podi to indicate where customers should stand. They were a metre apart. I got the first spot! “This is for everyone's safety. We will be open every day. You don’t have to worry,” the shopkeeper assured me as he handed me the items. I got back home, called my mother and set her mind at rest by WhatsApping her images of my supplies. I feel better too because now I am sure the essentials will be available to me through the lockdown.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/w2fgqo/article31171379.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GANDHIPURAMFLYOVER,https://www.thehindu.com/society/grocery-shopping-on-the-first-day-of-the-21-day-national-lockdown-due-to-corona-pandemic/article31171380.ece
37,2020/03/26,How are people who are usually at home coping with the influx of people?,"What does a lockdown mean to people who already work from home, and now have to share their space with family through the day

“Leftovers are not enough any more!” A wailing emoji accompanies this on WhatsApp. It is nearing lunchtime and Chitra Andrade has just realised that the remains of last night’s dinner (which she normally has for lunch) are not going to cut it because the three men in her life, her husband and two strapping sons are home and hungry.

It is not very different at the home of Priya Narasimhan who says she has been a homemaker since the age of 24. The 53-year-old from Mumbai, says shes been forced into the Superwoman cape. “My day routinely begins at 4.45 am. We are six of us at home. But usually, by 8.00 am most have left home for office, college, and school. After this, time is my own to do as I will. Not any more,” she sighs. “My dear husband who is now working from home bathes, has breakfast, takes his tab and phone and disappears upstairs.” She does cherish that half hour they are together at lunch as a family, but says, “ After lunch he works from home again till 8.00 pm, then comes down declaring, aaj ka office ho gaya (done for the day). At 5.00 pm sharp, just like he does at office, he gets his cup of hot filter coffee.”

Chitra grumbles, “Nothing has changed for them. Each of them is in his room working or on online classes. I have no access to any of the rooms except the living room and the kitchen! Have you tried restricting your mixer use to the time they are not on a phone call? I am the one who is displaced.” For now, Chitra has found the dubious silver lining: “There is less washing as everyone is in their home clothes.”

Life lessons Mom of two girls and a school teacher Chitra R says she and her daughters have learnt from the lockdown, especially with school closing down. She says...

Life is unhurried.

There are moments of fear of the unknown, but we acknowledge it and have learnt to not condemn it or discount it either.

We are learning to be aware and more mindful of our resources and plan better.

Family time is encouraging more conversations and teaching us to consider and respect each other’s opinions and emotions. We are aware of what is happening outside and we are able to better respond to it from within.

For 51-year-old software professional Trivikram Prasad who works from his Bengaluru home, as a routine, says things are ‘interesting’ now that his wife and twin daughters are with him too. “Vaishnavi (his wife) and I compete for the office room. But I am happy to retire for a nap,” he says. “Vaishnavi cooks daily now, which is amazing for me and the kids. But I know she misses going out. She gets bored if she does not have office work.” Trivikram is taking online courses, teaching his kids math and physics, and composing songs. “Vaishnavi and I now take the dogs for a walk every night which we never used to, and sometimes the kids too when they are up for it.”

But having them all home makes him feel just that teeny bit restricted. “I feel more accountable for my time now since we’re all cooped up.” And streaming shows has become a challenge as “none of us can agree on what to watch as a family.” But irrelevant conversations and debates abound as there is a lot of free time. “We video called with six other friends around the world and fought over the right to send forwards on WhatsApp and had a discussion on the plus and minuses of gomutra.”

Vaishnavi, who is India Head for an American financial services company, admits it is taking her some time to get used to working from home. “My first week working from home was unstructured and chaotic. I ended up working almost 14 hours and got a back pain for my efforts.” The second week has been kinder, she says. “I reverted to my office routine of workout, shower, dress up and then login in to work.” But she is discovering the joys of cooking for family. “I take the time to try out new recipes (I had a full time cook before),” she says and adds that she has increased her workout time too. But she absolutely loves being with her teenage twins.”They will soon leave for college and these are precious times for us. We have not eaten meals together in many many years and now we do, with my father-in-law joining in too.” But she confesses she does get anxious about the future. Also, “I am a social person, so I miss going out and meeting friends and family.”

The new routine is challenging, admits D Prashanth, a Yoga Instructor, “Kids are definitely feeling hemmed in,” he says. He and his wife Sapna are designing activities for the children so that they do not end up in front of the TV all day. They ensure the kids’ timetable includes household chores, studies, mealtimes, play and TV times too. He is also finding out that bonding is a double-edged sword. There are conflicts of interest and arguments. “But it is all going towards building healthy relationships. I am convinced families will come out stronger and happier after this lockdown.”

Priya is pleasantly surprised that her kids are volunteering with chores and have developed an interest in cooking and house work. “We giggle over WhatsApp jokes and, to my surprise, I find time to nap. There is no rush to meet deadlines.”",society,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/n2s0g/article31171226.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/laptop-3317007,https://www.thehindu.com/society/how-are-people-who-are-usually-at-home-coping-with-the-influx-of-people/article31171227.ece
38,2020/03/26,India lockdown: The 21-point guide to survive 21 days,"A quick reminder of everything you need to do to stay safe, yet sane over the next three weeks, as the COVID-19 crisis rages

1. Routine rules

It is quite easy to lose track of the days when you are not stepping out (Ask Omar Abdullah, or Andy Dufresne). So before our old enemy ennui sets in, let’s have a daily plan that doesn’t change too much and goals for the coming weeks.

2. Home offices

No matter how comfortable your memory foam mattress is, it cannot be your workspace. Try setting up a corner of your house as a workstation, preferably one that gets enough daylight and ventilation. Keep it clean and organised, and if living with family, make it clear that this is your personal space.

3. Switching modes

Try and switch on to your work, and then off at the end of the work day. When your work is interspersed throughout the day, it can seem never-ending and frustrating. This applies to people involved in homecare too.

4. Hey, good looking

Working in ‘home clothes’ may be blissful for the first three days, but after a point those ‘workwear holidays’ can make you feel like you’re not going anywhere -- metaphorically speaking. You will want to look in the mirror and feel good about yourself. Self care, folks!

5. Break take

Repeat after me: Slurping down noodles while alternating between tabs of YouTube and work email does not a break make. Stretch, play with your kids and pets, or talk to a family member. This means a break from the 24/7 news cycle as well.

6. Plugged in

The World Health Organization said test, test, test. And now we say, video-calls, video-calls, video-calls. Living alone during the time of lockdown can test your mental health. Stay connected with your family members and friends through daily video calls. And let’s stop talking of social distancing, but instead talk of physical distancing but social support. Those in families — ever thought of doing a real life telling of how you met their mother?

7. Alone time

Just because you’re with family doesn’t mean you need to spend every waking with one another. It is okay to zone out and be in your own world for a while. Meditate, if that helps. Mental health support groups like MPower are also holding online counselling sessions. Or step onto the balcony or terrace for a breath of fresh air every morning — you’ll catch some sun and you can start a pranayama regimen.

8. Covid cowork

39,2020/03/26,Vessels from COVID-19 nations to face more curbs,"DG Shipping gives updated country list to ports

The Directorate General (DG) of Shipping has instructed all the major and minor ports to comply with additional measures along with mandatory quarantine for those vessels arriving from COVID-19-hit countries.

In a circular, the DG Shipping has issued an updated list of 47 countries with mandatory quarantine and travel ban by the Ministry of Family and Health Welfare. The list includes countries such as China, the U.K. European countries, Arab, West Asian and South East Asian countries.

A request to this effect was made by the authorities of major and minor ports in the country to ensure seamless movement of essential goods and services so that the national economic activity was not disrupted.

On its part, Chennai Port Trust (ChPT) has started implementing the rotation system for its employees in administration, transportation, material handling and other departments allowing them to either work in batches or from home. Only skeleton staff is being deployed at the time of arrival of goods either through vessels or by trains.

“We have asked all the employees of the mechanical workshop to work from home. However, they are refrained from moving around and should be available on telephone or electronic means of communication all the time. They should attend office, in case of exigencies,” said P. Raveendran, chairman, ChPT.

“Till date, we have not stopped any vessel from entering our port. The exim business is going on as usual,” he added.

As a precautionary measure, ChPT has asked its employees to furnish the travel history of their family members to contain the spread of COVID-19.

The largest sea port in the South employs about 3,500 people. It has asked the employees who have recently returned from a foreign tour or if they were in contact with those persons who have travelled to foreign countries to furnish details.

According to the instructions, those who had travelled abroad should be kept in home isolation for 14 days from the date of arrival. Further, it has asked the staff report for duty only when they are totally free of any symptoms of the illness.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/vessels-from-covid-19-nations-to-face-more-curbs/article31176285.ece

There has been a tremendous increase in social advertisements on TV, higher than that seen in regular ads, courtesy COVID-19.

The pandemic has influenced the advertising behaviours of governments, both the Centre’s and States’, as per data made available exclusively to The Hindu by TAM Media Research, a media monitoring, measurement and analytics firm.

With the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a big surge in the virus-related advertisements.

For COVID-19-related messages on TV, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare tops the list with 28% share in ad volumes.

More than 65% of the ad volume share of social ads related to COVID-19 were from the State governments over the last seven weeks (cumulative), says L.V. Krishnan, CEO of TAM.

Delhi tops States

Among State governments, the Government of Delhi leads all other State governments — in communicating to the audience about the virus on TV — with 14% of the ad volume.

In week two of the study period, Gujarat and Kerala were top advertisers with 652 minutes of advertisements.

There has been a consistent growth of social ads on TV witnessed from the tenth week, finds the study.

By week 12, more governments like Delhi joined the fray and along with the Centre, produced 7,446 minutes of Coronavirus-related ads.

By Week 12, as infections began to gather pace in the country, the top two advertisers were the Centre’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, followed by the government of Chhattisgarh.

44,2020/03/26,Fitch revises outlook on banks’ operating environment mid-point score to negative,"Fitch Ratings has revised its operating environment mid-point score for Indian banks to ‘bb’ from ‘bb+’, as increasing challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to worsen the tough operating environment.

“The outlook on the operating environment is ‘negative’ due to the uncertainty surrounding the severity and duration of the pandemic, and the associated effects on India’s banks of restrictions on economic activity,” the rating agency said.

Fitch said the 21-day lockdown will affect industrial production and domestic demand, which will exacerbate the economic slowdown of the past few quarters.

Fitch has revised India GDP growth to 5.1% in the financial year ending March 2021 (FY21), from a pre-pandemic forecast of 5.6%, following a growth of 5.0% in FY20.

The rating agency said recent steps by the Reserve Bank of India so far focussed on shoring up liquidity in the banking system and ensuring currency stability, but there will be additional measures from the authorities to mitigate the impact of the outbreak.

“The banking system remains under-capitalised and saddled with bad loans despite some progress in resolving these issues. We believe [the] recent developments will add to these issues and slow the resolution process. It will further test the underwriting standards of those banks that expanded the fastest in recent years, including the private-sector banks, as the sharp disruption in economic activity will lead to worsening asset quality,” the rating agency added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/fitch-revises-outlook-on-banks-operating-environment-mid-point-score-to-negative/article31176130.ece

A petition was digitally filed in the Supreme Court on Thursday for issuing direction to the government to declare national financial emergency under Article 360 of the Constitution in the wake of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

₹1.7 lakh cr. package with doubled food rations, cash transfers for poor

The petition, filed by the think-tank Centre for Accountability and Systemic Change (CASC), represented by Virag Gupta, said the declaration was necessary to safeguard the rule of law in the country. The petition said this is necessary to prevent any arbitrary action by the authorities.

Fundamental rights suspended

“Almost all the Fundamental Rights such as freedom of movement, most rights under Article 21 and various other fundamental rights have been practically suspended during this lockdown. The general public is not having access to the newspapers, which is happening for the first time after Independence. The closure of courts affects the right to get justice. It is submitted that this requires the imposition of emergency as per the Constitution, and not an order under Disaster Management Act, 2005,” the petition said.

CASC has sought urgent hearing of the petition through video-conferencing.

Government to pay employer, employee’s PF contribution for 3 months

“The petition stated that this is the biggest emergency in independent India and it must be addressed as per constitutional provisions through unified command between Central and State governments. This will be required not only to defeat the war against Coronavirus, but also in recovery of the economy after lockdown is over,” the plea said.

Section 144 applied

The petition said that even after the announcement of the 21-day lockdown by the Prime Minister on March 24 and subsequent orders issued by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs under the Disaster Management Act of 2005, different States and police authorities are continuing to take their own action under the Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 in the guise of orders issued by the Central government which amounts to “constitutional fraud”.

Due to the lockdown, economic activities have come to a standstill as well for which financial package of ₹1.7 lakh crore has been announced by the Finance Minister.

The Centre has capped the maximum retail price of 3-ply face masks made of meltblown non-woven fabric at ₹16 per piece till June 30 after clearing confusion with the manufacturers, Consumer Affairs Secretary Pawan Agarwal said on Thursday.

On March 21, the Consumer Affairs Ministry had notified MRP for 2-ply and 3-ply ‘surgical’ face masks at ₹8 and ₹10 per piece, respectively. But for 3-ply meltblown face masks, it had said MRP would be at the rate that prevailed as on February 12.

“We had a meeting with face mask manufacturers. They were facing some challenges because of lack of clarity on MRP front. So, we have decided to fix the MRP of 3-ply meltblown face masks at ₹16 per piece,” Mr. Agarwal told the PTI.

The retail price of 2-ply and 3-ply surgical face masks remain the same. The rates will remain in force up to June 30, he said.

Efforts are being made to ensure sufficient supply of face masks and hand sanitisers are available in the current situation, he added.

It is around 3 p.m. Carrying luggage on their backs and wearing black masks, seven men, visibly fatigued, are signalled to stop by a policeman who hurriedly jumps out of his vehicle at Rajiv Chowk on the Delhi-Gurugram highway. The officer makes a few inquiries before letting them off, asking them to walk in twos and threes and maintain a proper gap.

The men used to work as loaders at an automotive company in Bilaspur village in Manesar. But the nationwide lockdown to check the spread of the novel coronavirus, announced on March 24, has suddenly left them without jobs and little money to survive. Running out of money and with no means of support, the men, mostly from Shahjahanpur district in Uttar Pradesh, decided to walk close to 400 km back to their villages. When this reporter met them, they had been walking for six hours.

“Yeh hartal abhi kaafi din chalne wali hai. Hamare pass khane ka bhi paisa nahi bacha hai (This lockdown is going to last for quite a few days. We have no money left even for food),” said Ramesh, the eldest in the group. He says seven other workers also set off on foot for Uttar Pradesh but he has lost contact with them.

Ajit, another member of the group, said they had returned to work after Holi barely a week ago, having taken home their savings for the festival.

“We make ₹500 one day but earn just ₹50 the next day. The pay is not fixed. We have been without jobs for five straight days now and have exhausted our meagre savings,” he explained. Another worker Vijay said they did not have enough cash to pay the room rent, and some of them had not had food for the past 24 hours.

Deepak said they hoped to find some work in their villages since it is the harvest season; they can tend to livestock and be with their families in these testing times, he said.

Mr. Ramesh said policemen at several barricades stopped them, but let them off after questioning. He claimed no help had come from the administration or the automotive company they worked for.

“We hope to reach in at least five-six days,” he said with a straight face when asked how long it might take them to reach home.

The youngest in the group, his hair dyed maroon, smiled as he said he was from Nepal and had no clue how long it would take him to reach home.

48,2020/03/26,Coronavirus outbreak | Mixed response to Centre’s relief package,"Economists and social scientists on Thursday welcomed the Centre’s move to double ration allocations as part of a welfare package to help poor communities deal with the impact of COVID-19 and its economic repercussions. However, they felt that the cash transfers, which form a key part of the welfare package, may be too little and also failed to include in the safety net some particularly vulnerable groups.

Watch | What is contact tracing?

“One problem is whether we have covered all vulnerable groups,” observed D.K. Srivastava, chief policy advisor for Ernst and Young India and a member of the advisory council to the 15th Finance Commission. “Essentially, this package seems to reach those who are connected to bank accounts and formal payment systems. But certain groups of daily wagers and informal workers may be left out,” he said, adding “these amounts will also have to be revised upwards once these schemes unfold and we have a better sense of how long this crisis will last”.

However, he felt the bigger challenge would be the financing of the announced welfare measures as well as a more comprehensive stimulus package that would be needed for industries. “The government has tried to strike a balance between the available resources and the needs,” he said, adding that the fiscal deficit limit would need to be relaxed to cope with the situation.

CARE Ratings Chief Economist Madan Sabnavis noted that globally, many countries had announced stimulus packages involving 10-12% fiscal expansions. “In comparison, this package is only about 0.75% of India’s GDP, which is marginal. It is a good beginning and something is better than nothing, but more needs to be done,” Mr. Sabnavis added.

He added that the real challenge would come in implementing these measures. For example, while there was sufficient surplus foodgrains available in government warehouses and an existing system for further procurement, the system for procurement of pulses needed to be created in most States.

“The doubling of rations is a very good decision, but what about the huge numbers of migrant workers left stranded around the country? This is a glaring gap,” remarked Reetika Khera, an economist and social scientist at the Indian Institute of Management - Ahmedabad. “There need to be community kitchens set up to feed them right where they are, in schools and community halls, so that they don’t panic and create a further health emergency.”

She also welcomed the cash transfers to pensioners, widows and disabled people, although she opined that ₹1,000 over three months would be insufficient. “But there is no real support to MGNREGA workers at the moment, given that work sites have closed down because of the infection. They should have been given cash instead of Jan Dhan account holders,” she added.

“It’s a good start, but hugely inadequate,” said Dipa Sinha, an economics professor at Ambedkar University, who is also associated with the Right to Food Campaign. “Many of these steps were actually needed in response to the economic slowdown even before COVID-19,” she added.

Ms. Sinha noted that the government had not provided a detailed financial break-up of the package. “From what they have announced, there is no way it adds up to ₹1.7 lakh crore unless you pad it up with items like the PM-KISAN instalment, which involves no additional funding, or the construction workers’ welfare funds, which actually came from employers, not the government,” she asserted.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/wxpui5/article31176474.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NEWS1INFORMALWORKERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-outbreak-mixed-response-to-centres-relief-package/article31176475.ece

Meghalaya has not reported any COVID-19 positive case so far but around 3,300 people have been kept under surveillance, Chief Minister Conrad Sangma told The Hindu.

Mr. Sangma said the State administration had created a database of 3,300 people and the numbers were adding up every day. “We have a medical volunteer team that is tracking each one them. They call them and make sure that they stay in self-isolation. There are few who have showed symptoms but they are not very conclusive. They are kept under intense monitoring and we are sending teams to visit them…we are making sure we do not take it easy.”

Thelist of people under surveillance was drawn based on information collected from various sources such as the airport, village headmen, locals, associations and Meghalaya House in Delhi.

“These are all people who have come in from all parts of the country and other parts of the world. We have decided to isolate them in their homes and requested the family members also. Our objective is to guide them and tell them that how they should take care of themselves and their families,” he said.

‘Not an easy task’

Monitoring individuals was not an easy task and people breaking quarantine rules was being reported from across the country as well as from foreign countries, including the U.S., he pointed out.

The State was taking the help of village headmen and religious organisations to convince people to stay home. “We are reiterating and using religious organisations and the village headmen to push the message and make sure the pressure is on the people that it is for their own safety that they stay home,” he said.

The medical volunteer team that was working round the clock included government members who have been trained to handle cases pertaining to COVID-19, some were from the State Disaster Response Force and home guards. “There are some people from the private sector who have volunteered to make the phone calls and help in contact tracing,” he said.

57,2020/03/26,Ban on high-speed Internet on mobiles extended till April 3: J&K govt.,"Decision despite parties and civil society groups demanding restoration of 4G

The J&K administration on Thursday decided to continue with the ban on the high-speed Internet for all mobile phone users in J&K, despite requests by political parties and civil society groups to restore it in the wake on the COVID-19 crisis.

The J&K Home department said the decision to extended the ban till April 3 “was taken after considering the overall security and the reports of the law enforcement agencies inter alia”.

“The Internet speed shall be restricted to 2G only. The post-paid SIM card holders shall be provided with access to the Internet. However, such access shall not be made available on pre-paid sim cards unless verified as per the norms applicable for post-paid connections,” reads the order.

The decision comes despite local political parties and civil society groups demanding restoration of 4G in the wake of the COVID-19 spread in J&K.

Recently released National Conference (NC) vice-president Omar Abdullah had also demanded restoration of 4G to help people to stay alert on COVID19. “We are being told to learn through Internet how to stay safe from the pandemic, but what would we learn, when we cannot open anything on the net with 2G speed,” he said.

Kashmir Private School Association Jammu & Kashmir (PSAJK) president G.N. Var said the absence of high-speed Internet had left students away for online classes.

“Classes exclusively online through apps and software like Zoom and Google Classroom are the only option for the schools till they reopen. High-speed Internet facility at home is the only way to help students to learn remotely,” said Mr. Var.

Only fixed line broadband service is allowed in Kashmir. However, over 65 lakh mobile users continue to connect websites with 2G speed, which is incompatible to access many dynamic websites, locals said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lmx27p/article30654493.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-KASHMIR-25jan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ban-on-high-speed-internet-on-mobiles-extended-till-april-3-jk-govt/article31175814.ece
58,2020/03/26,"₹1.7 lakh crore relief package: First step in the right direction, says Rahul Gandhi","But Congress hopes the government will offer more

The Congress cautiously welcomed the ₹1.7 lakh crore package announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi called it the “first” step in the right direction, but criticised the government for offering an insufficient cash transfer.

“The Govt announcement today of a financial assistance package, is the first step in the right direction. India owes a debt to its farmers, daily wage earners, labourers, women & the elderly who are bearing the brunt of the ongoing lockdown,” he wrote on Twitter.

In a series of tweets, former Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram called it a “modest plan” and hoped that the government would realise that it should do more. “The plan does not put enough cash in the pockets of the poor. Some sections have been left out altogether,” he said. “You will notice that suggestions like help to tenant farmers and destitutes, maintaining current levels of employment and wages, tax deferment, EMI deferment, GST rate cut, etc. have not been addressed. Let’s hope there will be a Plan II shortly,” he said.

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala pointed to many “lapses” in the package. He flagged the need for declaring grain procurement an essential service.

All grain markets are shut and the Food Corporation of India is not coming forward to procure.

“If the farmer is to delay harvesting till April 14, he will stand to lose 40% of the crop. A loss from which he will never recover,” he said.

The one-time cash help of ₹1,500 spread over three months to 20.4 crore women having Jan Dhan Yojana accounts was a paltry sum, he said. The Congress demanded waiver of all EMIs and the interest thereof for all salaried class up to June 30.

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the package was inadequate and missed out on migrant workers. He said if the government could airlift Indians from foreign shores, it should have given these workers food and shelter or transport to their home States. He also criticised the government for offering just one kg of pulses a family. “The key to resisting COVID-19 is good nutrition. This does not serve the purpose,” he said.

He said the government had uprooted the lives of people without planning, despite a warning two months ago. “The enhancement of the MGNREGA wages by ₹20 is a joke. Currently there is no work going on. What they need is direct cash transfers, or payment of wages irrespective of work,” he said.

Mr. Yechury said ₹1,000 offered to the aged widows and the disabled and ₹500 for those with Jan Dhan Yojana accounts were too little. Instead, the government should have offered ration kits to all the poor, especially the families of children availing themselves of the mid-day meal scheme. “In the face of large-scale layoffs and retrenchment, the government must guarantee the payment of wages for the next three months at the very least,” he said.

CPI general secretary D. Raja said the package had ignored the poorest of the poor. “Only 80 crore persons have ration cards, what about those without ration cards? What about the homeless? What about the migrant workers? The package doesn’t offer anything to these categories,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha-2019/3uc19i/article27012702.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-RAHUL-PTI-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/17-lakh-crore-package-first-step-in-the-right-direction-says-rahul-gandhi/article31175771.ece

60,2020/03/26,Coronavirus | UNICEF says don’t ignore other immunisation efforts,"Prepare for an intensified immunisation campaign when COVID-19 is under control, it tells governments.

In their efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), governments worldwide should not ignore life-saving health interventions such as immunisation, the UNICEF appealed on Thursday.

“As the pandemic progresses, critical life-saving services, including immunisation, will likely be disrupted, especially in Africa, Asia and the Middle East where they are sorely needed. At the greatest risk are children from the poorest families in countries affected by conflicts and natural disasters,” Henrietta Fore, UNICEF's Executive Director said in a press statement, adding that outbreaks such as cholera and measles would tax the already stretched health services and lead to additional loss of lives.

Ms. Fore said if the governments postponed mass vaccination drives to ensure physical distancing, they must prepare for an intense immunisation campaign when COVID-19 was under control.

“We are working hard to ensure adequate vaccine supplies are available in countries that need them. We are in close communication with global vaccine suppliers to ensure production is not disrupted and supply is managed in the best possible manner under these difficult circumstances. We are also providing greater support to governments to continue the supply of vaccines during this pandemic,” she stated.

Allocates $9 million

The UNICEF also announced that it would scale up support to all countries to help children continue their learning despite schools being shut. It had allocated an initial sum of $9 million to help governments and education partners develop plans alternative learning programmes as well as ensure access to remote learning.

“Schools in the majority of countries worldwide have closed. It is an unprecedented situation and unless we collectively act now to protect children’s education, societies and economies will feel the burden long after we’ve beaten COVID-19. In the most vulnerable communities, the impact will span generations. Based on lessons learned with the school closures in response to Ebola, the longer children stay away from school, the less likely they are to ever return. Giving children alternative ways to learn and also by doing so, rebuild a routine is a critical part of our response,” said Robert Jenkins, UNICEF Global Chief of Education.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/cqx7w/article29997937.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/unicef,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-fight-should-not-hit-immunisation-unicef/article31174882.ece
61,2020/03/26,New Parliament design to take a few more weeks due to lockdown,"Trying to address MPs’ concerns like absence of a separate Central Hall, says architect.

The design for the new Parliament building that the Centre is hoping to complete by August 2022 could be delayed by a few weeks as the country remains in lock-down, according to sources.

The Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry’s construction agency, the Central Public Works Department, was expecting to prepare the detailed project report for the building in March and present the same to the Lok Sabha Speaker and the Vice-President soon after, according to CPWD officials. The tender inviting bids for the construction of the building would have been issued shortly after, in keeping with the May deadline set by the Ministry earlier, officials said.

The timeline could be pushed back due to the lockdown. Bimal Patel, director of the Ahmedabad-based HCP Design, Planning and Management, which was selected by the CPWD in October 2019 as its consultant for the project, told The Hindu that though the pandemic was ‘disruptive’, he hoped it would not change the final deadline of the project.

“The COVID–19 pandemic is a time of much distress in the world. Yes, it is disruptive but MoHUA, CPWD, HCP DPM and all the on-board consultants are continuing to work in this period of lock-down...Many calls and video conferencing are ensuring that we continue to work at our best possible pace in these tumultuous times. We hope to not let this disruption effect the final deadlines of the project,” he said.

The draft masterplan drawn up by the HCP envisages a triangular-shaped building opposite the existing circular Parliament House. However, the design process would “continue in the coming few weeks”, Mr. Patel said, adding that concerns raised by MPs at a recent meeting would be addressed.

“Design as a process requires regular feedback from the end-users, in this case the Members of Parliament, the Vice-President and the Speaker. After presenting the design to this gathering, which was a ‘work in progress’, a few concerns were raised and now the design is evolving with the intention to accommodate them,” he said.

The MPs raised concern about the fact that the new building would not have a separate Central Hall.

“The Central Hall serves as an important lounge and meeting space for all MPs when the joint session is not in progress. They want to see how the activities in this space are going to continue in the new facility. In the proposal, a lounge in the periphery of the courtyard is being developed to address these concerns,” he said.

Another concern of the MPs was the design itself.

“The present Parliament building, despite its discomforts, is cherished by all its users. The MPs have an emotional connect with this “temple of democracy”, which resonated with all the citizens. The design of the new proposed facility is being developed so that its interiors and aesthetics are evocative of the present facility,” he added.

Announced in October 2019, the government’s redevelopment plan includes revamping the 3-km-long Central Vista, constructing a new Parliament building and demolishing post-Indepedence era government offices to make way for a common Central Secretariat by 2024. For the new Parliament building, the government had on March 20 approved the change of land-use from recreational to “Parliament House” for the 9.5-acre plot.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/w4qell/article31174522.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CENTRAL-VISTA-parliament,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/new-parliament-design-to-take-a-few-more-weeks-due-to-lockdown/article31174241.ece

Briefing the press, Mr. Agarwal said while these trends were not definitive indications of a reduction, the measures including social distancing, contact tracing and quarantine were important deterrents to the spread of the virus and could even enable India to keep community transmission away or delay it.

He added that measures had been put in place through the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, to educate doctors online about care of patients to ensure uniform treatment availability.

“The National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences (NIMHANS) has been roped in to provide behavioural health modules and educate about mental health while training is being offered to ASHAs and grassroots-level health workers to educate, help in surveillance and assist with care of patients,” said Mr. Agarwal.

66,2020/03/26,"Coronavirus lockdown | Migrant labourers holed up in their dwellings without work, access to food","Attempts to call various helplines have so far been unsuccessful, they say

Scores of migrant labourers employed in various activities here are stuck in their dwellings without work, money and access to food and are not stepping outside for fear of being attacked by police personnel following the imposition of the 21-day lock down, they said on Thursday.

Fazlur Rahman, 22, is holed up in a shanty in Vishwas Nagar, having arrived here only a week ago to start working at a construction site. “We hadn’t even worked for a day before the project was called off because of the [janata] curfew,” he said over the phone. He along with about 15 other people have now been stuck at their house here for nearly a week and ran out of food on Wednesday evening, he said.

“We’re afraid to step out because we’ve seen the police beat up people,” he said. In a video he shared, Rahman is seen speaking in Bengali appealing for help from authorities to help them return to their houses in West Bengal. “There are about a hundred like us in different parts of Delhi and nearby,” he said. Rahman reported that attempts to call various helplines have so far been unsuccessful. The one request the labourers here made was to help them get back home through some means.

In Ghazipur, his friend, Sorful Jahan, who worked at the slaughter house, finds himself without work since March 20, he said. About 40 others are staying in rooms provided by their employer at present, he said. “Khane ke liye hum chup chup ke jate hain” [We go get some food furtively], said Makoob. A nearby canteen run for the workers at the slaughterhouse is still reportedly in operation and serving them food. Here too, Makoob reports that police personnel are indiscriminately attacking people who step outside. “One of our friends went outside and returned beaten up on Wednesday,” he said.

The last meeting of the Commission was held in Lahore in August 2018.

On February 13, India’s Indus Commissioner, P.K. Saxena had invited his counterpart Syed Mohammed Meher Ali Shah to hold the annual meeting of Permanent Indus Commission in the second half of March and requested for the proposed agenda, sources said.

On March 12, the Pakistan commissioner accepted India’s invitation, and agreed to meet his Indian counterpart in the last week of the month. He also stated that details of the proposed agenda shall be communicated in due course.

However, with the World Health Organisation declaring COVID-19 as pandemic on March 11, India proposed to “defer this meeting for some time in the larger interest of both the countries”, sources said.

There is also a nationwide lockdown till mid-April, in an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus, which has killed over 21,293 people globally.

In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, All India Kisan Sabha and All India Agricultural Workers’ Union have demanded declaration of harvesting of crops as an essential service, facilitating farmers with free harvesting equipment and allowing agricultural labours to travel.

The Kerala government has already taken these measures.

The two unions affiliated to the Left parties pointed out that crops of wheat, rice, chilly and cotton were waiting to be harvested but because of the lockdown there were not any agricultural labourers to do so.

“Even if some farmers manage to harvest, they are not in a position to sell it due to restrictions on transportation and unavailability of workforce to commute goods,” the two organisations wrote.

Since the government is unable to extend MNREGA scheme due to the lockdown, the organisation asked Mr Modi to invoke the ‘unemployment’ clause under the scheme.

The lockdown was leading to severe losses, which should be assessed properly and farmers must be compensated duly under the Crop Insurance Scheme.

The government should immediately announce a moratorium on recovery of crop loans for at least a year, the organisations said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5976p1/article31170915.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/COVID19LOCKDOWNVENDORROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/declare-harvesting-as-essential-service-demand-farmer-unions/article31170917.ece

Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, expressing solidarity with his call for a 21-day lockdown to fight the Coronavirus and offering some sector- specific suggestions.

“It has imperiled lives and put at risk the lives and livelihoods of millions, particularly, the most vulnerable sections of our society. The entire nation stands as one in solidarity in the fight to halt and defeat the Corona pandemic,” she said in a letter that was released by the party.

Also read | Why 21-day lockdown period?

Ms Gandhi said, “As president of the Indian National Congress, I would like to state that we will support and collaborate fully with every step taken by the Union government to ensure the containment of the pandemic. At this challenging and uncertain time, it is imperative for each one of us to rise above partisan interests and honour our duty towards our country and indeed, towards humanity.”

Ms Gandhi also offered some suggestions in the spirit of “solidarity and cooperation” for the “massive health crisis we are about to face and to ameliorate the immense economic and existential pain that vulnerable sections of our society will soon be subjected to.”

“It has been announced that the Union government has allocated ₹15,000 cr. to fight the Coronavirus, including meeting the requirements of our doctors, nurses and health professionals. I would like to re-emphasise the urgent need to arm our doctors, nurses and health workers with ‘personal protection equipment’, including N-95 masks and hazmat suits,” she stated.

Editorial | A long road: On India’s 21-day coronavirus lockdown

“Let us ensure the opening and scaling up of manufacture and supply of these items so that not a single health professional faces the predicament of contracting or passing on COVID-19 owing to unavailability of ‘personal protection equipment’. Announcing a special ‘Risk Allowance’ for doctors, nurses and health workers for a period of six months retrospectively from the 1st of March 2020, is imperative.”

Over the last few weeks, there had been much uncertainty about designated hospitals and their locations, number of beds, isolation chambers, ventilators, dedicated medical teams, medical supplies, among others.

“This has been caused by a paucity of information. Disseminating all essential information, including the locations of designated hospitals and their emergency phone line numbers is essential to facilitate management of the pandemic. A dedicated portal for sharing these and all other necessary information is one way forward,” she suggested.

‘Temporary facilities needed’

Ms Gandhi noted that the most advanced and developed healthcare systems in the world were facing an overload of patients and crumbling under the weight of the sheer numbers, and suggested that the Centre should immediately commission and begin construction of temporary facilities with large numbers of ICUs and ventilators in areas where the outbreak could increase in the near future.

“Daily wagers, MGNREGA workers, factory labour, construction and unorganised workers, fishermen, farm labourers and many more form the most vulnerable sections of our society. It has been recently reported that many businesses and companies are laying off and retrenching large numbers of regular and temporary employees. It would be in order for the Union government to immediately put in place broad-based social protection measures, including Direct Cash Transfer, to these sections to tide over the period of difficulty,” she wrote.

Harvesting season

Since the lockdown came just ahead of the harvesting season by March-end and nearly 60% of India’s population being economically dependent on agriculture, the government should take necessary steps to enable harvesting and procurement of crops at minimum support price and suspend all recoveries from farmers for next six months, she said.

The government should either implement the Minimum Income Guarantee Scheme or the ‘NYAY Yojana’, as was proposed by the Congress, or consider a one-time cash payment.

Other suggestions included the distribution of 10 kg of rice or wheat for a family to tide over the lockdown, deferring EMI payments of the salaried class, deferring all loan instalment deductions from the salary of government employees for six months, giving businesses, particularly the Micro, Small & Medium businesses, necessary tax breaks, interest subvention and deferment of liabilities.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/umxf2q/article30728070.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SONIAGANDHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-sonia-gandhi-writes-to-pm-modi-expresses-support-for-lockdown-and-offers-suggestions/article31170513.ece

Attorney General (A-G) of India K.K. Venugopal has open up the digitalised version of his antiquarian library for public viewing, right in time to help people constructively spend time during the long days of COVID-19 confinement.

The catalogue on the website — kkvlibrary.com — shows rare works dating back to the early 17th century, like the Arabian Nights, travelogues, and Italian author Giovanni Boccaccio’s The Decameron.

The 1706 edition of the Arabian Nights introduces itself to the reader as a clutch of stories narrated by the “Sultaness of the Indies to divert the Sultan from the execution of a blood vow he had made to marry a lady every day and have her cut off next morning to avenge himself from the disloyalty of the first Sultaness.”

Labour of love

Mr. Venugopal told The Hindu that there is lot more work to be done. For him the collection has been a labour of love.

“I have another 2,000 books which are all prior to 1900 and have not been digitalised. These are very interesting books on a wide variety of issues like slavery in Goa, etc. Presently, about 600-700 books have been digitalised,” Mr. Venugopal said on the phone.

The website provides a short history of how Mr. Venugopal has an eye for the historic and the exotic, especially rare and old books.

Wide range

“The collection is a veritable treasure trove, with publications covering a wide range of topics, from religion, mythology and the Vedas, to Indian art and sculpture, historical battles, the British Empire in India and tales of travels across the world. The literature reveals fascinating and eye-opening facts and information, embellished with striking and eye-catching drawings and illustrations,” the website said.

The venture to digitalise the books has come from his “desire to disseminate this wealth of information, for the benefit of those who share his interest in the mysteries and minutiae of the bygone eras.”

The website is also an invitation to those who are, as yet, uninitiated, to explore the beauty, splendour and the stark realities of times past.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/s1pieb/article29779595.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24VENUGOPAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/attorney-general-kk-venugopal-digitalised-library-open-for-public-viewing/article31168559.ece

The letter said innocent protesters and volunteers were detained for peacefully protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act of 2019.

The protest site was dismantled by the police in the wake of curfew following the COVID-2019 scare.

But the letter signed “The People of Shaheen Bagh” said it had already been decided on March 21 that “all protesters had decided to vacate the protest site, except for two to three women who would be present there to symbolise the protest, but maintain the mandated precautions”.

“The mics had been disbanded and there were no speeches being made. The library established by volunteers during the protests had been closed. The school and art club set up by volunteers for the children of Shaheen Bagh had also been closed,”"" the letter said.

The letter asked why the police had resorted to “ruthless dismantling and thoughtless destruction of the markers of our physical protest” when the protesters had already taken precautions in public interest and when the case was sub judice in the apex court.

It said the police action “reeks of strong vendetta and ill feelings towards our innocent protesters, locals and sympathisers”.

The winners of The Hindu Prize 2019 Fiction and Non-Fiction are Mirza Waheed (Tell Her Everything) and Santanu Das (India, Empire, and First World War Culture: Writings, Images and Songs). The winners for both categories were selected by an eminent panel of judges.

The jury members for fiction were diplomat and author Navtej Sarna, author and columnist Nilanjana Roy, author Pradeep Sebastian, researcher and translator J. Devika and professor Rajeswari Sunder Rajan. For non-fiction, the jury comprised Kamini Mahadevan, publishing consultant; Chandan Gowda, faculty member at Azim Premji University; Harsh Sethi, former consulting editor with Seminar; author Rustom Bharucha; and author and social anthropologist Shiv Visvanathan.

The citation describes Prof. Das’ work as “a sensitive exploration of the human dimensions of a major modern war that reshaped global politics and culture in fundamental ways” and as one that “helps to re-examine the scholarly and popular imaginations of the First World War which have tended to ignore the involvement of close to over a million Indians in it, and in particular, the tens of thousands among them who lost their lives.”

“An extraordinary work of fiction whose complexity, depth and narrative mastery would be hard to match in contemporary world literature,” reads the citation for Mr. Waheed’s Tell Her Everything, describing it as “a compelling novel, both a narrative tour de force and an exploration of a profound existential and moral conundrum.”

The Hindu Prize was instituted in 2010 to honour writers who have spent their lifetime mining the human spirit through their words and ideas. The prize is usually awarded at a ceremony during The Hindu’s annual literature festival Lit For Life. However the 2020 edition had to be cancelled due to a challenging environment.

With a 52-year-old man testing positive for COVID-19 in the city, the district administration has launched a comprehensive sanitation drive in the neighbourhood and moved the person and his close family members to the isolation ward in Vijayawada.

The person, a close relative of an elected representative, is a tobacco trader and lives in an apartment at Mangaldas Nagar. He is married and has two sons.

Travel history

His recent travel history showed that on March 13, he, along with a group of family members and traders, had left for New Delhi and stayed there at Nizammuddin Dargah for five days. On March 18, he had boarded Duranto Express (coach no. S 8) and arrived in Vijayawada on March 19. On March 20, he had gone to a local mosque for Friday prayers. The following day, he had visited Suraksha Hospital at Gunturivarithota. On March 22 he attended a family dinner. On March 23, he was admitted to the Infectious Diseases (Fever) Hospital at Gorantla with symptoms of fever, cough, and body pains.

Four of his close family members were sent to the isolation ward at GGH, Guntur.

‘Condition stable’

The medical condition of the person was declared as normal.

Soon after the news broke out, the district administration began sanitising the entire area. Revenue personnel elicited information from the affected person about all the persons he had come in contact with during the period he was in New Delhi, where he was suspected to have contracted the infection.

87,2020/03/26,Strictly follow lockdown protocol: CM,"‘We are not in a position to welcome our own people stuck in TS’

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has appealed to people to stay indoors for three weeks to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Addressing the State on the outbreak of coronavirus and the recent developments on Thursday, Mr. Jagan, while admitting that he was disturbed over the Garikapadu incident, made it clear that hard decisions had to be taken at times to avert disasters.

On Wednesday night, tension prevailed at Garikapdu, a border village, after people coming from Telangana were denied entry into the State.

Mr. Jagan said a similar situation was prevailing at Pondugula, Dachepalli and Nagarjuna Sagar. Tracking people who contracted the disease would become difficult if people shifted from one place to another. Hence, it would be better if everyone remained indoors till April 14. “We are unable to welcome our own people with a smile on the face. But, I request everyone to think once.” Unless people followed the lockdown protocol, the spread of the disease could not be checked, he added.

Identification and shifting of affected people to hospitals would become easy only if people cooperated, he said.

‘Govt. working overtime’

He said helpline numbers 104 for medical emergencies and 1902 for other emergencies were active round the clock. If people observed home isolation, the needy and their contact point could be easily pinpointed. “We have never before in such an emergency,” the CM said.

“There are ten positive cases so far and we have tracked 27, 819 foreign returnees. The government has put in place isolation wards and dedicated medicare with critical care at four places. The facilities at the hospitals and isolation wards are well equipped to meet the requirements, but the three-week self-isolation would be a great contribution. Hundred-bed isolation centres are in place at the constituency level and officials and Ministers are constantly monitoring the situation,” he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/lpmeuy/article31176596.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27VJJAGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/strictly-follow-lockdown-protocol-cm/article31176597.ece
88,2020/03/26,Students of classes 6 to 9 to be promoted automatically in Andhra Pradesh,"Chief Minister asks officials to act according to the situation

In a significant development, the government has asked officials of the Education Department to cancel final exams for classes 6 to 9 in view of the uncertainty due to the coronavirus pandemic. The students of these classes will be promoted to the next class without writing any exams.

The crucial decision on SSC examinations would be taken after March 31, he said.

‘Maintain quality’

Since children are deprived of the mid-day meal in schools due to the lockdown to prevent possible spread of the virus, the department has made arrangements to supply dry ration on their doorstep. The Chief Minister asked the officials to ensure consistency in the quality of the programme across the State.

Education Minister A. Suresh and other department officials were present.

Subsequently, the Commissioner of School Education issued a circular asking the Regional Joint Director and the District Education Officers stating that in view of the 21-day-long lockdown, it was not feasible to conduct annual examinations (Summative Assessment-II) for students of Classes 6 to 9 and therefore, the exams stand cancelled and all students of these classes are declared ‘pass.’",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/students-of-classes-6-to-9-to-be-promoted-automatically-in-andhra-pradesh/article31176445.ece

91,2020/03/26,Students’ bid to return to TS falls flat,"Police refuse to allow them at Panchalingala check-post

Students hailing from Telangana and undergoing coaching for bank examinations at an institution at Nandyal in the district have appealed to the authorities to allow them return to their State.

Over 100 students staged a protest near the check-post at Panchalingala on Thursday, and urged the Telangana to allow them to return to the State.

However, the police refused to let them into Telangana and dispersed the students.

Pouring out his woes, 24-year-old Vineeth Reddy from Warangal said that they should be allowed to return to their hometowns as the hostels in Nandyal were being closed down. “The students here are from various parts of Telangana,” Mr. Reddy added.

“We reached the check-post but the police have not allowed us. They has asked us to return to Nandyal,” he said.

The students later spoke to their professors and convinced their hostel management to keep it open. “The hostel authorities have said that they will prepare food too,” he added.

In his traditional half-naked attire, 45-year-old Konda Dora tribal elder Sarapu Krishna Murthy has intensified the campaign on a moped all alone, appealing to the people in Rampa Agency to observe the COVID-19 lockdown in letter and spirit.

He was seen hitting the roads on Thursday morning, beginning his campaign from his village of Bandapalli to the Agency’s administrative headquarters of Rampachodavaram on Thursday.

95,2020/03/26,COVID-19 effect: villages in Anantapur look clean,"Unity among residents comes to the fore during trying times

Focus on public sanitation in the wake of COVID-19 has improved a lot with majority of villages looking very clean and most of the panchayat staff paying special attention to spraying disinfectants on a large scale for the first time in Anantapur district.

The other positive aspect is the unity among the villagers with Grama Sachivalayam (Village Secretariat) playing a key role in ensuring the ‘21-day Lockdown’ by moving towards village self-sufficiency. In Gutukuru, people have been sharing their grocery reserves with neighbours and there is no panic reaction like the one seen in Anantapur city.

Village Secretariat staff have helped the Gotukuru panchayat villagers put up notice boards at all entry points restricting others into their habitation and people at Ramachandrapuram village have begun guarding all entry points by taking turns in two shifts.

Thorny bushes and carts have been placed across the roads leading into the villages from national highways and State highways. Those on the Karnataka border areas are more alert as some of their relatives live across the border too, but it is a strict ‘No’ for them to either come into A.P. or these people going there.

“We are happy to find people coming up with their own initiative to stop travel into and out of their villages by guarding the entry points at 20 villages throughout the district and enforcing government orders strictly without the intervention of the government machinery,” said District Collector Gandham Chandrudu.

Massive sanitation drive

Disinfectant spraying activities at Kunukuntla, and Dadithota of Tadimarri mandal, and Chowlur Gram Panchayat in Hindupur mandal began on a massive scale on Thursday with panchayat staff mounting large plastic tanks on tractor-trailers. Motorised sprayers put up on the tractor are not leaving any household from spraying. “We are happy the panchayat is spraying some disinfectant, which is keeping the mosquitoes away and stench emanating from stagnant water in open sewage channels is no more there and such comprehensive operation is being taken up for the first time in the village,” said a resident, V. Brahmaiah.

Sanitation workers toil hard to spray bleaching powder all along the village roads, hoping people do not throw garbage into the drains.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ureu4/article31174583.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27VJATPSANITATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/covid-19-effect-villages-in-anantapur-look-clean/article31174584.ece

97,2020/03/26,"Police, fire staff don’t endorse blocking of roads in villages","It hampers the movement of emergency vehicles, officials say

With the police taking the COVID-19 lockdown seriously, the number of people found riding riding bikes has come down drastically in the last 24 hours all over the district, particularly in the rural areas.

While the police personnel mounting a strict surveillance on the the movement of people on the highways, people in rural areas have reportedly blocked the approach roads to many villages by placing boulders, dumping of sand and thorny bushes. Such incidents were reportedly from villages in Satyavedu, Nagalapuram, Pitchatur, Varadaiahpalem, Piler and Irala mandals.

Concern

The police at Varadaiahpalem expressed serious concern over the the blocking of rural roads by the public. Though the officials said it was a welcome sign that the people were confining themselves to their houses in view of the Covid-19 scare, the road blockades would only lead to adverse results in cases of emergency, they said.

“Such activities hamper the movement of ambulances and fire tenders. Removing of blockades will lead to delayed action and this could eventually lead to events turning tragic,” a police officer said.

Fire cases

District Fire Officer Adinarayana Reddy said with the start of summer, the fire fighting machinery remained fully geared in the district. “Every day, even during this lockdown period, we are attending to six to seven cases requiring our presence. Though, all the incidents were so far small in nature, alertness on our part is need of the hour. It has come to our notice that some people are blocking roads in the rural areas as part of the COVID-19 lockdown. This should go,” he said.

The official said that instead of blocking the roads with thorns, boulders and sand dumps, the people could just arrange a rope across the road to signal the lockdown and non-entry into their villages. “The movement of pregnant women, accident cases and fire tenders will not be hampered then,” he said.

Meanwhile, similar blockades turned into a regular scene in several towns in the district. Some enthusiastic youth placed the drums filled with sand on the streets, apart from boulders and arranging ropes to prevent movement of vehicles.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/police-fire-staff-dont-endorse-blocking-of-roads-in-villages/article31174511.ece

99,2020/03/26,Forest fire rocks Tirupati outskirts,"The Seshachalam forest area went up in flames, causing tension in the temple city, as the fire spread was at a visible distance from Tirupati.

The hills above the northeastern side of Tirupati were seen engulfed in flames since morning, which slowly spread to the upper portions, making the northeastern suburbs slowly, yet steadily, feel the heat. The flames only exacerbated the dire situation due to the lockdown. Many residents of Jeevakona and Satyanarayanapuram areas reached their roof-tops and silently watched the raging flames spread upwards, while some others captured the same on their mobile phones.

Man-made fire

Authorities from the Forest Department’s Tirupati Wildlife Division rushed 40 men to the spot, even as the TTD’s Forest Department deployed 25 men from its side to tame the fire. Though the fire was originally believed to have been caused by the scorching summer heat, forest officials firmly believe it to be the handiwork of mischievous elements venturing into the forest area from Jeevakona for fun or anti-social activities. “It is not a forest fire, but man-made fire in the forest area,” Divisional Forest Officer (Tirupati Wildlife Division) M. Nagarjuna Reddy confirmed to The Hindu.

Moreover, the terrain is hard to reach and no vehicle (four-wheelers or fire tenders) can be taken closer to the spot. “Only fire-beating is possible here,” he pointed out. Fire-beating is a process of hitting the burning trees and shrubs in the jungle with the help of coconut fronds.

Even as the forest staff zeroed in on most of the raging areas, Mr. Reddy hoped that it could be tamed sooner than expected.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/forest-fire-rocks-tirupatis-outskirts/article31173636.ece

102,2020/03/26,Robert Frost’s ‘Good fences make good neighbors’ line rings in faraway Rampa Agency,"Though separated by time, distance, and ignorance, four tribal hamlets in Andhra Pradesh erect fences to follow the lockdown, protecting themselves and others from COVID-19 virus

Valmiki and Konda Reddi tribes in Rampa agency in East Godavari district wouldn’t have heard of 20th-century American poet Robert Frost, or his famous poem Mending Wall. But the line from it ‘Good fences make good neighbors’, is precisely what they are following, albeit ignorantly, in these lockdown times over the spread of COVID-19.

Four hamlets in Devipatnam and Rajavommangi in the Rampa agency on Wednesday erected fences along their borders with the neighboring villages, thus fully implementing the lockdown, and restricting the entry of visitors into their habitations.

The fenced four

The hamlets that adopted the fencing-method to keep stop the dreaded virus spread are Pothavaram, China Bheempalli and Lothupalem in Devipatnam mandal, and a Valmiki-tribal hamlet of Laagarayi in Rajavommangi mandal in East Godavari district.

So much so, Integrated Tribal Development Agency (Rampachodavaram) officials on Wednesday circulated a few photographs of these fences, where people from all walks of life were seen holding placards, appealing to neighbors and strangers to stop visiting their hamlets.

No visitors please

“Request to stop visiting our village in the wake of the outbreak of COVID-19 till April 14. We will not visit any neighboring village until the lockdown period is over,” read the placards.

The Villagers have erected the temporary fences using bamboo and other materials including tree branches. “More hamlets in the Rampa agency are likely to adopt this method in the coming days of the lockdown, given the success of this campaign by the tribals, Rampachodavaram Divisional Public Relations Officer V.V.Reddy told The Hindu.

With a 52-year-old man from Mangaldas Nagar in the city testing positive for COVID-19, the district administration has launched a comprehensive sanitary drive in the neighbourhood.

The man, a close relative of an elected representative, had been a Tobacco trader and visited Delhi recently. His travel history showed that he came from Dubai, went to Ajmer on a pilgrimage, travelled to Delhi on March 18, and came to Guntur by train the next day.

Out in the open

Since then he attended daily events and even took part in a family gathering on March 22, the day people observed Janata Curfew. The next day, he developed flue like symptoms and the test results showed him to be COVID-19 positive.

On Wednesday, the district administration and the municipal corporation personnel conducted a sanitisation drive in the neighbourhood .

Only one person from a family has to come out for getting essential items not exceeding a radius of 3 km. Section 144 is being implemented across the State, and strict action will be taken against those defying the instructions,” was an order issued by the State government on Wednesday.

But people ventured out along with their family members, including children, to buy groceries and vegetables. People flooded Rythu Bazars in the city at dawn on Thursday with their children in tow, and many of them were not covering their mouth and nose.

Sans masks or face covers

Police on duty were seen asking them to cover their mouth and nose with a handkerchief in case they don’t have masks. Also, they were “helpless” in implementing the ‘one person from one family’ rule. In some cases, three to four persons, including children from a family were seen at the market.

In fact, a person staged a sit-in for a while for not being allowed to go to the Rythu Bazar and had his son aged around six years with him. Soon, he entered into an argument with the police saying he “did not know the rules. I am going to bring back my family member who went to the Rythu Bazaar,” the auto driver said, near Patamata Rythu Bazaar.

Indifferent to advisories

“The government and doctors have been advising people to avoid places that have gathering of people. But they seem to be indifferent to the advisories,” said a police constable on duty.

When parents were asked why they brought their children along to the market, they gave a puzzled look. “He (the child) is insisting,” was a cryptic reply of a person, and was reluctant to answer further queries. Another visitor, a woman of about 30, said: “None to look after the child at home.” Soon her husband, who was buying fruits at a little distance, joined to take them home.

“We have been listening to this kind of pleas. See what happened just now. The lady was saying none at home but the entire family has come to the market. People can come out to fetch essential commodities.

The High Court of Karnataka has prima facie said that activities which are not included in the exceptions provided by the State government in the order of lockdown, including holding of auction of attached properties by banks, will constitute violation, attracting prosecution.

The court also stayed the process of e-auction scheduled for the dates after the lockdown was enforced by the State government from March 23.

Narendar passed the interim order on March 24 on a batch of petitions filed by Muddaiah Amarayya Hiremath and others questioning continuation of e-auction process, initiated prior to the lockdown, even after imposition of the lockdown by the government for arresting the spread of COVID-19.

The State government, in its order of March 23, excluded certain activities, and in respect of banks, only excluded activity is bank teller services and operation of ATMs, and hence if proposed auctions are permitted to be held, it would amount to violation of the Government Order, the court observed.

109,2020/03/26,Huge crowds outside offices of DCPs to collect passes,"Those associated with essential services queue up

People associated with essential services were seen queuing up at the offices of the Deputy Commissioners of Police (DCP) across the city on Thursday, the first day for them to apply for passes to commute during the lockdown.

Thousands of people thronged these offices and the police had a tough time ensuring social distancing. Only those with masks were being allowed in and all were compulsorily asked to use sanitiser before entering the station.

To prevent crowding, the police collected information and gave out tokens asking applicants to collect passes at a specified time, in most cases a day later. Senior police officials said that as they had only just begun issuing passes only Thursday morning, they will give a leeway of two days. “We will begin enforcement only after we are convinced that most of those in need have got the passes. Later, we can detain people and seize vehicles of those who don’t have passes. The only exception will be for people who are in the same locality that they live in and have come out to buy essentials,” said a senior police official.

110,2020/03/26,"Hosa Thodaku | Mutton prices touch ₹1,000 a kg in Bengaluru","Short supply of meat and fall in consumption of chicken after avian flu spike mutton prices on non-vegetarian feast day

The non-vegetarian feast of Hosa Thodaku, which is celebrated a day after Ugadi, rubbed salt into the wounds of people, who are under lockdown owing to the COVID-19 threat, as mutton prices saw an unprecedented increase and even touched ₹1,000 per kg in several parts of Bengaluru.

Hosa Thodaku is popular in several parts of the State, especially the Old Mysore region.

But mutton prices not only spiked, but also went out of stock in most of the areas.

In Bengaluru city, the prices hovered between ₹850 and ₹1,000 per kg as against the normal range of ₹500 and ₹600. A meatseller in Bengaluru blamed it on the lack of transport facilities and the lockdown.

Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services Department officials pointed out that ever since the instances of bird flu were reported, meat prices had shot up as people had stopped eating chicken. However, COVID-19 turned the matter worse as there is no movement of meat or live sheep from different places, they noteD.

But the high prices did not deter the people from buying meat as they thronged meat shops in huge numbers and also bought in huge quantities.

“We are buying more as we are not sure whether these shops will continue to sell from tomorrow,” said a resident in Bengaluru.

As the meat shops drew crowds, people were seen buying meat in a hurry fearing that the police might come anytime to stop the sales as a precautionary measure against COVID-19 since social distancing was hardly maintained.

The festival disappointed people in most parts of Mysuru as meat shops remained closed in this city. Though the district administration had exempted meat stalls from the list of commercial establishments to be closed in view of the -19 restrictions, they had been closed for a week.

However, a few mutton stalls operated clandestinely for one or two hours on Thursday, selling meat for prices from ₹640 to ₹800 per kg. The regular price of mutton in Mysuru is ₹580 per kg.

After the outbreak of avian flu, the authorities had banned the sale of poultry products in a radius of 10 km from the epicentre of the bird flu in Kumbarakoppal in the city.

Since the ban covered the entire city, chicken shops were closed for the last 10 days. The mutton shops have also been closed since this week.

Though officials of Department of Animal Husband and Veterinary Science said the department had not passed any orders on the closure of mutton stalls, mutton merchants said Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) officials had directed them against opening shops as part of the prevailing COVID-19 scare.

Hundreds of people stood in long queues in Hassan to purchase mutton to celebrate the festival. The district administration allowed the stalls to open only till 1 p.m. owing to the lockdown.

Maintaining social distance in the queue, people stood for long hours to purchase the meat priced at ₹650 to ₹700 per kg.

The long queues and the restrictions coupled with high prices made many people to skip the festival in the district.

Kumari, who works as a cook, said her family had decided not to have non-veg on the day. “The price of mutton is very high and we cannot afford to it. Moreover, one has to stand in long queues to purchase a kg,” she said.

In Hubballi, which saw meat prices going up to ₹700 a kg owing to short supply, the shop owners are considering closing shops from Friday owing to the restrictions on movement.

In Shivamogga, the mutton prices touched ₹700 per kg as against the normal level of ₹550. In view of bird flu reported in the neighbouring Davangere district recently, prohibition has been imposed on the sale of chicken in Shivamogga district till the end of this month. Also, in the wake of the lockdown imposed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the arrival of sheep and goat to Shivamogga from Haveri and Chitradurga districts has come down.

Good Samaritans have taken the lead in ensuring food supply to daily wagers and people from the economically weaker sections of society in Mysuru. With a lack of job as all establishments are closed and suspension of transport system, most of them are stranded in the city and tend to spend their time in the open courtyards and lawns of K.R. Hospital or near the old APMC yard adjoining the railway station.

“Stay at home” is not an option as they have no home and are poor migrants and daily wagers living on the footpath. Many of the attendants of patients admitted at the K.R. Hospital in Mysuru are also among those who have been left in the lurch as there is no transportation to ferry them back to their village nor do they have a place to stay in the city. Hence they are seen waiting outside the K.R. Hospital complex or on the footpath.

With the COVID-19 lockdown in place private initiative has ensured to help as many people as possible during the last three days.

Suresh of Sutra Bistro Cafe told The Hindu that they covered 70 people on the first day and it has now increased to 300 people.

The police has given them passes and they move around supplying biscuits and water bottle to policemen on duty apart from those living on the footpaths. “I can cover only four areas of the city but there are others too who are doing the same,” he added.

“We normally have a stock of non-perishable items to last a month but as all hotels and restaurants are shut, we thought of utilising the stock for people who are in crisis,” he added.

There are a few more such voluntary initiatives apart from the food distribution launched by local area MLAs.

117,2020/03/26,Media urged not to sensationalise news about spread of COVID-19,"Transit passes for newspaper hawkers, transport, printing and circulation staff

Deputy Commissioner S.B. Bommanahalli held a meeting in Belagavi on Thursday to ensure hassle-free supply of newspapers in the district.

He instructed the police to issue transit passes to newspaper hawkers, transport and printing staff and circulation personnel. Such passes will be issued by Assistant Commissioner Mahantesh Jiddi in the city. Police Commissioner Lokesh Kumar said that the passes would have a distinct colour and time stamp. Superintendent of Police Lakshman Nimbargi said that the passes will be issued by various police stations across the district.

Circulation officials and heads of branches of various newspapers complained to the Deputy Commissioner and the Police Commissioner that police personnel in charge of enforcing the lockdown had not allowed the smooth movement of trucks carrying newspapers from printing presses to the distribution centres and some hawkers who were trying to deliver newspapers door to door.

The Deputy Commissioner requested media houses not to sensationalise news regarding the disease. He also requested newspapers to support the government to fight the misinformation being spread about COVID-19. He also asked journalists to take a measured and rational view of the use of minimal force by security agencies during the lockdown.

The Superintendent of Police advised journalist associations and media houses to purchase masks being prepared by the inmates of the Hindalga Central Prison. The inmates are making cloth masks that can be washed and reused. They are cost effective and are as good as synthetic masks, he said.

Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer K.V. Rajendra urged media houses to ensure that the passes issued by the district administration were not misused.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/media-urged-not-to-sensationalisenews-about-spread-of-covid-19/article31175318.ece
118,2020/03/26,"Kerala patients banned from entering Mangaluru, says Minister","‘Transportation of essential goods and commodities between two States not banned’

Minister in charge of Dakshina Kannada Kota Srinivas Poojary said here on Thursday that the State government had now stopped allowing patients from Kerala to enter Dakshina Kannada for taking treatment in any of the hospitals in Mangaluru.

“There is no compromise in our stand. The decision is to prevent community spreading of COVID-19 from Kasaragod,” he told presspersons here.

“We are strict and are not allowing patients from Kerala to enter our State. We are firm on this and are sending such ambulances back,” the Minister said.

He said transportation of essential goods and commodities between the two States had not been banned.

The government was releasing the addresses of all those under home quarantine in the district to ensure public vigil, Mr. Poojary said, and added that it was never intended to ostracise such people. Defending the city police for circulating their list on social media, Mr. Poojary said it had been done to ensure that those under home quarantine followed norms strictly.

Objecting to the State government decision, Muneer Katipalla, State president, Democratic Youth Federation of India, told The Hindu that several patients from north Kerala come to Mangaluru for medical treatment. Denying medical services to them in the guise of preventing COVID-19 is not proper. Those patients prefer hospitals and doctors who have been treating them for long in Mangaluru than approaching new doctors and hospitals. “It is an injustice,” he said.

Closing the Karnataka–Kerala border road at Ishwaramangala in Puttur taluk by pouring mud on the road was an “inhuman” and “uncivilised” act. Instead, barricades could have been used. In case if there was any emergency how to remove the loads of mud dumped on the road, he questioned.

Responding to reports on the issue, Mr. Poojary told reporters that all such blockades would be removed.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kerala-patients-banned-from-entering-mangaluru-says-minister/article31175292.ece
119,2020/03/26,"With academic calendar in disarray, final year students worry about admissions abroad","The restrictions and closure of schools and colleges has resulted in a disarray in carefully planned academic schedules, and final year students are worried about what they should do next. Many undergraduate students who were looking forward to receiving admit cards from universities and colleges abroad are still waiting in anticipation.

While the academic year begins in August or September, students normally receive their acceptance letters by March. While some of the colleges have written to the students asking them to expect a delay of six to eight weeks, many colleges that are closed have not responded to queries from students.

A final year engineering student of a city-based engineering college, who is hoping to get into one of the top colleges in the U.S. to pursue his masters, said that this delay would have a cascading effect on their academic careers. “Many of us who haven’t received our admits are worried. Besides this, they have stopped issuing U.S. visas and we don’t know how long this situation will prevail,” he said.

Students are also uncertain over whether the examination schedule will be delayed as classes are not over and have come to a standstill. As per the current calendar, the exam season is expected to be completed by May or June but that may not happen if the COVID-19 pandemic does not abate. “If colleges are unable to stick to their schedule, then we will not be able to get admission for masters abroad as we are supposed to get the results latest by the end of July,” said another final year engineering student.

A B. A. student said she had written to a college in New Zealand where she had got an offer and asked them for a deferral for the third trimester, but was informed that the option was not available. “The course in New Zealand starts in July and our examinations keep getting postponed. I might have to wait for the next academic year to pursue my masters,” she said.

However, Karisiddappa, Vice-Chancellor of Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), said that as it was a global pandemic, schedules would be disturbed but there was no need for students to worry. “After April 21, we will have a meeting and our top priority will be to fix the problems that our final year students are facing. Right now, we have asked colleges to keep students engaged academically. Many colleges that are conducting online classes are seeing attendance over 90%,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/with-academic-calendar-in-disarray-final-year-students-worry-about-admissions-abroad/article31175127.ece
120,2020/03/26,"Coronavirus | Karnataka government orders action against landlords asking doctors, paramedics to vacate","Officials asked to submit action-taken report on such cases on a daily basis.

Following complaints that landlords and owners are asking doctors and paramedical staff to vacate their houses, the government has directed all district, city, and police authorities to initiate strict action against such people under relevant provisions of the law.

In a Government Order issued on Thursday, officials have also been asked to submit action-taken report daily to the office of the Additional Chief Secretary in the Home Department.

Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education) Jawaid Akhtar said in the order, “We have received a lot of complaints from doctors, paramedical staff, and other health workers. The behaviour of landlords and house owners amounts to obstructing public servants in discharging duties. In this context, the government of Karnataka has issued the Karnataka Epidemic Disease (COVID-19) Regulations, 2020 under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and Hyderabad Infectious Disease Act, 1950 for prevention and containment of COVID-19.”

Doctors upset

Meanwhile, doctors and healthcare professionals are irked that although they are braving all odds to attend to patients during this crisis, people are treating them with disregard.

C.N. Manjunath, director of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, who is also part of the State government’s COVID-19 task force, said some 20 technicians and paramedical staff, including nurses from Jayadeva, who are staying in paying guest accommodation and individual rented pemises, had complained to him that their landlords had asked them to vacate the houses.

A senior government doctor said, “We do not want applause. All that we want is that people should treat us with humanity. If house owners do not want us to continue staying in their properties, we can also say that they should not turn up in hospitals for treatment.”

Expressing displeasure over the attitude by some landlords and house owners, U.S. Vishal Rao, chief of Head Neck Surgical Oncology and Robotic Surgery at Healthcare Global Cancer Centre, said the medical fraternity is going out on one limb to serve society. “In this hour of need, we need support from society. We have distanced ourselves from our family so we can risk our lives. We need understanding of society. Society should stand behind us,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/govt-orders-action-against-landlordsasking-doctors-paramedics-to-vacate/article31174933.ece

Extending some relaxations for the people during the present lockdown period, the district administration has allowed all small grocery shops to operate on the condition that they strictly adhere to social distancing norms.

Besides this, City Corporation has given permission to around 100 hawkers to sell vegetables and fruits in the city in order to meet the daily requirement of the people. Based on the requirement, more hawkers would be permitted if the present number does not cater to the need.

“After going through various options and public demand, we have decided to offer permission to vegetable vendors and grocery shops in the district. We hope this step would address the main issue people were facing as they wanted the availability of essential commodities”, said Deputy Commissioner, Y.S. Patil.

During his daily press briefing after holding a review meeting on Thursday, he however made it clear that shops that failed to adhere to social distancing norms would be sealed.

“We have made marking outside the shop for the people to stand in queue by keeping at least three feet distance from each other. The shop owner must see that people follow this norm, else their shop will be sealed”, he said.

On the complaint that people on duty to supply essential commodities are being beaten up by police, Mr. Patil said that all such persons would be issued special passes to avoid this problem.

On the complaint that wholesale traders are selling groceries at higher price to retailers which will affect the common man, Mr. Patil promised to take necessary action.

130,2020/03/26,A time to rediscover,"With most of the world coming to a standstill and lockdowns, how can we use the extra time we have on our hands to our advantage?

With the coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions, we are all in some sense out of school. But there is no doubt we are learning...new ways of living, getting along, expressing concern, thinking, and occupying ourselves. And indeed, new ways of learning.

But then, learning doesn’t happen automatically. In this case, we have progressed from distanced observation, to curious concern, to suddenly, being placed in the middle of change. From a routine of late-night study and rushing just in time to classes and scrambling to turn in assignments, we have suddenly been thrown into an extended waiting period. Some of us have had to simply forget the idea of classes, while a few others have had to adapt to online interactions — which are always not as efficient or productive as one would like them to be. And even if we have tried to move much of our lives online, there is still much more time at our disposal than we are used to. Time that cannot be used by hanging out with friends in the canteen or debating the state of the world over endless cups of chai under the eaves of our favourite crowded and smoky adda.

What next?

For those who are in a graduating class, this period can be particularly testing, with all the uncertainty about when the college or school session will resume, when hiring or admissions to the next level will begin, and when one should move into the next phase of preparation. How long will we have to wait? What will be the state of the economy when we emerge from this? Will there be jobs? What will be the impact of these lost months on college admissions and other opportunities? These are questions that many youngsters are dealing with.

One thing that we will all have to learn is patience, and the ability to accept a level of uncertainty. These questions are difficult to answer, and a small consolation may be that everyone is in this together. No one has the advantage of knowledge, even though, admittedly, some have the advantage of more resources (money, contacts, and so on).

The other thing that we can learn, if we choose to do so, is managing ourselves and our time without the pressure (and the support) of social obligations. Even though you may have virtual meetups and some level of keeping up with social media feeds, the absence of those chai-time conversations should give you the time and the freedom (of a kind) to reflect on the things you enjoy doing and perhaps, the things you could be doing — to catch up on reading, to reflect on what you want to do, to assess your preparation for those goals, to make some plans toward those ends.

This is also a time to rediscover ourselves without the scaffolding of institutions and other people — even though the reason we are in this situation is to protect those very things. But maybe we can also use the time to strengthen those connections that tend to get weakened by our everyday routines; this could be family, childhood friends, or others you have just missed catching up with. It is not often that we are all stopped at the same time, and forced to confront our shared reality. Perhaps, we should consider it an opportunity to take stock, at many levels, and learn some new lessons.

132,2020/03/26,State police tighten clampdown,"CM exempts more categories from curfew

The State police on Thursday attempted to limit vehicular and pedestrian movement by placing barricades at junctions and main thoroughfares.

They intensified checks and turned back hundreds of people who they reckoned had no reason to be out of their homes. They booked 2,094 persons for violating lockdown regulations imposed to control the spread of COVID-19 epidemic.

Surprised by the relatively large turnout in public places across Kerala, District Police Chiefs and City Police Commissioners enforced the lockdown in person. Most were on the road with their officers, stopping people, verifying their identity and asking them to explain their reason for travel.

Health workers, LPG delivery persons, owners of essential businesses and their staff, fish vendors, and those transporting milk and perishable goods were caught in the clampdown. The police action also led to arguments and few bordered on brawls.

Exemptions

The stepped-up enforcement drew a measure of criticism from Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan later in the day. The incidents also prompted him to exempt bakers, vendors of perishable goods, and those who step out of their homes to procure essential supplies and medicines from local shops. Mr. Vijayan cautioned the public against unnecessary travel.

He called scores of individual traders on the telephone. A grain merchant said he told Mr. Vijayan that he could not supply to retailers because his staff lacked police permits to report for work. Another trader said he had alerted the CM about disruption in inter-state supply lines. Mr Vijayan also publicly warned traders against hoarding and blackmarket sale.

Meanwhile, the Excise Department seized 11 litres of bootleg liquor from a blackmarket seller at Amaravila near the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border. Officials said the suspect had sourced the alcohol from Tamil Nadu to make a quick profit during the lockdown.

Around 150 German tourists who came for holidaying in Kerala and got stranded here following the ban on international flights into the country as part of the COVID-19 containment measures will fly back home this week.

The Centre has given the nod to operate a chartered flight from the Thiruvananthapuram international airport to Germany to enable the return of the tourists who are housed in Ayurveda resorts and yoga centres in 11 districts of the State.

The Honorary Consul, Federal Republic of Germany, in Thiruvananthapuram has submitted to the State government the list of the 150 Germans. None of them had COVID-19 and the flight is scheduled for March 28 evening, official sources told The Hindu. A high-level team, led by Chief Secretary Tom Jose and comprising Secretary, Tourism, Rani George, Airport Director C.V.

134,2020/03/26,Meeting hunger pangs in Alappuzha during lockdown,"Community kitchens and hunger-free food courts provide food at reasonable rate

It was just another working day for them on Thursday.

A group of seven, including four women and three men, reached the Janakeeya Adukala (community kitchen) run by the P. Krishnapillai Smaraka Trust at Mannanchery, near Alappuzha, around 6 a.m. They chopped vegetables, washed rice, and in less than five hours, meals for some 1, 300 people were ready.

The cooked food, which included boiled rice, sambar, thoran, achar, chammanthi, among other curries, was then dispatched to various places in vehicles.

Among them are two Janakeeya Bhakshanasalas (food courts) — near the Mannancherry bus stand and at Coir Machine Factory in Alappuzha — both launched recently as part of the State government’s Hunger-Free Kerala project.

As lunchtime neared, people started to arrive at the food court at Mannanchery, run by a Kudumbashree unit. They collected meal packets from the counter and left in no time, as no one is allowed to eat from the restaurant due to the lockdown. For those in quarantine and the needy, volunteers deliver lunch packets at their doorstep.

Ever since the government declared lockdown to check the spread of COVID-19, the small number of community kitchens and hunger-free food courts in Alappuzha are ensuring no one goes hungry, by providing food at reasonable rate. Midday meals are provided at ₹20. An additional ₹5 is charged for home delivery. For the cash-strapped, food is given free of cost.

“On Thursday, 700 lunch packets were distributed through the two janakeeya bhakshanasalas at Mannanchery and Alappuzha. Besides, food packets are delivered directly from our kitchen to health officials, the police, and those in line of duty based on bookings received. This apart, we continue to deliver free food to houses of bedridden patients and poor people at Mararikulam, Muhamma, Mannachery, and Aryad as part of the Hunger-free Mararikulam project, launched two-and-a-half years ago,” says, Riyas, patron of the P. Krishnapillai Smaraka Trust.

More join in

‘Subiksha’, a restaurant of the Kerala Food and Civil Supplies Department at Shavakottapalam here, set up as part of the hunger-free project in 2019, delivered 322 lunch packets on Thursday. Various local bodies in the district have started community kitchens to serve the poor and the needy.

After the State government declared a lockdown and the district administration imposed Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to check the spread of COVID-19, farmers in Kuttanad were a worried lot.

A high-level meeting attended by Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran, Food and Civil Supplies Minister P. Thilothaman and Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar here on Thursday decided to complete the harvest and procurement in a time-bound manner.

The procurement will come into full swing in Kuttanad soon,” the Minister said. Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar said that 80% of the paddy would be procured by April and the procurement would be completed by May 15. In the wake of COVID-19, the meeting decided to formulate a special health protocol for loading and unloading workers, truck drivers and operators of combine harvesters.

142,2020/03/26,Capital witnesses fewer violations of lockdown,"137 persons arrested for unnecessary travel, 134 cases registered

The State capital, which has largely accustomed itself to the lockdown that completed three days on Thursday, witnessed comparatively fewer violations of the restrictions imposed on account of the COVID-19 outbreak.

The City police, which tightened restrictions to prevent unnecessary travel, registered 134 cases and arrested 137 persons for violating the lockdown. As many as 85 two-wheelers, 19 autorickshaws and 13 cars were also confiscated. While the vehicles were returned to the owners after serving notices, their registration would be cancelled in case of repeated offence, District Police Chief (Thiruvananthapuram city) Balram Kumar Upadhyay said.

Cases were registered against motorists who did not possess passes meant for essential services or the self-declaration forms. Among them were those who falsely claimed to be government employees.

While the police adopted aggressive steps to discourage the public from stepping out of their homes, there were complaints of high-handedness by the police. The Sreekaryam police was accused of manhandling a man, who transported his wife, a doctor, to her hospital.

Collector K. Gopalakrishnan and Mr. Upadhyay conducted inspections at various places, including the Chala bazaar and Peroorkada, to ensure that people refrained from crowding and traders did not overcharge customers.

The city Corporation launched its first community kitchen at the Thycaud Model LP school. Mayor K. Sreekumar inaugurated the facility. Steps were afoot to commence community kitchens at the Manacaud LP school and the Cotton Hill school.

Register for food

Those requiring food to be supplied to them have been advised to register in the Smart Trivandrum mobile app through the COVID link, through www.covid19tvm. com or by contacting 94964 34448, 94964 34449 or 94964 34450.

The Kerala Police have also commenced food supply for the needy in the district.

Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran, who convened a review meeting, called for steps to mitigate the fallout of the suspension of liquor sales in the State. He instructed the district administration to assist those who were likely to suffer from health problems under the circumstances.

One held with IMFL

The excise officials arrested one person with alleged possession of 11.8 litres of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) at Karakkonam late on Wednesday. The accused, Saleem, 50, of Pullantheri, is suspected to have smuggled nearly 50 bottles of liquor from Tamil Nadu.

144,2020/03/26,"Now, police turn to yoga to make people stay at home","10-minute video on different asanas that will help strengthen respiratory system

Having effectively used their popular social media wing to raise awareness about COVID-19 through humorous memes and viral videos, the Kerala Police are now set to dabble in yoga to bolster their ‘stay at home’ campaign.

The initiative, tagged ‘Yoga against Corona’, aims at entertaining the public forced to stay indoors and to ensure the maintenance of their general health and fitness levels at a time when avenues for workout remain restricted.

The police have designed the new campaign realising that the same set of citizens who were unwilling to leave their fast-submerging homes during the floods are now reluctant to stay indoors and follow the lockdown protocol. A video of a 10-minute session of various asanas shot at the Martyrs Column of the Police Headquarters was uploaded on YouTube and various social media platforms on Thursday.

Yoga capsule

“When humanity is fighting against corona, locked in their homes, the Kerala Police have come up with a ‘yoga capsule’ specifically designed to strengthen the respiratory system,” said Additional Director General of Police Manoj Abraham, who heads the social media wings of the Police Department and conceptualised the campaign on a directive of State Police Chief Loknath Behera, who devotes an hour daily for his yoga routine.

Considering that the virus attacks the respiratory system, the police hope to add to the general immunity against it by strengthening the respiratory system through their new initiative.

The asanas have been selected by yoga experts within the department and performed by police officers themselves.

The video was directed, produced, shot, edited and scripted by the police social media team.

The police have roped in celebrities, including film stars, to appeal to the people to stay at home to ‘Break the Chain.’ The yoga campaign comes close on the heels of the phenomenal popularity of its ‘handwash dance’ and the ‘Break the Chain’ animated video, which reached more than 6.5 million people in five days.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/9apmmp/article31176534.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27tv-policgrab,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/now-police-turn-to-yoga-to-make-people-stay-at-home/article31176535.ece
145,2020/03/26,‘Preventive’ medicine demand raises doubts,"The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recommendation for the empirical use of hydroxy-chloroquine, an anti-malarial drug also used for rheumatoid arthritis, for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection has led to a reported rise in its demand in at least some districts in the State.

Public health activists have questioned the rationale behind the prescription without the tacit approval of the World Health Organization (WHO). They claim that panic buying of the drug will also deprive its benefits to thousands of patients who regularly use it.

Demand up

Functionaries of the All-Kerala Chemists and Druggists Association (AKCDA) and the Kerala Private Pharmacists’ Association (KPPA) confirmed on Thursday that the demand for the drug had gone up in the past few days. “We do not, however, have stocks as the medicine never used to sell that much,” A.N. Mohanan of the AKCDA said.

Galileo George, former general secretary, KPPA, said there had been many inquiries from districts such as Kasaragod, Kannur and Kollam.

Action warned

In the wake of the high demand and reported rise in sales, the Drugs Control Department in Kasaragod district warned of action under the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 against those who sold the medicine without valid prescription from a registered medical practitioner.

The ICMR had advised that “asymptomatic health-care workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19” and “asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases” can use it “on the prescription of a registered medical practitioner.”

Following this, a couple of voice clips, purportedly recorded by some doctors in the State, started doing the rounds in WhatsApp groups recommending health workers to use it as a preventive measure. Soon after, non-health workers also started sharing the messages. Medical shops started getting queries and there was panic buying in some places.

Not WHO recommended

Meanwhile, U. Nandakumar, public health activist, pointed out that the WHO had never advised using hydroxy-chloroquine as a preventive drug as a detailed study was yet to be undertaken. There had not been any evidence to prove its efficacy either.

“It is not like a vaccine that will provide immunity from a disease. The drug will not stay in the blood for long. For that to happen, you may have to consume it regularly. That defeats the purpose of its use as a preventive medicine,” he added.

Also, the clarification issued by the ICMR later that the unrestricted use of the medicine was not advisable as it was still in an experimental stage seems to have slipped the notice of many.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/preventive-medicine-demand-raises-doubts/article31176524.ece
146,2020/03/26,"Stray animals, birds face starvation","PFA approaches police seeking permission to feed such animals

The COVID-19 lockdown in the State has upended the lives of not just human beings but also animals and birds. Homeless animals such as stray dogs and cats are faced with starvation with animal welfare activities hampered by the restrictions in place and restaurants and eateries downing shutters.

The Thiruvananthapuram chapter of the People for Animals (PFA) has written to the District Police Chief (Thiruvananthapuram city) requesting freedom of movement for its staff to feed strays and animals housed in rescue shelters.

“If we ignore this issue, it could lead to a more severe problem. Strays left starving may start attacking people. If they start dying, the carcasses could pose health problems,” PFA (Thiruvananthapuiram) secretary Latha Indira told The Hindu.

PFA plea

The PFA has requested permission for vehicles of animal welfare organisations to attend rescue calls and take food supplies to animals in need. Stray animals are faced with the prospect of starvation due to the closure of restaurants and eateries, the PFA said in its petition.

Further, a number of organisations operate rescue centres where hundreds of animals are cared for, the PFA pointed out. There are also several people who feed and care for animals on a daily basis. The organisation has requested the police to allow animal feeders to supply food to homeless animals till 9 p.m. every day. “These animals are our responsibility and we need to feed and take care of them,” PFA said.

AWBI petition

The Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI), in a letter to Chief Secretaries of all States and Union Territories on March 23, had suggested that district administrations can allot a specific time during the morning and evening hours for individuals/volunteers to provide food and water to street animals and birds.

Valuable service

“This is a valuable service consistently provided by compassionate individuals and its absence may cause a large number of animals and birds to suffer and die. The carcasses of the animals and birds may further spread different diseases in the community which will be difficult to control,” AWBI chairman O. P. Chowdhuri said in his letter.

Pet shop owners also have approached the police with a similar request. They have birds, animals and fish which need to be fed. Moreover, pet shops also stock feed for pets. The Pets Farmers and Traders Association, in a March 25 letter to the District Police Chief (Thiruvananthapuram city), has requested permission to keep pet shops open from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Essential services

Meanwhile, the State government has issued orders listing veterinary clinics, animal husbandry services and dairy development as essential services.

The government has amended the March 23 order on the lockdown to facilitate their inclusion. All veterinary hospitals and sub- centres will function with skeleton staff and provide services to dairy farmers, Animal Husbandry Director M. K. Prasad said. In view of the COVID-19 scenario, it would be ideal for farmers to approach the hospitals only for emergency medical care, Dr. Prasad said.

Amending the March 23 order, the government included ‘waste management service by IMAGE and other private waste management services’ in the list of essential services.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vl3mea/article31176506.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27tvwatermelonjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/stray-animals-birds-face-starvation/article31176507.ece

A British citizen who was put on antiviral drugs at the Government Medical College Hospital, Ernakulam, has tested negative for COVID-19. Meanwhile, five others have left the Kalamassery-based hospital after being cured of the disease. Those discharged included a three-year-old boy and his parents from Kannur who contracted the disease in Italy, and two British citizens.

The condition of the British citizen, who was administered antiviral drugs ritonavir and lopinavir used in HIV treatment when his pneumonia worsened, has improved. His swab sample turned negative on the third day of the treatment.

The person who tested positive in Idukki is a local politician. However, the Health Department has pinpointed the source of infection and there was no reason for concern, Chief Minister said. The number of people under surveillance in the State on Thursday jumped to 1,02,003 from 76,542 on Wednesday, of whom 601 persons are admitted in isolation wards in hospitals.

Mr. Vijayan said there was no evidence of community spread in the State so far. Though the situation in Kasaragod district had given rise to such concerns, things seemed to be under control as of now. However, the issue of people violating home quarantine continued to be a major headache in the district.

Mr. Vijayan said the State had made preparations on an intense scale to meet any possible emergency which might arise out of the evolving COVID 19 epidemic, including an escalation in the number of patients that the health system might have to manage. The COVID 19 package declared by the Centre would be utilised suitably to augment the State’s own plans.

Apart from fully utilising the public sector hospitals, the government has identified 69,434 beds in all in 879 private hospitals in the State. These include 5,607 ICU beds. A total of 15,333 rooms had been identified in 716 hostels, which would be renovated as isolation/ hospital beds. Minor maintenance works were being carried out on an emergency basis in these buildings.

The Health Department was collecting details of doctors who had retired from service since 2012, whose service and experience could be put to use when the State was facing a health emergency, he said.

Chief Minister said all field-level health workers who were engaged in preventive and control measures should follow all safety precautions and ensure their protection.

A list of those above 60 years in the State is being prepared and the department is preparing to reach across to them with the help of the 14,000-strong pain and palliative care volunteer network in the State.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/no-evidence-of-community-spread-in-state-pinarayi/article31175797.ece
151,2020/03/26,47 community kitchens open,"1,000 more such facilities to come up across the State in next two days

Forty-seven community kitchens have started functioning in the State.

Announced by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to provide relief to the people in the wake of restrictions imposed to slow the spread of COVID-19, the community kitchens are being run by Kudumbashree in association with local self-government institutions (LSGIs).

The community kitchens that have started functioning are 11 in Thrissur and 12 in Malappuram, four in Wayanad, three in Alappuzha, and five in Palakkad.

Kudumbashree executive director Harikishore S. said they were aiming to launch 1,000 such kitchens in the next two days.

Locations for setting up community kitchens have been identified in 725 of the 941 panchayats and 84 of the 87 municipalities in the State. Sites for nine kitchens in the six Corporations too have been identified.

Mr. Harikishore said the LSGIs were playing a crucial role in setting up the community kitchens. They will be running the kitchens and ensuring that food is delivered to those in need.

Though intended to provide lunch for ₹20, these kitchens can be adapted to meet local requirements and provide food more than once a day, he said.

Those who are in home quarantine, those unable to cook because they stay alone in lodges or have no essentials, the elderly and the indigent, destitute people, bedridden patients, and those who seeks alms will be provided food from the community kitchens.

Over 60 migrant workers from Tamil Nadu, who tried to meet the District Collector on Thursday, have demanded that they be given permission to go back to their State.

They said that they had no work and place to stay.

155,2020/03/26,Kerala govt. plans 2.35 lakh volunteer force to help needy,"To recruit 2.35 lakh persons in the 22-40 age group through online registration

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said the State will immediately raise a volunteer force of able-bodied persons between the age of 22 and 40 to rush food, provision and physical aid to persons under lockdown.

The government hoped to recruit 2.35 lakh persons through online registration. Health authorities would examine them for illness and train them on how to help people in the time of the outbreak without jeopardising their health. The government would give them protective gear and meet their travel and food expenses, Mr. Vijayan said here on Thursday

Each panchayat would have 200 volunteers, municipalities around 500 and Corporations almost 750 workers. The volunteers would fan out in neighbourhoods to locate those in need and help them.

They should look out for homeless people, aged citizens without familial support, needy persons and those whose lives have been disrupted by the outbreak. The ‘Sannadha Sena’ should rush to their aid and ensure nobody went without food, medicines and State support.

Mr. Vijayan said community kitchens were mushrooming across the State to ensure that no family or homeless persons went hungry during the lockdown. Hotels and catering services have offered their services to assist the local self-government institutions (LSGIs).

He said those without ration cards could get provision free at ration shops, provided they furnished their Aadhaar cards. Mr. Vijayan warned the police against restricting individuals from venturing out to procure provision, medicines and other essentials for their families.

Citizens should mandatorily carry an affidavit detailing their reason for travel on their person. He warned the police against closing bakeries and preventing pharmaceutical suppliers from transporting medicines to retailers.

The government would operate fleets of trucks on a convoy basis to help wholesalers import essential commodities from production centres in other regions and free up provision and pulses languishing in seaports.

Mr. Vijayan warned traders against hiking the prices of commodities or creating artificial shortage to squeeze profits. He told traders that the government would ease restrictions on home delivery soon.

Mr. Vijayan said online sale of legal alcohol was not on the cards currently. However, the clampdown on liquor sale had immediately spawned networks that profited from bootleg, illicit spirit and moonshine. He ordered the Excise Department to be extra vigilant.

Mr. Vijayan sought a moratorium on loans for a minimum of three months and more time to register vehicles and remit various taxes. He also exempted warehouses and godowns from the 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. lockdown.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ine3w2/article31187596.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27TVLOCKDOWNKERALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/govt-plans-volunteer-force-to-help-needy/article31175035.ece

The enforcement wing of the Excise Department has stepped up vigil against bootlegging and substance abuse in the wake of the closure of bars and sales outlets till April 14. As part of this, night patrolling and searches have been stepped up.

De-addiction and counselling centres under the State Excise Department will offer free treatment and counselling services to persons suffering from physical or mental stress due to non-availability of alcoholic drinks, following the closure of bars and retail liquor outlets in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak.

The Excise Department and de-addiction mission Vimukthi under it will extend these services on call to the nearest Excise Range Office or police station. The service will also be available by calling the Excise Department’s toll-free number 14405.

The Excise Department has set up a de-addiction Centre at one taluk hospital in each district to provide free treatment and counselling services. Apart from these, de-addiction and counselling facilities are also functioning in Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam and Kozhikode districts. These facilities will provide round-the-clock free service.

Besides the typical withdrawal symptoms such as shivering, nausea, insomnia and lack of appetite, such situations are also found to result in domestic discord, necessitating consultation and counselling.

158,2020/03/26,Man booked for giving COVID-19 shudders to Palakkad,"Umra returnee roamed around, met many, entertained visitors at home

The man from Karakurissi near Mannarkkad in the district who was tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday has posed a threatening puzzle for the health authorities and the district administration. The police registered a case against him for deliberately endangering society by ignoring laws.

The 51-year-old man is believed to have had interaction with hundreds of people even after he contracted the virus causing COVID-19. He is suspected to have contracted the virus from Saudi Arabia, where he had visited on Umra pilgrimage.

He is believed to have roamed around for over a week without any control even after returning from Jeddah on March 13. He visited several mosques and two hospitals. The district administration, after a rough estimation, said that he could have interacted with at least 300 people.

Flouting the instructions given by the Health Department that all passengers coming from abroad should remain in home quarantine, the man in question had visited several public places after he landed at Karipur airport on March 13.

He attended mass Juma prayers at Karakkunnu Juma Masjid near Karakurissi on March 13 and 20. He attended group prayers at Anakkaparamba Aisha Masjid five times almost every day. He visited a tailor shop, a vegetable shop and a grocery shop at Mannarkkad.

He visited Darussalam Orphanage at Karakurissi and a mosque at Viyyakurissi. He also entertained several visitors at his house. He had sought treatment for cough and other body discomfort twice at Government Taluk Hospital and Cooperative Hospital, Mannarkkad.

He was forcibly put under quarantine by the health and police authorities after local people complained.

Seven of his relatives who had had close interaction with him are currently in quarantine. The fact that his son, who is a KSRTC bus conductor, had attended duty a few times after interacting with him has given a shock to the district administration.

His son had attended duty on KSRTC bus from Mannarkkad to Coimbatore and later to Thiruvananthapuram. KSRTC has prepared detailed sketches of those bus routes.

District Collector D. Balamurali said here on Thursday that more stringent measures would be clamped in Mannarkkad area as two cases were reported from there.

159,2020/03/26,Centre should scrap limit for deficits: K.M. Abraham,"‘It will help overcome the impasse triggered by COVID-19’

The Central and State governments should eschew the policy obsession for keeping deficits below 3% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the textbook rules that adhere to balancing the Budget to overcome the impasse triggered by COVID-19, public finance expert and Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) chief executive officer K.M. Abraham has said.

Interacting with The Hindu, Mr. Abraham said public finance concerns had led to conferring an unwritten holiness to the 3% borrowing limit for the Central and State governments.

‘Imposing on States’

“India is expected to have an average financial savings of 12% to 13% of the GDP, of which about 2% is distributed to public sector institutions and about 6% apportioned equally among Central and State governments. This became an axiom in the Union Finance Ministry and now the Centre is imposing it on the States. But the Centre itself tends to flout the rule at will and revises upwards the fiscal responsibility targets through the Union Budget,” he said.

Manufacturing industries, which account for the bulk of the private sector borrowing, will be struggling next financial year to dispose of its finished goods, inventories and work in progress. Hence, they are unlikely to show an appetite for fresh debt soon.

To keep the economy rolling, States could be allowed to fill up the gap. State governments should be allowed to borrow up to 5% of their share of the GDP in this as well as next financial year.

‘MSMEs need a lifeline’

The micro, small and and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which account for 6% of the manufacturing GDP and offer 12 crore jobs, need a strong and easily accessible lifeline. The Centre should support a credit line for working capital through the banking system. It should be with a one-year moratorium and repayable over 10 years at 4% interest, he said.

The suggestion assumes significance in the wake of the thrust laid by the government on promoting and nurturing the MSME sector. Mr. Abraham laid accent on leveraging the National Food Security Act and making optimum use of the public distribution system for supplying essentials covered under the system.

Procurement channels

“The State governments should open procurement channels for produce from rural farmers and homesteads to address shortage of milk, vegetables, fish and meat,” he said.

A concerted effort should be made to search, trace and identify the marginalised and indigent sections who do not figure in any formal accounting system such as Jan Dhan, GSTN or income tax databases and ensure that their nutrition and living needs are met fairly, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/g5oosd/article31187520.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27tvKMAbrahamjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/centre-should-scrap-limit-for-deficits-expert/article31174338.ece
160,2020/03/26,Coronavirus lockdown | Kerala dreads rise in prices of essentials,"Stocks are in short supply as the coronavirus lockdown hits freight movement; Minister says govt. taking efforts on war footing to maintain supply chain

The spectre of a steep rise in commodity prices loomed large in Kerala on the third of the COVID-19-related lockdown on Thursday.

Major importers of pulses, edible oil and food grain said they foresaw an imminent shortage of provisions as the lockdown had hit cargo movement severely.

Also read | Kerala to provide free ration to all

Pottuvelu Subramanian, head of one of the oldest trading houses in the State, said the deficiency of labour and lack of transport had hobbled efforts of wholesale merchants in Kerala to get supplies trucked in from other regions.

For instance, the supply of Orid dhall, considered a staple in the State and transported from Theni in Tamil Nadu, was hit due to shortage of workers to process and parcel it.

Truckers feared being detained at inter-state borders and said they would have to starve with no wayside eateries open.

The State customarily leaned heavily on green gram imports from Australia to make up for the dip in local production during summer. Several shipments of mung bean were held up in Thoothukudi port due to the lockdown.

Traders said transporters would charge a hefty penalty as demurrage on importers for the delay in unloading the shipments. Naturally, traders would pass on the extra cost to consumers. A rise in the price of essential commodities appeared difficult to fend-off.

The lockdown has also hit the supply of edible oil, chiefly palmolien, imported from Malaysia as the shipments have been stuck in ports.

R.S. Manikantan, a wholesale onion and potato merchant, said the Tamil Nadu police had closed down markets and warehouses in Dindigul and Madurai. The remaining stocks were fast dwindling.

Provision stores found it difficult to operate with the police unwilling to issue passes to staff. Moreover, the police turned away buyers.

G. Sanal, general secretary, All India LPG Distributors Federation (Kerala Circle), said lack of delivery persons had hit cooking gas delivery in the State. The Federation has requested the government to issue protective gear and travel permits to gas agency staff.

The lockdown has drastically reduced the availability of fish and ushered in poverty along the coastline. Fish hawkers, once a ubiquitous sign of life in the State, are now few and far between.

T. Peter, general secretary of the National Fish Workers Forum said fishers were unwilling to go to sea because the government had banned auctions.

Bakers have all but stopped functioning. There were fears that the lockdown could squeeze chicken, mutton, beef and egg supplies.

“The hospital is taken as per the 2005 Disaster Management Act and the order in this regard has been issued to District Medical Officer to utilise the infrastructure and staff for converting it as special COVID hospital,” he said. The decision has been taken in the wake of an increase in the cases in the neighbouring districts and lack of infrastructure facilities available in government hospitals.

163,2020/03/26,"Coronavirus lockdown | Stringent action against violators, says Tamil Nadu DGP","Chennai Police to issue temporary passes online.

Tamil Nadu Director-General of Police J.K. Tripathy on Thursday warned of stringent action against any person violating the prohibitory orders issued under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The second day of prohibitory orders were incident free and people were by and large co-operating with the law enforcing agencies by remaining indoors. Police were instructed to initiate firm legal action against those found to be deliberately violating the restrictions by coming out of home without valid reasons. Such offence was punishable with imprisonment, Mr. Tripathy told The Hindu.

Senior police officials were monitoring the security arrangements and keeping a close watch on vital establishments across the State. Asked about allegations that police were using lathis or abusive language in some places to chase away people seen on the roads, the DGP said videos of certain incidents reported in other States were being circulated in the social media. In Tamil Nadu, clear instructions were given to police officials to ensure that no force was used against the public.

“We have told the police to enforce the rule of law and not to use any force against the public. There is no need for that…people are aware of the risks of coming out in the current scenario. The prohibitory orders were issued to curb the spread of coronavirus and at the same time uninterrupted supply of essential commodities has been ensured. Appropriate action is being taken where police high-handedness was alleged,” he said.

Police would make enquiries with people found moving outside their residence. If the reasons given for coming out of home were reasonable and justified they would be allowed to go. “Police have been sensitised to the exemptions given to those in essential services. I appeal to the people to cooperate with the government in its efforts to control the deadly virus from spreading,” he said.

In a statement, Mr. Vaiko called upon the people to co-operate with the government in its effort to prevent the spread of the viral disease. He pointed out to medical forecasts that a large number of people could be affected by the disease in April and May. He appealed to the police to be considerate when it came to dealing with carriers of essential commodities.

Mr. Vaiko requested the government to supply essential commodities even to those who did not possess a ration card.

Mr. Anbumani said: “Tamil Nadu requires thermal scanners, personal protection equipment, ventilators, gloves, medicines, and to buy this requires huge funds. I am allocating ₹3 crore and will set aside more funds as per need.”

Industries Minister M.C. Sampath on Wednesday allocated ₹55 lakh from MLA Local Area Development Fund (MLALAD) to help meet the medical requirements for treating COVID-19 patients in Cuddalore district.

Mr. Sampath handed over the letter releasing the funds to Cuddalore Collector V. Anbuselvan.

The fund would be used to procure medical equipments to fight COVID-19, he said.

Chidambaram constituency AIADMK MLA K.A. Pandian has also offered ₹32 lakh from MLALAD funds to the district administration for treating COVID-19 patients.

165,2020/03/26,Skeletal staff keep Secretariat ticking,"Personnel asked to take turns

Amidst the 21-day countrywide lockdown across the country in the fight against COVID-19, skeletal staff in the Secretariat have been keeping the machinery functioning at Fort St. George, the seat of power of the Tamil Nadu government. Special arrangements have been made for their transport.

In line with the detailed notification issued by the State government on Monday evening, the employees in several departments have been instructed to work on rotation in the Secretariat. Besides the Chief Minister and the Deputy Chief Minister, a few Ministers visited the Secretariat.

However, a section of the staff opined there was no need for skeletal staff in all departments but only in specific departments. “It will be better if only officials from Revenue and Health departments and the DIPR are allowed to work. Others can be exempted from coming to office because their departments are not related to COVID-19 at all and their coming to office should not make Secretariat a COVID-19 hotspot,” an official contended. While several employees in the Secretariat preferred to commute on their own vehicles, many officials who had been using public transport thanked the government for the special arrangements made for their transport.

Special buses

Two MTC buses have been pressed into service for their benefit from over 10 pick-up points to the Secretariat both in the mornings and evenings. “While one would start at 9 a.m., the next would start 30 minutes later. On our way back, one would start at 6 p.m. and another 30 minutes later,"" an official said.

Two buses each have been allotted to pick up points in Thiruvanmiyur, Okkiam-Thoraipakkam, Royapettah-Peter's Colony, Todhunter Nagar, Guindy Railway Station, K.K.

166,2020/03/26,Love in the time of lockdown,"Youth jumps quarantine, elopes, only to be nabbed and brought back to the facility

A 23-year-old man who returned from Dubai a few days back and was quarantined at a government facility near here, escaped from there to meet his lady love in a remote village on Wednesday.

“Probably those around him mistook him for a sanitary worker as he was sporting a mask,” a police officer said.

The man who walked to the Inner Ring Road hitch-hiked on a two-wheeler towards his village in Sivaganga district.

Midway home, he was picked up by his relative and taken to the village.

The police say the unskilled labourer had come to India only to marry his lady love as her parents had arranged her marriage with another person on March 30.

Despite the lockdown and vigil of family members in the village, the man managed to bring the girl out of her residence with the help of his friends and they eloped.

Meanwhile, a health official at the quarantine home lodged a complaint with the Madurai City police and a team of police and health officials nabbed him at a hideout and brought him back to the quarantine facility.

“The man claims that he has married the girl,” a police officer said.

The girl has been handed over to her parents.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/love-in-the-time-of-lockdown/article31176898.ece

All persons who returned from abroad after February 15, in addition to all those advised earlier, should remain under strict home or institutional quarantine for a period decided by health officials.

A notification issued by Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam on Wednesday said persons violating rules for quarantine would be liable to face legal action under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code.

Meanwhile, the State government has said that lists with details of about persons who returned from abroad had been provided to the respective District Collectors to ensure that the persons in question remained in self-quarantine.

Collectors informed

“Severe action would be taken against violators,” it said and added that officials should ensure that they remain in isolation in their respective homes. District Collectors have been instructed to ensure safety, security and essential supplies to such families.

“Violators would be dealt with severely, including imposing of fine and criminal proceedings would be initiated against them,” it added.

Sections 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and Section 188 of the IPC and other relevant sections would be invoked against violators.

168,2020/03/26,Police get tough with joyriders,"Those found making unnecessary trips made to do squats, not allowed to proceed

Faced with the task of implementing a curfew, the Tamil Nadu police often resorted to force across the State, on the second day of the total lockdown on Thursday.

Since Wednesday, people have been complaining of police high-handedness. But on their part, the police have pointed out people taking joy rides or unnecessary long trips on the pretext of buying groceries. Some people, on the other hand, said that they were making legitimate efforts to go out for medicines or groceries, but were not allowed to proceed. Video clippings showing people being forced to do squats did the rounds of social media.

On Wednesday evening, the police resorted to mild force and chased around 50 youngsters playing cricket in an open ground in Kancheepuram, despite prohibitory orders.

In Chidambaram, the police made a group of youngsters, playing cricket, do sit-ups. In Thiruvannamalai, the police made a few motorists do squats.

Wielding of lathis

Similarly, the Singanallur police in Coimbatore wielded lathis on motorists on Wednesday evening, drawing criticism from various quarters. A video of the police beating up motorists at the Singanallur traffic junction went viral on social media. Police high-handedness continued on Thursday.

In Madurai, a Railways Assistant Loco Pilot, who was going for railway duty, was fined by the traffic police at Goripalayam junction on Wednesday morning. Railway sources said that he was going to the railway junction to operate a light engine for a specific railway work. While he was crossing the Goripalayam junction on his two-wheeler, he was detained, along with other vehicle users, by a team of traffic police. A railway union leader said that the ALP was in his uniform. He had told the officer that he was going for his duty. But before he could flash his office identity card, the officer issued him an e-challan for ₹500.

In Koyambedu, the traffic police on Wednesday evening caught two youngsters, riding a motorcycle, and took away the vehicle’s keys. They were made to do squats for violating orders.

The city police chased people who were taking joy rides on their two-wheelers, in the western suburbs of the city.

A senior policeman said that youth were riding motorcycles from Tambaram, past the Central station, claiming that they had come out “to buy groceries”. The police said that they had regulated inter-zone movement of people, and for all essential needs, residents could shop in their own areas. They added that people travelling for medical emergencies would be allowed to pass, even across zones.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/kk2nr1/article31176673.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THLEAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/police-get-tough-with-joyriders/article31176675.ece
169,2020/03/26,HC directs govt. to keep eviction and demolition drives in abeyance,"Extends all interim orders till April 30 to avoid miscarriage of justice

The Madras High Court on Thursday took up a suo motu public interest litigation petition based on a letter penned by its Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and directed the State government to keep in abeyance all encroachment eviction drives, State revenue recovery measures and proceedings related to demolition of buildings.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and Abdul Quddhose further ordered that all other actions which were likely to give rise to an immediate litigation should also be kept in abeyance temporarily since judicial functions in courts across the State had been suspended for three weeks in view of a nationwide lockdown to fight COVID-19.

In order to prevent miscarriage of justice, the Bench invoked its powers under Article 226 (writ jurisdiction) of the Constitution and ordered that all interim orders that were to expire on or after March 20 shall stand extended till April 30 unless or otherwise they were vacated or modified earlier by a judicial order to the contrary.

“All orders passed by the courts exercising criminal jurisdiction having granted bail, anticipatory bail or parole etc., for a limited period which are likely to expire on or before April 30, 2020 shall stand extended till April 30, 2020 subject to any orders passed by the said forums even before the said expiry date or thereafter,” the Bench ordered.

It also reiterated a general order already passed by a Division Bench led by Justice N. Kirubakaran on March 20 directing the Chief Secretary to the State government to ensure that no eviction of any encroachment was carried out until the situation normalises and people were able to approach a court of law to ventilate their grievances, if any.

If there were any emergent situations, the government could obtain the views of Advocate General Vijay Narayan and act accordingly, the Bench led by Justice Sathyanarayanan clarified. A similar suo motu PIL petition was taken up in the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court too and identical orders were passed with respect to the districts that fall under its territorial jurisdiction.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-directs-govt-to-keep-eviction-and-demolition-drives-in-abeyance/article31176395.ece

177,2020/03/26,Advocate warns TN police against assaulting violators of curfew order; policeman responds in ‘Singam’ style,"Two audio clippings – one purportedly by a Supreme Court Advocate and another by apparently by a police personnel taking on the advocate – have gone viral on social media.

Police-advocate rivalry in Tamil Nadu is legendary. The universal threat of Coronavirus that has led to a nation-wide lockdown has only helped fan the flames of the feud.

Two audio clippings – one purportedly by a Supreme Court Advocate warning police of losing their jobs for assaulting violators of curfew order and another by apparently by a police personnel taking on the advocate – have gone viral on social media.

The advocate started his statement with a huge warning. “Who gave you the right to assault the common man? Is it the Director General of Police, Chief Minister or the Deputy Chief Minister?” is how he pounced on the State police.

He said that the police could only book the violators of the Prohibitory Order promulgated under Section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure under Section 188 of Indian Penal Code.

“You can only advise them [to keep indoors]. Keep in mind that all [policemen] those assaulted [the violators] will lose your job if the video clipping is produced before High Court and Human Rights Commission,” he said. He also warned them of serious charges being booked against them.

The advocate dared whether the police would take on the advocates, if they come out in violation of the curfew order. “The violators should only be produced before the magistrate. Let the magistrate decide on whether they could be let off on bail,” he said.

Within few hours of this audio clipping did rounds on the social media, especially on WhatsApp, another clipping by an unidentified police person went viral. He said that the State police are aware of the penal sections and the advocate need not teach them on legal aspects.

He took on the advocate saying every citizen, including the advocates, were bound by the curfew order and other laws. Anyone with the knowledge that his venturing out could lead to spreading of an epidemic can be booked.

“You press any charge against us. You are free to even pack us home. It is not a problem at all,” the policeman said. He went on to say that the policemen could survive setting up a grocery shop like in the Surya-starrer ‘Singam’.

The protagonist of the Tamil movie – a Sub-Inspector of Police – would warn the villain that he was not dependent on the police job.

“We are not assaulting anyone who comes out with a genuine reason. But only those unnecessarily roam around and pick up quarrel with police are beaten up,” the policeman said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/advocate-warns-tn-police-against-assaulting-violators-of-curfew-order-policeman-responds-in-singam-style/article31169973.ece

It started on the night of March 22, barely hours before the ‘Janata Curfew’ called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi came into force and continued its journey for the next four days traversing seven States across the country to reach its destination in the southern tip of India.

Though the train had about 50 % occupancy during most part of its journey, it reached its last station Kanyakumari without any passenger.

About 150 passengers, including women and children, were deboarded at Palghat and quarantined at Government Victoria College there. As a nationwide lockdown also dawned on Kanyakumari, Train No. 15906 Vivek Express rolled in empty.

For your weekly Watch List, we have filmmaker C Prem Kumar sharing his list of favourite movies and TV series that he often finds himself revisiting “I’ve never been a religious movie watcher. You could say I was one during my childhood. But I’m utilising this quarantine period primarily to write,” says Prem Kumar.

I particularly liked the way the dialogues were written, and of course, it had wonderful casting in the form of Kevin Costner, Robert De Niro, Andy Garcia and Sean Connery. There’s a beautiful action sequence that pays tribute to Sergei Eisenstein’s editing theory. You’ll be stunned by the camera movements. Every department surprises you. It’s not an arthouse movie, but a completely commercial one — something any common man would relate to.

Lawrence of Arabia

I keep revisiting Lawrence of Arabia time and again for various reasons. Sometimes, I watch it for David Lean, the filmmaker; sometimes, it’s for Freddie Young, the cinematographer. It’s a special movie because it was my father who made me watch it. I remember watching Lawrence of Arabia on VHS. Those days, it used to come in two parts — the first half in one and the second half in another. I have a bundle of memories attached to it.

Knives Out

The movie received great reviews and was nominated for the Oscars. I watched Knives Out with four of my director friends. The female lead looked like Trisha Krishnan’s doppelganger. It’s such an engaging movie with Daniel Craig leading the front, in an non-action role. I liked the entire construct inside one large family and an arresting drama that unfolds.

Game of Thrones

I’m a big fan of period movies and am into historical dramas. Vikings is one of my all-time favourites. There can’t be many people who haven’t watched Game of Thrones. But if there’s anyone who hasn’t watched it yet, now is the time. In the sense that you can binge-watch the entire series in 21 days. That is one strong suggestion.

183,2020/03/26,What are Kollywood stars learning this lockdown season?,"Tamil film personalities are using this quarantine time to equip themselves with skills that could come handy later

Being grounded is never fun. Normal life is affected, even for celebrities who aren’t quite used to said life. And at a time when we don’t quite know when the concept of normalcy is likely to return, Tamil film personalities have taken up different interests, away from the glare of cameras and arc lights.

Like actor-composer GV Prakash Kumar, who has gone back to video-gaming with a vengeance during the lockdown. “I have no other choice now but to play video games,” says Prakash, whose normal work schedule doesn’t leave him enough time to engage in this childhood passion. “I work out in my house. I have a gym set up here. I’m also watching movies and listening to music,” he adds. When we reached out to him, Prakash was playing Tennis World Tour: Roland-Garros edition on his favourite PS4 console. “I’m also playing Call of Duty: WWII,” he says. When we suggest trying out FIFA, Prakash, who admits to not having played the popular football game, responds: “FIFA is supposed to be good. Maybe, I will give it a shot.”

Besides video games, the composer says that he thought he’d pick up a guitar and learn how to play the instrument during this time, but the severe restrictions placed on movement of people on the streets means that Prakash will have to give it a pass. Wouldn’t a composer be able to teach himself how to play one? He laughs. “Yeah, but without a tutor it will be tough to get the tone and temper right. It only comes with good positioning,” he says, insisting that there is something he won’t even bother trying during lockdown. “Cooking. I used to like watching the Australian MasterChef series. But I’m not good at cooking.”

For director Sam Anton, though, the lockdown has come at a bad time. “I was in discussion for my next film,” he says, adding that the situation has forced him to have script writing sessions over WhatsApp calls. “I’m writing from 10 to 12 in the morning and after 7 pm in the evening.” What does he do in the meantime? Perhaps, this is now time to touch upon his cooking skills.... “Haha, nope!” he says. “My wife does not let me inside the kitchen because I make a mess. I had to walk a mile to get some bread now,” he says. While it is easy getting used to catering food on a film set, Sam says he is trying to eat healthy at least for the period of lockdown. “I’m trying to lose weight,” he says, before pausing to reiterate the word: “TRYING”.

Vishnu Vishal | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Losing weight is no problem for Vishnu Vishal. The actor, last seen in the smash hit Ratsasan (2018), has been in a fighting fit condition for some time. His workout and fitness regimen videos attract a lot of viewers on his Instagram and Twitter profiles. However, aside of workouts, Vishnu Vishal has been spending time with his parents, trying to keep the positive spirits high about him and the family. “I’m also thinking of trying to learn some cooking,” he admits. So, exactly how bad is he at cooking at the moment, we ask. “Haha, I’m really bad with cooking. But I haven’t started yet [to learn]. As of now, I can cook some yummy eggs and make myself some sandwiches,” he says. Will that be enough to get him over the next 20 days? He laughs. “Mom is there. But I do want to learn a dish or two,” he adds.

Ponniyin Selvan actor Ashwin Kakumanu is trying something a bit different. He is spending time glued in front of his computer, as he attempts to “brush up on using Final Cut Pro X”. With the Mani Ratnam film now standing postponed for a lot longer than expected due to the Coronavirus outbreak, the actor has found time to edit a pilot video he shot last year. “I had shot it as a concept. I was editing it, but got busy with becoming a father and then work.” He also has other plans. “I was going to start learning the guitar,” he says, adding, “The guitar has always looked cool and the sound of it is really romantic. I was supposed to learn playing the guitar for a project that got shelved. My father-in-law used to play it. I figured it would be a nice way to learn... from apps and watching YouTube tutorials.”

I’m exercising a lot, and experimenting with my fitness by learning CrossFit and focussing on my kick workouts. On the other hand, I’ve finally begun to learn to cook as well, starting off with simple recipes. I noticed a lot of people posting easy instructions for beginners in the kitchen to follow online, and really felt that I should take it up. It’s been surreal for me, as this lockdown feels almost exactly like my time in the Bigg Boss house! Sealed inside the house, with nobody but your family for company, and you cook, clean and fend for yourself: the only difference is that, thankfully, we have our gadgets here to be connected to the outside world. I have four films lined up this year, including Ivan Than Uthaman, the shooting of which was completed. We have to wait and see what happens with them; keeping fingers crossed!

Harish Kalyan, actor

I’m using this time to be productive and decided to take up cooking. I’ve started preparing my own dishes. It’s not like I don’t know the basics. But I want to try out something that’s a little more. For instance, I made some curries and had it with rice. I also made bread upma with eggs. I think it’s essential for people to learn the basics of cooking, at least for survival reasons. Cooking is definitely not an easy job. That’s what I’ve realised. Reading books is another thing I’m seriously giving a thought to. In fact, I’m literally forcing myself to take a book and have started reading after a long time. I think this quarantine period is going to change our lives for the better.

Shraddha Srinath, actress

I've been surprisingly leading a very disciplined schedule of late. I get a really good night’s sleep now, with no alarm, cause there’s no need to get up early! Then I ensure I work out twice a day: an intense session in the morning and a lighter one in the evening, getting my 10,000 steps in with a walk while maintaining social distancing of course.

I’m also really enjoying helping my mom in the kitchen and marvelling at her make her signature dishes; the plan is to start baking next as I’ve been really inspired by bakers I see on Instagram. In the evening, my whole family also bonds over movies and old Hindi songs. But my favourite activity during this lockdown is ultimately cleaning! I’ve been vacuuming the house thoroughly every day and it looks beautiful — it’s almost sort of therapeutic in a way — and I’m relishing this downtime.

As singers, we travel a lot, and we use that time for listening to various forms of music. But in those times, we don’t get the space to practise. I’m using this time to practise, practise and practise. When I have recordings, practise becomes difficult because my voice is under a lot of strain... but now, thanks to the free time, I can brush up my vocal skills. I have started revising some old varnams and keerthanams that I learnt when I was younger. I’m learning all these in the hope that someday soon, I will get to a stage where I can perform a full-fledged classical performance.

I don’t think I will ever make a documentary but I’m using this time to equip myself with a lot of research material from documentaries. I have a long watchlist of documentaries that have the potential to be turned into a dramatic story... so am ticking them all away now. In the pre-OTT days, accessibility to good quality documentaries was a challenge, but now, it’s just a click away. I feel that these documentaries are like reading books; you get more information in lesser time. I’m currently watching ‘Don’t F**K with the Cats’, a docu on someone killing a cat and how a group of people track him down. I have a huge watchlist from various subjects, mainly crime thrillers and historical subjects.

I’ve started painting again; it’s something I used to enjoy doing earlier and now I have the time to indulge in it. I’ve already posted a couple of my recent works on Instagram. Another interest of mine is yoga: in fact, I’ve always wanted to be a yoga teacher! So every evening, I’m doing a live on Instagram where I demonstrate basic poses — sun salutations — that even beginners can pick up. I’m making this a daily affair, and asking people to practise along with me. On the work front, there are two Telugu films currently stalled due to the lockdown, so here’s hoping things get sorted soon.

184,2020/03/26,"South Korean drama ‘My Secret, Terrius’ predicted the coronavirus pandemic, find Netflix users","After Steven Soderbergh’s ‘Contagion’, here comes a 2018 K-drama that has a plot point referring to the ‘mutant coronavirus’

With people across the world confined to their homes in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, several Netflix users, who have been binge-watching news shows, have come across a coincidence connecting the plot in a South Korean drama with the current pandemic affecting the globe.

My Secret, Terrius, which is a 2018 show available on Netflix in several countries (though not India) predicts the coronavirus outbreak in an episode in its first season. Earlier, Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 film Contagion, was also in the news, for having a similar storyline.

The synopsis of the South Korean show reads, “A secret agent who detaches himself from the world after a failed operation tries to unravel the mystery behind a neighbour’s death.”

This may come across as an intriguing murder-mystery, but in the tenth episode of the first season, Netflix users have identified that at 53 mins in, the plot comes to a discussion over the coronavirus, though there is no reference to the current COVD-19 that is causing the pandemic.

A doctor hands over some documents to another character, telling her, “We must do more research, but it looks like a mutant coronavirus.”

The other character responds: “Corona? Then MERS?”

“MERS, SARS, the common flu. They all fall in the same gene family with the same gene information. The coronavirus attacks the respiratory system. During the 2015 MERS epidemic, the mortality rate was over 20 percent,” says the doctor.

“But that’s not serious enough to be used as a weapon. Am I wrong?” asks the other person, to which the doctor states, “Like I said, this is a mutant virus. Someone tweaked it to increase the mortality rate to 90 percent.”

Understandably, after this footage found its way online, social media began trending My Secret, Terrius, and users across the globe began searching for the episode on Netflix. Some (like those in India) were left disappointed, while others added to their conspiracy theories.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/nv5mx3/article31173081.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/corona,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/south-korean-drama-my-secret-terrius-predicted-the-coronavirus-pandemic-find-netflix-users/article31173082.ece
185,2020/03/26,"Visu, a colossus","A tribute to the late Visu, writer-director-actor, who left his stamp in both theatre and cinema

News of the demise of veteran Visu plunged the Tamil film world in sorrow. Some of them share their association with the legend.

M. Saravanan, Producer, AVM Production house

Samsaram Adhu Minsaram, which Visu directed for AVM Productions, was the first Tamil film to get a gold medal at the National Film Award for the Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. It was destiny which brought us together because it was not planned. After finishing his work in Nallavanukku Nallavan, for which he wrote the screenplay, I gave him a double salary because the film had come out very well and was a huge success. He told me that he would rather make a film under the AVM banner than a double salary. I told him that if he could focus only on the AVM film, we could do it. He came back after some time with stories and I was keen on a family drama, which was his speciality. He did have a story, which I liked. The issue was it had already been made into a film and had failed. I told him that humour was missing and he could introduce it by bringing in the character of a maid servant. Visu returned with a modified script and my choice for the maid was Manorama. Visu now wondered how he could think of the story without that character. The rest, as they say, is history. Samsaram Adhu Minsaram was a silver jubilee hit. We gave him only Rs. 15 lakhs. He was able to finish the film with that money. Initially, no distributor came forward to buy the picture. But those who did eventually, did not regret. It earned them revenue ten times. We have lost a good friend, an excellent writer and fine director.

Actor-director Y.Gee. Mahendra

Visu was a simple giant. His association with UAA goes back to 1965-66, when Mouli joined too. We were staging “Kannan Vandhan.” Visu appeared in small roles in our plays, his major role being that of a journalist Meenjur in ‘Flight 172.’ We had spotted his talent and he always said that UAA was his launch-pad. His brothers Rajamani and Kishmu were very supportive and they were a close-knit family. Visu was very fond of my parents Y.G. Parthasarathy and Rajamma. He and Rajamani were YGP's blue-eyed boys. Visu wrote the script “Uravukku Kai Koduppom.” My mother liked it; so did I and agreed to direct it for him. It was with this play that Visu’s Viswa Shanti troupe was inaugurated. The play went on to win many awards and created waves. I directed one more play, “Eswara Allah Tere Naam” and after that he was on his own. He rose steadily as a writer-director, actor and conquered the middle class audience. To our family, however, he was the same Visu. In those days, I was a regular pillion rider on his Jawa motorbike. He never missed any of my plays and always followed it up with frank opinion. He was up to date even with my daughter's plays. Perhaps one of his last outings was the special screening of my movie, Shyama Ragam, a month ago. In spite of his deteriorating health, he attended the show and expressed his appreciation. Also, he gave some positive response to the movie in his TV bytes. To me, he said, “It is a good film. And I like it especially because it is a writer-director subject of which I feel proud.” Sad that I could not meet him after that. But I have such lovely memories of the 1960s and 70s, when Visu, Mouli and myself had a roaring time.

Director Kasturi Raja

I owe my career to him. I did not know anything when I came to Madras in search of livelihood. Cinema was my goal and I was exploring opportunities, when I met Visu. He asked me whether I was familiar with direction, I lied that I was. From his first film Manal Kayiru to Sakalakala Sambanthi, I worked with him. In the process, I learnt several things related to life too. It was to him I went with the cheque, when I was first engaged as a director for a film. Blessing me, he said, “Do not give false promise or hope to anybody. Because falsehoods are common in this field. I haven’t forgotten those words. People, who have stories, approach me for an appointment with my son Dhanush. I tell them that I’m not the right person for this. It may cause heart burn and they may not even believe me but that is the truth. Why mislead someone with false hope? I am proud to say that I learnt everything from my guru, Visu, who was a colossus.

Actor Rekha

I acted in four films under his baton — Mappillai Sir, Vedikai En Vadikai, Varavu Nalla Uravu and Kavalan Avan Kovalan — featuring leading artistes. He was a workaholic and his shooting spot was always serious, even if it was a comedy film. Meticulous in his planning, he hated wastage of any sort. His sharp story sense and the ability to make a tight script were his strengths. Even his dialogue was crisp. Comedy flowed naturally from his pen. I was very young and Tamil was not my mother tongue. So I found it difficult to speak his lines. After a couple of times, he would rewrite the lines on the spot. Such was his power. The Tamil film industry has lost a good director and script writer.

Actor Ananthi

I would always remember him as a person oozing with kindness. If somebody went to him with a problem, he would not rest until he found a solution. If it was beyond him, he would suggest the right person. In 1975-76, I acted in the play, “Easwara Allah Tere Nam,” written by him and directed by Y.Gee. Mahendra. After that, I acted in some ten plays, which he directed. When he started work on Manal Kayiru,” he asked me to dub for the heroine. In fact, he took almost all of his theatre friends with him during his film journey. His growth never affected that equation. On my side, all the milestones in my life happened with his blessings. On location, I once noticed that a boy seemed a little distracted. Some personal issue. Visu and that boy had a long conversation, when shooting was suspended. It was resumed only after some understanding was reached. In a couple of days, I came to know that Visu had sorted out the problem. He never spoke about it. Such was his integrity.

Actor Sivakumar

My homage to my friend:

After director K. Balachander, you were the one, who showed the middle class life in the right perspective on stage and also on cinema. Manal Kayiru and Samsaram Athu Minsaram showed your calibre. Through “Arattai Arangam,” you reached the mass. Young students in the villages got recognition and aid because of this platform. Both your daughters live abroad. You once told me, “If I die, I’ll be lying like an orphan, until they reach my side.” My friend, you were so noble, both were with you when your end came. Farewell my friend, extreme caution necessitated by the deadly Corona prevented me from paying my last respects to you. When will we meet again?

Actor Sachu

I was popular in cinema, more for my roles on the lighter side. I wanted to have a taste of theatre. After all so many stalwarts had come from drama and I wanted to test my prowess in a serious role. Vani Kala Mandir gave me the opportunity and I wanted actor and director Mouli to write a script for us. Mouli was busy and recommended young Visu, then an up-and-coming writer, mostly engaged with UAA. ARS corroborated the idea and Visu wrote a script titled, “Deviyar Iruvar,” which had a double role for me. First half was comedy and the second serious. His dialogue proved what a master he was in the art. So, I was the heroine for his first script. I did not act in his direction but we paired in the film, Vaimaiye Vellum. He often said that he wanted to be like Sachumma. What did he mean by that? He explained: “You are like a pillar to your family, making a sacrifice for their happiness. I want to emulate you.” True to that, he took care of all his brothers. When Krishnamurthy (Kishmu) died, he was shattered. All his heroines were ‘Uma,’ named after his wife, who lent him tremendous support. The Tamil film industry will miss a great dialogue writer and a director and I miss a friend, who was kindness personified.

Actor K.R.Vijaya

Visu liked my style of acting. I acted in three films, which he directed. One of them was Aval Sumangalithan. One with the legend Sivaji Ganesan and another Veedu Manaivi Makkal, which was the debut film of his assistant T.P. Gajendran. A master of the art of writing dialogue, he knew what lines would fetch applause from the audience. His instruction to me regarding Veedu… was to just appear for the shooting! He would take care of my acting. Besides, his screenplay and dialogue would do the work for him. And he did guide me. On the last day of the shooting, I told him that I had been a mere spectator at his shooting. When I saw the film, I realised the magic he had worked with my acting. I wanted to go and pay my respects to one of the brightest stars of Tamil cinema but the Corona scare prevented me from venturing out. But I certainly prayed for him.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/4hc4fr/article31172340.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27FRMANALKAYIRU,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/visu-a-colossus/article31172346.ece

From family drama This Is Us to crime series NCIS, audiences are flocking to television shows in numbers unseen for up to a year as coronavirus shutdowns and social distancing keeps millions of Americans at home.

Police action series NCIS scored its biggest audience since February 2019 on Tuesday night, attracting some 13.08 million viewers: a 22% increase over its last original broadcast on March 10, CBS said on Wednesday.

The Tuesday night season finale of heart-tugging NBC series This Is Us was the most-watched episode since September 2019 and saw a 21% increase in viewers aged 18-49 over the previous week, NBC said.

Audiences for the big four U.S. television networks — ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC — have been declining in recent years due to fierce competition from streaming, esports and social media.

U.S. movie theaters and Broadway theaters have been shut down for almost two weeks, and multiple U.S. states have ordered the closure of restaurants, bars, theme parks and concert venues in a bid to contain the coronavirus epidemic. There are now more than 60,000 cases in the United States and more than 880 deaths.

Streaming service Netflix Inc was also expected to be a major beneficiary of the stay at home directives. Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos told CNN on Sunday that viewing was up but gave no details. Netflix on Wednesday declined to comment on recent viewership.

However multiple shows on traditional television, including ”The Good Doctor” on ABC, “The Masked Singer” on Fox and “Survivor” on CBS are also seeing a surge in viewers, according to ratings data.

Data analytics company Nielsen said in a report last week that Americans are expected to watch as much as 60% more television across all platforms as increasingly restrictive shutdowns are implemented across the United States.

The increases are not just for escapist fare. Sunday's topical news show 60 Minutes reached 10.9 million viewers, its largest audience since December 2019, CBS said.

Cable channel HBO is seeing increases for shows like sci-fi series Westworld and for older fare like teen series Euphoria.

Time spent on the HBO Now streaming service since March 14 was up over 40% from a month prior, while daily binge viewing increased 65% compared with the prior four-week period, according to WarnerMedia.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/wvn7qm/article31170597.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thisisuss04e18still0,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/season-finale-of-this-is-us-most-watched-episode-since-september-2019-says-nbc/article31170598.ece

189,2020/03/26,"Nimmi, doe-eyed star of the 1950s, passes away at 88","She made her debut in Barsaat in a lead role opposite Raj Kapoor

Nimmi belonged to an era in Hindi cinema when actresses came with their own distinct adaa (style). Acting was all about quicksilver turn of expressions. A raised brow or the quiver of the lips could say it all. Nimmi was known for graceful presence, doe eyes that were a pool of emotions and a voice layered with gravitas.

One of the leading stars of yesteryears, Nimmi passed away in Mumbai on Wednesday at the age of 88.

She was born Nawab Banoo and it was filmmaker-actor Raj Kapoor who gave her the name Nimmi and introduced her on screen. She met him on the sets of Mehboob Khan’s Andaz, which is when he decided to cast her as the second lead in Barsaat. Her debut performance as a naive shepherdess in love with a reckless city slicker went on to define her persona. She came to be identified for a unique air of melancholy and intensity combined with charm, guilelessness and innocence.

Nimmi straddled genres and had a substantial number of hits (a clutch of them with superstar Dilip Kumar) to her credit but could not quite get her due. Despite successes like Aan, Deedar, Daag, Amar, Kundun, Uran Khatola and Basant Bahar, she didn’t get counted in the top league of Meena Kumari, Nargis and Madhubala.

Family friend and music director Madan Mohan’s daughter Sangeeta Gupta, who also acted with her in Bhai Bhai, remembers her as an educated, well-spoken, sensitive and charming person. “She used to live across Madan ji’s music room and used to visit quite often,” she says.

Nimmi had slipped into obscurity after the death of her husband Ali Raza. It was a rare interview in 2013 (Guftagoo with Irfan) on Rajya Sabha TV that the reclusive star revealed lots of unknown facets about her personal and professional life. Like how at the London première of Aan she received four Hollywood film offers, including one from none other than Cecil B. Demille.

Lata Mangeshkar tweeted about working together on many films and remembered her as a well mannered, gracious lady. Actor Rishi Kapoor tweeted: “RIP. Thank you, Nimmi aunty, for all the blessings and love for Bobby on its première release. You were part of the RK family. Barsaat was your first film. Allah aapko jannat naseeb kare. Amen.”

Saira Banu tweeted through Dilip Kumar’s handle: “Dilip Sahab and I are feeling a deep sense of personal loss at the passing away of our beloved Nimmi ji. She was my elder and had always maintained close contacts with Sahab and I through her beautiful, loving, prolific, handwritten personal letters in Urdu. Nimmi ji spent good time with my mother Naseem Banu and through my mother and my husband, I built a bond with her. Such stalwarts are rare. Nimmi ji will be missed. May Allah bless her with Jannat.”

Amongst some of her most memorable songs was Jiya beqarar hai and an apt one for the moment Tum na jaane kis jahaan mein kho gaye.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/93z6fo/article31170157.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NIMMI,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/nimmi-doe-eyed-star-of-the-1950s-passes-away-at-88/article31170158.ece

191,2020/03/26,Move to dedicate Gandhi Hospital to COVID-19 cases,"Many departments to be shifted to Osmania General Hospital

Preparations are under way to dedicate the Gandhi Hospital exclusively for COVID-19 cases. Orders to this effect were issued by Telangana Health Minister Eatala Rajender who held a review meeting on Thursday to discuss the measures needed to be taken if the infection reaches Stage-3 (Community transmission)

Currently, it is in Stage-2, which is local transmission- a patient with no history of international travel but a contact of COVID-19 patient. Source of infection can be traced at this stage. If source of infection cannot be traced for large number of cases, it is community transmission.

In Telangana, at least six cases of local transmission were reported. The State government has increased surveillance to avoid further spread of the virus.

Mr Rajender along with health officials held discussions on hospitals, staff, medical equipment that would be required if the infection enters Stage-3.

Since three days, surgeries related to burns, trauma, emergency cases which were scheduled to be performed at Gandhi Hospital were shifted to Osmania General Hospital.

Director of Medical Education Dr K Ramesh Reddy directed superintendents of the hospitals to shift the remaining departments too from Gandhi Hospital. If there is further need, services from private hospitals and medical colleges will be utilised.

Though the official bed capacity of OGH is 1,168, a little over 1,300 patients are admitted at the hospital. However, after COVID-19 scare, the number of in-patients has come down to around 950. If the patients undergoing treatment under various speciality departments at Gandhi Hospital are shifted to OGH, additional equipment such as ventilators, infusion pumps, and others, have to be provided to the latter.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/nt0tqk/article31176591.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY27GANDHIHOSPTIAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/move-to-dedicate-gandhi-hospital-to-covid-19-cases/article31175902.ece
192,2020/03/26,State government sets up high-level panel to monitor prices,"Initiative to ensure availability of essentials

The State government has focused on measures to ensure availability of essential commodities in view of the lockdown to counter spread of coronavirus.

The high-level committee constituted to monitor prices under the chairmanship of Agriculture secretary B. Janardhan Reddy met here on Thursday to review the availability of commodities and monitor the prices at which they were being sold. The committee stressed the need for ensuring availability of vegetables and fruits besides creating awareness among people against wasting these essential commodities during critical times.

The normal requirement of vegetables was of the order of 22,000 to 24,000 quintals in the city and the arrival was around 21,954 quintals on Thursday indicating that there was no shortfall of supplies. The marketing department had been directed to accordingly organise as many mobile rythu bazars as possible to reduce density in the regular rythu bazars. As of now, 61 mobile rythu bazars had been pressed into service at 101 locations and their number would be progressively increased. The committee opined that these mobile rythu bazars should be permitted to charge ₹ 5 over and above the regular prices for their commodities. The committee directed the district collectors to constitute price monitoring committees at their level with immediate effect.

The committee had decided to encourage the weekly shanties in towns/cities as these would ensure reduction in density at regular rythu bazars. Towards this end, there was need for an integrated effort by all stakeholders including the police, marketing and horticulture departments that should work in tandem with the farmers and farm labour. This would also send a message that the government was committed to providing essential commodities at reasonable prices.

Steps should be taken to caution commission agents and traders against exploiting the situation and they should be warned that serious action would be taken against those found guilty of hoarding. Agriculture labour should be sensitised in the use of sanitisers while there should also be uninterrupted movement of vegetables. Accordingly, vehicles carrying essential commodities should not be stopped by police at inter-State borders.

Since transportation of vegetables was one-way activity, the police should not stop the empty vehicles that were returning after delivering the commodities at the designated markets. The GHMC, on its part, should coordinate with residents’ welfare associations in preparing route maps and identifying sales points while ensuring that social distancing was maintained at all these points.

Online service providers

The committee felt that Zomato, Swiggy and other online service providers should be encouraged to join hands in delivery of essential commodities. Super markets should be asked to use online service providers to send essential commodities. In addition, private entrepreneurs or persons interested in procuring vegetables in bulk quantities for select areas for mobile rythu bazars could contact the estate officers/secretaries of market committees for their requirements.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/3ynb0x/article31176560.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY27MARKET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/govt-sets-up-panel-to-monitor-prices/article31175728.ece
193,2020/03/26,Muslims told to perform Friday prayers in houses,"In the wake of 11 persons testing COVID-19 positive including 10 Indonesian preachers and one local person in Karimnagar town, MIM Karimnagar town president Syed Ghulam Ahmed Hussain has appealed to the Muslims including the youth to perform the Jama namaz on Friday at their respective houses instead of Mosques in Karimnagar town.

In a press note here on Thursday, Mr Ghulam Ahmed said that already three municipal divisions in Karimnagar town have been declared as ‘red zones’ to avoid the spread of the deadly virus. “At this juncture, it is better to avoid crowding at mosques by assembling in huge congregation for the prayers and spread the virus. Hence, I request you all to perform the Friday prayers at houses only and not to visit the mosques,” he appealed.

Reminding that several developed countries such as USA, Italy, and Spain etc were struggling to cope with the outbreak of the virus, he urged upon the Muslim youth not to make it mandatory for the Friday prayers in the mosques and perform the prayers in their respective houses to avoid the spread of the virus.

He also stated that the government had announced lockdown and is implementing curfew only to avoid the spread of the virus.

Adilabad Additional Collector G. Sandhya Rani on Thursday asked ration shop dealers in the district to ensure only 10 to 12 white card holders are given the 12 kg free rice every hour starting Friday. She said this was to avoid gathering of people at one spot as per the COVID-19 protocol.

During a video conference with fair price shop dealers, the Additional Collector said every day only 60 card holders need be given the rice. In tune with this, coupons should be distributed in every ward so that not all beneficiaries come to the shop at one go, she added.

The dealers were asked to keep ready soaps and sanitisers for the beneficiaries to wash hands before they touch the biometric machine. Social distancing between the card holders should also be observed, the Aditional Collector ordered.

In Nirmal, rice would be distributed between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m. the district has 2.4 lakh white ration card holders.

The distribution o rice has been deferred in Kumram Bheem Asifabad district for unspecified reasons.

195,2020/03/26,No ‘lockdown’ for oustees of Kondapochamma,"Mamidayala and Bahilampur villagers being shifted to new colony

In what could be termed as a surprise move, some of the oustees from both Mamidayala and Bahilampur villages are being vacated by the authorities. This despite the lockdown announced by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao.

Both these villages are getting submerged under Kondapochamma reservoir. Oustees of Thanedarpally tanda and Thanedarpally were already shifted to new houses at Tunkibollaram.

On March 22, the nation observed Janata Curfew and the lockdown was extended till March 31 by Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao. Incidentally, getting people vacated from their homes and shifting them to new colonies has been taking place in the constituency being represented by him.

Under pressure

The oustees from both the villages informed The Hindu that they are being shifted from the village for the past two days. They are experiencing the pressure from the authorities and vacating the villages even during ‘lockdown.’ “No one dares to speak to the media. Some of those who filed cases in the court for right compensation are also not ready to express themselves. Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has asked people to isolate themselves in houses, but here, in our villages, all those regulation are floated,” said B. Venkatarama Reddy, mandal parishad president from Bahilampur.

Pointing out at the large number of vans parked on the outskirts of village, he said that this shows the involvement of officials in forcing the oustees get vacated during the lockdown period. He said that even the government school in the village was dismantled on Tuesday.

“All of them vacating the village were already allotted houses at Tunkibollaram Rehabilitation and Resettlement Colony, and some of them even got them modified. They want to spend the Telugu New Year in their new houses and hence are voluntarily moving to new houses. We have no role in this,” said an officer on condition of anonymity.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/no-lockdown-for-oustees-of-kondapochamma/article31169405.ece
196,2020/03/26,The making of meaning during Corona,"When the Hindi film Dr Kotnis Ki Amar Kahani was made in 1946, India-China friendship was central to it. Human beings keep trying to narrativise natural catastrophes, constantly make meaning, and the meaning is usually associated with the dominant ideology

The Coronavirus crisis underway may be too frightening for us to invoke cinema to talk about it, but cinema mythologises illness and reveals, when interrogated, dominant attitudes towards sickness and infection. In her essay ‘Illness as Metaphor’, Susan Sontag deals specifically with tuberculosis (in the past) and cancer (in the present), what they mean to people in the light of the narratives constructed around them. She notes that no one conceals a severe cardiac problem from a patient but cancer is hidden from sight. “Cardiac disease implies a weakness, trouble, failure that is mechanical; there is no disgrace, nothing of the taboo that once surrounded people afflicted with TB and still surrounds those who have cancer.”

Rather than examine the new epidemic it may be preferable to look at a few films first. To consider just a handful, let us first take V. Shantaram’s Dr Kotnis Ki Amar Kahani (1946) about an Indian doctor who went to China to help the Communists against the Japanese army, to help the wounded when there was a scarcity of doctors and the film is more about professional dedication rather than illness. The Wikipedia entry for Dr. Dwarkanath Kotnis notes that he married a Chinese girl, developed epilepsy because of the strain he underwent and later succumbed to it. In the film, Dr. Kotnis fights plague and, when he is unable to find a cure, he injects himself with the contents of a patient’s pustules in an effort to find antibodies, and eventually dies of plague after doing yeoman service to the Chinese. Regardless of the bald facts of the actual case, it would be deeply poetic for someone martyred to the cause he or she is serving. The cause in 1946 was Indo-Chinese friendship which went sour in 1962.

When Dr. Kotnis went to China travel was slow and infection could only travel at the speed of a steamer, by which time the virus would be out-of-date; but in the global age, air travel by so many passengers means that people on opposite sides of the planet can catch an infection from each other, in a matter of hours. Then there are also the stories around bio-weaponry that no one really understands and the issue of diseases crossing over the species barrier, animals infecting human beings. COVID 19, it is generally rumored, originated in bats, treated as a delicacy by the Chinese people and that is how the Coronavirus began its spread. Films about infection and sickness also give the lie to Western rhetoric that every life is equally valuable and that was confirmed when Trump offered money to a German pharma company for exclusive use of a vaccine, when the whole world was under threat of infection.

In the film Outbreak (1995), an African disease resembling Ebola is carried by a monkey to the US where it begins to infect a huge number of people in a small town in California. In accordance with the above mythologies around unknown diseases, the virus – appropriately from darkest Africa – is sought to be preserved by the military, to be used selectively as a biological weapon. The military doctor played by Dustin Hoffman does his best to find the antibody, but he is consistently thwarted by his villainous superior (Donald Sutherland) and the protagonist’s wife herself contacts the disease. After overcoming the villain’s plan of bombing the town to destroy the virus and incinerate its inhabitants, the town is saved from the disease in the nick of time when the original monkey is caught and the antibody found. What I found interesting in the film’s conclusion was that even as everyone is celebrating the happy outcome, no one seems to care that the disease is still raging in Africa.

Contagion (2011) is a more recent film in which the virus is caused by an amalgam of genetic material from bats and pigs and could be a bioweapon to be used by terrorists on Thanksgiving weekend. In this film, a married woman has sex with her former lover, and she and her son fall sick and die, leaving her husband (Matt Damon) only to deal with his own teenage daughter. Having to deal with a stepson would be inconvenient for the story and he is sacrificed. Hollywood treats marital vows as sacrosanct and one can see in the adulteress’ death by the virus a dire warning to all those who choose to stray. At the end of this film, the infection is shown to spread in an Asian rainforest, far away from Western civilization. There is asymmetry in the film’s concerns and Asia is ‘elsewhere’.

We see that when films try to make narratives around infection and disease, they tend to promote ideologies and political viewpoints. Regardless of the fact that most new infections have unknown causes and their progress cannot be charted ‘meaningfully’, the tendency is to try and find comfort in such ‘meaning’, like upholding a moral viewpoint of holding the citizens of one country more deserving of being saved.

It is difficult to construct such immediate meaning out of the Coronavirus, which is infecting those accustomed to air travel first. The slums, which suffer the most and usually earliest are relatively safe for now. It is an infection which is beginning at the top although it could work its way downward as time goes on. A factor that is difficult to make sense of is that it began in China but, while it rages in Italy and frightening western Europe, China seems to be back on its feet. The question that naturally occurs to oneself is, if China was able deal with the disease and its spread, why are the more advanced countries panicking and succumbing? Another factor difficult to explain is the disproportion between number of cases and number of deaths depending on the country we are talking about, although that could change. In China about 4 per cent of those infected died while in Italy it is nearly 10 per cent. Of course, some countries were affected much later and casualties could mount, but the disproportion is still striking. Coronavirus is highly contagious but it is not as lethal as some earlier diseases; given this factor are not the containment measures likely to be brutal on poor people less affected by the infection?

The last paragraph was to demonstrate how difficult it is to make meaning out of a catastrophe like the Coronavirus pandemic if all its facts were taken into consideration. But human beings keep trying to narrativize natural catastrophes, constantly make meaning, and the meaning is usually associated with the dominant ideology. It is too early to speculate on the narratives that will be constructed around the Coronavirus pandemic but the fact that it originated in China but affected the developed countries most severely will certainly be taken into account. Perhaps there will be a conspiracy film from Hollywood suggesting that China deliberately did it to counter the economic war Trump is trying to wage against it because, if it is doing anything most definitely, it is turning the world economy upside down.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/ilnexu/article31174987.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGF06FR-LVIJAYALAKSHMI1JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/the-making-of-meaning-during-corona/article31174991.ece
197,2020/03/26,How this Kerala visual artist captures different aspects of the Coronavirus outbreak,"Graphic art series ‘Meanwhile in Kerala’ is Unnikrishna Menon Damodaran’s cheeky and succinct depiction of life in Kerala. His latest ones are about life in the time of the virus

Crisp, irreverent and political, visual artist Unnikrishna Menon Damodaran’s graphic art strip ‘Meanwhile in Kerala’, depicts different aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala in a single frame. Begun on March 9 on his Instagram account @unnikrishna, it is a satirical take on the way people navigate the problem.

Having worked in Bahrain for the last 27 years as a digital specialist for a multi-national payment company, UMD, as he calls himself, has cheeky takes on contemporary political and social life in Kerala. An alumnus of the College of Fine Arts, UMD calls himself a “designer and visual artist with a dissenting diction”. He blends typography, drawings and witticism in English and Malayalam.

Excerpts from an email interview with the artist…

How long have you been doing ‘Meanwhile in Kerala’ and why did you start this?

It all started with social media from 2008. Being a visual artist it is imperative to show the work you are creating. I started creating a verbal-visual expression of a single word in Malayalam that we often use in our daily life. Some struggled to read it, some ignored it, but I kept sharing it. I called it “strange word picture”. And it evolved over time.

Editorial friends of Malayalanadu Online Web Journal were interested in sharing my work on their website and I became committed to creating my dissenting visuals almost every week. I had developed the habit of watching the daily news after work and that motivated me to start creating an opinionated visual, very much in keeping with my graphic-visual literacy. But I have retained my strong interest and sense of visual elements and never compromised on it. No re-drawing and no reworking; all my work is just organic as it comes out. Initially, there was no reaction to my work. But I kept on doing it. Engage, ignore or do whatever you like was my policy and I am still on it.

I was (am still) reacting to Kerala’s political-cultural moments within the constraints of Instagram’s square boxes. No out-of-the {Instagram} box claims here! Visually very typographic and, at times, pun intended, reactions, responses and, rarely revolting, but dissenting comments on the eventful daily life of Malayalis in Kerala and across the world.

This live collection of graphic messages explores the daily life of Malayalis that engaged, altered or influenced the key moments created by Malayalis themselves!

Your recent ones are on the Malayali’s change in life because of the COVID-19 outbreak. How much time do you spend on it and what is it that motivates you to put this up?

As usual, we did not bother much and waited for it [Coronavirus] to reach Kerala. I was like that too as I was only focusing on issues in Kerala, and then came the news that about three people from Italy and their doings in Pathanamthitta. As COVID-19 is a contagious disease, I kept watching its spread across the world and how Malayalis were taking it.

As the news develops, I start with the headline and based on that my visual follows quite organically. I spend about two to three hours for a post as I do a lot of self-editing before it is posted. So sometimes, it may take more time.

Why do you call yourself ‘Designer of the Dissent’?

That is still my claim. We know how great designs successfully sell big fat lies and we also know the whole process of selling, branding and commodifying that all design usually is. The progressive power of political graphic design - especially in these times of dissent – is what provides a spark of consciousness of human life, social justice and struggle to the exercise.

However, first we must realise that designers are problem-solving professionals, not just people who make things look good and glamorous. It is our responsibility to question, challenge and communicate the problem and dissent, wherever necessary, to protect those freedoms and interests we value so much.

Unnikrishna Menon Damodaran’s graphic art in his series ‘Meanwhile in Kerala’ on social media | Photo Credit: special arrangement

We create visual and verbal cultures that creates a resonance in others and that can only be achieved within a culture that welcomes dissent. But what is important is that ‘design dissent’ should be about improving situations as design should ultimately be about making things better and not spreading hate. So my claim as designer of the dissent is an ongoing process and it evolves as society changes.

Any plans of a book or an e-book for ‘Meanwhile in Kerala’?

Of course, I am waiting for a publisher.

198,2020/03/26,First COVID-19 case in U.P.’s Baghpat,"The first case of COVID-19 in Baghpat has increased the danger of community transmission of the virus.

“A resident of a village in Baghpat who had recently returned from Dubai has been found positive for COVID-19. He said he travelled by bus from Delhi to Baghpat. As he doesn’t remember the number of the bus, it is becoming difficult to conduct tracing, increasing the danger of community transmission,” R.K.

199,2020/03/26,NE eyes retired doctors as combatants,"Medical and nursing students in their final year also being roped in for emergency

Doctors are being called out of retirement and medical students roped in as the north-eastern States prepare stadiums and school buildings to be used as quarantine centres for suspected Covid-19 cases.

The Mizoram government has recalled retired doctors and paramedics in view of the shortage of manpower in combating the pandemic.

“We are collecting details of the retired doctors but will use their services only when a major crisis arises,” the State’s Principal Director of Health, F. Lallianhlira said.

In Assam, the government has decided to use the services of MBBS and nursing students in their final year of study for meeting emergency needs.

“There are 700 final year MBBS students in Assam’s medical colleges and about 2,000 final year nursing students who have three-four months of course left. They are more or less doctors and nurses. We have prepared a training module for them from tomorrow (Friday) or day after (Saturday),” Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.

Besides, private hospitals have offered the services of young doctors who have returned after medical studies from outside Assam, he added.

Mr Sarma said the government has been readying two multi-purpose stadiums in Guwahati to be used as quarantine centres for suspected Covid-19 cases. Among those to be shifted to these centres are about 700 people who are stranded on the Assam-West Bengal border, and not allowed to enter until a proper arrangement is made for them.

No positive case

Of the 210 suspected cases in Assam so far, none has tested positive, officials said.

In Manipur, the government’s move to use some schools as quarantine centres has come in for criticism. The opposition Congress has advised using some vacant hotels instead.

“In schools, people quarantined will end up sharing the same hall, classroom or toilet. Hotel rooms with attached toilet is a safer option,” Congress spokesperson N.

200,2020/03/26,Haryana CM promises early procurement of mustard crop,"‘If the situation is favourable, it will start from April 15’

Amid rising fears among farmers over crop loss by a delay in harvest on account of the ongoing lockdown, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday said “if the situation is favourable” his government would start purchase of mustard from April 15 and wheat from April 20.

“As it is not possible to make procurements till April 14, we have made arrangements for the procurement of mustard and wheat starting April 15 and April 20, respectively, if the situation is favourable,” he said. He said till then the farmers should stock the grain in their homes. “There is no need for the farmers to worry as each and every grain will be bought. Though there might be a delay in the procurement, but purchase will be done.”

He said in case any farmer was having trouble doing it, the Marketing Board has been directed to look into the matter. “To make up for the loss that the farmers will face due to delay in procurement and the lockdown, a new scheme will be announced by the government soon,” he added.

‘Aid for labourers’

Mr. Khattar said extensive arrangements have been made through the district and police administration to deliver all essential commodities to the people. “Arrangements have been made to provide financial assistance to labourers and BPL families, including daily wagers, labourers and construction workers,” he said.

He said a new website covidssharyana.in has been started from where grocery dealers, vegetable, milk sellers and chemist can register themselves for home delivery of commodities. “E-passes will be issued to those who register on this website,” he added.

Amid a few incidents of excesses against citizens in Punjab for the enforcement of the curfew, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday directed the police to be more sensitive in dealing with violations.

Urging the police personnel to exercise maximum restraint in the difficult situation, the Chief Minister asked them to find more compassionate ways of handling curfew violations, especially in cases of individuals found moving out for essentials.

“Use of corporal means to punish violators could not be allowed,” said Captain Amarinder, directing DGP Dinkar Gupta to take all possible steps to sensitise the personnel and warn them against taking the law into their hands in dealing with cases of curfew violation.

Captain Amarinder also took note of reports of a recorded telephonic message purported to have been released by Gurpatwant Singh Pannu of the Sikhs For Justice, and said any attempt by him or anyone else to provoke the youth of of the State to violate the curfew would not be tolerated.

‘Zero tolerance’

202,2020/03/26,Manipur MLA ‘willing’ to resign from House,"Apex court stricture against him

Manipur legislator Thounaojam Shyamkumar has officially intimated Assembly Speaker Yumnam Khemchand of his “willingness” to resign from the membership of the House.

The Supreme Court on March 18 had banned the Minister and BJP MLA – against whom multiple disqualification petitions were pending – from entering the Assembly. The court also ruled that he would cease to be a Minister immediately. The Speaker’s tribunal had also heard the case and reserved the verdict till March 28.

A brief letter of Mr. Shyamkumar, which was submitted on Thursday, does not furnish any reasons.

Congress members K. Meghachandra and Fazur Rahman had filed a petition to the Speaker praying for the disqualification of Mr. Shyamkumar, arguing that he had violated the provisions of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution.

Mr. Shyamkumar was elected in the 2017 Assembly election on a Congress ticket. However, he joined the BJP even before he was sworn in as a member of the Assembly. He was made a Cabinet Minister.

The fate of seven other Congress MLAs who had also joined the ruling BJP is still awaited.

203,2020/03/26,Govt. swings into action as nine cases strike Indore in two days,"Odd-even road-rationing scheme rolled out in the city

As nine COVID-19 positive cases strike Indore in two days, the most populous city in Madhya Pradesh, government officials grappling with spiralling cases have declared the area within the 3-km radius of houses of the cases as ‘containment areas’, and are rolling out the odd-even road rationing scheme in the district from Saturday.

While four cases were reported on Wednesday, five were reported on Thursday, necessitating the action. The State’s only COVID-19- related death — a 65-year-old woman from Ujjain — on Wednesday also occurred in Indore.

Within the containment areas around the nine ‘epicentres’, all residents will have to go into home quarantine and traffic will be prohibited. Besides, the area within the 5-km radius of the ‘containment’ area has been declared ‘buffer’ zone, according to an order issued by District Collector Lokesh Kumar Jatav.

For each ‘containment’ area, a rapid response team, comprising doctors and paramedics, among others, will be deployed, who will monitor suspected cases. At every exit point, health officials will screen persons. Moreover, they will follow-up with every person in home quarantine every day. The Municipal Corporation will sanitise the area.

As per another order, Mr. Jatav has rolled out the road-rationing scheme starting with allowing vehicles having only odd-numbered plates from March 28. Every third day traffic will be prohibited. In addition, every person stepping out to buy provisions should have face covered.

On Thursday, five residents of the district tested positive for the viral disease, taking the count of active cases in Madhya Pradesh to 19.

“Five persons had tested positive in the first lot on Wednesday, and another five later,” Mr. Jatav said.

‘No travel history’

The first four cases from Indore had no travel history, he confirmed. “We’re still finding out if the new cases had travelled abroad.”

Two men aged 35, a man aged 38 and a woman aged 55 had tested positive, said an official of the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College, Indore, where 10 of the 70 samples tested turned out to be positive.

Five fresh COVID-19 positive cases were detected in Rajasthan on Thursday, taking the total number of cases to 43. Two of the cases are from Bhilwara and one each from Jaipur, Jhunjhunu and Jodhpur. A 73-year-old man, who was in coma due to kidney failure and had later tested positive for the virus, died in Bhilwara.

Additional Chief Secretary (Medical & Health) Rohit Kumar Singh said here that the senior citizen, who died in Bhilwara, was admitted in a state of coma from March 3 to 11 in a private hospital where three doctors were later found COVID-19 positive.

During the contact tracing, his samples were obtained and he tested positive for the virus.

“The deceased was in coma before the coronavirus spread in Bhilwara. His death occurred because of kidney failure and brain stroke, and not due to COVID-19. He was in coma since March 3 with a history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease,” Mr. Singh said.

Former chief minister Kamal Nath appealed to Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to extend a monthly relief of at least ₹7,500 to each farmer for the next two months in view of the lockdown imposed to contain the COVID-19 threat.

Stating that rabi crop harvest and sale had already begun, Mr. Nath wrote to Mr. Chouhan: “Several crops like wheat, peas, coriander, mustard and gram etc are in the state of harvest but due to the lockdown the harvest is not being possible and a possibility of the crop damage is created.”

In addition, he said, farmers who had already harvested crops were facing storage issues. “In many districts, harvested vegetables are kept in fields and are reaching the stage of getting damaged, as there are no arrangements for transport or sale of vegetables owing to the lockdown,” he added.

The situation was no different in the case of fruits, he pointed out. “For instance, if orange is not plucked in time, it will start rotting after a period. The situation has further worsened owing to untimely rain.”

Mr. Nath said, “To give relief to farmers, it is important that the State government makes arrangements for the harvest, plucking, storage, transport and sale of vegetables, crops and fruits.”

With two new confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported in Punjab on Thursday, the number has climbed to 33. The government has decided to de-congest its prisons by releasing around 6,000 prisoners.

The State Health department said one of the two, a woman from the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district, is a close contact of a positive case. The other patient is from Jalandhar with a travel history.

Prisons Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa said the Supreme Court had constituted a High Powered Committee under the chairmanship of Chairperson, Punjab Legal Services Authority, with the Principal Secretary (Jails) and the ADGP, Prisons as members.

“The committee has circulated detailed criteria and procedure to initiate the release of prisoners. Convict prisoners will be released on parole and under-trial prisoners on interim bail for six weeks,” said Mr. Randhawa.

209,2020/03/26,Coronavirus lockdown | Bamboo barricades hit essential services in rural northeast,"A health team in Manipur’s Tamenglong district ran into one such barricade. Residents of Matung village refused to remove the bamboo barricade and let their vehicle carrying life-saving drugs pass.

Bamboo, the ‘golden grass’ vital for all aspects of life across the northeast, is now being used by local residents in the region’s rural areas for erecting makeshift barricades that have impacted the delivery of essential services and goods during the ongoing nationwide lockdown.

Arterial corridors in some of the region’s hill districts have been cut off by barriers made of bamboo and thorny vines that the locals have used to block roads leading to their villages. This has affected the supply of essentials and medicines by local authorities.

A health team in Manipur’s Tamenglong district ran into one such barricade. Residents of Matung village refused to remove the bamboo barricade and let their vehicle carrying life-saving drugs pass.

“The vehicle was forced to return to (district headquarters) Tamenglong avoiding more such barricades elsewhere,” the district’s Chief Medical Officer Chambo Gonmei told newspersons.

The Food Corporation of India has also been facing problems in accessing some of its depots because of barricades by people of some leikais (localities). Some of the corporation’s trucks have as a result been stranded at Jiribam, Koirengei and other strategic places.

In Arunachal Pradesh, many villages and localities have hemmed themselves in with bamboo barricades. Ganga in the State capital Itanagar is one such locality where the predominantly Nyishi community has pasted instructions barring the entry of outsiders. Even grocery shops in the locality have been allowed to open for only three hours a day.

The scene is similar at Boha and Painaktang villages in West Kameng district inhabited by the Monpas. “It is crucial for our minuscule community not to be affected by the killer virus,” said A. Sang, a Boha village elder.

The scenario is similar in Assam. Villages such as Laopati in Tinsukia district and Kolajan Peeyang in Dhemaji district have not only barricaded themselves but also armed small squads of locals with bamboo sticks to keep unwanted visitors and “potential virus carriers” out.

In Nagaland, there have been instances of villagers passing “laws” not to allow entry to even their own people who have returned from studies or jobs from other coronavirus-hit parts of India.

But several other rural communities have been more accepting of their own. Lothavi village in Dimapur district recently welcomed nine boys who returned from Bengaluru. The villagers have had them quarantined in a sanitised community hall and have been providing their basic needs.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bwgrhu/article31174219.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200326-WA0023,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-lockdown-bamboo-barricades-hit-essential-services-in-rural-northeast/article31174220.ece

The Samajwadi Party has withdrawn its application seeking disqualification of its senior leader Shivpal Singh Yadav from the Uttar Pradesh Assembly under the anti-defection law.

Leader of Opposition and senior SP leader Ram Govind Chaudhary on Thursday said he has written a letter to Uttar Pradesh Assembly Speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit, withdrawing application seeking disqualification of Shivpal Yadav.

When asked if this could lead to Shivpal Yadav returning to the SP in the future, Mr. Chaudhary said “anything is possible in politics”.

In September last year, the SP had moved an application seeking disqualification of Shivpal Yadav from the State Assembly under the anti-defection law.

Mr. Dey, who owns State’s second largest circulated vernacular daily Syandan Patrika also informed of sending most of staff on leave.

He said leaders of Tripura Patrika Bikreta Samity, apex body of newspaper hawkers, complained of harassment by police and residents at different localities over the past few days. Hawkers were even denied entry in some localities, he pointed out.

“After due consideration we have decided to stop printing up to March 31 and hope to go for print on April 1. However, it depends on certain issues, including health scenario and government restrictions,” he added.

CM flags off 50 ELS ambulances

“Life support ambulances are dedicated for the healthcare of the 37 lakh people of the State” Mr. Deb said, adding that people should dial 102 if they needed any emergency assistance.

Officials said the government spent around Rs 50 crore for procuring the ambulances.

According to the family, the patient had travelled to New Delhi and Uttar Pradesh with the Tabligh-i-Jamaat, a religious group that preaches Islam. The Jamaat activities were attended by people from Malaysia and Indonesia, the family added.

“A report further reveals that the patient, who was later tested positive for COVID-19, has not been handled as per the protocol required for treating such patients,” the order reads.

Negligence, says official

There are fears that the patient was allowed enough time to spread the virus by intermingling with the public and relatives. “The negligence at the hands of hospital administration has resulted in a lot of confusion and vulnerability among masses,” an official said.

The Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Government Hospital in Jaipur is conducting a series of trials on a humanoid robot to check if could be pressed into service for delivering medicines and food to the COVID-19 patients admitted there, helping to keep the doctors and nursing staff at a safe distance to protect them against the dreaded coronavirus.

A committee of experts, which saw the demonstration on Thursday, will shortly submit its report on a proposal to use the robots to serve the patients admitted to the hospital’s isolation ward, SMS Hospital’s Medical Superintendent D.S. Meena told The Hindu. SMS Hospital is the biggest government hospital in the State.

Mitigating risk

Dr. Meena said that since there were higher chances of the medicos and paramedical staff being infected with the virus despite wearing protective gear like masks and gloves, it would be a good idea not to get in touch with the patients frequently and instead use robots for rendering some of the essential services.

A Jaipur-based entrepreneur, manufacturing robots indigenously at his assembling unit, has offered to supply them free of cost to the hospital as part of a corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative to help out both the patients and the staff. The robot sent to the hospital is battery-operated and has a life span of four to five years.

The humanoid robot, which uses artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT), has been designed with a tray which can be used for carrying medicines, food and other objects to the assigned patients. It can navigate its own way without the instructions to follow lines on the floor.

He said the robots could also be easily disinfected and used multiple times inside the high-risk isolation ward.

In addition to the establishment of a fully equipped isolation ward, the SMS Hospital has converted Charak Bhawan on its premises as the corona outpatient department and care unit.

“Three more persons tested positive for coronavirus in the State on Wednesday night,” All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Raipur, Director Dr. Nitin M Nagarkar told PTI.

Of the three new patients, two men, one from Raipur and another from Bhilai (Durg), have been admitted to the isolation ward of AIIMS, he said.

As many as 83 junior doctors of the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) in Patna, which has been designated as the State’s first COVID-19 special hospital, have written to their superintendent seeking a 15-day home quarantine as many of them have developed symptoms of the viral disease in the absence of protective kits and masks.

Bihar has reported six positive cases and one fatality so far.

Coronavirus | Interactive map of confirmed cases in India

The NMCH junior doctors’ petition to the hospital superintendent has been forwarded to the Principal Health Secretary Sanjay Kumar. The junior doctors expressed serious reservation over the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), N-95 masks, gloves and protective gowns in the hospital.

“We’re on duty without all necessary kits and masks, which makes many of us vulnerable to infection...many of us have developed symptoms of COVID-19...but nobody is here to listen us,” said Ravi Ranjan Kumar Raman, president of the NMCH Junior Doctors Association.

“We face acute shortage of PPE kits, N-95 masks and other necessary protective gear ...we’re still waiting for these to come... till then we’re left to serve and die herewhen our principal is handling everything through videoconference,” they alleged.

Monetary incentive

On March 23, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had announced a monetary incentive equal to one month basic salary for doctors and paramedical staff for their contribution to fighting COVID-19. However, the junior doctors have written to the government to “utilise the money to provide them PPE kits and N-95 masks.”

The United Resident & Doctors Association of India has drawn the attention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a letter written on March 25, to the plight of the NMCH junior doctors.

“A recent incidence of Nalanda Medical College in Patna, Bihar has been brought to our notice where 83 resident doctors who had history of exposure to positive patients are now having symptoms and are suspected of being positive. No tests have been done, nor the said doctors have been quarantined which may complicate the situation. We request you to kindly direct authorities not to ignore such grievous situations”, the letter said.

Earlier, Bihar’s Principal Health Secretary issued a detailed advisory, subsequently supplemented with further advice, to the civil surgeons and DMs of all districts, putting response and recovery teams in place to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Facing acute scarcity of PPE kits and N-95 masks, the government has asked doctors to use HIV protection kits. “But, the HIV protection kit does not fully cover the face up to the neck as compared to the triple layered N-95 masks... it also does not have goggles to protect the eyes,” the doctors said.

However, doctors from all the nine State-run medical colleges and hospitals, which are mapped for screening COVID-19 cases, have lamented that they face acute shortage of PPE kits, N-95 masks, shoes, gowns, gloves, even sanitizers and other necessary gears to deal with the situation.

The government, meanwhile, has asked Jeevika workers to prepare nasal masks of cloth and permitted a factory in Vaishali district to produce sanitizers.

The government on Thursday, though, announced a ₹100-crore package from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund for those from the State stranded across the country due to the lockdown.

226,2020/03/26,"Coronavirus: Under lockdown, Manipur running out of essential commodities","Some grocery shops which used to sell rice and flour through the backdoor have closed down as stocks had run out

Prices of all essential commodities have been hiked unreasonably in Manipur which is under a lockdown to check the spread of COVID-19. Some media reports quoted people as saying that rice and flour were not available. Some grocery shops which used to sell these items through the backdoor, in view of the curfew restrictions, have closed down as stocks had run out. The government’s announcement that PDS rice for April will be distributed free of cost by March is yet to be translated into reality.

Soon after indefinite curfew was clamped, Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren Singh said: “The curfew will be in force for some time and people should stay indoors. There will be no shortage of essential items. While inter-State bus services are suspended trucks transporting essential items will not be obstructed. People should also stop panic buying since there shall be no shortage”. However, ground realities are worrisome.

Some retailers say that the wholesale traders do not open shops as they do not have any stock now. A. Devika, a working woman, said, “Baby foods, including milk supplements, are out of stock. The shop keepers are yet to replenish their empty stocks”. Prices of onion, potato and other essential items have become prohibitive.

Some weeks ago the government had announced the suspension of water supply as the rivers which are the main sources are bone dry. W. Lalit who has been selling raw water to the people at ₹200 per 1,000 litres in his water tanker said, “The government had shut down the water supply facility. The private businessmen also cannot supply to all the tankers. Now we are selling 1,000 litres of raw water at ₹400.” But the supply is likely to stop soon since there is no source.

Some pharmacies are open for certain hours in the urban areas. Chonjon, a pharmacist in the Imphal west district, said, “Our stock is dwindling since the wholesalers cannot open shops. Baby foods, medicines and life saving drugs are out of stock”.

Following erratic rains and drought-like situation last year, the price of tasty and nutritious Manipuri rice was hiked at ₹52 a kg. Several persons say that in view of the curfew they cannot buy rice even at this extortionate price. Though Prime Minister Narendra Modi had spelled out the guidelines during the 21-day lockdown these are hardly implemented in the curfew-bound Manipur.

Meanwhile, official sources said that out of the 176 co-passengers of the Manipuri girl afflicted with COVID-19, 133 persons are now quarantined in 10 centres. They had travelled together in an Air Asia flight from Kolkata to Imphal via Agartala on March 21.

Local officials said over 5,000 motorcycles have left Surat. “Migrant workers from diamond and other sectors are leaving on motorbikes because factories are shut,” a senior official from Surat said.

From Ahmedabad too, thousands of migrant workers and daily wagers from the tribal belt of Gujarat and neighbouring Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan are leaving.

“We have reports of people leaving for their native places,” a State government official said. He added that police and some voluntary organisations are making arrangements for their food on highways as other places are closed due to lockdown.

In cities, all construction sites have been shut for indefinite periods, so more than 50,000 workers, mostly migrant labourers, have left for their native villages in the Godhara, Dahod districts of Gujarat, and Jhabua of Madhya Pradesh.

According to Gujarat Congress spokesman Manish Doshi, the Rajasthan government has made arrangements for migrant workers and hired buses to take them back.

The relief flights approved by the Indian government saw 249 tourists fly to Manchester, while another 121 left for Moscow.

The Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) said that it had launched a helpline (9921003568) for foreign tourists who are stranded in the coastal state and want to return.

TTAG president Savio Messais said that there were several foreigners, mostly from European countries like Germany, stranded in various parts of Goa. “Most of them have taken shelter along the coastal belt of the North Goa district in the Pernem taluka,” he said.

“The TTAG is hopeful of getting required permissions from the government after things normalise.

230,2020/03/26,Coronavirus | Madhya Pradesh govt. to give BPL families free ration for a month,"CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan announces worker welfare measures, advance pension, home delivery of medicines

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Wednesday announced that all Below Poverty Line (BPL) families would be provided a month’s ration free, in view of the lockdown. Mr. Chouhan further said ₹1,000 would be provided to labourers as support through the State Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board. Mr. Chouhan also announced ₹2,000 for two months to each Saharia, Baiga and Bharia family. Moreover, old age and social security pensioners would receive an advance amount of ₹1,200 for two months.

‘Not deadly’

“Coronavirus is not a deadly disease if precautions are taken. We have all the medical facilities. Whether at private or government-run hospitals, treatment for the disease will be provided free,” he said. “Payments to private hospitals will be done based on rates prescribed under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana.”

“As schools are closed, food items meant for children under the midday meal scheme can be collected from the public distribution system ration stores,” he said.

Even for daily wage workers and students, the government would arrange for food packets, he added. “I want to appeal to social workers that we need to arrange for food for students stranded in different cities and the poor, too,” he said.

Mr. Chouhan asserted that the government would not let there be a shortage of essential goods. “I have held a meeting with District Collectors and Superintendents of Police in this regard and given them directions,” he said.

As regards farmers, he said owing to the harvest seasons, threshers and harvesters had been allowed to operate. “And, of course, drivers will be screened for the disease too. My appeal to even villagers is to not step out.”

Home delivery

For the home delivery of medicines, he said, the government had deployed vehicles from all departments. “Remember, all kinds of cold, cough and fever are not due to coronavirus,” he said.

Pointing to reports of doctors and nurses being asked to vacate their apartments by landlords, he said this would not be allowed and action would be taken. “Selling anything over the MRP (maximum retail price) is also prohibited and we will take strict action against those who indulge in it,” he said.

The only way to contain the disease, he said, was to break the chain of contact. “Let’s not be scared but fight the disease,” the CM said.

232,2020/03/26,17 arrested in Odisha for taking out procession,"Seventeen participants of ‘Danda Nata’, a religious festival of penance, were arrested by personnel of the Purushottampur police station in Odisha’s Ganjam district.

They were arrested on Tuesday for taking out religious processions despite the lockdown in Ganjam district due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The arrested persons include ten members of Rajakpunja troupe from Purushosttampur and seven members of the Danda Nata troupe from Jamuni village.

The participants were arrested while taking out a procession to mark the beginnign of the 21-day Danda Nata that ends on Mahavishub Sankranti which falls on April 14.

Ganjam district administration had put a ban on the festival this year due to the virus outbreak. All Danda Nata troupes had been made aware of the dangers of celebrating the festival and were asked to refrain from observing it this year.

Every year, thousands of male devotees leave their homes to lead a nomadic life and join ‘Danda Nata’ troupes for 21 days till April 14. According to sources, there are around 200 Danda Nata troupes in Ganjam district. The smaller troupes have around 100 members, while the larger ones may have more than 1,000 members.

Apart from it, a team of around 30 to 50 persons related to the theatre troupe is attached to each Danda Nata troupe.

District administration had decided to completely stop the celebration as these troupes could have been a major catalyst for the spread of COVID-19 in Ganjam.

The two troupes, whose members were arrested, had also been made aware about a week back of the dangers by the Purishottampur tehsildar, the Block Development Officer and the local police station.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/17-arrested-in-odisha-for-taking-out-procession/article31168564.ece

234,2020/03/26,Lockdown in northeast as Manipur records first case,"Assam MLAs to donate salary for anti-virus fund; Meghalaya introduces odd-even vehicles formula

Assam became the last of the eight northeastern States to go into lockdown mode on Tuesday after a 23-year-old woman from Manipur became the region’s first to test positive for COVID-19 pandemic.

The woman was found infected with the virus on Tuesday morning following a medical examination conducted at a designated laboratory in Imphal’s Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences. Her parents, both college lecturers, and other family members of an upscale locality in Imphal West district have been quarantined with the police cordoning off the house.

U.K. student

Officials in Manipur said the woman, a student of biomedicine at Bristol University in United Kingdom, had arrived in Kolkata via Delhi on March 19. Her 14-year-old brother joined her in Kolkata from Atlanta, U.S. Both stayed in a hotel in Kolkata and arrived in Imphal on March 21 by a flight via Agartala, Tripura.

Last week, the Manipur government had made a list of 99 people who had arrived from various coronavirus-hit countries and were prescribed home quarantine. The biomedicine student’s name was not on the list.

“She fell sick on Monday and was admitted to the hospital. We have taken away 12 members of her family and others she was in touch with and kept them under close observation,” said K. Rajo, the State’s Director of Health.

Reports suggest she had attended a wedding before she tested positive. The government is trying to get details of the passengers who had travelled in the same flight.

CM’s appeal

Hours after the woman tested positive, Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren Singh took to social media requesting the people to shut themselves in for their own good. “Please do not panic and cooperate with the government by extending support to the lockdown. I urge those who returned from foreign countries to honestly declare their travel history,” he said.

FIR against man

The authorities in southern Assam’s Hailakandi district filed an FIR against a man who had arrived from abroad on Monday but did not report his arrival at the nearest police station or health station as had been mandated.

“Departmental action for immediate suspension is also being drawn against the father, who is a government employee, for concealing information,” Deputy Commissioner Keerthi Jalli said.

Members of the family had misled the authorities by saying he would arrive after three days but an inquiry revealed he had already reached home. “He was detained and taken to Silchar Medical College and Hospital for screening,” the district’s Superintendent of Police Pabindra Kumar Deka said.

Officials said 721 people from across the district, who had come from abroad and other parts of India, have been home quarantined with stamping on hands.

Assam MLAs’ gesture

All 126 legislators in the Assam Assembly, cutting across party lines, on Tuesday pledged a month’s pay for a fund set up by Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal to combat COVID-19.

“We don’t know when the crisis would tide over, and whether we can cope financially. We are yet to devise a mechanism to provide relief for daily-wagers if the lockdown phase needs to be extended. We might have to use the money parked in the accounts for Ujjwala, labour welfare and tea plantation workers’ schemes,” Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.

The authorities in Meghalaya capital Shillong on Tuesday introduced the odd-even formula for private vehicles to enable people to fetch essentials. Such vehicles bearing even and odd registration numbers would be allowed to move within a limited area on even and odd dates.

The lockdown period in Meghalaya that began from 10 p.m. on Monday would continue till March 29 with a short relaxation of restrictions on March 26.

No newspaper delivery

The All Manipur Newspaper Distributors and Hawkers Association on Tuesday announced that it will stop delivering newspapers to homes and offices till March 31. The decision was taken after a police officer allegedly thrashed a newspaper delivery boy despite the latter displaying his identity card.

Delivery of newspapers is an essential service, according to a government notification on the services to be allowed during the lockdown.

235,2020/03/26,"Differentiation of goods as essential and non-essential would lead to chaos, Naveen tells Modi","Many people face difficulties in procuring essential items in Odisha

With the Odisha police strictly enforcing the 21-day-long lockdown on the first day on Wednesday to check the spread of the COVID-19, a large number of people faced difficulties in procuring essential items across the State.

With reports of scarcity of essential goods pouring in from various districts, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi stating that differentiation of goods as essential and non-essential would lead to discretion, corruption and dislocation at checkpost level. “It may lead to chaos and affect the movement of essential goods as well,” he said.

In fact, the shortage of essential goods had arisen in Odisha since the State government had ordered lockdown in five districts and eight urban centres from March 22, the day janata curfew was observed across the country.

Mr. Patnaik pointed out that there were “long queues extending to few kms at the inter-State borders”. “I am sharing this from our experience in handling natural disasters — whenever we have made a differentiation between essential and non-essential goods, the overall goods movement, especially of essential goods, gets affected,” he said.

Mr. Patnaik suggested that movement of goods may be permitted seamlessly across the country without any differentiation to avoid clogging which may adversely impact supply of essential goods.

On the other hand, in order to augment the health work force, the State government advertised to engage qualified specialists, MBBS doctors, staff nurses and other paramedics to serve the people on short term contract for three months.

The State government announced to pay salary of four months in advance to all doctors, nurses and paramedical staff in appreciation of the risk being taken by them to fight the pandemic.

The government informed that of the 133 samples sent for COVID-19 examination, reports of 129 samples had been received. The number of persons found to be positive continued to remain two.

So far, the State government has recorded arrival of 4,015 persons from abroad. More than 78,000 people working in other States have also returned to their homes in various districts and they have been advised to stay inside their homes.

236,2020/03/26,Punjab CM urges steps to evacuate pilgrims from Nanded,"Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has urged the Central and Maharashtra governments to evacuate pilgrims stranded at the gurdwara at Nanded in Maharashtra amid the lockdown to fight the coronavirus.

In a letter to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Captain Amarinder Singh said around 2,000 pilgrims from Punjab who had gone to the Hazur Sahib in Nanded. Hazur Sahib is one of the five spiritual and temporal centres of Sikhism.

With the cancellation of trains some days ago and the nationwide lockdown since Wednesday, they could not be brought to Punjab without the approval of the government of India, he said. He urged the Centre to consider evacuating them by special trains or flights at the earliest.

The Chief Minister wrote on Twitter, “Have written to @AmitShah Ji & Maharashtra CM @OfficeofUT to facilitate the evacuation of devotees stranded at Nanded Sahib Gurdwara. The pilgrims have been stranded there for long & we owe them safe return to their homes & families.”

237,2020/03/26,Pandemic throws life out of gear for Bhopal residents,"People came out on the roads, scrambling to grocery stores in preparation for the long haul

Lockdowns are not novel for Bhopal residents. Gas leak from the Union Carbide pesticide unit in 1984 pushed thousands to the city’s fringes, while the 1992 riots following Babri Masjid demolition crippled daily life and left streets deserted for days beneath a hazy sky filled with smoke.

But this time, the lockdown, necessitated by the COVID-19 scare, is different. Restraining outdoor activity and avoiding touch is coupled with the enduring uncertainty of its end and the lingering fear of the obscure disease, which is much scarier for its imperceptible ubiquity.

As Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared a nationwide lockdown from Tuesday midnight, Bhopal residents disgorged onto roads, scrambling to salvage groceries, medicines and dairy products from shops to prepare for a 21-day isolation, essential to contain the virus spread. Lights beaming from shops offered a glimmer of hope, contrasting with the harsh reality of lives turning upside down.

“Malik says this will continue for days, and we have to abide by government orders and stop work,” said Raju Kumar, a construction worker, who makes ₹350 a day.

“Ever since demonetisation, we have stopped saving cash anyway,” said Mr. Kumar, whose family is now dependent on neighbours for essentials.

The recent political turmoil delayed the necessary response to tackle the virus spread, as the State got lucky in bearing its share of the virus burden a little later. Still, numbers are spiralling, with 15 cases recorded in five days since March 20.

Fearing infection, more than 25 families have cancelled their newspaper subscriptions, rues Harbajan Vishwamitra, a large-scale vendor, who made ₹30,000 a month, but is incurring a loss of ₹5,000 now. “Many have asked my boys to leave the copies on tables they've placed outside doorsteps. They'll pick them after 12 hours once the virus perishes, they say.”

At a locality on the Kolar Road here, residents are wary of domestic workers crossing the doorstep. “We make sure our maid uses a hand sanitiser before entering, and our infant daughter doesn't come too close to her,” said Rahul Chouksey, a guest faculty member at a journalism university.

However, families are going a step further in another part of Bhopal - 11 Number Market - by saying no to domestic workers until the disease subsides. Dwarka Devi, 64, a domestic worker for 15 years, and who makes ₹5,500-6,000 a month, says, “They have asked me to stay away but I am not sure if I'll still get paid. My savings are drained, and this uncertainty makes it worse.”

Even Mr. Chouksey’s fate is no different. As a guest faculty member, he makes ₹350 for each of the four lectures every day and ₹ 200 as travelling and dearness allowance. Yet, no classes since March 16 mean no pay since then.

Admission anxiety

With the admission schedule pushed back, Smiti Johri, who completed MBBS from Mumbai and took a gap-year to prepare and take the NEET PG, is grappling with anxiety. “The counselling process is online, but there is uncertainty surrounding the date of joining,” she says, “Delaying it further might disturb the academic calendar and impair our chances of opting for a super speciality course later, which has a strict eligibility criteria.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ai40cj/article31168208.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE25-BHOPAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pandemic-throws-life-out-of-gear-for-bhopal-residents/article31168209.ece
238,2020/03/26,"Lockdown: Punjab, Haryana farmers worried over wheat harvesting","Steps for smooth operation of harvesting, procurement of the crop will be in place before the marketing season: State govts

With harvesting of wheat crop about to commence in the next few days in the key grain growing States of Punjab and Haryana, the farmers are a worried lot, fearing losses over delay in harvesting and procurement amid the ongoing lockdown.

The State governments, however, have stated that farmers need not fear as necessary arrangements for smooth operations of harvesting and procurement of the crop will be in place before the marketing season starts.

“My crop will be ready for harvesting in next 9-10 days, if the weather is clear. But I am nervous about how will I harvest my crop during the ongoing lockdown (curfew). So far there has been no notification issued by the government about the procurement dates,” said Sarvan Singh of Pandher Kalan village in Amritsar, who has sown wheat in five acres.

Mr. Sarvan said that farmers are willing to follow all precautions and regulations to curb COVID-19, but government should also immediately address the fear among farmers about incurring losses by losing the crop.

‘Hardship for farmers’

Gurmeet Singh of Bhattiwal Khurd village in Sangrur told The Hindu that wheat harvesting is mostly done by combine harvester, and if the curfew restrictions continued then it will bring hardship for every farmer.

“Government needs to immediately come out with a plan otherwise it would be a chaotic situation later on when the harvesting starts,” said Mr. Gurmeet, who has sown wheat in nearly 17 acres.

In Haryana's Shahbad, Rakesh Bains, who has sown wheat in his seven acres, said that if government procurement is delayed it will add to farmers woes. “First, there’s no clarity on any mechanism or guidelines being adopted by government for harvesting of the crop. Secondly, if mandis (yards) are not open then where will the farmer store the produce. It’s not easy for farmer like me to store the grain,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/lockdown-punjab-haryana-farmers-worried-over-wheat-harvesting/article31168203.ece

‘Difficult to make list’

Stating that it is difficult to prepare a comprehensive list of essential and non-essential goods and get it enforced practically at the field level, Mr. Patnaik suggested that movement of goods may be permitted seamlessly across the country without any differentiation, in order to avoid clogging at the check gates that may adversely impact supply of essential goods.

The Punjab government on Wednesday issued a fresh set of directives to the police and civil administration in order to ensure that the people are not inconvenienced during the ongoing lockdown even as the State reported two fresh cases of the virus.

State's health department said that two new cases COVID-19 were reported in Punjab on March 25, taking the total cases to 31. One patient is from Hoshiarpur district and was in close contact with a positive case. The other patient is from Ludhiana and doesn’t have a travel history. The source of patient's infection is being identified, it added.

Panel formed

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has constituted a committee to oversee the procurement processes for all COVID-19 related items. The Chief Minister in a statement said he has directed the police and administrative officials to ensure that door-to-door delivery of essential services is maintained for the desired-prescribed period and it may, as far as possible, be further streamlined with the assistance of e-commerce companies and service providers.

Sanitation drive

The Chief Minister has also ordered sanitisation of affected or vulnerable areas, for which guidelines have been issued by the Department of Health and Family Welfare, may be undertaken in both concerned towns and villages.

While there would continue to be no general relaxation in curfew, if it is decided by the district administration in due course to relax it in a selected area, due care must be taken to avoid overcrowding and to observe prescribed social distancing, according to the guidelines, added the statement.

In Union Territory of Chandigarh no fresh cases of Covid-19 was reported on March 25. However, two women have been kept under isolation and their test results are awaited. Amid the lockdown, the Union Territory administration was seen battling to provide essentials like vegetables and milk in many parts of the city.

The Union Territory Advisor Manoj Parida, took to Twitter, saying “Just as we were preparing 4 hour sector wise relaxation in curfew, came orders for total lockdown, at night,we switched over to door delivery which is taking some teething problem. please please bear till tomorrow.”

Madhya Pradesh recorded its first COVID-19 death on Wednesday as a 65-year-old woman from Ujjain who had tested positive in the morning died later while undergoing treatment in Indore, the country's cleanest city.

“The woman was admitted to the M.Y. Hospital. The condition of rest of the patients is stable,” Akash Tripathi, Indore Divisional Commissioner, told The Hindu.

In the morning, four residents of Indore and the woman had tested positive, taking the count in the State to 14 cases in five days. The Indore patients are aged 66, 68, 50 and 49.

Lokesh Jatav, Indore Collector, said, “We are doing their contact tracing now, after which further steps will be taken.”

As for prohibitory orders in the city, Mr. Jatav said the police had been directed to act against those on the roads, barring ones catering to essential services.

“We have filed cases and cancelled driver’s licences too, and will take stricter action if people still don’t comply,” he added.

Journalist tests positive

Meanwhile, panic gripped government officials and journalists in Bhopal on Wednesday, as a senior journalist, who had attended a press conference of former Chief Minister Kamal Nath and visited the Vidhan Sabha and the Raj Bhavan, tested positive for COVID-19.

The journalist is the father of the city’s first case — a woman who tested positive on March 22 after returning from London. He is the 15th positive case in the State.

As the news of the test result trickled in, several government Public Relations Department officials and journalists went into quarantine.

242,2020/03/26,"Olympics postponement a blessing for me, says triple jumper Arpinder Singh","Triple jumper Arpinder Singh says he now has time to try out a new technique

The postponement of the Tokyo Olympics, from this July to next year, must have been shattering for many. But triple jumper Arpinder Singh considers it a blessing.

“Yes, this postponement is a kind of blessing for me. I felt I wasn’t ready for the Federation Cup in April,” said the Asian Games champion in a telephone chat with The Hindu from Amritsar on Thursday.

“I felt I would be ready only by the time of the inter-State meet (June-end, in Bengaluru). So, this one year’s delay in the Olympics will help me a lot.”

Aprinder, the first Indian to win a Continental Cup medal (bronze, in the Czech Republic in 2018), has a personal best of 17.17m which came in the Lucknow inter-State Nationals in June 2014. But it had been a big struggle for him to cross 17m after that. His next 17m came four years later in the 2018 Guwahati inter-State Nationals a few months before the Jakarta Asian Games where he won the gold with 16.77m.

Very tough

The Tokyo Olympics entry standard is 17.14m and since he had planned his season late, it would have been very tough for Arpinder to make the cut, had the Olympics been held this year.

“Now, I’ve got a lot of extra time to try out the changes I had made in my technique,” said Arpinder, a bronze medallist in the 2014 Commonwealth Games.

Arpinder didn’t think a major event like the Olympics would be postponed.

“I was a bit surprised. People told me that it was not possible to have it next year because of the four-year cycle. We’ve never had a situation like this before.

“This experience is rather new to me. But I’m happy because I know my form will be good by the time of the inter-State,” said the 26-year-old.

“Of course, I’m not happy with the situation around me. Everybody is suffering, there’s a big problem everywhere (with the coronavirus crisis).”

Arpinder, who had been training under P.B. Jaikumar in Thiruvananthapuram for the last few months, took a flight home to Amritsar on March 20.

“I was a bit lucky, I flew out just before the lock down came into effect. Now, I’m home after nearly four months, trying out home food and trying to stay healthy.”",athletics,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/ysl76z/article31176250.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27ARP,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/olympics-postponement-a-blessing-for-me-says-triple-jumper-arpinder-singh/article31176251.ece
243,2020/03/26,Strict enforcement keeps motorists off the roads in Erode,"Complaints pour in of masks, sanitisers being sold at exorbitant price in pharmacies

Strict enforcement of Section 144 across the district by the police who had erected barricades across the roads at many places kept most of the motorists off the roads during Day Two of the nationwide lockdown here on Thursday.

Only government and private hospitals, pharmacies, Uzhavar Sandhais, Aavin outlets and Amma canteens were opened as people waited in queue to purchase essentials.

Personal distancing was followed in all the shops as workers regulated the customers who were asked to maintain distance of one metre from the other. Though provisional stores, vegetables shops and meat stalls were allowed to function, very few shops were opened across the district.

The police erected more barricades not only in arterial roads, but also in important roads and many streets and prevented motorists from proceeding.

Police personnel at many places intercepted motorists and questioned their purpose of travel.

At GH Roundabout, few motorists who were found travelling without valid reasons, were asked to do air squats and warned against venturing out.

The lockdown is very effective in rural areas, too, as people who went to petrol bunks, banks, pharmacies, hospitals and provisional stores were found wearing face masks.

Meanwhile, the district administration had received many complaints that masks and sanitisers were sold at exorbitant price at pharmacies in the city and across the district.

Collector C. Kathiravan said that the Central Government had declared face masks and hand sanitisers under essential commodities and had fixed the prices of these items.

He said that three-ply masks should not be sold over ₹10, while 200 ml sanitizer should be sold at a maximum retail price of ₹100. He said that action will be taken against pharmacies, if they were found selling the items at higher price.

52 cases registered

The district police on Thursday have registered 52 cases against motorists for violating Section 144 of CrPC that was clamped in the district from Tuesday evening.

A press release said their vehicles were impounded and they were later released on bail. On Wednesday, the police had registered 63 cases. Superintendent of Police S. Sakthi Ganesan said that stringent action will be taken against persons for violating Section 144 and warned people against unlawful assembly on the road.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/strict-enforcement-keeps-motorists-off-the-roads-in-erode/article31176810.ece
244,2020/03/26,"Bus stand, school ground will turn into markets","In order to avoid overcrowding of the municipal and farmers’ markets here, the Nilgiris district administration has decided to ask merchants to sell essential items at the Ooty town bus stand and the Shri Shanthi Vijai Girls Higher Secondary School grounds.

District Collector J. Innocent Divya told presspersons on Thursday that while a few shops would continue to function in the municipal market complex, the other merchants would be asked to set up stalls at the two locations.

Officials made chalk markings at the market entrance to ensure personal distancing among the people to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. People were allowed into the market complex in batches. The district administration asked merchants to display the prices of commodities outside their shops to prevent profiteering. The Collector said people could lodge complaints of overpricing against store owners with the district administration on toll free number 1077.

“We have also told merchants that it was their duty to ensure personal distancing among people visiting their stores,” said the Collector.

According to officials, 91 cases were registered against individuals for defying prohibitory orders on Thursday. Officials warned of stricter action, including arrests in the coming days.

732 in home quarantine

The Collector also said that 732 people were in home quarantine in the Nilgiris. They had been told not to step out of their homes. She reiterated that none of these people had tested positive.

245,2020/03/26,High-handedness alleged against police in Coimbatore,"Personnel continue to clamp down on people who came out even for essential services

A day after police wielded lathi at motorists at Singanallur junction on Wednesday evening, some of the personnel continued clamp down on newspaper agents, food delivery agents, milk vendors and even people who came out for essential services on Thursday.

On Thursday, the police chased and beat a differently-abled man from R.S.Puram who had come out to buy medicine.

Newspaper agents who supply various dailies were stopped by some police personnel who were on duty at places like R.S. Puram, Ramanathapuram, Singanallur and some parts of Coimbatore rural.

“The policeman raised lathi at me and warned that I should not be seen around. When said that I was delivering newspapers, the policeman wanted to see my ID card which newspaper boys do not have”, said a newspaper agent from R.S. Puram area.

J. James, Coimbatore district President of Coimbatore district President of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Micro Enterprises, had bitter experience from the police when he was travelling alone from his house at Venkatapuram to Saibaba Colony on Thursday morning.

“I saw policemen standing on the road from a distance and they were showing sign with lathis to return. As I reached the place, they rushed to my car shouting at me. I told them that I was going to a bank at Saibaba Colony and bank services are exempted from the lockdown. They harassed in abusive language and asked me to return. I was allowed to go only when a sub-inspector intervened and asked me to show proof for purpose of travel. I showed my cheque book after which the officer permitted me to go,” he said.

S. Balamurugan, advocate and national council member of People's Union for Civil Liberty, wanted the Madras High Court and the National Human Rights Commission to take suo motu cognizance of the police high handedness, beating common public with lathi indiscriminately.

“The police violence on motorists was sheer violation of human rights. Enforcement of Section 144 of the CrPC or Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897 does not accord them the right to beat people with lathi. This shows that the police lack experience in handling crisis like an epidemic outbreak and they took lathi to handle it as a law and order situation,” he said.

V. P. Sarathi, Chairperson of Coimbatore Human Rights Forum (CHRF), said that he had complained to the NHRC against the Coimbatore city police requesting it to immediately stop them from beating the public, many of whom have ventured out to buy and deliver essentials.

“The police also denied food to the differently-abled man at R.S. Puram by chasing away a food delivery agent who had come to deliver a parcel for him. NHRC has accepted the complaint,” he said.

According to Mr. Sarathi, while appealing to the public to strictly avoid non-essential movement, police authorities cannot continue to be indiscriminate and violate human rights to life in its drive to implement orders under Section 144 of criminal procedure code. It violated human rights to life and liberties as guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India by lathi-charging and causing grievous hurt to the members of the public who had ventured out to buy essential commodities, he said.

“It may be noted that assembly of only more than four persons is unlawful and punishable under Section 188 (1) the person can be arrested by the police and kept under detention for some time for the disobedience and let off on bail. The punishment under the Act, after trial, can go up to one month simple imprisonment if he is convicted”, he said.

A senior police officer of Coimbatore city police said that all personnel were instructed to avoid such incidents. As a result, a lot of newspaper delivery boys, loadmen, drivers and shop assistants have made it clear that they would return to work only after the lockdown period is over. This is likely to hit the essential commodities supply, point out residents who were waiting in queue at shops.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/high-handedness-alleged-against-police-in-coimbatore/article31176154.ece

248,2020/03/26,ICC Board to discuss contingency plans,"The points system in case of cancelled series will be a topic of discussion

The members of the ICC Board will meet via video conference on Friday to discuss contingency plans for its multiple tournaments in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

While a couple of ICC Board members confirmed to PTI that no concrete decisions are expected during the conference call, it became imperative that a meeting was necessary to discuss contingency plans.

The most high-profile ICC flagship event in 2020 is the Men’s T20 World Cup in October-November besides the various bilateral series which are part of the World Test Championship. The points system in case of cancelled series will be a topic of discussion. One such series, England’s away tour of Sri Lanka, has already been postponed.

“Right now, the situation is such that no decision can be taken as no one knows when normalcy returns. Obviously the members will give a lowdown of the situation in their respective countries. But we need to be ready with plans if this lockdown continues for two more months. The complete FTP will be topsy turvy,” an official of a member nation said.

He added that points allocation of Test Championship games that will be postponed will be another issue.

“The England-Sri Lanka series got postponed but where will it be slotted considering the FTP calendar is choc-a-bloc. It’s not one series that will be affected but a few more which are lined up,” he said.

There is England hosting West Indies and Pakistan in June and July while New Zealand travels to Bangladesh in August. India next plays Test matches in November against Australia in an away series.

“So like what could be the ideal points distribution system. Whether giving 60 points each to both teams will be fair deal is something that members need to discuss,” he added.

No imminent threat

249,2020/03/26,Stokes preparing for IPL despite likely shutdown,"‘I have to build up and get myself physically in a position’

England all-rounder Ben Stokes says he is preparing to play in the Indian Premier League (IPL), even though he knows the tournament is unlikely to go ahead.

Stokes has signed to play for Rajasthan Royals and is one of 13 English players set to feature in the IPL.

But the Twenty20 tournament has already been delayed until April 15 in response to the pandemic.

“At the moment my next competitive cricket is going to be in the IPL,” Stokes told the BBC on Wednesday. “That hasn’t changed yet so I have to think I will be playing on April 20.”

Last week, England and Wales Cricket Board announced that English county season would not start until at least the end of May, while England’s tour of Sri Lanka was also postponed.

With IPL chiefs yet to call off or further delay their event, Stokes has to continue to keep himself in shape to play in the unlikely event if he is asked to travel to India.

“I have to get my head round that I am playing even though in the back of my mind I know I am probably not,” he added.

“I have to build up and get myself physically in a position that if it does happen I am good to go. I cannot take three weeks off and expect the body to be ready for April 20 because it doesn’t work like that. It might happen and if it does I don’t want to be behind.

250,2020/03/26,Lot to learn from this crisis: Kapil,"Being a sportsman has helped him face tough situations with equanimity, says former India captain

Lockdown — a word that needs to be drilled into the minds of citizens. “A word,” as former India captain and one of the game’s greatest all-rounders Kapil Dev observes, “that has become the lifeline for mankind. You are supposed to stay at home, so stay at home! It is the least one can do to help the competent and relevant authorities to fight this life-threatening virus.”

Positive attitude

As Kapil elaborates: “It can be taken in a positive way. Lockdown or Stay at Home. You have to challenge yourself to accept this situation. You have the world inside your home — your family. You have means of entertaining yourself — books, TV, music. Best of all is the interaction you have with your family.”

Personal tasks

To stay focused, Kapil has taken up various tasks inside the house. “I sweep the house, clean the garden. My little garden is my golf course. I am getting to spend so much time with my family. Something that I had missed in the last several years. I give the cook a break. I cook for everyone. I take turns to do the dishes. I learnt all this when playing in England and Romi joined me.”

Being a sportsman has helped him face tough situations with equanimity, Kapil says. “I always believe in being positive. In cricket you get out for zero after scoring a century in the preceding innings. You end up wicketless after having done your best in previous spells. I have read and heard how the human race has fought and set examples when dealing with crises. India’s strength lies in our culture — looking after each other and caring for elders. We have to look to help the seniors. I know we will win this battle by staying together and strengthening the hands of our government and doctors by staying indoors.”

This tough phase, believes Kapil, will make people more responsible. “People will remember the lessons in hygiene now. They will learn to wash their hands and not to spit and urinate in public. We have to keep our surroundings clean. Wish we had learnt these lessons earlier, but hope this generation will not make those mistakes. I was lucky I could learn from my seniors and am thankful to them.”

Kapil picked Bishan Singh Bedi and Sunil Gavaskar for special mention. “Bedi taught me the joy and importance of being large-hearted. Life becomes simple when you are large-hearted. Sunil taught me to plan. He would keep planning.

“Even when he was batting against me, he was sporting enough to advise me. He told me to bowl from close to the wicket because he found it difficult to pick my out-swinger. What a lesson I learnt from the artist. Also, my generation of cricketers did not criticise youngsters,” he says.

Masters of the game

Reflecting on colleagues from his playing days, Kapil talked of how some of them would have been superstars in current times too. “Sunil would have been a sought-after batsman in T20. Srikkanth started T20 in 1985 when he was smashing Imran Khan and Wasim Akram over cover and mid-off. We used to wonder ‘what is this guy doing’. Yashpal, with his bottom-hand shots over midwicket would have been a hit. He could hit from cover to midwicket with such ease.

“Take Sidhu (Navjot Singh). Belter of the ball. Once, in the nets, he hit the ball in the air and Bedi ordered him to run six for that shot. Madan Lal had the game for T20s. Bowlers like Bedi and Venktaraghavan would have shackled batsmen. Prasanna would have beaten the batsmen with his art in the air. I have not forgotten (Gundappa) Viswanath. He would have made a mockery of the field by picking gaps with ridiculous ease. I could go on and on,” he says.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ob114b/article31176188.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27KAPIL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/lot-to-learn-from-this-crisis-kapil/article31174163.ece
251,2020/03/26,T20 World Cup: ICC postpones all qualifying events,"The ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Trophy Tour will also not be commencing in April as originally planned.

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has postponed all the qualifying events, which were scheduled to be held before June 30, due to the global COVID-19 pandemic

The coronavirus outbreak has so far claimed more than 21,000 lives and infected over 4,00,000 globally, prompting countries to shut down borders and operate on lockdown mode.

“In light of the significant global health concerns at the current time and the restrictions on movement imposed by governments across the world, the ICC has taken the decision to postpone all events up until the end of June subject to further review,” ICC head of events, Chris Tetley said.

252,2020/03/26,"Mithali Raj wants women’s IPL next year, says BCCI shouldn’t wait forever","“You cannot wait forever; you have to begin at some point.”

BCCI should not “wait forever” to start the women’s IPL, said India women’s ODI captain Mithali Raj, urging the board to make it happen next year on a smaller scale before gradually developing it.

“I personally feel they should start a women’s IPL by next year, even if it’s on a slightly smaller scale and with some changes in rules, such as, say, have five to six foreign players in the first edition instead of four as is the case with the men’s IPL,” Raj told ‘ESPNCricinfo’.

After India lost the T20 World Cup in the finals earlier this month, former skipper Sunil Gavaskar had called for a full-fledged women’s IPL from next year to unearth talent.

In 2019, a three-team women’s tournament was held featuring sides called IPL Velocity, IPL Trailblazers and IPL Supernovas.

This year, the BCCI had decided to organise a four-team women’s T20 challenge to run parallel to the men’s IPL playoffs, but now it has been put on hold along with the main event due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

India don’t have enough women cricketers for a full-fledged IPL but Raj said it can still be conducted if existing IPL franchises own teams to begin the process.

“I agree we don’t have the depth in the domestic pool yet, but the key is to get the existing franchises to form teams, even if (only) five or six of them are keen to begin the process because in any case, the BCCI was going to have four teams,” she said.

“You cannot wait forever; you have to begin at some point, and gradually, year by year, you can keep evolving the league and then bring it down to four foreign players.”

Raj also said that teen sensation Shafali Verma, who impressed with the bat in the T20 World Cup, should be included in the ODIs too.

“It’s not a bad idea to consider her for the ODIs. She is young but that should not be a criterion for not giving her opportunities in the ODI side,” she said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/cutw26/article29674850.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14MITHALI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/mithali-raj-wants-womens-ipl-next-year-says-bcci-shouldnt-wait-forever/article31170323.ece

In another case, a Delhi police constable was admitted to Doctor Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital and kept in isolation ward. He was feeling feverish for the past one week. His samples have been collected and the reports will be out in 48 hours.

The Delhi police on Wednesday had issued a circular to send about a quarter of its staff to isolation on a rotation basis, for 10 days, to contain the spread of COVID-19.

In an internal communication to his personnel, Delhi Police Commissioner S.N. Srivastava said a part of the police strength should remain in quarantine for 10 days by rotation and the rest should enforce the 21-day lockdown announced by the government.

“All police stations, offices of ACPs/DCPs of districts and other higher offices are advised to send 25-33% of staff to isolation,” the order said.

The family said that a post-mortem was not required and that they did not suspect any foul play, but we insisted for a post-mortem,” the police officer said.

The police said that while the report of the post-mortem is awaited, the doctors have told them that the swelling and blackness around the eyes were “suspicious”. “There was no external injury on his body. The post-mortem report will bring more clarity and legal action can be taken only after we get the report,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/man-found-dead-at-residence/article31176939.ece
256,2020/03/26,Constable suspended for vandalising vegetable carts,"A Delhi police constable posted in Central district was suspended on Thursday for allegedly vandalising vegetable carts during lockdown, officers said.

The incident happened in Nehru Nagar area where a police constable posted under Ranjit Nagar police station asked vegetable vendors to leave. There were customers and vendors were busy dealing with them. The constable asked the vendors to leave again and an argument broke when vendors said food items come under essential services. The policeman then overturned three vegetables carts and threatened to arrest the vendors.

“We got to know about the incident after he received a video of the incident from a local resident. Constable Rajbir of Ranjit Nagar police station, seen in the video, has been suspended with immediate effect for his misconduct. All other police staff in the district have been sensitised in this regard,” said Sanjay Bhatia, DCP (Central).

The police said that the video surfaced online on Wednesday, following which the constable was suspended on Thursday.

However, there were numerous complaints of policemen beating people associated with essential services, like delivery boys, vegetable vendors and newspaper hawkers.

“We have set up a platform for e-commerce websites where they can share with us difficulties faced by them, so that we can solve them,” said Mandeep Singh Randhawa, Delhi police PRO.

257,2020/03/26,3 more test positive for COVID-19 in Noida,"Total cases in Gautam Buddha Nagar stands at 14, the highest in Uttar Pradesh

Three more persons were found to be infected with COVID-19 on Thursday in Noida, taking the total count in Gautam Buddha Nagar to 14, the highest in Uttar Pradesh.

Confirming the report, Anurag Bhargav, Chief Medical Officer (Gautam Buddh Nagar) said the three persons have been shifted to Pediatric Hospital and Post Graduate Training Institute in Sector 30, Noida. “The three seem to be related to each other,” he said.

A district health official said that one of them is a 21-year-old resident of Sector 137 and is the daughter of a chartered account who, along with his wife, was tested positive on Monday. “Another couple who tested positive for COVID-19 resides in Sector 150. The husband is colleague of the 21-year-old youth,” he said. Both, he said, were in touch with the youth from the United Kingdom, who stayed in Noida for three days and was said to be symptomatic.

Meanwhile, district authorities have sealed a hotel in Sector 135, where their British colleague stayed for three days. “The hotel premises are being sanitised and Health Department staff is screening the staff as per protocol,” an official release said.

In a separate order, District Magistrate B.N. Singh said that no pass would be required for vehicles delivering essential goods.

Meanwhile, the Uttar Pradesh Bhawan in Delhi has finally established a control room to tackle problems faced by migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh, in the national capital. A release issued by Prabhat Kumar Sarangi, Resident Commissioner, U.P. government, said that such people could call or Whatsapp on 9313434088 or dial 011-26110151to 55. Ashish Kumar Singh, Assistant Protocol Officer, told The Hindu, “In the last two days, we have observed movement of migrant workers from Delhi to their houses in U.P.

258,2020/03/26,COVID-19 poster outside west Delhi house keeping people away,"Relatives bringing us essential items: quarantined family

“COVID-19. Do not visit. Home under quarantine,” read a poster outside a house in a west Delhi locality. People walking past were seen taking a closer look of the poster after they noticed it, before quickly walking away.

The poster also has a name, the address, and the number of persons advised quarantine written on it besides the duration of quarantine — March 15-31. The six members of the family have been asked not to step out of their house to avoid legal action against them.

The house is owned by a 40-year-old who had returned from the United States on March 15. Employee of a multi-national company, who requires to travel for work often, the owner said that all that the poster had done was scaring people around them.

Screening

Complaining about the process, the man said that he was screened at the airport and was also briefed about quarantining himself for 14 days, adding that the poster was pasted outside his house only on Wednesday (March 25). “Ideally, they should have pasted the poster a day or two after I returned if the threat was real. It has been 10 days and I am absolutely fine. What it really does is scare people,” he said. Whoever he asked, including his friends, to even come outside the house, turned him down, he added.

He said that on Wednesday, as soon as the poster was pasted, they had clicked a picture of it and sent it along with a message on their residential colony’s group saying that the man is fine and that this was a precautionary measure being taken by the government and there was nothing to panic. The response from his neighbours included “Take care”.

The neighbours, however, are now both concerned and apprehensive.

A 62-year-old, who did not wish to be identified, said that the man’s father had come out to throw garbage in the morning and a few people in the area “took a step back”. “We have called them to say that if they need something, they should let us know. But people are obviously scared to go near the house,” he said.

The owner of the house said that he had been buying everything online till a few days ago, but since Wednesday, the family has not stepped out “as such” even for essentials. “Legal action can be taken against us if we step out before the quarantine period ends. The police had come today [Thursday] and posted another list of do’s and don’ts that also mentioned that we are not allowed to step out,” he said, adding that relatives have been coming with food items whenever required. “Our relatives are bringing us things like milk and daily essentials. They come and keep the items outside the house and we pick those up,” he said.

The members of the family have been taking precautionary measures even inside the house that include sleeping in separate rooms and washing utensils as and when they are used.

A government official said the Airport authorities is sharing a list of details of people who landed in the country, with the District Surveillance Officer (DSO). The DSO is tasked with putting up the posters and informing the police. “Several complaints have been received about people not following the quarantine orders and the police are being informed in such cases who are then warning people of of legal action if they step out of the house,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/covid-19-poster-outside-west-delhi-house-keeping-people-away/article31176892.ece
259,2020/03/26,Lawyers unable to register online for welfare scheme,"They urge for deadline to be extended as site not working properly

Several lawyers, hopeful of getting themselves covered under the recently announced Chief Minister Advocates’ Welfare Scheme, have complained that they have not been able to register online as the official website is not working properly.

The Delhi government, under the Chief Minister welfare scheme for advocates, allocated a budget of ₹50 crore which will give mediclaim policy, group insurance policy, e-library and creche facilities. It set up a customised online application site with OTP facility, for practising advocates who are enrolled with the Bar Council of Delhi and are also in the voters’ list of Delhi.

The Delhi government opened the online registration portal on March 21 and put a deadline for closing it on March 31, 2020.

Bar Council of Delhi (BCD) chairman K.C. Mittal said, “We have received complaints from various lawyers that the website is not working properly, in as much as, at times, it is found that, the server is down or OTP is not sent from the website”.

Unique ID number

He additionally said the unique ID number which should be generated after successful submission, is not generated, resulting in a lot of members not being able to register.

Advocate Rahul Mehra, a member of Armed Forces Tribunal (Principal Bench) Bar Association, said he has been trying to apply online since March 21, but with no success. Mr. Mehra, who has been practising in various courts in Delhi since 2008, said he had brought the issue to the notice of the authorities concerned and government departments.

“I tried applying through my system at home, and also from other location, but failed every time,” Mr. Mehra said, adding that, “With the COVID-19 pandemic closing down most institutions, the March 31 deadline for online registration should be extended”.

Advocate Kirti, who has been practising at various courts in Delhi for the past 10 years, said she tried registering online on Tuesday. “I went through all the process, even added the OTP, but was unable to successfully register on the website,” she said.

With several other lawyers experiencing similar difficulties, Mr. Mittal has written a letter to the Principal Secretary, Law and Justice, Delhi government apprising him of the issues with online registration. Mr. Mittal has requested the Law Secretary to “ensure that there is no difficulty in the online registration of lawyers”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/lawyers-unable-to-register-online-for-welfare-scheme/article31176878.ece
260,2020/03/26,Delhi reports 4 new COVID-19 cases; total number 39 now,"National capital currently has 32 active cases and reported 1 death so far

Four new cases of COVID-19 were reported in the city on Thursday, taking the total number of cases to 39 with 32 active cases and one death.

All the four new cases have travel history to affected countries. Case 36, a 32-year-old man, who is a resident of Jamia Nagar in Delhi, has a travel history to Dubai.

Case 38, 38, and 39 are residents of Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Bangalore respectively and they have a travel history to Iran, Spain/Paris, and Canada, respectively.

Also, Case 10, a 38-year-old woman, who travelled to India from Saudi Arabia, has proved to be a conundrum for the Delhi government, with her contacts reaching 1,400 and still increasing.

“ As many as 1,400 people came in contact with the woman and officials have asked all of them to be in home quarantine for 14 days. Most of them are from 500 houses in her area,” a Delhi government official said.

“Also, around 1,100 people came in contact with the 49-year-old male Mohalla Clinic doctor [Case 28] and we have asked them to home-quarantine themselves for 14 days,” the official said. Most of the contacts are his patients.

“We have told all the people, who have been home-quarantined, to report to us if they show any symptoms. Currently they are asymptomatic,” a doctor said.

Case 28 had also come in contact with Case 10, when she consulted him at a private clinic. He was later tested positive on Sunday.

BLK Super Speciality Hospital and Max Healthcare will start admitting COVID-19 patients from Friday.

262,2020/03/26,No food at Gurugram night shelter: inmates,"At least 40 people didn’t eat for last 2 days

Sitting on the benches laid haphazardly under a tree at a Municipal Corporation of Gurugram-run night shelter at Bheem Nagar here on Thursday afternoon, around 40-odd people, all daily-wagers, have not had meals for the last two days.

“I brought rice for ₹200 two days ago. We all cooked and shared,” said Bablu, 48. He claimed that many of them have not had food for even longer. “The work stopped around five days before the people’s curfew. After the curbs on Monday, the police did not allow us to stand at Labour Chowk,” added Bablu, who had migrated from Bihar a decade ago and is a regular to the night shelter.

The inmates claimed that most of them were daily-wagers going to Bhuteshwar Mandir Labour Chowk everyday and somehow making a living before the restrictions were imposed.

Dhara, a scavenger, said that he was managing the meals helped by the scrap-dealers known to him. But it was now getting difficult. “Earlier, we got free meals at gurdwaras and mandirs, but now they have also been shut. There is no help from the administration either. We will die of hunger before we are infected by the deadly virus,” said Ashish, 26.

Dashrath said even the local residents in the locality were not helping. He said that some of them had gone out begging for food last night, but returned empty handed. “The police do not allow us to step outside. There are no means to go back to our village. We are stuck,” said Dasrath.

Rajesh, 53, had cough and fever. He said he did not have money for medicines. “I am managing with tea and biscuits offered by the guard for the last two days,” said Rajesh.

Inder Kumar, a guard at another night shelter in Kadipur, said the facility was ready, but not formally taken over by the MCG and therefore, he had stopped allowing anyone inside. “It has space for around 100 people, but it got ready in January only. Not many people know about it. Only a dozen people were coming for night stay. But now I have been told by my company, who constructed the shelter, to not to allow anyone. The MCG should take it over first,” said Inder.

The other two facilities of the MCG at Rajiv Chowk and Mahabir Chowk, running from porta cabins were locked.

Gurugram Red Cross secretary Mahesh Gupta said they had identified 32 locations, all slums, across the city to provide food to the poor from Thursday. He said that a kitchen was set up at the office of Red Cross in Chandan Nagar and food supplied with the help of the volunteers. “However, most of our regular volunteers, above 50 years, had made themselves unavailable saying that they were at greater risk if infected,” said Mr. Gupta.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/no-food-at-gurugram-night-shelter-inmates/article31176860.ece
263,2020/03/26,The poorest of the country are the ones hit most hard by the restrictions,"Estimates suggest that more than 70% of the population of Delhi works in the unorganised sector. Often, the poorest from villages migrate to the city in search of livelihoods and work as daily wagers, with minimal or no savings to dip into in times of crisis. It is not surprising, therefore, that the 21-day curbs announced by the Prime Minister, albeit necessary, is pushing these residents of Delhi into abject destitution.

Reassurances by the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister that essential commodities will continue being available in neighbourhood shops, mean little to those who have no money to buy them. Heart-wrenching pictures of families carrying their young on their backs, walking towards villages hundreds of miles away during the nation-wide curfew, are a grim reminder of their economic fragility. Lack of social infrastructure and recurring expenses — the average rental for a jhuggi in Delhi is around ₹3,000 — make it unviable for them to continue living in the city without any source of income for extended periods of time.

A large number of Delhi’s children are no strangers to hunger. The post-mortem of three sisters aged two, four and eight, who died in east Delhi two years ago revealed that they succumbed to starvation — there was zero gram of fat on their little bodies. Since schools and anganwadis have been shut down due to the pandemic, children in the Capital are being denied their mid-day meals on which many subsist — putting them at grave risk.

The Finance Minister on Thursday announced a financial package to mitigate the disastrous consequences for the poor. While the measures are welcome and much needed, they are mainly focused on providing relief to those who are already covered in the food and social security net of the government. The supply of additional foodgrains to existing ration card holders and enhancing pensions of existing beneficiaries, while necessary, is in no way sufficient. These measures ignore the poorest, especially migrant workers, who have been excluded from the ambit of social security programmes of the government because they do not possess the necessary documents and proof of address.

No identity cards

Only 40% of Delhi’s population has a valid ration card, leaving lakhs of deprived residents out of the ambit of the Public Distribution System. Similarly, the pension scheme excludes a very large number of the old and the handicapped, who desperately need social security benefits. Now, more than ever, is the time for Delhi to learn from the experience of Kerala and other States which have universalised their social security programmes to ensure no deserving family is excluded.

In the meantime, it is incumbent upon the Delhi government to immediately deploy its resources to assist those who are left out. In addition to making sure that foodgrains and pensions are efficiently delivered to all, the government must set up proper shelters for the poor who are rendered homeless during this crisis and provide cooked food to those who need it.

While doing so, care needs to be taken to ensure that social distancing norms necessary to prevent the COVID-19 from spreading are adhered to, else the entire purpose of the curbs stands to be defeated. Currently, the Delhi government is distributing free cooked meals at all night shelters in the city. Experience of the first two days of the curbs is clearly showing at the 234 shelters are not adequate to feed the needy.

COVID-19 hotspot

Thousands have been congregating at meal times making these places hotspots for the spread of the dreaded COVID-19. Also, not everyone who needs food is able to reach these centres during curfew conditions. There is an urgent need to decentralise the distribution of cooked food. The network of anganwadis and government schools must be used to enable easy access and prevent overcrowding. It is critical that the mid-day meal scheme, and support to pregnant and lactating mothers, be immediately resumed.

There is no excuse for putting the already vulnerable at greater risk. This would also be in line with the recent Supreme Court judgment directing States to promulgate policies to immediately ensure provision of these meals. Implementation of curbs in a city like Delhi, with its teeming, poor and vulnerable population was never going to be anything short of a herculean task. Lack of proper planning and prompt implementation of requisite emergency measures could hurl the national capital into an economic and health abyss.

266,2020/03/26,"At night shelters, food for most but not for all","Despite government increasing the quantity of food, it is proving inadequate

Days after the Delhi government started distributing free lunch and dinner at its 220-odd night shelters, in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak, the programme drew mixed response from the homeless.

The authorities, meanwhile, stated that they have increased the amount of food being served at these shelters. Though the food sufficed for those in the three-night shelters, The Hindu visited, people and caretakers complained that more food is needed to serve homeless people who come to the shelter for just food.

On Saturday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced that due to the pandemic, the government-run night shelters are open for all and would provide food for anyone.

“Yesterday [Wednesday] night, on Lodi Road, dal chawal was distributed at 11.30 p.m. I slept off by then and in the morning, we couldn’t eat it and had to throw it away,” said 55-year-old Jameela Khatun. “I beg at the mandir, but now that is also closed due to the disease. What will we do,” she asked.

The delay, a caretaker said, was due to miscommunication. “The food was mistakenly dropped off at AIIMS last night and then we had to get it from there and that caused the delay,” he said. Though the food was inadequate for all those who came from outside, the quantity have increased, he said.

Food portion

“Everyday we are increasing the number of meals we are serving. Today, we gave lunch to more than 20,000 people in our night shelters,” Bipin Rai, a member of the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), which runs the night shelters, said.

“Also the Chief Minister has said that we will start ward-level distribution of food to more than one lakh people everyday and the DUSIB will be part of this programme too,” he added.

On Thursday afternoon, hundreds of people lined up for free lunch at a night shelter in Yamuna Pushta in east Delhi. But people sat close to each other and some complained that the portion of food being served was less. “The quantity is so less that even a child’s stomach would not be filled with this,” said a person in his forties.

Shoaib Khureshi, from Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh, who has been staying at a night shelter outside AIIMS for the last 15 days, had another grouse. “Khichdi was less yesterday [Wednesday]. Today it was more.”

A caretaker admitted that the food would never suffice as more people are flocking the tents during the curbs. “There are 11 tents [shelters] around AIIMS and food is never going to be enough, as a lot of people come from outside. But we served almost everyone that came to our tent for lunch. We have been getting more food for the last two days,” he said.

Near a night shelter in INA, a father of five children from Sitapur said he could not sell bamboo furniture for the last five days, and hence has to depend on food from the night shelters. “The government should give food to everyone who lives in slums. What else will we do? Police don’t allow us to go out and sell our things,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/at-night-shelters-food-for-most-but-not-for-all/article31176738.ece
267,2020/03/26,Animal protection groups call for regulating meat markets in the country,"Five national organisations urge Central government to shut shops which do not follow food safety guidelines

Five national animal protection organisations on Thursday appealed to the Central government to regulate all meat markets in the country in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic. They urged for immediate closure of meats markets and shops which do not follow food safety guidelines.

The organisations, which include People for Animals (PFA) said, “The rise of antimicrobial resistance, along with the emergence of new, highly pathogenic viral strains, have been linked to live animal markets, including pet and wildlife trade and meat production systems”.

“Live animal markets and facilities that confine animals in crowded conditions are fertile hotbeds of zoonotic pathogens,” Gauri Maulekhi of the PFA said adding, “The meat, fish and egg industry in India confines millions of animals in crowded facilities, transports them in similar conditions, and slaughters them in the most unhygienic manner”.

“Despite a clear distinction for operation of such businesses made out in law, meat markets also double as meat shops. Slaughtering animals in markets, in shops where other live animals are confined in close quarters, is a common sight,” the joint letter to the Union Health Minister said.

Apart from the PFA, Humane Society International/India, Mercy for Animals India Foundation, Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations, and Ahimsa Trust, have collectively appealed to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to work with the Ministry of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries to regulate intensive animal agriculture.

Public health crisis

They also called for closure of meat markets and shops which do not follow the Food Safety and Standard Authority of India guidelines. Claiming that “often, the meat of diseased and infected animals enter the food market and is invariably consumed by the public,” the animal protection groups said, “Allowing the meat industry to flourish in such uncertain times of public health crisis will have widespread and debilitating ramifications upon public health and safety”.

The letter also called highlighted that no standards are notified for the trait selection, housing and rearing of poultry or swine rearing. “The absence of regulations relating to livestock production lead to intensive, crowded rearing, unnatural diets, antibiotic abuse and various other practices that have lead us into the COVID-19 crisis,” it added.

They also said that a majority of pet shops across the country which operate through live animal markets are largely unregulated and illegal as well. Despite the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (Pet Shop) Rules of 2018, now being in force for nearly two years, barely any of these shops are registered with the State animal welfare boards as is a requisite under the rules, they said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/animal-protection-groups-call-for-regulating-meat-markets-in-the-country/article31176730.ece

Delhi Minorities Commission chairman Zafarul-Islam Khan on Thursday appealed to Muslims in the city to strictly obey curfew restrictions and adhere to social distancing norms.

His appeal came as a reaction to an information that Muslims in some areas like Old Delhi, Zakir Nagar, Seelampur and Jafarabad were lax about social distancing and the restrictions imposed by the government to control and contain the virus epidemic.

Mr. Khan asked Muslims in these neighbourhoods to strictly obey the curfew restrictions, adhere to social distancing norms and approach hospitals if symptoms were noticed and follow quarantine rules.

“Imams and mosque committees must strictly adhere to the current restrictions and restrict congregational prayers to a maximum of four persons including, the imam and muezzin while others must pray at home. Preservation of human life is a primary duty of all. People must not pay attention to fake videos offering doubtful advice and cures,” Mr. Khan said.

He added that authorities, especially police, must deal firmly with violators, while allowing people to procure essential supplies or to go to chemists and hospitals.

“Action, in particular, must be taken against imams and mosque committees members who are adamant to flout the current restrictions,” Mr. Khan said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/47a1cb/article31176668.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/COVID-HELPLINE-newcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/minorities-panel-appeals-to-muslims-to-obey-curfew-norms/article31176669.ece
269,2020/03/26,Make available essentials at ration shops: BJP leader to CM,"LoP suggests steps to prevent hoarding, black marketing

Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri on Thursday wrote to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to suggest that milk, vegetables and fruits be made available at ration shops being operated by the government so that people did not have to suffer hoarding or black marketing.

Full support

In a letter to the Chief Minister, the leader said that the BJP sought to give “full support” to the Delhi government in dealing with the ongoing virus epidemic that has gripped the Capital.

Mr. Bidhuri suggested several measures on behalf of his party to extend the reach of government services to the needy in Delhi more effectively. “Our first suggestion is to streamline the network of ration shops run under the public distribution system and give comprehensive information to the public about these... People should also be told the time of opening and closing of these shops,” Mr. Bidhuri said.

“...It is also our suggestion that milk, vegetables and fruits should also be made available at these ration shops so that people do not have to suffer any hoarding or black marketing. They will get everything they need at a reasonable price at one place,” he said.

Mr. Bidhuri also sought to remind Mr. Kejriwal about the Delhi government’s announcement of providing assistance of ₹5,000 to poor workers, daily labourers and construction workers and demanded that this be done as soon as possible.

He has also demanded that the government ensure that the amount of pension to be given to senior citizens. “I also suggest to the Chief Minister that a helpline number be issued and wherever there is a demand to provide food to the poor, it should be transported via government vehicles,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/make-available-essentials-at-ration-shops-bjp-leader-to-cm/article31176634.ece
270,2020/03/26,Delay in issuance of curfew passes hits vital goods business,"Staff unable to come to shops as a lot of confusion prevails

Several people who come under the essential services category, on Thursday, said that their respective businesses were getting hampered even as they waited for the curfew passes to be issued.

Many of the city pharmacists added that even though medical shops were supposed to stay open, delay in issuance of the passes to the staff were affecting the supply as the shops had to keep their shutters down.

Online passes

Mukul Rajvansh of Vinayak Medicos, a pharmacy near GB Pant Hospital said, “The stocks are affected because we haven’t been able to open our shops in the first place, the primary reason being the delay in the issuance of curfew passes. We had applied two days ago but we still have not heard anything from authorities. We had even visited the DCP’s office but again, we were told that we’ll get the passes online. There is a lot of confusion and because of this even the staff are unable to come.”

Harilal Kumar of Star Medicos added, “The supply has definitely been affected since the lockdown was announced. Earlier, we used to get around 7-8 batches of supplies in three days which has now reduced to barely 2-3 batches. Even the curfew passes for all the staff are yet to come. Half of our staff have received it till now so we are working in batches. Hopefully, the passes for the others will also arrive soon.”

Meanwhile, Bittu, a mineral water vendor based in south Delhi said, “We could not step out today [Thursday] as we don’t have the passes yet. We have applied for the same and have been told that we will get it by Friday. We are now waiting for it so that we can start the delivery again.”

However, for Rinku Kumar, a vegetable seller, business is usual. “I have not yet faced any issues. The regular passes which we had earlier, to enter colonies, are still with us. So we are continuing going from colony to colony,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ipz8mc/article31176628.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26DELPRIYAMOHALLA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delay-in-issuance-of-curfew-passes-hits-vital-goods-business/article31176629.ece
271,2020/03/26,Shops selling essentials to operate 24x7,"e-commerce companies allowed to deliver commodities at home during lockdown period

Shops and factories associated with essential services can operate 24x7 and e-commerce companies can home-deliver essential commodities during the ongoing 21-day lockdown to contain the COVID-19 epidemic in the Capital, the Delhi government announced here on Thursday.

These announcements were made at a joint digital press conference by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal after a meeting with senior administrative and police officers.

No restriction

“We have ordered that there will be no restriction on e-commerce companies providing essential services. We have also formulated a plan by which we can check if the essential services providers are working on the ground and if they have enough stock or not,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

“The SDMs and ACPs will ensure that all shops in their area providing essential services are open and they have enough stock of essential commodities. We have witnessed that the shops providing essential services are facing huge crowds and therefore, we have decided that shops selling essential items will be allowed to remain open 24×7,” he said.

COVID-19 cases

According to Mr. Kejriwal, Delhi currently reported a total of 36 COVID-19 positive cases and, in the last 24 hours, only one new case was reported.

Among the 36 cases, he said, 26 pertained to individuals who had travelled from virus-affected countries and 10 people got the virus through local transmission.

Mr. Baijal emphasised on adherence to social distancing at all times and urged people to stay at home and fully comply with lockdown advisories.

The L-G, Raj Niwas said, further instructed the district administration to ensure strict compliance of home quarantine and initiate action against violators and to create a mechanism to check if home quarantine is being followed properly.

“RWA office bearers, neighbours may also be informed about the persons under home quarantine in that residential complex/area. He also advised proper monitoring of quarantine facilities and coordination with agencies,” Raj Niwas quoted the L-G as having said.

Mr. Kejriwal said special requests had been made to facilitate people engaged in the supply and distribution of five basic essential items or like milk, vegetables, ration shops, chemists and pharmacists.

Mr. Kejriwal said he had requested the police that if they see any essential service provider on the road who does not have a pass, the police should allow them to commute.

“The government is working relentlessly to provide passes to all the essential service providers...the Delhi government has decided and issued orders that the e-commerce delivery of essential services should not stop in Delhi,” he said.

“The company ID cards of these delivery people will be accepted as their proof and they will be allowed to travel... many State governments are working in very innovative ways to tackle this pandemic and that they are constantly in touch with those State governments,” he said.

Doctor tests positive

Admitting that a doctor engaged at one mohalla clinic has contracted the virus, Mr. Kejriwal assured everyone to dispel rumours that all such clinics would be shut.

He also said that the Delhi government was also ensuring that doctors, nurses and other health officials who are dealing with the infected patients go through tests to check if they are also affected by it.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/p1fsf0/article31176607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26DELPRIYAGOODS1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/shops-selling-essentials-to-operate-24x7/article31176609.ece

Christian Michel James, the alleged middleman arrested in connection with the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam, on Thursday moved the Delhi High Court seeking interim bail, saying he was ill and susceptible to contracting coronavirus in the Tihar Jail.

Mr. James, in his petition, said he was 59-year-old and ill. “The agedness and a pre-existing ill state of health will make the Applicant’s body more susceptible to the said infection than any other ordinary prisoner with a normal health condition,” the plea stated.

The bail plea also referred to the Supreme Court’s March 16 order directing all the states and union territories (UTs) to constitute high-level committees to consider releasing prisoners and undertrials, for offences entailing up to a seven-year jail term, on parole or interim bail to decongest jails to contain the coronavirus pandemic.

Michel, extradited from Dubai, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on December 22, 2018.

On January 5, 2019, he was sent to judicial custody in the ED’s case. He is also lodged in judicial custody in another case registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in connection with the scam.

Michel is among the three alleged middlemen being probed in the cases filed by the ED and the CBI.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/h7bruh/article31171968.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIA-AGUSTAWESTLAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/coronavirus-christian-michel-moves-delhi-hc-seeking-interim-bail-in-agustawestland-case-citing-risk-in-jail/article31171969.ece

Citizens engaged in essential services in Delhi can call 1031 on WhatsApp to avail e-passes to be able to commute to work, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Wednesday.

e-passes were not required for the general public, who were free to visit local shops for the purchase of essential items, even as he sought to assure citizens that Delhi was prepared to ensure the supply of essential goods to residents during the 21-day “total lockdown” ordered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to contain the spread of COVID-19.

No panic buying

“We are here to serve you. Please do not engage in panic buying. It is our responsibility to provide you with all the essential supplies such as vegetables, milk, and medicines. Those who are providing essential services to the people, general store owners, water and electricity department employees, government employees, government hospital doctors, vegetable vendors, will be issued passes by the government,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

“We will issue e-passes to people engaged in manufacture, transport, and storage of essential items, as well as the people who work in private or government essential services... and engaged in the supply of milk, vegetables, ration shops, chemists and pharmacists. The helpline number for this is 1031. You can call the helpline number, intimate the authorities regarding the essential services you are engaged in, and you will be issued the e-pass,” he said.

Mr. Kejriwal also warned landlords of strict action if they force doctors and nurses to vacate their premises under fear of infection.

He said the government had increased the number of spots across the city where free food for the poor would be made available.

“We have arranged for food for poor in our night shelters... However, there are a lot of people who fall outside the ambit of many schemes. We also know that people are more in number. We are increasing the number of spots where free food has been provided,” he said.

Mr. Kejriwal reiterated that it is important for the people to support the government in their actions.

He also appealed to citizens to follow the provisions of the nationwide lockdown.

278,2020/03/26,Many avataras,"The Lord appeared as Nara and Narayana in Badrikasrama. Pillai Lokacharya, in his Mumukshuppadi, gives the reason for this avatara, said P.T. Seshadri in a discourse. Samasaris do not know about the Lord. They do not know why they have been born. They do not know what kainkarya they have to do for the Lord. Samsaris are like a man who has lost something, but does not even know what he has lost. The Lord did not want them to continue to suffer in samsara. So, He came as Nara Narayana, did penance in Badrikasrama and gave us the Ashtakshara mantra.

Thirumangai Azhvar also records this in his Peria Thirumozhi. While Narayana was the Acharya, Nara was the sishya. While it is understandable that the lord should have come as an Acharya, why did He have to come as a sishya as well? Pillai Lokacharya answers this question also. He explains that we do not know how to be model disciples. To show us how a sishya should behave, He came as a sishya too. So, in his very first avatara as Nara Narayana, He shows the world how to be an ideal Acharya and an ideal sishya. In His next avatara, He came as a swan, to save the Vedas. This was followed by the Dattatreya avatara, Sanatkumara avatara and Rishabadeva avatara. These four were amsa avataras, that is partial incarnations.

Then comes the Hayagreeva avatara, says Dhrumila, one of the nava yogiswaras. In this avatara, the Lord killed Madhu and Kaitapa and retrieved the Vedas, which had been stolen. Then came the Matsya avatara. In this avatara, He asked king Satyavrata to protect all life forms during the deluge. Dhrumila also talks of the avatara He took to save Gajendra, the elephant. Dhrumila tells king Nimi that the Lord will soon be born as Krishna.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/many-avataras/article31176150.ece
279,2020/03/26,Time to look inward,"It is an opportunity to step back, to get closer

This is an extraordinary situation. Indeed unprecedented. Sample this. The processional idols of the presiding deities doing the Pradosham rounds alone at the Mylapore Kapaliswara temple. Except the bearers and the priest, the Couple is in solitude, minus the hundreds of devotees, who mill around them on such a day. With the doors shut, devotees, who pride themselves on never missing a Pradosham, are found going round the temple outside.

Festivals are deferred, daily rituals done in the privacy of the sanctum with only the priest in attendance. Images of a deserted Tirumala haunt social media buffs. “Why, why,” ask forlorn devotees. “There cannot be a more cruel punishment,” laments one. “We deserve this for all the unholy things we have been doing on this earth,” says another. Nature’s Nemesis? Retrospection, introspection...

This lull makes one wonder whether the gods are not actually taking a well-deserved break. Years and years of being made a spectacle, being used as the most lucrative source, incessantly playing host to lakhs of people, butt of ridicule, object of controversies — with little or no respite — seem to have pushed the most tolerant and benevolent Father and Mother into isolation. Divine Distancing?

“Besieged with worries? Come to me. It has not rained for a whole year, come to me... famine and pestilence, come to me... Enough. You don’t know to lead your life, co-exist, on the most beautiful planet in the universe and don’t seem to learn your lessons. So, we’ll make ourselves scarce, while you pause to think, because pause you must...” the Parents seem to say.

This Virus is indeed a great leveller. The doors are shut for all. Playing politics won’t open doors here. No court can pass a verdict on this either. No amount of money, no special ticket is going to take anyone anywhere near. Now, what is near? Standing two feet from the dazzling figure even as hundred others are struggling to catch a glimpse of the arati? “He is inside you. Don’t go searching for Him elsewhere,” goes the adage. “Irukkum idathai vittu illadha idam thedi engengo alaiginrar...” sang Kannadasan. Perhaps this pause is to enable that Quest... at least to make a beginning. Time to reboot.

Let the gods rest. They’ll emerge when they are ready. Until then, let the soul look for that divinity inside, find a way to connect... to heal quietly. Draw strength from the spiritual power bank.

280,2020/03/26,How a small pox epidemic launched Kochi’s Pulavanibham market,"The centuries-old Pulavanibham in Kochi began because of a small pox epidemic. Look back on how the city has faced and survived maladies that have struck over the years

Pulavanibham springs up every January near Azhakiyakavu Bhagwathy temple in Palluruthy. This over 100-year-old market has its origin in a smallpox epidemic that flared up in the outskirts of Kochi city, towards Cherthala. In those times, when medical advances were few, the virus was unknown and virulent.

The worst affected were the malnourished and underprivileged farm hands, as well as artisans from socially disadvantaged communities. With a mounting number of deaths and no cure in sight, the people took to praying to the Goddess at the Azhakiyakavu temple that’s believed to be nearly 800 years old. At that time, prevailing custom prevented many of them from entering the temple, however the Raja of Cochin, believed to be Shaktan Thampuran, Rama Varma 1X (1751-1805) , in a humanitarian gesture, allowed them entry. That was a significant milestone in the social history of Kerala.

The families of the sick began coming in hordes to worship the goddess, camping around the temple for weeks. Slowly a small market sprung up that sold essentials as well products — terracotta ware, coir and palm leaf items —made by the commune that assembled. Today’s Pulavanibham market, a colourful bazaar of indigenous handmade items, is a result of that epidemic a century ago.

Unfortunately, that was not the only epidemic to hit the state, says former mayor KJ Sohan. He cites the outbreak of plague and smallpox “during British times, post World War II.” The Mattancherry Ayurveda Hospital in Veli, Fort Kochi was then an isolation hospital. “It was called dheenapura (isolation). The adjacent crematorium was also part of it,” he says adding, “Bodies of the dead were laid out on banana leaves; there were very few people who agreed to bury them. In those days toddy drinking was a pastime: when men got drunk they would agree to feed the sick and bury the dead. ”

Sohan adds that the Fort Kochi Hospital founded by the Portuguese, is perhaps one of the first “modern” hospitals in India, as the Portuguese were the first colonial power in India.

Bussinessman and author Thomas Burleigh, whose family has lived in Fort Kochi for generations, recalls compulsory vaccination against small pox at Kunnumpuram during the British times. “It was forced on everybody,” he says, adding that parts of Fort Kochi and Mattancherry, had low lying areas, below sea level, like Thamaraparambu, where slums existed and the disease raged in these areas.

Local historian VN Venugopal speaks of another small pox epidemic and an outbreak of cholera in the 1940s, in which many families, “even the middle class”, were affected. He recalls his mother pointing out the Vasoori Kolam to him whenever they travelled by train to Thrissur. “It was an isolation hospital, a stone’s throw from the Ernakulam South Railways Station. “It seemed so desolate and far away from everywhere,” he remembers.

Sujith Vasudevan, a doctor for 41 years in Kochi, tells of the plague when his father, N Vasudevan, had to battle when he practised medicine in the 1940s. “There was an outbreak of plague in Fort Kochi, Mattancherry, around the time he joined work. My father had to go and stay at a camp to attend to the sick. He used to go by boat.” He shares a poignant memory of his father bidding farewell. No one knew if his return was certain, as he would be exposed to the deadly disease.”",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/477v3b/article31170551.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KIMPPULAVANIBHAM,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/centuries-old-pulavanibham-in-kochi-began-because-of-a-small-pox-epidemic/article31170552.ece

282,2020/03/26,Many still ignorant about dreaded COVID-19,"Several garbage collectors, grocery shop workers, vegetable vendors and milk delivery persons, not taking proper precaution

Proper awareness about the spread of the dreaded coronavirus appears to be still eluding some sections of the society, particularly those linked to essential services, in spite of the constant rise in the number of positive cases.

Only a few garbage collectors, grocery shops, vegetable vendors and milk delivery persons in some residential areas in Kukatpally and Lingampally areas, were found wearing masks, clearly displaying the ignorance among them.

Delivery of newspapers, however, has been stopped in all the half-a-dozen localities, where enquiries have been made.

“Many customers are coming to my shop wearing masks and we are maintaining a safe distance while handing over groceries and taking cash,” Bajranglal, a street-corner grocery shop owner from HMT Hills, said. However, his ignorance was clearly evident as he himself did not wear any mask.

Also, pharmacists in several medical shops visited by this correspondent on Thursday were seen wearing masks and maintaining safe distance with customers while giving medicines and dealing with cash.

“We are among the essential services and we have no problem in delivering milk to our regular customers,” Mohd. Sadiq, a milk vendor in Shamshiguda and Shatavahana Nagar, said, adding that his delivery boys were local residents and their work is a part-time employment for them.

He, however, stated that in some apartments, residents had restricted the entry of delivery boys to their door step and milk packets were being left with watchmen to be collected later.

Residents in some localities have also asked their maids to stop coming to work at least till the next 2-3 weeks with the fear of virus spread from unknown sources. “We have managed to go back to our village near Shankarampet in Medak district since my husband, who works as a plumber here, has no job now and one of the two families where I work as maid has asked me to stop coming to work,” Savitriamma, a maid, said.

Even before newspaper vendors stopped lifting newspapers for distribution, several gated communities and apartments had asked them to stop supply for at least a month with the whatsapp abuzz with unverified messages stating that coronavirus spreads through newspapers as it changes several hands till reaching the reader. “We have stopped lifting newspapers as many subscribers have a suspicion that the virus spreads through newspapers,” Suresh, a hawker in the HMT Hills area, explained.

However, stopping newspaper delivery has not affected anybody as such as most delivery boys take up the work as a part-time job to supplement their other earnings, Mahesh, another hawker, said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/many-still-ignorant-about-dreaded-covid-19/article31176392.ece

If anyone is thinking that most of these students are from African nations or from the West Asia only, please see these numbers.

Of the 1,469 male and 387 female foreign students, a vast majority are from Somalia - 352, Sudan - 213, Afghanistan - 236, Djibouti - 66, and Ethiopia - 54. Interestingly, there is a significant number from Uzbekistan - 256, Turkmenistan - 119, Iran - 23 and Iraq - 59, too. Also, there are students from China - 26, Syria - 24, South Africa - 15, United Kingdom - 9, Canada - 10, Australia - 3 and hold your breath - United States - 61!

With the current lockdown, all these students have faced forced eviction as all educational institutions were asked to remain shut, including hostels.

However, OU authorities have decided to keep the international hostels of both men and women open, on humanitarian grounds, informed senior OU professors declining to be identified, as they are not authorised to do so.

Unlike other countries, the varsity administration did not want to leave them in the lurch as other than those from developed nations, students mostly come with bare minimum finances with support from respective governments, they explained.

However, the international students of OU have been advised to remain confined to their hostels, maintain personal and locational hygiene by washing their hands often, keeping their surroundings clean, and avoiding shaking hands.

With no mess facility available, foreign students generally make their own arrangements for cooking, the professors disclosed.

Meanwhile, University Foreign Relations Office (UFRO) register G.B. Reddy advised students suffering from severe cold, cough and fever, continuously for three to four days, to quarantine themselves and get admitted to Gandhi Hospital or Fever Hospital immediately. He also made them aware of the medical helpline numbers, including ‘104’.

Students were instructed to follow the social distancing norm to the maximum and advised not to venture out or visit crowded places.

Appreciating the key role the pharma industry was playing in the fight against the pandemic, Mr. Rao said that the pharma sector in Telangana not only produced life saving medicines for the domestic market but also exported to many countries.

286,2020/03/26,TSRTC staff entrusted with milk supply face problems,"Employees of the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation tasked with transporting milk cans to different locations in the State have been facing problems reporting to duty, with police stopping them from reaching their destinations on account of lockdown.

Beginning March 24, TSRTC’s Depot Goods Transport vehicles have been ferrying milk cans from Vijaya Dairy in Lalapet several places. DGTs are usually used to transport spare parts from zonal workshops to respective depots.

For instance, on Thursday, the TSRTC earmarked as many as 29 DGTs for transporting milk cans. Additionally, five vehicles per depot are on standby in case of any emergency.

Speaking to The Hindu, Divisional Manager Secunderabad Sudha P said, “Several RTC employees have been facing problems in reporting to work as they are being stopped by police. It becomes difficult for them to explain that they are only going to respective depots to work. Every depot has around 15 employees such as drivers, mechanics and electricians, working. For buses to run, staff has to come.”

An officer said that the confusion over turning back TSRTC employees could stem from the fact that since public transport – including TSRTC buses – have been directed to not ply the roads, police are instructing employees of the transport juggernaut reporting to work to stop.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/tsrtc-staff-entrusted-with-milk-supply-face-problems/article31176079.ece

Social workers who were trying to help out people affected by the lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19 pandemic were beaten up near Toli Chowki and Shastripuram areas of the city. While Sajjad was beaten in the Shastripuram area, Syed Bilal was thrashed near the Toli Chowki flyover.

“We got information about people running out of rations; so our team went to distribute dry rations in Shastripuram area when Sajjad was attacked. Other members of our team faced similar problems in other areas of the city,” said Maria Tabbassum of Access Foundation and NGO. “Our people on the field did not know how to get passes. This is an emergency situation and we thought helping others should not be a problem but Sajjad got beaten up very badly,” said Ms. Tabbassum, showing images of welts on Sajjad’s arms and legs.

The police department has announced a system where e-commerce site vendors and those exempted under the essential services category can get passes. However, the information about the system to get the passes remains limited and there were glitches. One person who tried to access the pass got a message on the app: “We are not operational due to restrictions...”

“I was returning from Toli Chowki where my friend Arun gave me money for rations for food when the police attacked me at 2.30 p.m. I stopped but still they kept on beating me,” said Syed Bilal, who pools money and arranges food near the Maternity Hospital and Niloufer Hospital. “Many attenders and poor people near these hospitals need food now.

289,2020/03/26,Thousands of foreign returnees untraceable,"The addresses they gave have changed since the issue of passports

A number of persons who recently returned to the city from foreign countries could have escaped the State government’s radar as their addresses have changed since the issue of passport.

While Health and GHMC authorities are not responding to queries, an unofficial estimate put the number around 5,000, which accounts for almost half of the number of persons identified as recent returnees. Officials under the condition of anonymity confirmed this and informed that addresses collected from passengers while de-boarding at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) turned out to be false. Details of several persons who de-boarded at airports other than RGIA are missing too.

GHMC Commissioner D.S. Lokesh Kumar, during a media interaction a week ago, put the figure of identified foreign returnees at close to 10,000. Surveillance teams have been appointed in all the 150 divisions of GHMC to trace the foreign returned and ask them to stay in home quarantine, in view of the COVID-19 pandemic in the city. Each team comprises members drawn from Health and Police departments, besides GHMC, and visits the homes of all the identified households.

Since Wednesday, the teams have started pasting posters at the entrances of the respective homes, identifying the persons home quarantined therein, so that visitors would avoid the homes, and neighbours can keep a watch. Passport details of the returnees who went missing are being shared with the Police by the Immigration wing, who, together with GHMC staff, have embarked upon the task of tracing them down. Sources inform that so far, only about 5,000 foreign returnees could be traced in the city, with the rest at large.

“Quite a few addresses given in the passports were not permanent addresses. The residents are not found there any more,” a team member informed. At times it was found that students from outside studying in coaching centres here, gave their temporary addresses in the city for the issue of passports.

Addresses in the passports issued with Aadhaar linkage too were found to be old. At several places, the residents shifted from the rented accommodation, and sometimes, they sold away their old houses. At one address, the house was found to have been already demolished, shared a source.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/thousands-of-foreign-returnees-untraceable/article31175959.ece
290,2020/03/26,Grocery store owners have a reason to smile,"Lockdown has resulted in higher than normal sales, many outlets double up as makeshift vegetable markets

The mom-and-pop grocery store owners are perhaps the only businessmen who are smiling as Hyderabad goes into a grim lockdown to prevent the spread of Novel Coronavirus pandemic. “We are having higher than normal sales. I just wish I had more stocks and more space to store them. Everything is moving fast from agarbatti to rice to soaps to milk. We are selling more milk than earlier,” says Mahender Reddy, who runs a small retail outlet near the Eshwar Theatre.

Sensing an opportunity, other businessmen are turning their shops into grocery and vegetable outlets. “I have a tailoring and maggam unit but that cannot be kept open. For the past four days I am buying vegetables from Gudimalkapur and selling them here. It is better than having no work,” says Sukhinder.

A few yards from his shop is Anoop, the owner of Balaji Selection, a cloth store that dealt with school uniforms. Now, Anoop is selling vegetables neatly laid out in front of his shop. “There is no trouble selling vegetables. The only condition is I have to close by 6 p.m. when the police patrol van comes this way and orders us to shut down,” says Anoop, who has turned his shop into vegetable mart over the last three days.

Many of the grocery owners rue the short notice they got to stock up. “We went to Medak for a family event and rushed back after hearing about Janata Curfew. We did not anticipate this longer lockdown and frenzy of buying; and we don’t have enough stocks. Otherwise, we would have done more business,” says Chandrasekhar at his family run outlet near Nalanda Nagar.

291,2020/03/26,"Under lockdown, grocery deliveries become scarce","Tagging IT Minister K T Rama Rao and city police in twitter, people seek free movement of delivery vehicles

Hundreds of customers of online supermarkets in the city faced massive problems with grocery deliveries either getting cancelled or ordering disabled as the lockdown due to COVID-19 came into effect.

Several customers of Big Basket and Grofers took to social media and brought the issue to the attention of the authorities, including the police. Many shared screenshots which purportedly showed that the store was facing problems in delivering the groceries due to “restrictions imposed by local authorities on the movement of goods in spite of clear guidelines provided by central authorities to enable essential services”.

Tagging IT Minister K T Rama Rao, a twitter user Siva Krishna wrote, “Why you are (City Police) blocking goods delivery services like Big Basket even though central government allowed them to deliver? How the whole Hyderabad is going to get Groceries and Vegetables? Please answer. #CoronavirusLockdown @KTRTRS @hydcitypolice @bigbasket_com (sic).”

Another twitter user by the name M Venkat Kumar expressed his exasperation and tweeted that both online and offline grocery stores were running out of stocks, and wondered what options are available. Ashhar Farhan, co-founder of Daana, a small and marginal farmers’ collective, said that his organisation has been facing difficulties sending consignments of rice, dals, atta, and cooking oil to warehouses and godowns of online grocery stores. “This problem began on Saturday. It is not just the delivery boy who is facing problems, it is the entire supply chain. Movement from transportation of goods all the way to delivery to the customer’s doorstep must be ensured,” he said.

Taking stock of the situation, IT Secretary Jayesh Ranjan took to twitter to ensure free movement of delivery vehicles. “All delivery ecom companies pl obtain movement passes for your essential staff and vehicles by sending a mail to covid19.hyd@gmail.com with required details: name, vehicle number, route & company name (sic),” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/under-lockdown-grocery-deliveries-become-scarce/article31175887.ece

The zone, on an average every month, ferries around 80 milk containers having a capacity of either 40,000 litres or 44,660 litres by weekly/daily express trains from Renigunta to New Delhi. But now since all the passenger carrying trains have been cancelled, transportation of milk has also been stopped for past few days.

The Railway Board was contacted by the SCR authorities about the issue and it was decided to put in motion a special container train to make up for the non-transport in the last few days. General Manager Gajanan Mallya directed the staff at both Guntakal division and at the headquarters here to prepare for milk tankers fit for loading with all necessary safety precautions.

Railway officials coordinated with local consigners to mobilise the milk offered for loading in six milk tankers at the earliest. These efforts have yielded results and finally the milk tanker special train containing six tankers depart Renigunta on Thursday.” The special train would be moved at an average speed of 110 kmph to reach the destination i.e., Hazarat Nizamuddin, at the earliest,” said Chief PRO Ch.

293,2020/03/26,‘Priority is on motivating police force’,"Daily I am conducting a set conference with our stressed men, says Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic)

Top brass in the police department presently has a tough job on its hands as the force on the ground is stressed and ‘scared’ from their new and additional responsibilities. The officers said they were having to go into overdrive to motivate the staff at a time of such high risk of cronavirus spread in Telangana.

Sensitive task

A few officers stated that motivating their men during this crisis situation is important and a sensitive task to do.

“In this situation, we cannot talk to everyone in person, but are making sure that our message reaches the last home guard officer on the ground,” they said.

Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Anil Kumar told The Hindu that stress is part and parcel of their job, but currently, it is more challenging due to the need to contain the virus.

“Every day I’m conducting a set (wireless) conference with our men for at least 45 minutes asking them to take precautionary measures for their own safety and safety of others,” Mr. Kumar said, adding that constant communication with ground-level staff is very important.

He said that with the onset of summer they are supplying buttermilk and bottled water to traffic policemen and whoever is falling sick is asked to take leave for a day or two.

Sufficient supply

Mr. Kumar said he noticed several police officers not wearing mask despite having a sufficient supply to each police station in the city. “They should not go overconfident and always wear mask and maintain personal hygiene,” he said.

When asked if the force is ‘scared’ about the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic and worried to perform duties, Mr. Kumar said the motivation level of the State police force is very high and they are really working hard.

Meanwhile, Bhadradri-Kothagudem SP Sunil Dutt said people should not step out of their houses without valid reason.

“They must stay in and be safe,” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/p5wzdz/article31176701.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27HYSTRESS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/motivating-stressed-and-worried-force-is-very-important-police-bosses/article31175659.ece
294,2020/03/26,Forgotten heroes of battle against COVID-19,"Left to their fate by GHMC, garbage collectors work against all odds

Paslawath Satyam’s day begins at 5 a.m. daily. He downs a cup of steaming ‘chai’ at the roadside tea shop, before taking out his SAT (Swachh Auto Tipper) vehicle, a sanitised nomenclature for a mini-garbage truck.

Since then, he and his wife Kamala make rounds of the 300 buildings allotted to him at Abhyudaya Nagar Colony, collect garbage, segregate, take out the plastic that they can resell, and dump the rest at the designated transfer station. By the time they are finished, the clock strikes noon, till when they would not have eaten even a morsel.

“In fact, nowadays, we have to forgo our morning tea, as the tea stalls are often closed. We do not eat anything while on duty, and have lunch only after we reach home and wash ourselves thoroughly,” says Satyam. This cardinal rule of personal hygiene alone is what seems to be protecting 3,000 garbage collectors in city.

“We too get scared listening to the news about coronavirus outbreak. Who wouldn’t? But we cannot sit at home because if we do, garbage will pile up in all streets, and RWAs will complain endlessly,” says G. Chinna Rangaswamy, another garbage collector in the Cantonment area who covers Sripuri Colony of Kakaguda near Karkhana.

“Despite exercising extreme caution to remain safe while collecting garbage, we nevertheless have this feeling that death might strike us any day,” he says. After the lockdown, thankfully, they have stopped rummaging through the trash for plastic, as there wouldn’t be any buyer.

GHMC, which has provided hazmat suits to its disaster response forces while spraying disinfectant, and supplied the sanitation staff with masks and gloves, has left the garbage collectors to their fate. With no protective gear, handkerchiefs double up as masks, and plastic sheets are improvised as shoes. While not employed with GHMC, all the SAT drivers-cum-owners are under the control of the corporation’s sanitation wing, by virtue of being at the primary level of garbage collection.

“I take ₹70 per month from each household. If I have to climb upstairs to collect, it will be ₹100. Last time when we asked the RWAs to hike the price, they complained to GHMC, and we were dissuaded by the sanitation officials,” Satyam says. The price per household too is not standardised across the city and varies based on the locality. “We must work against all odds, because that’s our livelihood. We are not salaried employees to work from home,” he says.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/lxpqhy/article31176799.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-COVID-GARBAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/forgotten-heroes-of-battle-against-covid-19/article31175399.ece

Apollo Hospitals Group has announced a new initiative - Project Kavach (shield) - a comprehensive and integrated response plan and approach to protect people across the nation from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The plan encompasses all aspects from information, preventive measures, online self-assessment for risk, testing, isolation/quarantine rooms, treatment and hospital beds, and ICU facilities for serious patients.

‘Never been seen in the last 100 years’

Making the announcement in a virtual press conference on Thursday with top management from Chennai and Hyderabad, Group Chairman Dr.Prathap C Reddy said: “The pandemic we are seeing now has never been seen before in the last 100 years. Apollo Hospital Group has been leveraging its experience of the last 30 years and its protocols for the safety of patients and health personnel to face the unprecedented challenge of COVID-19. The Apollo’s family of doctors, technologists, pharmacy have come together with their expertise and commitment to face the challenge and tackle it successfully,” he said.

Congratulating the Prime Minister and Chief Ministers for many bold steps including lockdown for containing the spread of coronavirus, Dr. Reddy said they would work with the Government and use the Group’s technology and Artificial Intelligence to reassure people through sample collection facility at their homes, testing clinics and in-patient service.

Fighting for generations

Further, “We are fighting a war not just for this generation but also for the generations to come. The pandemic knows no borders, makes no distinction between religion, caste creed or social status. It will require all of us to come together to break the chain,” Dr. Reddy said.

Project Kavach is the Group’s pledge and will augment the Government’s initiatives to address the COVID-19 pandemic. “All other private hospitals are also doing their best,” he said.

Shobana Kamineni, Executive Vice Chairperson, Apollo Hospitals Group said they designed an AI-based coronavirus Risk Assessment and it is available in the form of an App and on the website and guide individuals about the potential risk through simple interactive questions. Based on the risk people are guided to contact the certified help centre.

Tele-consultation

She said over 8.5 million people across 30 countries had already gone through screening on the Apollo 24x7 app and website, and it is expected that over 10 million Indians will use the scan to know their risk score. The group also offers virtual and tele-consultation with all doctors at Apollo Hospitals to enable people seek healthcare from home.

All the 3,800 Apollo Pharmacy outlets across 18 States will serve people with medicines, consumables. Stocks have been doubled, prices are being monitored strictly, and home delivery capability has been enhanced to even serve 10 lakh people if needed.

Sangita Reddy, JMD of the Group said most Apollo Centres have been cleared for COVID-19 testing and full scale testing would start by end of March. There would be provision for home collection of samples and drive through testing in accordance with government guidelines for testing.

Dedicated fever clinics were being set up to screen people and those who qualify for tests would pay the government recommended charges.

5,000 rooms across the country

With more screening, more positive cases may come up and the Group would launch isolation rooms in the vicinity of Apollo Hospitals with medical supervision for quarantine on Saturday. This would address the situation where over 50 per cent of cases would need only isolation and medication. The isolation rooms Project Stay-I would come up in Chennai, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Bangalore and Delhi starting with 50 each and going up by 50 rooms every three days to reach a target of 5,000 rooms across the country.

Suneeta Reddy, MD, said over 250 hospital beds were kept aside for COVID-19 patients and it could be ramped up to 500 if needed. The group has 1,000 ventilators and enough of them could be freed for COVID19 -patients since only emergency cases are being taken up at present.

When asked what kind of support they were expecting from the government, Dr. Reddy said: “The government was aware that the health care sector was going through trying times. It’s support would not stop with COVID-19 alone, and the sector would require its support to tackle all illnesses of people all through.”",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/apollo-hospitals-launches-project-kavach/article31172439.ece
297,2020/03/26,Telangana Police to begin online monitoringof air passengers through TSCOP,"22,000 international air passengers who had landed at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport from March 1 will be located and monitored

In the next two to three days, Telangana police would start online monitoring of the movements of all persons who had flown into Hyderabad from different parts of the world in the backdrop of increasing number of COVID-19 cases.

Details of international air passengers became crucial for the government since a majority of the coronavirus positive cases reported so far directly or indirectly involved them. Central intelligence agencies passed on details of all international air passengers who landed at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Shamshabad from March 1.

Some from neighbouring states

“We have details of close to 22,000 international air passengers with us. They are being located based on their passport addresses,” a police officer unwilling to be named said. Inquiries revealed that not all of them were residing in Telangana. Police believe a considerable number of these 22,000 passengers belonged to neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka.

After landing in Hyderabad, they are said to have gone to their homes in these States. Despite serious efforts, Telangana police could not trace nearly 10,000 of them. However, addresses of nearly 12,000 passengers had been traced and their co-ordinates are being geo-tagged by the respective local police patrolling teams.

Patrolling teams to monitor

District-wise details of the passengers had been passed on to Police, Revenue and Health Department officials. A local police patrolling team would go to the address, upload details of the passengers in their tabs. The data would be synchronised with TSCOP, a mobile application of Telangana Police. Everyday local police patrolling teams would visit the address, collect details of the person and alert the higher authorities in case of any emergency or developments.

In fact, a Hyderabad-based software developing company approached the Telangana High Court by filing a PIL petition stating that it had developed a mobile app to monitor COVID-19 cases. To make use of the app, the air passengers need to download the app in their mobile phones so that their movements can be tracked.

Updating TSCOP App

“All passengers are unlikely to agree to download a new app citing privacy reasons. In a first step towards online monitoring of air passengers, we are updating the TSCOP app,” police officials said. Identifying high risk zones would be made easier with the geo-tagging of addresses of the passengers, they added.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/6p5r1g/article31175911.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-EMPTY-ROAD-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/telangana-police-to-start-online-monitoring/article31171889.ece

Police sources said that the victim Koppula Venkatesh (55) residing in Kashmirgadda locality came to the rythu bazaar to purchase vegetables for Ugadi festival following the relaxation of curfew from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. After reaching rythu bazaar, he developed severe heart stroke and collapsed and was seeking assistance. But none of the passersby at the busy vegetable market went to his rescue.

All the people who came to the market area were busy making purchases and were scared to even touch the victim fearing that he might have been infected with the dreaded coronavirus. After knowing about the incident, the police rushed to the spot with an ambulance and found him dead and later shifted him to the government headquarters hospital mortuary for autopsy.

It may be recalled that Karimnagar town is reeling under fear psychosis with 10 Indonesians who roamed in the town testing positive and another person, who was also associated with the Indonesians testing positive for COVID-19. Already, the district administration had sealed off some localities in Mukarampura, Kashmirgadda covering three municipal divisions where the Indonesians had moved about. The authorities are providing essentials to the residents at their doorstep and not allowing them to move out of their localities to avoid the spread of the virus.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/stroke-victim-dies-due-to-covid-19-apathy/article31169394.ece

301,2020/03/26,Santoor maestro Abhay Sopori is using his time to complete his thesis on Kashmiri music and culture,"Strings from Kashmir

Abhay Sopori, 40, from the Sufiana Gharana of Kashmir’s music tradition, who won the Gandhi Global Peace Prize earlier this year, is working towards completing his thesis on the music and culture of his home state. He will submit it to Pracheen Kala Kendra in Chandigarh soon. Currently at his Lodhi residence, he says he hopes to develop this into a book. Excepts from a phone conversation.

How will students of classical music, unfamiliar with Kashmiriyat (cultural values) benefit from this?

My research work will first compel historians to revisit their opinion with regard to Kashmiri culture. Musicians, musicologists, and other research scholars will get a new insight. This will lead to new research works on Kashmiri music being analysed on the basis of facts rather than opinions and illusions.

How many hours of study and research you are putting in?

I write and research for my thesis from 9 p.m. and it goes on till 3 or 4 a.m.. I also study post lunch with brief gaps. Right now I am planning to organize festivals and artist line-up, venues, for both for SaMaPa Sangeet Sammelan to be held in November 2020 in Delhi, as well as the SaMaPa festivals in Jammu and Kashmir. I am devoting around 10 hours to my research work, four to five hours to riyaz (music practice).

Why do you say that Kashmiri music and culture has been distorted?

Kashmir and its culture, unfortunately, has mostly been described by non-Kashmiris. Thus there has always been a bias in writing the history of Kashmir, especially music. Take for example the santoor, where all non-Indian historians called it a Persian instrument that came to India from Iran. To further distort our history, many Indians, even some santoor players, said the same. My research work will establish that the Indian santoor has Kashmiri origins.

How are you bringing out the syncretic traditions of Kashmir?

Post 1990, both communities [Hindus and Muslims] lost the balance of communal oneness in Kashmir, as they were not together. We need to grow in a mature, intelligent, and humane way and for that love is important. Love comes when we have inner peace. Peace comes through patience. Patience comes through creative arts where music plays the most important role. That’s the philosophy of my life and that’s what I am doing even through my thesis.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/9g90z5/article31164679.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ABHAYSOPORI,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/santoor-maestro-abhay-sopori-is-using-his-time-to-complete-his-thesis-on-kashmiri-music-and-culture/article31174995.ece
302,2020/03/26,Chennai musician Mr Kev locks himself in a room until he completes ‘Quarantino’ album,"City musician Mr Kev has locked himself in a room until he finishes his album. On Day 8, we check how ‘Quarantino’ is progressing

Five days before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that India would go under a three-week lockdown to curb the spread of Coronavirus, a musician in Chennai imposed one on himself. Kevin Paul aka Mr Kev stepped inside his one-room apartment and decided: “I am not coming out of this room until I finish my album.”

For the seventh day today, Mr Kev is cooped up in a box, determined to get out only when he finishes seven songs for his new album, unofficially titled Quarantino. And the entire process is being video streamed live on Instagram (@kevsleepin) every day.

In a psychology experiment of sorts, we get to see him in the windowless air-conditioned room for eight to 10 hours a day. He is surrounded by artwork that ranges from the basic AC/DC, The Who and Sarah Jane posters, to the personal: pieces made by his former students (he was a teacher before he quit his job two years ago, to be a musician). Some are downright bizarre: “I put up a collage of wrappers that you get with burgers, and tags that come with clothes and bags.”

We see him working on his music most of the time, but also measuring cups of rice to put on the electric cooker, talking on the phone, munching on snacks and sometimes Blair-Witch-Project close to the camera, to read the comments on his Live. “How’s it coming, Kev?” ask most of them.

“Four of the seven songs are almost ready, one definitely is. I’ll send it to you,” Kev sounds groggy over the phone, when I ask him the same question. I have just woken him up after a late night, and the daily Live hasn’t started yet.

Having collaborated with Anand Kasinath, whose forte is electronic music production, Kevin says this album will be different from his previous work. He will step away from his indie style for a bit to sound more post-modern pop. “Anand was actually with me in this room on Day 1, when we started. But he has the problem of wheezing, and needs fresh air. My room does not have windows, so he had to leave. Now he is working from a friend’s place,” says Kevin.

When he started, Kevin was sure he would be out in three days. It turned out to be not that simple. “I have never worked like this, ever. I normally take months to finish a project: in terms of words, melody, getting feedback, and improving on it.”

So how many days until he finishes his album? “Not more than three, I hope,” he says, joking, “Even God rested after seven days.” Which is why he is hoping to do as many collaborations as possible. He has so far worked with Vaisakh Somnath for a Tamil song, and his mentor Raemus Castelino, among others. While it is a great help, it is also a challenge, he says, to not be physically working together. “I don’t want it to sound like I just sent a sample, and they added their bits on to it. It should flesh out their talent as well, and do justice to their body of work.”

He admits he did not realise the difficulties until he locked himself in, but is adamant to stick to the challenge. “I have a huge ego! If I got inside with the one-track mind of finishing this album, I will achieve that goal, even if it is sub-par work,” he says, impressing this writer who understands creative blocks all too well.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/y0db6n/article31173017.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/P1030732,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/mr-kev-locks-himself-in-a-room-until-he-completes-quarantino-album/article31173019.ece
303,2020/03/26,Bryan Adams regales on Instagram in the wake of social distancing,"One song a day: The Canadian singer’s initiative offers notes of comfort to tackle COVID-19 pandemic

People say we got it made;

Don’t they know we’re so afraid; Isolation ...

John Lennon wrote this in 1970 and would never have fathomed that the lyrics would haunt humanity five decades later. Eversince World Health Organisation (WHO) called for ‘isolation’ in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic hitting the world, Canadian singer, songwriter, philanthropist and activist Bryan Adams, who otherwise is constantly on tours, is house bound and has connected with his fans by rendering the late Lennon’s number on his Instagram.

His fans across the world couldn’t have asked for more. They pleaded that he present one song a day to help them cope with isolation blues. Bryan was too happy to oblige and invited requests: “If you have suggestions to any songs that are relative to this troubled time, you’re welcome to suggest them to me,” he posted while rendering Bob Marley’s ‘Natural Mystic’.

Bryan’s next number ‘All Things Must Pass’, a song by George Harrison stuck the right chord. With a hashtag #songsofisolation Bryan’s healing through music continues.

He picked ‘Stay Away’ of Nirvana, ‘Isolation’ by Joy division and the latest one he posted is ‘Doom and Gloom’ by the Rolling Stones. He even posts lyrics of the songs he’s rendering.

Bryan, who’s also a vegan, holds forth on his campaign against wet markets with this post: “Let’s not forget this virus comes from an open wet market where animals and fish of all descriptions are sold together either dead or alive. This has been going on for decades and as a result, so have these viruses. #closewetmarkets.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/705a0z/article31171845.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Bryan-Adams,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/bryan-adams-regales-on-instagram-one-song-a-day/article31171846.ece

Composer-singer Amit Trivedi has announced the launch of his own music label, AT Azaad, under which he plans to release his independent music.

Through a video message on Twitter, he said, “I’ve been composing music for feature films since 2007. I’ve been creating music for films for 13 years and I totally enjoy and love doing that. However, I have a lot of music inside me which I want to share with you all in a different way.”

305,2020/03/26,There is a reason why the Trickster Orchestra is scouting the globe for musical innovators,"Turning new tricks, constantly There is a reason why the Trickster Orchestra is scouting the globe for innovators

With a name like Trickster Orchestra, one should expect flamboyant music of the theatrical kind. However, this Berlin-based collective founded by Cymin Samawatie and Ketan Bhatti, is more than that. The Trickster Orchestra is where the experimental ideas of creative minds from around the world come to take shape.

Cymin Samawatie and Ketan Bhatti were recently in Bengaluru in their quest to identify like-minded artistes. “First of all we are here to meet people, get a feel of the country. I think that is the most important thing when you want to be influenced. Our work is to bring people together who usually wouldn’t get in touch with each other,” says Cymin, adding, “When that happens there is a possibility of transformation and a chance that something new and unique is created.”

“We work with musicians and their region-specific instruments — from China, Arabia and Western Europe. When the folk music of Syria is presented with the 20th Century music of Germany, a mimetic process is underway,” says Ketan.

According to Ketan, mimesis or the act of imitation is actually a transformation of one’s self into the person or act they are trying to emulate. “Here is when one begins to think outside the box. When a trombone player from Berlin meets a koto (13-stringed traditional Japanese instrument) player, there is a moment of innovation. Each is playing in a way that will accomodate the other’s sounds. This process is interesting and we strive to put people in this situation,” he says.

“Every culture, musical genre, discipline of art, and of course, every person, is never static. Keeping this in mind, these transformations are a way to develop an understanding of each other,” says Ketan.

“What happens if an Indian sitar player is not just playing the sitar according to the tenets of Indian classical music, but in another contex? In such a situation, a musician may find a new technique and bring out sounds unlike what they are normally used to hearing,” says Cymin.

Trickster believes that by putting such musicians together, one finds out what they didn’t know so far and they learn from that process, fostering a greater understanding as a result. But for Ketan and Cymin, there is more to this exercise than just a collaboration of like-minded artistes.

Cymin says, “We both are composers and this process has helped change the way we create music. I remember how the German bass flute sounded together with the clarinet. That is a sound I will never lose because I was there when those musicians were searching for something new. And as a result, I too, have something new to build on while I am composing a tune.”

Trickster Orchestra was founded in 2013 and while the duo have been working largely with musicians, their projects also include artists, poets and the spoken word.

“We started working with musicians in Berlin, who have a migrant history. Using their traditional instruments, our work progressed so we now have a grant from Munich to search for others interested in new ways of playing and collaboration,” says Ketan.

Last year, they visited Bangkok and this year, it was India. A few musicians from India will be invited to stay in Berlin for a week, where they will develop a programme together. “Next year, we will go to another place and the year after, to yet another one. It is an endless journey,” says Cymin.

Why the name? “Every culture has the notion of a trickster who thinks out of box, who believes in bending rather than breaking the rules. The trickster has a radical approach or is just curious, like a child spills water not because he’s naughty, but because he wants to see what happen to water on the ground,” says Ketan.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/515qas/article31170630.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGMTRICK1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/meet-trickster-orchestra-which-is-scouting-the-globe-for-innovators/article31170634.ece
306,2020/03/26,Poor compliance with norms forces police to intensify drive,"Vehicles seized at picket points taken to police stations

The number of police pickets has been increased in the city and rural areas following poor compliance with lockdown norms by a section of the motorists.

All vehicles, except those for emergency or essential services, will be stopped at picket points for checking as part of intensifying the drive.

Some of the vehicles which were blocked at picket points on Thursday were taken to nearby police stations. Vehicles seized for violation of norms will be released only after the lockdown period.

The total number of such cases registered in Kozhikode city was 338 on Wednesday, which was the highest in the State.

Policemen posted at one of the picket points said some of the motorists were giving silly reasons for roaming around. There were also incidents in which drivers tried to tell lies and escape from legal action, they said.

Officers coordinating enforcement actions said private vehicle owners would be allowed to go only after the submission of the prescribed self-declaration form explaining the purpose of travel, address and other details. Those who do not keep the declaration form would not be allowed to resume their journey, they said.

Road passes

According to officials, road passes too would be made mandatory for those in need of daily travel by private vehicles. The national Informatics Centre would soon come up with an online service to apply for such road passes, officials said.

They also warned youths who were found on roads in the name of charity work without the authorisation of the district administration. Vehicles used for charitable purposes would be allowed to proceed only on production of certificates issued by local body secretaries concerned. For inter-district or inter-State travel, the certificate issued by the District-level Transportation Committee should be produced, they said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/n7ck81/article31175454.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27CTMOTORISTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/poor-compliance-with-norms-forces-police-to-intensify-drive/article31175455.ece
307,2020/03/26,Over 90% of rough sleepers shifted to care homes,"The district administration’s project to give temporary shelter with food and emergency medical support for the city’s rough sleepers during the lockdown period is nearing completion. Around 500 persons who were roaming around the streets have so far benefited from the drive.

All arrangements have been put in place using buildings of Government Physical Education College and three other hostels at East Hill to care for the elderly and those suffering from various ailments. Volunteers and charity organisations appointed by the district administration will bear the daily expenses for caring the destitute.

Officials with the Social Justice Department who coordinate the drive said more than 90% of the total wanderers in Kozhikode city had been relocated to temporary facilities. Health officials screened all of them before their entry into care homes, officials said.

The Health Department will assign doctors to regularly monitor accommodated persons. A team of volunteers too is ready to take care of them. As of now, none of them has been included in the quarantine list.

The district administration decided to shift rough sleepers to care homes following reports that the majority of them were struggling to get food, medical aid and sanitation facilities after the national lockdown following COVID-19 spread. Many of them were solely depending on food and medical aid offered by charitable organisations.

The support of the city police too was sought to find out rough sleepers and convince them of the safety requirement. Police officials from Town Station said there was no reluctance on the part of street dwellers as all of them were convinced of the situation and the need for a safe shelter to overcome the COVID-19 threat.

According to the police, most of the rough sleepers in Kozhikode city were using the available open space near the Kozhikode railway station and mofussil bus stand for their night stay. Their insecure stay without adopting any preventive measure against COVID-19 was assessed as a safety challenge for public health, which eventually resulted in their speedy rehabilitation, they said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/fz6vj0/article31175437.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27CTROUGHSLEEPERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/over-90-of-rough-sleepers-shifted-to-care-homes/article31175438.ece

The MCH block in the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, has been converted as a facility to treat only COVID-19 cases.

District Medical Officer V. Jayasree said in a release on Wednesday that outpatient services would continue to be available at the hospital. Services of the gynaecology and paediatrics departments would not be available at the Government General Hospital from now on. They would be available at the Government Hospital for Women and Children at Kottaparamba in the city.

The specialty OP services and casualty services at the MCH would be available at the superspecialty block and at the General Hospital. If the number of COVID-19 patients went up, more isolation wards would be set up at the General Hospital. If more number of patients came to the MCH, the less severe cases would be shifted to the General Hospital.

Database

Unused ventilators at other hospitals would be shifted to the General Hospital. The district programme manager of Arogya Keralam had been asked to prepare a database of critical care specialist doctors in Kozhikode and train them in handling ventilator care and critical care. All the private hospitals should be ready to handle emergency cases and all the major ones should have the minimum isolation facilities. It should also be ensured that non-COVID-19 emergency cases were not left out.

Dr. Jayasree said that all diseases other than those with COVID-19 symptoms could be treated at nearby taluk hospitals and community health centres (CHC). OP services would be available at CHCs and primary health centres till 6 p.m. and in-patient treatment too would be offered at all CHCs.

Calisthenics, comprising a variety of exercises such as push-ups and squats, can be done indoors with minimal requirement for any equipment. One also needs to follow a balanced diet.

Walker’s Club president A.A.G. Rajkumar points to household activities such as cleaning and gardening to keep oneself fit.

Nutritionist D. Mouna adds that it is not necessary to go to a gym to be fit. Simple exercises at home is enough.

NAGERCOIL

A 40-year-old man, who had returned from Kuwait recently and had been admitted to the isolation ward of Kanniyakumari District Government Medical College Hospital at Asaripallam here died on Thursday.

Sources in the hospital said the deceased, who was admitted to the isolation ward with liver ailments on Tuesday on his return from Kuwait on March 3, developed breathing difficulty and the toxicity levels in his blood increased menacingly. Though he was asymptomatic for COVID–19, he was admitted to the isolation ward as he had returned from the Middle East. His blood and saliva samples were sent for analysis.

He did not respond to treatment and died on Thursday even before the results were made available, the sources said.

Meanwhile, Kanniyakumari district police have started using drones to monitor those who are riding bikes when the nationwide lockdown is in force. Superintendent of Police K. Shreenath, who formally inaugurated monitoring of the public with drones at Vadasery bus stand on Thursday, said those who were violating the lockdown order would be booked with the videos the police could get from the drones.

320,2020/03/26,This good samaritan feeds the homeless and hungry,"As the poor, the homeless and labourers start gathering in front of Amma Unavagam at Jawahar Grounds in Palayamkottai for breakfast, an AIADMK functionary awaits their arrival with tokens to buy and distribute idlis to them.

When the frail-looking customers return in the afternoon, the functionary again distributes tokens — this time for sambar rice and curd rice.

This is happening at all 10 Amma Unavagams in Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai after prohibitory orders were issued following a nationwide lockdown in the wake of COVID-19. The impoverished section of society, rendered jobless due to the closure, are able to enjoy free breakfast and lunch, thanks to AIADMK Tirunelveli urban district secretary N. Ganesa Raja, who foots the bill.

Sensing that the deserted roads and downed shutters of business establishments, particularly roadside eateries, have made the street people’s existence bleak, he has decided to serve free-of-cost food to them.

Under the arrangement, the Amma Unavagams will collectively serve 15,000 idlis in the morning and 5,000 sambar and curd rice plates in the afternoon. Mr. Ganesa Raja, who has purchased tokens for the quantity, distributes the food to the customers through party functionaries posted there.

The daily bill: ₹15,000 for idlis, ₹25,000 for sambar rice and ₹15,000 for curd rice.

“Amma [late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa] started the community kitchen, where food is served at heavily subsidised cost, with the objective of feeding the poor. Her dream was ‘peace, prosperity and progress’. Hunger is the obstacle in achieving our late leader’s dream. It is an opportunity for me to alleviate the hunger of the poor and I am doing it with a deep sense of satisfaction,” says Mr. Ganesa Raja, a renowned organic farmer.

Even late-comers do not leave with empty stomach.

On Thursday, for instance, when he comes out of Amma Unavagam at Jawahar Grounds in Palayamkottai around 10.30 a.m., he encounters three labourers at the entrance. As breakfast is over, he gives them money to buy snacks and tea and tokens for lunch. He then leaves for the next Amma Unavagam in Melapalayam.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/this-good-samaritan-feeds-the-homeless-and-hungry/article31174506.ece
321,2020/03/26,Precautionary measures implemented at Amma Unavagams,"With the closure of restaurants, a steady stream of people, mostly migrants and daily wage earners, throng the 12 Amma Unavagams across the city.

According to officials, there is an increase in footfall at these centres, where all precautionary measures, including social distancing, are strictly being enforced.

Due to increase in footfall since Thursday, extra sambar rice has been prepared for an additional 50 people for lunch and 200 more idlis for breakfast, N. Saravanakumari, who works at the centre at Arapalayam, says. “While there is a dip in the number of regular customers, a considerable number of new ones, mostly migrant labourers, are walking in.”

According to a Corporation official, a considerable number of customers come for dinner, which has been introduced in view of the lockdown. At some centres, sales have exceeded the target.

Precautionary measures are being strictly enforced by Corporation officials. They have drawn squares/circles using white chalk from the entrance to the food counter to ensure personal distancing of the customers. Also, customers have to wash their hands using soap before entering the centres.

“To prevent crowding, we recommend customers to bring their own vessels and pack the food. Also, police personnel are regularly monitoring to ensure that they maintain distance from each other,” says S. Govindammal, who works in K. Pudur.

While face masks have been provided to the workers, they cover their hands with plastic covers while serving food. “We also soak all coins paid by customers in a big bucket of disinfectant,” she adds.

The Corporation official also says that the centres are completely disinfected and fumigated after the end of every shift.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/precautionary-measures-implemented-at-amma-unavagams/article31174504.ece
322,2020/03/26,COVID-19 | Special ambulances to cater to those with symptoms of coronavirus,"Field managers coordinating with GHs, PHCs to get ambulances, as call centre is flooded with panic calls

Field managers of 108 ambulance services have geared up to maintain quick and uninterrupted ambulance services as panic calling by people from all over the State under lockdown due to COVID-19 threat has kept its short-staffed call centre very busy.

Meanwhile, the GVK-EMRI ambulance services have earmarked 11 special ambulances to ferry patients who have symptoms of corona virus infection to the government hospitals.

In Tirunelveli division, covering four five districts of Tirunelveli, Virudhuanagar, Thoothukudi, Kanniyakumari and Tenkasi, all 78 ambulances, including one bike ambulance, have been kept in working condition with men and materials.

“In this extraoridinary situation of lockdown, we have ensured that our call centre in Chennai functions round the clock though with limited staff strength. With increased distress calls in the last two days, there are occasions during peak hours that our phones are continuously engaged. People have misconstrued it as if we are not attending to calls,” said its Tirunelveli Programme Manager, Ranjith Viswanath.

In order to ease the situation, the district coordinators have been coordinating with the government hospitals and Primary Health Centres in finding ambulances for them at the earliest.

“Our contact details are available in the GHs and PHCs. In case the hospital authorities find it difficult to get connected to 108 call centre, they call us and the coordinators help them get ambulances,” Mr. Viswanath said. The field managers are getting around 120 calls every day, he added.

Mr. Viswanath also advised people not to get panic if the phone lines in call centres are continuously engaged. “They can reach us through the local GH or PHC,” he said.

The coordinators have been working round the clock to ensure all usual support to the ambulance pilots and emergency medical technicians with fuel, maintenance and medical kits.

Special COVID ambulances

In order to meet the emergency situation, Tirunelveli division has earmarked 11 ambulances exclusively to ferry patients who might have been infected.

The vehicles have been parked at vantage locations in each district. Besides the usual medical kit, the special ambulances have personal protective equipment for the pilot and the EMT. Additionally, the vehicles have disinfectant sprayer guns.

“This arrangement has been made as per the Tamil Nadu government’s instruction to avoid spreading of COVID-19 infection. While the special ambulances would cater only to COVDI-19 patients cases and not other cases, other ambulances would not be used for COVID-19 cases,” Mr. Ranjith said.

After every such person is dropped at hospitals, the ambulance is completely disinfected before attending to the next case, he added.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/j3wzj7/article31171972.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AMBULANCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/covid-19-108-comes-up-with-special-ambulances-to-cater-to-those-with-symptoms-of-coronavirus/article31171973.ece

In the wake of COVID-19, a retired government doctor has closed down his private clinic in a village near Tirupattur in Sivaganga district and self-quarantined with his family at his residence here.

A notice board outside the house of M. Sheik Davooth, who retired as professor of pharmacology from Pudukkottai Government Medical College, says he has gone into self-quarantine along with his family members since Tuesday.

Since his rural clinic does not have any modern facility, he decided to close it down as he cannot ensure safety for himself, staff and patients, he says. “I am not able to identify people falling under category B among patients coming to my hospital. These are people who could have come into contact with those who have infection. Besides, some with infection can be asymptomatic. And some infected with the virus will not have any symptoms in the initial stage.”

The physician says he gets around 40 to 60 patients everyday with all kinds of minor ailments such as cough, cold and fever. “My hospital does not have space to maintain social distancing. This can put everyone’s health at risk. Besides, masks and sanitisers are also not available freely in the market. N95 masks are important to safeguard myself and my staff in the present situation.”

326,2020/03/26,Crisil cuts growth estimate,"Cites pandemic, lowers FY21 outlook to 3.5% from 5.2%

Rating agency Crisil has cut the country’s GDP growth forecast for the next financial year to 3.5% from 5.2% projected earlier, due to the spread of COVID-19.

“We have slashed our base-case gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for fiscal 2021 to 3.5% from the 5.2% expected earlier. This assumes two things: a normal monsoon, and the effect of the pandemic subsiding materially, if not wearing out, in the April-June quarter,” said Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist, Crisil.

Mild recovery in H2

“The slump in growth will be concentrated in the first half of the next fiscal, while the second half should see a mild recovery,” he said.

According to the rating agency, COVID-19 is now the foremost risk for the world economy with multi-dimensional ramifications because, and unlike the global financial crisis of 2008, it has not only slammed the brakes on economic activity and jeopardised financial stability, but also brought with it enormous human suffering not seen in decades.

“Since our last forecast of 5.2% GDP growth for fiscal 2021, the scenario has worsened notably. S&P Global has marked global growth down significantly, predicting a likely recession in the U.S. and the Eurozone, and lowering China’s growth to 2.9% from 4.8% with dominant downside risks,” the rating agency said, adding the pandemic in India and the consequent lockdown for 21 days posed a material risk to India’s economic outlook. The impact of social distancing and decline in discretionary spending will aggravate the downturn in the April-June quarter, and the sharp slowdown in key trading-partner economies will hit exports.

Services, which account for 41% of total exports, have been resilient so far, but a recession in the advanced economies would dampen the prospects for IT-ITeS, tourism and bring down services’ exports growth.

On inflation, Crisil said it may soften in FY21 for three reasons; one, the abnormal surge in food inflation in 2019 has started to correct; two, core inflation will remain moderate with slowing growth; and three, the sharp drop in crude prices will keep fuel inflation soft.

“With base effect also kicking in, the second half of next fiscal should see a perceptible drop in inflation,” the rating agency said.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/crisil-cuts-growth-estimate/article31176140.ece
327,2020/03/26,Coronavirus | Centre rolls out ₹1.7-lakh-crore lockdown package,"Rations doubled for three months; we do not want anyone to remain hungry: Nirmala Sitharaman

The Union government on Thursday announced a ₹1.7 lakh crore package in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and countrywide lockdown, providing free food and cash transfers to support the poorest citizens who are most vulnerable during the crisis.

The food grain ration for 80 crore poor people would be doubled for the next three months, supplemented by a kg of local pulses as well, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Thursday.

The Centre would provide ₹50 lakh medical insurance cover for the next three months for about 22 lakh health workers in government hospitals fighting the spread of the virus at personal risk, including ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers, medical sanitary workers in government hospitals, paramedics, nurses and doctors.

The Pradhan Mantri Gharib Kalyan Yojana had been announced within 36 hours of the lockdown and it would take care of the needs of poor and migrant workers, farmers, women, pensioners, widows and the disabled, said Ms Sitharaman.

“We do not want anyone to remain hungry, so we will be giving enough to take care of their food grain requirement, protein requirement in terms of pulses. On the other hand, they should also not remain without money in hand, so several measures through DBT are being taken so that money reaches them,” she said.

Over the next three months, each person who is covered under the National Food Security Act would get an additional five kg wheat or rice for free, in addition to the 5 kg of subsidised foodgrain already provided through the Public Distribution System (PDS). One kg of pulse a household would also be provided for free, according to regional preferences. This would benefit about 80 crore people, she said.

Cash transfers -- a mix of advances via existing schemes and additional sums -- would also be given to vulnerable groups under the Pradhan Mantri Gharib Kalyan Yojana.

About 3 crore poor pensioners above 60 years, widows and disabled people would be given ₹1000 in two instalments over the next three months. The 20 crore women holding Jan Dhan Yojana accounts would get ₹500 a month over the next three months as well. The 8.3 crore poor households, which received cooking gas connections under the Ujjwala scheme, would now get free gas cylinders for the same period.

Wages were being hiked under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act scheme, from ₹182 to ₹202 a day. Although the Minister said this would provide an additional ₹2000 a worker, many States have in fact closed down MGNREGA worksites to curb the spread of COVID-19, leaving it unclear how many workers would be able to benefit.

For land-owning farmers, there is only the promise that the first instalment of ₹2000 due to them under the PM-KISAN income support scheme will be paid promptly in April, the first month of the financial year.

For small companies with 100 employees or less, of whom 90% earn less than ₹15,000 a month, the Centre will bear the cost of both employer and employee contribution (a total of 24%) to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) for the next three months. This will benefit 80 lakh employees, and incentivise 4 lakh establishments.

In a move to provide relief to all 4.8 crore organised sector workers registered under the EPF, the scheme's regulations will also be amended to allow non-refundable advance of 75% of the amount standing to the credit of the member, or 3 months worth of wages, whichever is lower.

Collateral free loans provided for women self-help groups under the National Rural Livelihood Mission are being doubled to ₹20 lakh, potentially benefiting seven crore households.

Indian shoe majors are in dire straits as many international brands have cancelled a portion of their orders and put on hold the rest for the winter season due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

According to rough estimates, India exports about 130 million pairs of shoes every year, accounting for total revenue of ₹25,000 crore. Two of the big firms — Tata International Ltd.

The State Bank of India and other banks and financial institutions have already infused ₹10,000 crore into the bank after a scheme of reconstruction was announced by the government. The bank was put under moratorium earlier this month following a deterioration in its financial health and later, the government announced a reconstruction scheme to aid the lender’s revival. Prashant Kumar, who was a deputy managing director, SBI, was appointed as the administrator of the bank by the Reserve Bank of India after the moratorium was imposed. He later took charge as the MD & CEO of the private lender.

Yes Bank reported a ₹18,564-crore loss for the third quarter, with gross non-performing assets jumping to ₹40,709 crore, which was 18.87% of gross advance and capital adequacy ratio depleting to 4.1% as on December 31, 2019, way below the minimum regulatory requirement.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/an151r/article31176117.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THBUYES,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/board-okays-yes-bank-plan-to-raise-5000-cr/article31176118.ece
332,2020/03/26,Mega bank consolidation on track; to take effect from April 1: Finance Minister,"The government is not considering extending the deadline despite the coronavirus pandemic, said Nirmala Sitharaman

The government on Thursday said the mega bank consolidation plan is very much on track and will take effect from April 1 despite the onslaught of coronavirus pandemic throwing the country out of gear.

The Union Cabinet earlier this month approved amalgamation of 10 public sector banks into four global size lenders, beginning next financial year.

Asked if the government is considering extending the deadline for merger of public sector banks, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said “at the moment there is nothing on that”.

Banking Secretary Debasish Panda said the merger process was very much on track and expressed hope that the banking sector would be able to meet the challenges thrown by the pandemic.

“That is very much on the track. It’s parallel activity going on. As far as fund transfers, etc, are concerned, necessary arrangements will be made,” Panda said.

The statement assumes significance as there has been demand from some quarters for deferring the deadline due to coronavirus outbreak.

All India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC) on Wednesday requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to defer mega merger exercise of banks in view of coronavirus outbreak.

Banking services across the country are impacted due to COVID-19 as the lockdown is being observed across the country.

Following the consolidation, there will be seven large public sector banks (PSBs), and five smaller ones. There were as many as 27 PSBs in 2017.

As per the mega consolidation plan, Oriental Bank of Commerce and United Bank of India will merge into Punjab National Bank; Syndicate Bank into Canara Bank; Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank into Union Bank of India; and Allahabad Bank into Indian Bank.

The merger will result in creation of seven large PSBs with scale and national reach, with each amalgamated entity having business of over ₹8 lakh crore and it would help create banks with scale comparable to global banks and capable of competing effectively in India and globally.

In addition, consolidation would also provide impetus to amalgamated entities by increasing their ability to support larger ticket-size lending and have competitive operations by virtue of greater financial capacity.

333,2020/03/26,India coronavirus lockdown | Delivery issues add to woes for homebound,"Firms worried over safety of agents.

Many e-commerce firms were forced to suspend deliveries to their customers in major cities across the country on Wednesday with local authorities unable to ensure the safety of delivery persons on the first day of the 21-day nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the coronavirus pandemic.

Angry customers vented their anger on social media even as police services scrambled to put in place a system where delivery persons for online vendors were able to go about their jobs unmolested.

“The key challenge in the field is that sometimes our delivery partners are getting stopped by the police, and some of them have even got beaten up by the police for no fault of theirs,” online grocer BigBasket said in a statement.

“It will help to have better coordination between the Centre and State, and between the State and local police, to ensure that our delivery vans and bikes don’t get stopped by the police,” the firm added.

India coronavirus lockdown | Day 1 live update

Late on Wednesday, the e-commerce firm put out a statement that they were now operational in Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Bhopal, Coimbatore, Indore, Mumbai, Mysuru, Noida, Surat and Vadodara. However, services remained suspended in Chandigarh, Chennai, Delhi, Gurugram, Ludhiana, Pune, Vizag, Hyderabad and Vijayawada.

Earlier, e-commerce major Flipkart announced that it had suspended its services, while rival Amazon India halted orders for non-essential products. Gurugram-headquartered Snapdeal also said it was working towards completing delivery of essential goods.

Coronavirus | What will be available and what will be closed during the 21-day lockdown

“We are an essential service and our delivery persons must be allowed to perform their duty,” Shan Kadavil, CEO & Co-founder, FreshtoHome, said in a statement. “The directive from the top is clear but the implementation on the ground level is different.”

“What China followed to control coronavirus, we must do the same. Home delivery is the only option to prevent the spread. We are forced to stop delivery in almost all parts of India including Pune and Mumbai, other than Bengaluru, because our delivery boys are beaten up by police or they are not allowed to move... hopefully in a day or two, delivery across the country should resume.”

Local hurdles

In Bengaluru, a customer who had ordered groceries and fish online, said that she had been informed by FreshtoHome that they had been unable to deliver despite their best efforts on account of “local authority hurdles”.

Coronavirus | Why 21-day lockdown period?

Confusion prevailed in Bengaluru as most supermarkets remained closed, while those that were open ran out of stocks. The restrictions on the movement of vehicles disrupted the wholesale-retail and farmer-trader supply chains in the city, creating an artificial scarcity, leading to a spurt in prices. A kilogram of tomatoes that were available for ₹25-₹30 a day earlier cost as much ₹80 a kilo on Wednesday.

Working overtime

While major online delivery platforms have been hit hard by bottlenecks in stock procurement, retail stores in Kerala were working overtime to keep the food and grocery delivery chain active despite a surge in online orders.

“We receive an average 300 to 400 orders through online after the doorstep delivery was launched,” said N. B. Swaraj, media co-ordinator of the Lulu Group in Kochi. “There has been an increase in demand after the nationwide lockdown was announced,” he added.

On the availability of stocks, Mr. Swaraj said there was a dip in supply of vegetables following the restrictions imposed at the inter-State borders. “However, we have enough stocks of rice and other essential items,” he added.

Lockdown issues

In Hyderabad, thousands of customers of online supermarkets in the city faced massive problems with grocery deliveries either getting cancelled or disabled on account of the lockdown.

Several customers of BigBasket and Grofers took to social media to bring the issue to the attention of the authorities. Many shared screenshots, which purportedly showed that e-stores were facing problems in delivering the groceries due to “restrictions imposed by local authorities on the movement of goods in spite of clear guidelines provided by central authorities to enable essential services”.

335,2020/03/26,Promoters up stake in firms as markets drop,"Tata firms, Bajaj group, Godrej see buying either by promoters or management

Indian promoters are using the drop in equity markets as an opportunity to consolidate their holdings in group companies.

This comes at a time when the Indian markets have witnessed an unprecedented correction over the last month and a half

Nifty is down 36% from recent highs and many stocks have seen significant correction.

The largest quantum of buying by promoters or top management was witnessed in the Tata Group (Tata Chemicals, Tata Steel, Indian Hotels, Tata Motors, Tata Power and Tata Consumer) and the Bajaj Group (Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Holdings and Bajaj Auto).

Promoters also enhanced their stakes in Mphasis, Maruti Suzuki, Sun Pharma, Godrej Industries, JSW Steel and GMR Infra.

L&T increased its holding in Mindtree from 60.55% to 61.07%.

Utkarsh Sinha, MD, Bexley Advisors, told The Hindu, “Bear markets usually offer great pickings for value investors looking to buy for the long term.

“We are definitely entering such a phase. And typically, a promoter is the definition of a value investor in his or her own company.”

Firms such as Sun Pharma, Emami and Granules India have announced share buy-backs.

“Buy-backs are not only the norm in such an environment, they may make the most sense for spending accumulated capital. If you are able to expand your equity pool in a bear environment, it gives you the ability to go back to the market on more favourable terms down the road,” Mr. Sinha added.

Motilal Oswal Research said there was a heightened activity in promoters buying / raising stakes.

“We expect the buy-backs to accelerate given the prevailing juicy valuations across sectors. Any relaxation on the buy-back tax front can prove to be a catalyst for more activity, in our view,” it wrote to its clients.

Tata Sons chairman N. Chandrasekaran has bought two lakh shares each of Tata Steel, Tata Motors and Tata Power each and one lakh shares each of Tata Consumer Products, Tata Chemicals, Tata Communications and Indian Hotels.

Hey there, and welcome back to Clued In!

How is the sequestration going? Hopefully, you’re not wanting for any essential rations while the world’s best and brightest epidemiologists and virologists quest for the antidote to the novel Coronavirus. In the spirit of inspiring you to take succour in your quarantine, here’s another topical clue from Arden (and a bonus one to follow):

The Hindu Cryptic #12893 | Arden | (24 Across) Clue surface : I love to enter, criticize and keep away (7) Answer : ISOLATE Definition: Keep away Clue type : Charade, insertion Annotation : Plonk the letter I, clear as day, on to your scribbling pad. Then, the letter O (Crosswording liberty allows you to read the zero indicated by ‘love’ as an ‘O’) is inserted (‘to enter’) into SLATE (which is actually a colloquial synonym for ‘criticize’)

And ‘keeping away’ is the singular act of virtue we as humans have been called upon to perform right now. This virtue-signalling isn’t so far off the mark though, given that most acts of creative excellence (flash mobs strongly excluded) are known to be achieved in solitude — be it writing, thinking, meditating. The Greeks were paragons of this idea and even had a word for it that has survived into English as a loanword.

The Hindu Cryptic #12893 | Arden | (23 Across) Clue surface : Taking care, team achieves excellence in Greece (5) Answer : ARETE Definition: excellence in Greece Clue type : Telescopic or hidden word Annotation : The letters ARETE can be found placed, in that order and adjacent to each other, somewhere in the clue.

‘Arete’ may also be understood loosely as ‘doing the best one can’, or ‘best moral behaviour’. Dating back to Ancient Greece and popularised by the philosopher Plato’s brand of ethics, the term is rather flexible if subjective — it has been applied to whatever values society considered praiseworthy or desirable at the time (evidence of this can be seen in that ‘arete’ was used to form the root of the word ‘aristocracy’ sometime before the French revolution happened).

arete sounds like: uh-ri- tay noun — aggregate of qualities, as valour or virtue, making up good character (dictionary.com) Origin: From the works of Homer (8th Century B.C.), which influenced Plato

Pretty insightful (if intentional) from Arden to marry the ideas of ‘taking care’ and teamwork to clue the idea of ‘best moral behaviour’ for these times!

340,2020/03/26,COVID-19 and the great Chinese puzzle,"China does not know, or is not revealing, the magnitude of infection in the country

The pandemic is spreading like wildfire. What started surreptitiously sometime in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, has engulfed 172 countries and regions by March 25, 2020. Globally over 4,35,000 have been reported as confirmed infected, over 19,500 have died, and around 1,11,000 have recovered.

The virus is SARS-CoV-2; the clinical illness is COVID-19. When not specified, reported numbers may pertain to either infection or disease or a mix, misleading decision-makers to conflate the two.

Coronavirus | China to lift travel curbs on 50 million people in Hubei

The numbers of test results put out from China, the ‘index country’, have helped the world World Health Organization (WHO) and affected countries get a sense of the seriousness of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infection. In China, about 81,600 had confirmed disease; there were about 3,100 deaths. The crude estimate of case fatality was 3.7%. All diseased are infected, the reverse is not true. Not all infected are sick or tested. Hence, information from China is unhelpful to confidently project the probabilities/proportions that will get infected; get COVID-19 symptoms; develop pneumonia; die.

Virus spread in China reportedly stopped by the end of the third week of March, with no new SARS-CoV-2 infections arising locally since then. China is now gearing up to prevent virus transmission from citizens returning from other countries. If only 90,000 were infected among a 1.4 billion population, the proportion was only 0.0065%. Here is the puzzle: for any epidemic, its downturn consequent to high herd immunity requires about 70% infected and immune. Every second person in the community will then be a dead-end for virus spread. What proportion of the Chinese was actually infected? The proportion of 0.0065% is unrealistically low for the visible shift in epidemiology. If 70% were infected, there were 980 million infections. This extraordinary range is the puzzle.

The beginning

The story began unfolding in December 2019 with cases of pneumonia without an identifiable cause. One astute physician saw this and alerted his colleagues. He was reprimanded by the authorities for spreading fear, rather like ‘anti-national activity’ in contemporary Indian parlance. Soon they realised that the alarm was true. Among the first 41 cases, most were workers in, or had direct contact with, the Hunan Seafood Wholesale Market, where several species of wild-caught animals were stocked and sold. On December 31, health officials informed the WHO of the outbreak of a suspected zoonosis (vertebrate-to-human transmitted infectious disease). That market and all other similar markets nationally were closed the next day. On January 7, WHO was notified that the pathogen was a novel coronavirus. Soon Chinese scientists mapped its full genome sequence and gene sequence for primers needed for diagnostic tests and made these data publicly available. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses re-named it SARS-CoV-2 because of its close genetic similarity to the SARS coronavirus that had caused the SARS epidemic in 2002-03. Also the new disease was clinically SARS-like. By mid-January, several countries (Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Viet Nam, USA, France, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia and Nepal) reported COVID-19. This was a globalising disease, no longer China’s problem alone. It was no longer zoonosis but had become anthroponosis (person-to-person transmitted infectious disease). But when did this epidemic actually start in Wuhan? How long did it remain unrecognised? The number of cases at a given time could reflect the duration of the outbreak. Since amplification of infection is a function of time, the higher the number of cases at a time when laboratory testing was in full swing, the longer the virus had circulated in China as anthroponosis. The necessary numbers are just not available, which is a problem.

Editorial | China’s zero

Only on January 11 did China record the first death from COVID-19. Considering that the test had just become available, any earlier death would not have been attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. More than a week later China counted 26 deaths among 830 diagnosed with COVID-19. By January 20, Wuhan was placed under lockout; Hubei province followed shortly. China alerted the world by end-January, it alerted the world that COVID-19 was widely prevalent in all 31 provinces. The WHO declared the disease a ‘public health emergency of international concern’ on January 30. The very next day Philippines, India, Russia, Spain, Sweden and the U.K. documented virus importation through infected travellers. A pandemic (global epidemic) is declared by the WHO ‘when the world’s population would likely be exposed to a new infection with potential to make a proportion sick’. By February 2, the infection had already spread to 24 countries outside China-Hong Kong-Macau. Given time this contagious anthroponosis was more than likely to expose the whole world and was already a pandemic by definition. But WHO declared a pandemic only on March 11: 38 precious days were lost. Did WHO get misled by the 0.0065% risk? Countries like India that depend heavily on WHO guidance for public health action had apparently mistaken the non-declaration as a signal that it was short-lived or non-serious. Was not the likelihood of universal spread low if it was not pandemic? On March 12, fear gripped India as it had not done homework to face the pandemic and invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act giving the state extraordinary powers.

Coronavirus | China sees drop in imported cases

On June 11, 2009, WHO had declared influenza H1N1 as a pandemic. It was relatively mild with a case-fatality of about 0.1%. The low fatality rate was probably, partly, because it was not an entirely new virus. The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic was H1N1 virus, replaced by the 1957 Asian flu pandemic of H2N2. People aged 53 and above in 2009 had a high probability of having some immune memory for H1N1. In addition, the 2009 H1N1 strain had lower virulence than earlier pandemics. The pandemic alert was clearly warranted based on defined virological and epidemiological criteria. Yet there were allegations that WHO had declared a ‘false pandemic’ as a pandemic on account of pharmaceutical industry pressure to sell more pharmacological products. Might WHO have delayed the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic until it was too obvious to avoid criticism?

Growth pattern

This infection shows an exponential growth pattern typical of contagious anthroponosis. Epidemiologists have estimated the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. The term basic reproduction number (R0) denotes the number of new infections that an infected person could seed, during the infective period, if all contacts exposed were non-immune and susceptible. For this infection, R0 has been estimated to be between 1.5 and 3.5. If we accept conservatively R0=2, one infected person will, on an average, infect two other people; next generation will be 4, then 8, 16, 32 and so on. When a large proportion is infected, hence immune, the scene changes. An infected person will encounter a majority of immune and a minority of non-immune among contacts, and virus transmission will slow down.

Coronavirus | China's high-tech battle against COVID-19

Experts outside China are projecting infection to reach 30-70% of the world’s population in the coming months. Data from China indicate that 80% of the infected are likely to be not very ill, and hence require little or no medical attention. Around 14% would develop severe disease, and around 6% would require critical care. Consider these figures against a total of 90,000 reported infected in all of China and extrapolate to a probable 980 million infected. If countries use these estimates to plan resource demand in terms of hospital beds, personnel, ICU beds, ventilators, equipment and trained personnel, no country in the world can claim to be prepared to meet these requirements. This is why the Chinese puzzle needs exploration. If only <1 % will be infected when the numbers begin to fall, countries like India have reason for optimism.

Or does this puzzle indicate that although 70% of Chinese were actually infected with SARS-COV-2 by the third week of March, only about 90,000 of the 980 million infected (0.0092%) developed COVID-19? This could also provide reason for optimism, but is highly speculative without necessary information. Why are the data missing? Has the world at large and WHO particularly missed a massive elephant in China? For infection rate to decline, the proportion of immune, hence non-susceptible people among the whole population should be fairly high. We define herd immunity as the proportion immune in the population and herd effect as the reduction of infection incidence in the non-immune segment of the population on account of the high herd immunity slowing down the circulation of the virus. To determine how large the COVID-19 epidemic was in China is information that we need urgently. The only way to get it is by careful antibody prevalence surveys, which we hope WHO will be demanding from China.

Coronavirus | Wuhan closes makeshift hospital as new cases in China drop sharply

China claimed success in interrupting transmission because Hubei province was under lockdown fairly early in the course of the epidemic, and China also imposed travel restrictions on other provinces. Is its claim credible? What if the epidemic had actually started, say, in August?

Since the lockdown occurred later than it should have, travellers attending the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations transmitted the infection wherever they went. Most countries have focussed on identifying infections brought by travellers from such high-risk countries but the majority with COVID-19 infections now are showing increasing rates of local transmission. The signal from the Chinese puzzle could be that widespread infection is not inevitable and with stringent public health measures infection rate could be brought down to zero. That scenario does not make epidemiological sense. We have to conclude that China does not know, or is not revealing, the magnitude of infection in all of China.

All countries that expected very small numbers to be at risk of infection based on the China puzzle must anticipate about 70% to be infected in the first wave of the epidemic. If summer heat dampens transmission, we may not reach 70% until autumn or winter. After that, the infection may stay on as endemic and seasonal. We are better off to learn lessons from other countries. We must also learn our own lessons real-time, as and when events happen. We have to catch up for lost time because of our optimistic reading of data that were not verified or even checked for plausibility.

341,2020/03/26,"Test, test, test for the virus","Travel bans and quarantines are imperative, but testing alone can reveal the extent of the disease

The novel coronavirus differs from other pandemics because of its exponential speed of transmission. The coronavirus is a novel virus because the genetic RNA has undergone mutation recently to infect humans from an animal source, thus converting a zoonotic disease to an anthroponotic one. Coronavirus RNA is new to the human immunological system. Therefore, there are a lot of unanswered questions with regard to immunity, recurrence, carrier state, treatment and vaccines. The incubation period is 2-14 days. However, research has revealed that the virus can remain in circulation for much longer in affected individuals.

The economic status of a country influences implementation of its policies. As India is a lower-middle-income country with a healthcare expenditure that is consistently below 1.5% of the GDP, it needs to be prudent and pragmatic in its approach to withstand it in the event of community spread. Therefore, the government must focus on continued surveillance, prompt diagnosis and adopt robust treatment modalities to reduce morbidity and mortality.

Increase in testing

An increase in testing will identify the actual number of cases that would require quarantine and prompt treatment. The Indian Council of Medical Research has to increase random sampling and screening of the high-risk population. Nationwide, the government has identified 75 government hospitals for testing and has allowed private labs with NABL accreditation to conduct real-time PCR assay of the RNA virus. The National Task Force has recommended that the maximum cost for testing sample should not exceed ₹4,500. The country’s per capita annual income for 2019-20 is ₹1,35,048 and the average middle-class annual income is ₹10-15 lakh. Out-of-pocket expenses in healthcare is what pushes a lot of low-income Indians below the poverty line.

COVID-19 is a national emergency. Therefore, the government should include the test under the ambit of all private and government health insurance schemes. The primary goal of the government is to ensure availability and accessibility to diagnostic tests free of cost. Setting up diagnostic centres in every district general hospital should be the top-most priority. Travel bans and quarantines are imperative measures, but testing alone can reveal the extent of the disease in the community.

Fighting misinformation

Misinformation, especially on the use of facial masks, alternative medicine, and availability of a cure, should be avoided. With limited resources, India requires protection gear such as three-layered facial masks for its healthcare workers and for those in service industries.

Where does India stand on the coronavirus curve?

There is no vaccine to fight the virus yet. Randomised controlled trials for antiviral treatment are difficult to execute during pandemics. Researchers need to make tough choices during clinical trials, while ensuring the safety of the patients. Medication was elusive in the past for H1N1, HIV and many other viral illnesses but the human mind proved invincible. Anti-COVID-19 drugs may be available sooner than later.

The true incidence of the disease is still unknown. Evidence from the identified cases worldwide suggest that 80% of the infections will be mild with people having flu-like symptoms, about 15% will be severe requiring hospitalisation due to breathlessness or pneumonia, 3-5% will require ventilatory support, and about 1% will succumb to the virus.

Every individual at risk, and not just those in power, should be tested on request. There are authentic reports that several individuals have been denied diagnostic tests despite a contact history.

The WHO categorised India as having local transmission. If so, lessons can be learnt from South Korea which is taking 6,388 tests per million of the population compared to India’s 11.6. Every life is equally invaluable.

342,2020/03/26,If COVID-19 affected a district,"Along with the immediate response to the virus, there is need to think about creating long-term capacity in state institutions

How well India fights the novel coronavirus will be shaped not only by specific measures to tackle it, but also by the overall capacity of its public health and management systems. How capable is India’s public management system of tackling COVID-19? Some indications are available in a case study that I conducted in 2017-18 of a district.

If the virus were to spread in the district studied, its elected representatives would be aware and vocal about it. The local media too would report it. There would be considerable pressure on the district administration to act. In case of laxity, we can expect adverse media reports, and complaints to the State government. However, this pressure would build up only after a visible occurrence of the virus.

Data | COVID-19 is deadliest for the elderly

Weak health infrastructure

Prevention, early detection and medical assistance to the affected would be more difficult. The first stumbling block would be the paucity of health facilities. For a population of over 12 lakh, the district had 26 government health centres with doctors, including the district hospital, community health centres (CHC) and primary health centres (PHCs), which is one per 35 villages and 0.5 towns. These had 820 beds (one for more than 1,500 people and less than one per village). There were 173 sub-health centres (SHCs), one per 5.4 villages. SHCs did not have doctors, but had auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) who were not medically qualified, but trained by the Public Health Department. Further, the health centres had an overall staff vacancy rate of more than 30%, and over 55% among class 1 and 2 posts, mainly doctors. One sample rural PHC had no full-time doctor. A doctor from a neighbouring PHC visited once or twice a month. The lab technician and pharmacist were shared with another PHC. There was a staff nurse who managed the PHC. When she handled a delivery at night, she had to attend to the PHC the next day. In another sample CHC, there were only three doctors against the sanctioned strength of six, one ward boy when four were needed, no dresser, and the doctors complained that there was no one to get patients in stretchers from the door.

In the sample SHCs, while basic equipment (instruments to measure blood pressure and glucose levels, vaccines, etc.) were available, the buildings were in poor condition. The ANMs did numerous surveys in their area of five to seven villages, and those interviewed reported difficulty in carrying instruments, vaccines, etc. They had asked for transportation, but to no avail. It can be imagined that with this manpower and infrastructure, stretched even at ordinary times, it would be difficult to follow additional protocols for the novel coronavirus.

A solution, and riders

However, there could be solutions. The District Collector could take charge at an early stage. In the short term, a capable District Collector could mobilise personnel from other departments, volunteers, and private medical practitioners and create temporary medical facilities. The capacity of the health system would thus increase manifold.

Coronavirus | The importance of ‘contact tracing’

However, there are three riders to the above solution. One, all District Collectors may not be capable because frequently, officials are posted on the basis of political patronage, not ability. In the district, in the previous 10 years, there had been eight District Collectors and 15 Chief Medical Officers. Thus, the leaders of the battle against the virus would most likely be new to the district. Two, the study showed rampant rent-seeking. As in the case of calamities, officials could pilfer government funds, and weaken the initiative. Finally, cracks will appear in these solutions if the crisis continues over time, even where officials are capable and honest. It will not be possible to rope in personnel of other departments or volunteers indefinitely. If there is a law and order crisis, the District Collector’s attention will shift.

The bare-bones health system will then have to cope. Not only will this be inadequate, but new problems could emerge. In the district, because of deficient public health facilities, people accessed private services often. The well-off went to private doctors in nearby towns, while the poor frequently went to traditional healers and ‘Bengali doctors’ — individuals without medical qualifications who ‘treated’ the villagers at a modest fee. It is not hard to imagine that many more such doctors would appear with rising anxiety and desperation and leading to further impoverishment and possibly harm to ordinary people.

How the public management system will deal with the COVID-19 threat will be shaped by these characteristics of the system. There could be good crisis management in the short term, but in the long term, inadequate health facilities will not match up. Along with the immediate response to the virus, there is need to think about creating long-term, sustained capacity in state institutions.

343,2020/03/26,Beware of a lopsided lockdown,"The poor seem to count for very little in the Central government’s curfew plan

“I am willing to go hungry if there is no other way to stop this virus, but how will I explain that to my children?” We heard these poignant words two days ago from Nemi Devi of Dumbi village in Latehar district, Jharkhand. Her son and husband, both migrant workers, are stranded far away. In village after village, many other women expressed similar worries. And that was even before the Prime Minister announced a drastic 21-day lockdown, from Wednesday.

The enormity of the coronavirus crisis is gradually dawning on India. For you and me, it is still in the future. But for many informal-sector workers and their families, the crisis is already in full swing: there is no work, and resources are running out. Things are all set to get worse as the privileged hoard with abandon and food prices go north.

Also Read Dressing a wounded economy

Hopefully, the Central government’s decision to impose a 21-day lockdown will prove right in due course. But the lockdown (a virtual curfew) is crying out for relief measures, including income support for poor families. As it happens, most of them already receive a limited form of income support: food rations under the Public Distribution System (PDS). Under the National Food Security Act, two-thirds of Indian families (75% and 50% in rural and urban areas, respectively) are covered. In most States, including the poorest, the PDS works — not perfectly, but well enough to protect the bulk of the population from hunger.

Use excess food stock

The PDS is the country’s most important asset in this situation. It is essential to keep it going, even to expand it, in terms of both coverage and entitlements. Fortunately, India has gigantic excess food stocks. In fact, it has carried excess food stocks (more than twice the buffer-stock norms) for almost 20 years, and this is the time to use them. Nothing prevents the Central government from, say, doubling PDS rations for three or even six months as an emergency measure. That will not make up for most people’s loss of income, but it will ensure that there is food in the house at least.

Some bold steps are required to make food distribution effective. For instance, biometric authentication (fingerprint scanning) is best removed at this time — it is a source of exclusion as well as a health hazard. Distribution needs to be staggered and tightly supervised, to avoid crowds and cheating at the ration shop. Dealers who are caught cheating must be swiftly punished. All this is well within the realm of possibility; the main thing is to release the stocks without delay.

Having said this, the PDS is not enough. For one thing, many poor people are still excluded from it. Large-scale cash transfers are also required, starting with advance payment of social security pensions and a big increase in pension amounts (the Central government’s contribution has stagnated at a measly ₹200 per month since 2006). Here, one possible hurdle is the payment system. Many pensioners collect their pension from “business correspondents” (BCs) – a kind of human automated teller machine (ATM), who dispenses money on behalf of the bank. The problem is, unlike ATMs, most BCs use biometric authentication rather than smart cards. And mass biometric authentication could accelerate the transmission of the novel coronavirus.

Payment arrangements

Ideally, biometric authentication should be abandoned for now. Even if it is not, many BCs may vanish for fear of infection (most of them are poorly-paid employees of poorly-regulated private entities). Under both scenarios, something has to be done to ensure safe crowd management at the bank. New payment arrangements are also possible. For instance, social security pensions could be paid in cash at the panchayat bhavan on a given day of the month, obviating the need for everyone to go to the bank: this has been done in Odisha for years, with good results. Cash could also be disbursed, with due safeguards, through anganwadis or self-help groups. Cash transfers need not be limited to social security pensions. Revamping the PDS and social security pensions would go a long way, but a significant proportion of vulnerable families are likely to fall through the cracks. Further, food rations may prevent hunger but people have many other basic needs; they will need money to cope with this spell of unemployment.

Coronavirus | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

There are several possible ways of extending the reach of cash transfers beyond pensions. For instance, money could be sent to the accounts of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act job-card holders, or Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) beneficiaries, or PDS cardholders. How these lists are best used and combined is a context-specific question, perhaps best handled at the State level (my sense is that in many States, the MGNREGA job-cards list is the best starting point).

Coronavirus | Pandemic fallout revives talk of universal basic income

These are just some examples of possible emergency measures. Many other valuable suggestions have been made, relating for instance to midday meals, community kitchens and relief camps for stranded migrant workers. The first step is to make relief measures an integral part of the lockdown plan. Failing that, it may do more harm than good. For one thing, a hungry and enfeebled population is unlikely to fight the virus effectively. A constructive lockdown should empower people to fight back together, not treat them like sheep.

Finally, Centre-State cooperation is essential. Many State governments have already initiated valuable social-security measures, but they are far from adequate. The Central government, for its part, has been struck with inexplicable paralysis on this. Adequate relief measures require big money (lakhs of crores of rupees) from the Central government. Implementation, however, should be led by the States. They all have their own circumstances and methods. The Central government is unlikely to do better on their behalf. If it foots the bill, that will be a good start.

344,2020/03/26,A long road: The Hindu Editorial on India’s 21-day coronavirus lockdown,"The unprecedented lockdown can work only if governments help people stay homebound

India’s unprecedented 21-day national lockdown is an unparalleled effort at stopping the march of a fast-spreading scourge that has overwhelmed the health infrastructure of several nations. Although the Centre seems to have thought of such a move in advance in a bid to flatten the curve of transmission of the novel coronavirus, the enforcement has left millions of people unprepared for the severe disruption. The janata curfew, on March 22, ahead of the lockdown was obviously a drill for the three-week imposition, but the government failed to anticipate the complex issues involved in confining over a billion people to their homes. Of course, as a public health measure, the full national lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is being welcomed by the medical community as a necessary measure to cut the transmission chain of the virus. Fresh arrival of travellers from abroad has already been stopped, and three weeks is long enough to allow for symptomatic cases of COVID-19 disease to emerge. This should give the government sufficient time to plan a treatment response. But for the lockdown to serve its purpose, it should lead to wider testing of all suspected cases. Regrettably, the lack of planning on the lockdown resulted in another bout of crowding, with people rushing out to buy essential supplies and medicines. There were instances of mindless police violence against workers performing routine jobs. The virtual curfew could have been made far less stressful through prior discussion with the States, and unambiguous communication to the public. Clearly, State agencies did not follow the order issued by the Home Ministry under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, spelling out provisions on essential services.

If the prolonged lockdown is to be executed without too much trauma for the general public, there has to be a war room approach. Chief among the measures needed is reliable access to food, water, medicines and emergency assistance. Here, some States have moved early and announced cash relief and free rations. The challenge is to ensure effective implementation. Again, if movement is to be restricted, essentials must be delivered virtually at the doorstep. This is enabled explicitly by the Home Ministry’s order. Allowing delivery of medicines by pharmacies is important and essential personnel must be given passes that protect them from police harassment and ensure movement of goods. There is also a deplorable trend of social discrimination against health workers handling COVID-19 cases, which must be sternly dealt with. The onus is on the Central and State governments to provide for everyone during the lockdown, and they should be working round the clock. Otherwise, people will be forced into a situation where breaking the curfew might seem the safer alternative to deprivation and suffering in isolation.

The efficacy of a protracted three-week-long countrywide lockdown in the fight against the pandemic aside, what is very clear is that the shutdown is set to bring the approximately ₹200-lakh crore national economy close to a shuddering standstill. The ramifications are already so wide-ranging that measuring the fallout merely in terms of lost economic output would be grossly inadequate. The hardest hit are the millions of daily wage earners, the self-employed and small businesses, and the rural landless poor. Vulnerable segments of the workforce face the immediate prospect of a lack of income as well as hunger. On a larger scale, with public transport services now withdrawn and private vehicular movement severely restricted to the barest delivery of essential services, it is hard to see how people employed even in vital sectors of manufacturing or the utilities would be able to reach their workplaces. While the Finance Minister on Tuesday announced a welcome slew of tax and regulatory compliance-related deadline deferments as well as some credit-related relief to the MSME sector, the combined steps will at best be of marginal help to tackle the unprecedented economic crisis. Any package to address it therefore demands a set of mitigation and subsequent stimulus measures that would need to be of an exceptional scale and require implementation on a war footing.

For a start, the Centre must abandon its fiscal deficit goals at this moment of a worldwide healthcare and economic crisis that is set to tip the global economy into a recession, at the very least in the near term. In keeping with what some State governments as well as most developed economies have already announced, the Centre needs to immediately release sizeable cash grants to all persons with Jan-Dhan accounts and BPL ration cards and use its various social welfare schemes including PM-KISAN and MGNREGA to ensure that the reach of such financial aid is maximised countrywide. The plan must also encompass a broad swathe of spending measures. These should include substantial investments in public health infrastructure targeted at COVID-19 treatment — for which a beginning has been made with an allocation of ₹15,000 crore — as well as provisions for free services to all financial aid recipients; loan repayment holidays and a wage bill subsidy to all MSME businesses that retain their workforce at pre-crisis levels; and once the lockdown is lifted, a huge public infrastructure creation backed spending push to generate jobs and restart economic activity. A modest doubling of the budgeted fiscal deficit figure for 2020-21 could see about ₹16-lakh crore being freed up for the Centre to both spend directly and provide capital support in the form of grants and subsidies to State governments and banks. The government would do well to use the crisis as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to address both the economy’s and the public’s well-being. The lives and livelihoods lost to the pandemic should not be in vain.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-long-road-the-hindu-editorial-on-indias-21-day-coronavirus-lockdown/article31167312.ece
345,2020/03/26,COVID-19: Karnataka to procure SARS-CoV-2 antibody test strips from China,"This will help in preliminary screening of quarantined persons

The State government is set to procure one lakh SARS-CoV-2 antibody test strips for preliminary screening of quarantined persons and those who are asymptomatic.

As there are no authorised manufacturers in India right now, the State has to procure the strips from China. But, with no regular flight cargo services available, the State government has sought permission from the Civil Aviation Ministry for a chartered cargo flight to be sent from India to pick up the consignment from Beijing.

Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education), told The Hindu on Thursday that the process of procuring the strips has begun. “We have discussed this in the task force. If all goes well, we should be able to take up preliminary screening of even those who are asymptomatic,” he said.

As of now, the country is facing a shortage of RNA-based test kits through which the ICMR-approved confirmatory tests can be done.

C.N. Manjunath, Director of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, who is part of the State’s COVID-19 task force, said South Korea, Singapore, UK and Ukraine are successfully using the strips. These strips are certified by the European Union, he said.

“We discussed this at the task force meeting on Tuesday. The government has requested the Civil Aviation Ministry to permit sending a chartered flight to pick up the consignment. If all goes well, we should have it in the next 15 days,” he said.

V. Ravi, Senior Professor and Head of Neuro-Virology at NIMHANS, who is also part of the task force, said these antibody strips will help in detecting antibodies to COVID-19 in less than an hour with just a drop of blood.

Preliminary screening

“The strip is similar to a pregnancy test strip. It will help in preliminary screening, especially among the large number of quarantined patients and their contacts. This will help in avoiding the rush for confirmatory tests. However, after this screening, the samples will again have to be tested through the standard PCR method for confirmation. This will take six to eight hours,” Dr. Ravi said.

Meanwhile, the ICMR has asked States to test individuals aged above 60, who are part of the group of evacuees currently quarantined in government designated camps, as they are at high risk and may have medical concerns.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-state-to-procure-sars-cov-2-antibody-test-strips-from-china/article31175746.ece
346,2020/03/26,COVID warriors: Pourakarmikas walk the extra mile,"Though BBMP has arranged for BMTC buses and food packets to help essential workers, many are yet to benefit from this

On a normal day, Rupa, a pourakarmika who works in and around Peenya, wakes up at 6 a.m. to get to work by 6.30 a.m. But these days are far from normal with working professionals, children and the elderly hunkering down at home in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the city is under a complete lockdown, her day begins at 5 a.m. as there is no transport.

“When everyone is asked to stay at home, we work. Earlier, we would take share autos and other means of transport. Now, we have to walk. Sometimes, we manage to get autos early in the morning. But they are extremely expensive, and we cannot afford them,” said Rupa.

Nirmala M. of the BBMP Pourakarmikara Sangha said that pourakarmikas across the city have to walk for at least 5 km just to get to work. “They are drained out by the time they come to work, and they are under a lot of stress. It is an unfortunate situation,” she said.

Though the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has roped in buses for essential workers, most are yet to benefit from it. Officials said that these teething problems will be sorted out soon.

The BBMP has reduced the working hours of pourakarmikas to four hours from 6.30 a.m. to 10.30 a.m.

Another pourakarmika, who is also struggling to get to work, said that it was difficult for them to get food and water too as Indira Canteens are now closed. “If we do not get anything to eat en route, our first meal is only after we reach home, which is after noon, or later if we have to walk back home,” she said.

In a few areas, including K.R. Market, pourakarmikas were provided food packets on Wednesday. A BBMP official said that they would ensure that everyone gets food in the coming days.

The men and women, who are an essential part of Bengaluru’s waste management system, are also worried about their health given the increasing number of masks that are being discarded.

“People use them and carelessly throw them on the road. We have asked many people to at least wrap it up in paper and put it in dustbins. Some agree, but most ignore the request,” she said.

“We feel that we are vulnerable to epidemic diseases like COVID-19 because of the nature of our work. Though the government has provided basic preventive measures such as masks, gloves and sanitisers, we are afraid,” said Jayamma.

Randeep D., Special Commissioner, Solid Waste Management (SWM), BBMP, said that the civic body will look into the complaints. “We have tied up with the BMTC to mitigate the transport problem. Pourakarmikas can now travel in BMTC buses to get to their places of work and back home,” he said, adding that the civic body will be paying the pourakarmikas ₹100 per day over and above what they are being paid.

R. Moha Raj of Dalit Sangarsh Samiti urged the government to provide pourakarmikas with insurance facilities during these testing times. “They are one of the most essential services and boosting their morale at such times is important” he said.

348,2020/03/26,COVID-19 | Karnataka government promises to remove bottlenecks in supply chain,"Based on this assurance, APMCs plan to reopen yards on Friday

Restrictions on movement of goods vehicles have severely disrupted supply chains of farmers-wholesalers and wholesale-retail creating an artificial scarcity in the State leading to panic buying. Given the demand, many retailers have increased the price of essential commodities and vegetables. To make matters worse, due to low stock Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) yards across the State were closed on Wednesday and Thursday.

The government on Thursday held a special meeting of all wholesalers, after which APMCs announced that they will reopen on Friday and function from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. every day.

“We have stock of pulses only for three days and rice for eight days. Trucks laden with rice and wheat, pulses and oil are stranded on national highways. So we shut down. Now the government has assured us that there will be no restrictions on the movement of heavy vehicles both inter- and intra-State. Subject to removal of all bottlenecks as promised, we have decided to re-open,” said Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, chairman, APMC Committee, FKCCI.

This is expected to ease the situation for retailers to a large extent.

While police are being blamed for the disruption of supply chains, a senior police official said such a lockdown was unprecedented, and there were several teething problems which he assured would be ironed out over the next few days.

“There is a strict instruction to seal district borders and stop inter-district movement. But we are facing traffic pile-up at these borders. Goods vehicles are getting stuck. In some cases, it will be tough to manage crowds while selectively allowing vehicles to cross borders,” a senior police official said, adding they were trying their best to enable movement of goods vehicles.

While movement of essential goods across district borders have been streamlined to a large extent, the same cannot be said for State borders. However, the State government has assured wholesalers that the problem will be sorted out.

Tomatoes, probably, serve as the best illustration of the resultant problem. Due to short supply in the city, the cost of a kilo of the vegetable has gone up to ₹80. However, it was trading at ₹10/kg in Kolar and ₹2/kg in Tiptur.

“So the problem is not of shortage of produce, but disruption of supply chains,” said B.N. Prasad, Managing Director, HOPCOMS. “If farmers are not able to bring perishable goods to the markets, the produce will perish causing more stress to farmers,” he added.

Safety measures

Health concerns are being raised at these wholesale markets.

“There are no preventive measures at APMC yards. We fear the spread of the infection. There are goods from Maharashtra, which is a hotspot for COVID-19. Officials have now assured that they will help us observe social distancing, provide us with thermal scanners and other preventive measures,” said Mr. Lahoti.

HOPCOMS suggests that instead of Kalasipalyam, the crowded and narrow wholesale market in the city, vegetables need to be distributed in stadiums and playgrounds across the city.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/lmwwk6/article31179395.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGAPMCFILEPHOTO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-karnataka-government-promises-to-remove-bottlenecks-in-supply-chain/article31175462.ece

350,2020/03/26,"Coronavirus | ‘Trace, test, treat’ mantra helped us control the virus, says South Korean Ambassador to India Shin Bong-Kil","Extensive testing was crucial in preventing spread of COVID-19 without drastic lockdowns, says Ambassador Shin.

The Korean Model, a vigorous regime of “trace, test, treat”, has shown remarkable results in controlling the spread and mortality of the novel coronavirus, without putting a nationwide lockdown in place, and depended on conducting as many as 18,000 tests a day, says South Korean Ambassador to India Shin Bong-Kil.

What is the latest situation with the Coronavirus epidemic in South Korea?

I can say Korea is now in full control of the spread of the disease. The number of new confirmed cases per day has been showing steady decline since hitting a peak at 989 in February to double-digits figures as of mid-March. I believe, more importantly, that Korea might be the only country that hasn’t imposed a lockdown within its territories or even of its international borders. We have our own strict measures to prevent inflow and outflow of the virus but we are sticking to improving the situation without using drastic measures such as closing off our cities or our borders.

How has this been possible?

What we call the ‘Korean model’ is grounded on concentrated testing of high-risk areas and clusters. Korea found out at the beginning of the spread of the virus that a certain religious cult group and its gathering was the cause of a large portion of the spread in a certain area of the country. This group had massive gatherings in a closed-off space with congregation in close contact with each other. The government listed all members of the group across the country, tracked their whereabouts and conducted tests on a massive scale, leading to the rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases. However, Korea succeeded in identifying and isolating potential cases at a very early stage and finally flattened the curve.

Are there best practices you would like to share, or advice you think India should follow as it begins its lockdown?

The moment the virus DNA pattern was confirmed in Wuhan, Korean medical teams and bio-companies were able to develop new testing kits with surprising speed. This made it possible for Korea to conduct mass-scale testing of 18,000 cases a day. Anybody in Korea who has symptoms or reasons to be tested can get the test within minutes at a ‘drive-thru’ or ‘walk-thru’ testing centres and receive the result by text message the very next day. Korea made available over 650 testing centers nationwide.

Korea, as a democratic country, put top priority on the principles of openness and transparency. The government is fully committed to sharing information, in a prompt and transparent manner and has gained public trust and high-level of civic awareness, which encouraged the public to take voluntary self-quarantine and other preventive measures such as ‘social-distancing’.

Coronavirus | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

If I could give an advice during such difficult times to the Indian government, I understand the need for lockdowns given India’s demography and medical infrastructure. However, openness and transparency is important to tackling this situation and identifying and isolating the core of the spread of the virus with full medical capacity at the earliest possible stage is key. This is the essence of the ‘Korean Model’.

How are India and Korea cooperating and sharing information during this crisis? Has India made specific requests for testing kits/ medical equipment so far?

Korean government has repeatedly communicated to the Indian government on what is going on in Korea and how we tackle the virus. Though India has not asked for help regarding testing kits or medical equipment, we are always ready to extend a hand. Already, nine Korean companies have received export licenses of testing kits and the Embassy as well as Korean Trade Agency (KOTRA) are willing to facilitate the communication between the Korean companies and those who want to import the kits.

How many South Korean nationals are stranded in India, and needing to be evacuated? What is the status now?

There are currently nearly 15,000 Koreans residing in India, most of who are resident employees of Korean companies and their families. We do not have any plans of evacuation as of now. I like to believe that basically the Korean community in India has confidence in what the Indian Government is doing to tackle this horrible situation. So I hope for the situation to alleviate. But in case the situation worsens, we will discuss what options are best for our citizens when the time comes.

There are many Indian students and workers in Korea but they have not put forward their desire to return to India, as I know. I believe Korea is handling the situation efficiently and to my knowledge the Indian community in Korea is feeling quite safe.

Coronavirus | Patient data from Singapore and South Korea shows physical distancing is the only option

What kind of impact has the virus had on functioning of South Korean companies based in India, and what sort of assistance would they like from the Indian government?

Actually, many Korean companies like Samsung, LG, Hyundai and Kia have ambitious plans for India, the biggest emerging market in the world. Samsung which has the world’s largest smartphone factory here in Greater Noida as well as other companies, were looking to have greater production and more aggressive strategy to be part of the ‘Make In India’ policy, but they have been hard-hit with this extraordinary situation. KIA Motors, for example, has been another success story in India by setting up a 300,000-unit production plant last year. This year, they were planning to install large facilities for its new small-sized SUV, Sonet, but it is now uncertain if they can move ahead on schedule as engineers and construction experts are unable to receive visas to travel to India.

I understand all industries are going through this together. If I were to refer to bilateral relations, Korean companies have made large investments in India aligned with its ‘Make in India’ initiative and some of those companies have an urgent need to enter the country to expand and redesign the production facilities. I hope that Indian government can grant visas to those who have compelling reasons under the condition that health certificates are presented and self-quarantine is enforced.

Coronavirus | What China and South Korea are getting right

I have often seen crises turn into opportunities. I hope India can overcome this difficult situation and rather take this opportunity to becoming the largest manufacturing hub in the world. We should ensure that the economy survive these trying times, if the companies collapse what is the use? I believe it is Indian government’s difficult task to efficiently tackle the pandemic while saving the economy.",interview,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/interview/iva6tf/article31175788.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27TH-KOREA,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/interview/coronavirus-south-korean-ambassador-to-india-shin-bong-kil-says-trace-test-treat-mantra-helped-south-korea-control-virus/article31175789.ece
351,2020/03/26,Braving lockdown to feed strays and birds,"Musician heads to Kamarajar Salai daily

Ever since the lockdown kicked in, 22-year-old Lionel Praveen has been religiously visiting Kamarajar Salai, as several strays are yearning for food and water.

“I realised that this is a time when not many care for the already neglected strays in the city. So I decided to feed stray dogs, birds and cows near the Marina beach,” said Praveen, a musician who works on shortfilms.

Despite restrictions, he ventures out, every day, with a mask and a hand sanitiser. “Some policemen understand and let me go, while a few have asked me to return home immediately,” he says.

But a day after feeding them, he knew that he would not be able to collect adequate food, as most shops remained shut. That is when he posted a request on Facebook, requesting people to help him with rice or pet food.

Soon, he began receiving responses.Once someone offers food, Praveen drives down on his two-wheeler to collect the food. “Apart from dry fruits and pet food, many have provided rice. I cook dal rice, since that is feasible with the limited resources I have,” he said.

After finishing a course at the K.M. Music Conservatory, Praveen has been gradually getting opportunities to work on short films. But financial crunch is a battle he fights constantly. Yet, he cares for 12 cats and three dogs in his house.

“I spend ₹2,000 on food for the animals. I also try to rescue injured animals, care for them and give them up for adoption to whoever is interested,” he said.

His next challenge is to source water for the stray animals on Kamarajar Salai. “If people can provide water and some more food, I will be grateful and happy,” he says.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/jibkn1/article31176946.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THDOG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/braving-lockdown-to-feed-strays-and-birds/article31176947.ece
352,2020/03/26,‘Restrict timings of fuel outlets’,"Move will help reduce staff’s exposure: dealers’ body

The Tamil Nadu Petroleum Dealers’ Association (TNPDA) has urged the State government to allow it to supply fuel to people, only between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m.

Association president K.P. Murali said that this would help reduce the exposure of their staff. “We are getting around 500 customers a day, in place of the usual 1,000-1,200 customers. And not many of them follow etiquette and maintain the a metre’s distance. If we restrict timings, only those who absolutely need fuel will come in,” he said.

A dealer said that in several places, youngsters on two-wheelers were a menace and were causing problems at fuel outlets. “We are unable to control them. They just speed into the outlets,” he said.

Another dealer said that they were yet to receive hand sanitisers and masks from State-run oil companies, since their work spots were high-risk zones. “Our stocks of gloves and masks are over. The ordinary masks are worn out easily. The company had promised to supply us with masks and gloves. But we are yet to get them. We have to provide hand sanitisers to customers as well, since we handle cash,” he said.

Distributors’ demand

LPG distributors have said that they are finding it difficult to get delivery boys to deliver cylinders to households.

“If something happens to them, we are the ones who will be held responsible. Their families are already asking them not to go out for deliveries. The oil companies have not bothered to supply protective gear to us. And office staff are not reporting for work due to pressure from the police,” a distributor said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/4kqm6k/article31176934.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THGAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/restrict-timings-of-fuel-outlets/article31176935.ece

With people staying indoors during the ongoing lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19, keeping fit now has a virtual push, with online group meditation sessions, fitness apps that recommend home workouts and workout videos sent by coaches and gyms.

Strength System, a gym in the city, had a live workout session on Zoom, for their members a few days back. “We had over 30 members joining us for the online session and we have decided to host a free live workout session on Friday. We’ve also introduced a 16-day ‘Live Living Room Programme’, that people can enrol for and workout with our coaches online,” she said.

Ever since people began to quarantine themselves, Ms. Prashanti said that she has received several queries about how to remain motivated and get some exercise, as well as how to eat healthy.

“It definitely is hard to find the motivation to exercise when one is stuck at home. Signing up for online programmes helps with staying motivated and being accountable,” she added.

Gyms in the city that had to shut down operations have also started sending short workout videos from trainers to their clients, on WhatsApp. The last few days have given rise to several fitness challenges on social media platforms as well, with users sharing their workout routines and videos. Prasanth S., a resident of the city, said that people have a lot of options among workouts to chose from, depending on their fitness levels of fitness. “There are also a lot of free fitness apps to choose from, that have home workouts,” he said.

355,2020/03/26,Corpn. looks to put unused homes to use,"Civic body in need of quarantine space

The Corporation has launched a drive to create spaces for quarantine in each of its 15 zones.

According to data generated by the civic body, the space in government buildings in the city is limited, with less than 5,000 public buildings maintained by various civic agencies.

Chennai has more than 20,000 properties that remain vacant.

“Due to the need for more quarantine space as reserve security arrangements, an appeal has been made by the Greater Chennai Corporation administration to the general public to allow the use of unused homes, lodges and mansions with rooms for quarantine purposes,” said Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash.

‘Nation’s interest’

“This being the need of the hour, those who have such properties are requested to offer their services, in the interest of the nation,” he said.

The decision to request people for space was taken following a social media post by actor Parthiban to share such spaces with civic agencies.

“I have a few residential properties. I am willing to share the houses for containing COVID-19,” said Mr. Parthiban.

Corporation officials will regulate the use of such spaces for quarantine and handover the buildings to the owners after the spread of COVID-19 has been contained.

357,2020/03/26,Tanker water supply hit in added areas of the city,"‘Police not letting lorries reach apartment complexes’

Residents in the added areas, particularly in the southern suburbs and the IT corridor, are facing difficulties in accessing private tanker water supply, after the nationwide lockdown started. However, private water suppliers have assured residents that they would continue operations during the lockdown.

With most hotels and IT firms closed due to the COVID-19 threat, private water suppliers are mainly catering to large apartment complexes and hospitals.

On average, 4,500 lorries are operated, and each of them ply three to four trips, every day, said members of Tamil Nadu Private Water Lorry Owners’ Association. There has been a slight dip in demand this month. The number of trips the lorries make have come down from five last month to four this month, members of the association said.

Residents of Siruseri noted that vehicles that plied to areas such as Siruseri and Perumbakkam were stopped, citing lockdown. Though there was a threat of suspension of water supply, the issue was sorted out. With Chennai Metrowater yet to provide piped water supply, several added areas still depend on private water suppliers for their needs.

Association president N. Nijalingam said that the police did not let vehicles get to certain apartment complexes on Wednesday. “We have made representations to the authorities concerned and Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani, on the issue. We have been assured that water tankers will not be stopped, as they are an essential service.”

Private water suppliers are prepared to support the State government by providing free water supply to government hospitals, he said. The association has also requested Metrowater for the private water tankers to be fumigated. They are also creating awareness about precautionary measures among drivers.

Residents note that the supply was normal on Thursday. Harsha Koda, coordinator, Federation of OMR Residents’ Association, said that residents’ associations too had to intervene for private water supply to continue. “Staff members who are also into the essential service of maintaining water treatment and sewage treatment facilities in large apartment complexes are harassed by the police. They carry letters provided by the associations on the government guidelines, and are still stopped from reaching their workplaces,” he charged.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/b8wdlo/article31176707.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THPOLICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tanker-water-supply-hit-in-added-areas-of-the-city/article31176708.ece

361,2020/03/26,IIT Madras students fear crowded mess could spread viral infection,"About 300 students chose to remain on campus to complete their lab and project work

Around 300 students who have chosen to stay on in the Indian Institute of Technology Madras campus are now saying they have begun to regret it.

The students, mostly in the final stages of their course work, remained on campus to complete their laboratory and project work.

They are upset that while the institution had shut to prevent spread of COVID-19 viral infection it was now forcing them to remain in groups, putting them at risk.

Students said only one mess was functional currently. “We are trying to stay wherever we are to avoid crowding. If we complain about it, we are being threatened with evacuation, which would be more critical,” said a student.

A letter was sent to the Dean of Students when the students were moved to Bhadra hostel. They had complained of lack of basic facilities such as drinking water and unclean rest rooms.

A student said some of them had stayed back as they had to travel long distances to get home. Some students said the rooms vacated by international students was provided to them but were worried that the rooms were not sanitised properly.

Though in a circular the institute said it had provided two-hour slot for each meal time, the students said they had to rush in order to use the instruments in laboratories.

“We have to borrow instruments from another lab. If we miss the slot, we have to wait for the instrument again for 3-4 months. That is why some students have to stay back. There are some labs in which we have sophisticated instruments also and have to run continuously so have to take care of that too,” he explained.

Students claimed that some caterers were willing to run the mess even if there were just 100 students but the institute did not allow it. “It would have reduced crowding,” a student said.

A spokesperson for the institute said only one mess was allowed to run and outside caterers were barred from entering for fear of spread of infection.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/gm62f9/article31173666.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IIT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/iit-madras-students-fear-crowded-mess-could-spread-viral-infection/article31173667.ece
362,2020/03/26,"Disaster or lockdown, milk gets delivered at the doorstep","“We are ensuring workers in the dairies wear gloves, masks and cover their hair. Their body temperature is checked and hands are well sanitized,” Aavin official

At a time when residents are scrambling to buy vegetables and rushing to the store for groceries, there is one essential service that is always delivered. Even in the face of a lockdown, as Chennai wears a deserted look, several workers deliver milk to thousands of houses quietly.

Fifty-two-year old N. Kaalidevi has been dropping off milk packets in the city for the last three decades along with her mother and son. “It is basic a need for most of us. There are children in almost every household who certainly want it. It is our responsibility to serve our customers whatever happens. Now, we have been advised to stay protected. So, we have been wearing masks and have a hand sanitizer. With all this, we will continue to do this service.”

S. Marimuthu, a senior citizen, who has been delivering milk for over 35 years now, says that he cannot stay at home when so many homes depend on him for milk supply. “We have faced so many challenges including during rains and cyclones and the 2015 floods. And despite the challenges we have supplied milk to consumers. I shall continue to deliver milk. We are taking the requisite precautions,” he says.

Many contract labourers working at the dairies were unable to make it on day one, sources in Aavin say. The management has now asked such persons to reach a common point from where they can be picked up.

Similarly, for drivers of milk trucks temporary ID cards are being issued based on an ID proof that they submit. Despite the lockdown Aavin sold 13.61 lakh litres of milk today in the city.

On Monday, it was 14.20 lakh litres. “We are ensuring that all those in the dairies wear gloves, masks and cover their hair too. Their body temperature is checked and hands well sanitized before they enter the premises and also each time they take a break.

363,2020/03/26,COVID-19: Pigeon fanciers turn to ragi to feed their birds,"Lack of pigeon feed supply may be the least of the problems in these times — not for these enthusiasts though

Against the backdrop of widespread uncertainty, which includes worries about reaching essential supplies to people in the next three weeks, at the least, feed-supply for homing pigeons certainly looks as big an issue as the size of a single grain.

For pigeon fanciers though, this concern is big enough to crease their brow with a thousand worry lines.

With exclusive pigeon-feed shops having to down shutters as part of the lockdown, pigeon fanciers are turning to ragi to feed their birds.

In Chennai, there are only three well-known pigeon grain shops found in Seven Wells behind the existing bus terminus in Mint, and pigeon fanciers beat a path to these shops.

All three pigeon-feed have been closed and in contrast, pet shops and pet clinics are allowed to function during the shutdown period as essential services.

J. Rajinikanth, a seasoned pigeon fancier from Mint, is among those who are adding generous amounts of ragi to the feed mix in the feeder-boxes.

""Due to closure of the pigeon feed shops, we depend on a few grocery shops that sell ragi,” says SVS Vasantha Kumar, Secretary, Star Pigeon Society. Vasantha Kumar has more than 300 racing birds at his loft at Tondiarpet.

This is the only way they can keep the feeder-boxes stay filled with feed.

The feed-mix for homing pigeons will include Bengal gram, green gram and green peas, along with corn.

Now, in these times of the novel Coronavirus, pigeon fanciers will stick to just ragi, as it is cheap, and more significantly, can be bought from the grocery shops.

“We have advised our members to have an adequate stock of feed their birds during the lockdown. Ragi can be added in the existing feed mixture for,” says Rajinikanth, who is the secretary of Royal Pigeon Society (RPS).

At present, the city has 14 pigeon racing clubs with each club having around 50 members. Each member, on an average, has 50 to 100 homing pigeons.

Every day, pigeons are fed twice — in the morning and evening hours — and corn constitutes 60 per cent in the daily feed mixture. On an average, at least 50 kilograms of feed mixture is needed for around 100 homing pigeons for a month.

The “plate” for a homing pigeon may include wheat, bajra, roasted Bengal gram, soyabean and oil seeds like Saffola, sunflower, linseed and hempseed. Mohammad Ali (55), who runs a pigeon grain shop in Mint for more than three decades, says, “With many wholesale grain traders having shut down now, our supply of grains is cut off. So, even if we were open, the going would have been tough for us.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ybqxkb/article31172625.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26dcpigeon1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/covid-19-pigeon-fanciers-turn-to-ragi-to-feed-their-birds/article31172626.ece

The Koyambedu wholesale market, including vegetable and fruits market, will continue to work on March 27 and March 28, according to traders welfare associations.

Various traders associations had earlier announced that the market would remain closed on these two days in solidarity with the nation-wide lockdown. However, the decision was withdrawn after a meeting with the authorities concerned on Thursday morning.

S.Srinivasan, wholesale fruit merchant, said that the flowers and fruits wholesale market would operate as usual and the market has received sufficient truckloads of fruits.

According to wholesale vegetable merchants, the decision was withdrawn following the government instructions to operate the market. All the wholesale shops would remain open on Friday and Saturday. It was advised that the closure may lead to panic and escalation in prices of the vegetables in the retail market. Moreover, the crowd visiting the market may increase after two days of shutdown.

P. Sukumar, treasurer, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants’ Association said the market received only a limited number of produce. About 250 truckloads of vegetables arrived on Thursday against the normal daily load of 450. The sales too were dull and the fewer arrivals did not create any issues.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/xgtaw/article31171743.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KOYAMBEDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/koyambedu-wholesale-market-to-function-on-march-27-and-28/article31171744.ece

Chennai Corporation has launched drones with support from Anna University to disinfect inaccessible neighborhoods in the city.

Launching the drones in Ripon Buildings on Thursday, Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash said the drones will disinfect 50,000 sq.m. every day. “We have four drones to disinfect the city. The trial run has been completed. The drones have been developed by Anna University. Congested residential areas will be disinfected using the drones. Market areas will also be disinfected using the drones,” he said.

The Corporation is planning to get more drones from other agencies for the disinfection drive. More than 1,200 of the slum areas are inaccessible for vehicles carrying out disinfection operations. Similarly, more than 400 market areas in various parts of the city have also not been disinfected properly.

Chennai Corporation has started using 500 vehicles to disinfect the city. Over 75 vehicles have been regularly carrying out disinfection of public buildings and the neighborhoods. Corporation officials said they require more drones to disinfect such areas with narrow lanes in “continuous building areas” such as George Town, Chintadripet, Mylapore and Triplicane.

Stranded passengers from other states have been accommodated in Corporation schools and shelters. The Corporation officials have been supplying food to the passengers.

“Chennai Corporation officials will help all residents on home quarantine. Corporation workers have been instructed to disinfect residential areas of where persons have been advised home quarantine,” said Mr.Prakash.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/c924se/article31170350.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DRONE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-corporation-to-use-drones-to-disinfect-congested-areas/article31170351.ece
366,2020/03/26,Coronavirus: Pathways at Koyambedu market cleared of clutter to promote social distancing,"The COVID-19 situation has brought about many changes in the functioning of the Koyambedu market — changes in operational hours and even short closures for cleaning operations are only to be expected. Significantly, the crisis seems to have also led to the resolution of one long-pending issue — cluttered pathways.

On all the three sections, dedicated to the sale of three categories of perishable items: flowers, fruits and vegetables, at the Koyambedu Wholesale Market complex, pathways have been freed of clutter and made wider so that visitors, who are mostly small traders, can practise a form of social distancing.

Social distancing is one of the major preventive measures to check the spread of the novel Coronavirus.

This move was jointly orchestrated by officials of Greater Chennai Corporation and officials of the Koyambedu Market Management Committee (MMC), which comes under the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) and manages the market complex.

A Corporation official said that earlier many designated shops used to park their commodities along the pathway in front of their shops, thereby extending their shops and obstructing the movement of visitors.

During weekends and holidays, “extensions” to shops, engineered through makeshift arrangements, would be a nuisance for visitors.

In the past few days, such extensions have been cleared to disinfect the entire market complex as part of preventive measures against COVID-19.

Further, Corporation officials said that only retail traders, who have their outlets in respective neighbourhoods, were allowed to make purchases in the wholesale market. Entry of people who may want to buy these items for their household is restricted to reduce the number of people gathered at the complex at any point of time.

On an average, the wholesale market gets more than one lakh visitors every day especially during weekends and holidays, the Corporation officials said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/qqsr16/article31169854.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25dckoyamedu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pathways-at-koyambedu-market-cleared-of-clutter-to-promote-social-distancing/article31169855.ece
367,2020/03/26,Dressing a wounded economy,"The two major tools that the government has available before it are monetary policy and fiscal actions

The impact of the coranavirus pandemic is now felt by almost every country. First, there are the health effects of the virus, and second is the economic impact of the various actions that have to be taken to combat the virus. The world is experiencing an additional slowdown on top of the contracting tendencies already present and India is no exception. The economic impact on India can be traced through four channels: external demand; domestic demand; supply disruptions, and financial market disturbances.

External, domestic demand

As the economies of the developed countries slow down (some people are even talking of recession), their demand for imports of goods will go down and this will affect our exports which are even now not doing well. In fact after six months of negative growth, it was only in January that Indian exports showed positive growth. The extent of decline will depend on how severely the other economies are affected. Not only merchandise exports but also service exports will suffer. Besides these, the IT industry, travel, transport and hotel industries will be affected. The only redeeming feature in the external sector is the fall in oil prices. India’s oil import bill will come down substantially. But this will affect adversely the oil exporting countries which absorb Indian labour. Remittances may slow down.

Coronavirus | Pandemic fallout revives talk of universal basic income

To ward off the spread of the coronavirus, the government has declared a lockdown of the country. As passengers travel less, the transportation industry, road, rail and air, is cutting down schedules, sometimes drastically. This will affect in turn several other sectors closely related to them. The laying off of non-permanent employees has already started. As people in general buy less, shops stock less, which in turn affects production. Perhaps retail units will be first to be affected and they will in turn transmit this to the production units. One is unable to make an estimate of the reduction in economic activity at this point. If the situation is not reversed soon, there can be a serious decline in the growth rate during 2020-21.

Supply disruptions can occur because of the inability to import or procure inputs. The break in supply chains can be severe. It is estimated that nearly 60% of our imports is in the category of ‘intermediate goods’. Imports from countries which are affected by the virus can be a source of concern. Domestic supply chain can also be affected as the inter-State movement of goods has also slowed down.

Financial market issues

Financial markets are the ones which respond quickly and irrationally to a pandemic such as the coronavirus pandemic. The entire reaction is based on fear. The stock market in India has collapsed. The indices are at a three-year low. Foreign Portfolio Investors have shown great nervousness and the safe haven doctrine operates. In this process, the value of the rupee in terms of dollar has also fallen. The stock market decline has a wealth affect and will have an impact on the behaviour of particularly high wealth holders.

Coronavirus | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

How does the government deal with this sudden decline in economic activity which has come at a time when the economy is not doing well? The two major tools that are available are monetary policy and fiscal actions.

Monetary policy in a situation like this can only act to stimulate demand by a greater push of liquidity and credit. The policy rate has already been brought down by 135 basis points over the last several months. There is obviously scope for further reduction. But our own history as well as the experience of other countries clearly show that beyond a point, a reduction in interest rates does not work. It is the environment of the overall economy that counts. Credit may be available. But there may not be takers. You can lead a horse to water but you cannot make it drink. Any substantial reduction of policy rate can also affect savers. Interest is a double-edged sword.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) needs to go beyond cutting policy rate. A certain amount of regulatory forbearance is required to make the banks lend. Even commercial banks on their own will have to think in terms of modifying norms they use for inventory holding by production units. Repayments to banks can be delayed and the authorities must be willing to relax the rules. Any relaxation of rules regarding the recognition of non-performing assets has to be across the entire business sector. The authorities must be ready to tighten the rules as soon as the situation improves. This is a temporary relaxation and must be seen as such by banks and borrowers.

India coronavirus lockdown | Delivery issues add to woes for homebound

Fiscal actions have a major role to play. Once again, the ability to play a big role is constrained by the fact that the fiscal position of the government of India is already difficult. Even without the pandemic, the fiscal deficit of the Central government will turn out to be higher than that indicated in the budgets for 2019-20 and 2020-21. Revenues are likely to go down further because of the virus related slowdown in economic activity.

In this context, the ability to undertake big ticket expenditures is constrained. But there are some ‘musts’. The virus has to be fought and brought down. All expenditures to test (there is some concern that the extent of testing that we are doing now is low) and to take care of patients must be incurred. Now that private hospitals are allowed to test, the cost of the people going to private hospitals must also be met by the government. The involvement of private hospitals has become necessary. It is mentioned that a test costs ₹4,500. The total cost can be substantial if the numbers to be tested run in the thousands and more. This may sound exaggerated. But we must be prepared so that we avoid the tragedy of Italy. Therefore, the first priority is to mobilise adequate resources to meet all health related expenditures which includes the supply of accessories such as masks, sanitisers and materials for tests. The challenge is not only fiscal but also organisational.

The job sector

Serious concerns have been expressed about people who have been thrown out of employment. These are mostly daily-wage earners and non-permanent/temporary employees. In fact some of the migrant labour have gone back to home States. We must appeal to the business units to keep even non-permanent workers on their rolls and provide them with a minimal income. Some relief can be thought of by the government for such business units even though this can be misused. However, in general, in the case of sectors such as hospitality and travel, the government can extend relief through deferment of payments of dues to the government.

There is also talk of providing cash transfer to individuals. There is already a programme for rural farmers with all the limitations. For a system of cash transfer to be workable, it has to be universal. At this moment when all the energies of the government are required to combat the virus, to institute a system of universal cash transfer will be a diversion of efforts. The burden on the government will depend upon the quantum of per capita cash transfer and the length of the period.

Also read | Understanding remote working against the backdrop of a pandemic

As mentioned earlier, the government should advise all business units not to retrench workers and provide some relief to them to maintain the workers. A supplemental income scheme for all the poor can be thought of once the immediate problem is resolved. Provision of food and other essentials must be made available to the affected as is done at the time of floods or drought. States must take the initiative.

The fiscal deficit is bound to go up substantially. The higher borrowing programme will need the support of the RBI if the interest rate is to be kept low. Monetisation of deficit is inevitable. The strong injection of liquidity will store up problems for the next year. Inflation can flare up. The government needs to be mindful of this. All the same, the government must not stint and go out in a massive way to combat the virus. This is the government’s first priority.

368,2020/03/26,"Letters to the Editor — March 26, 2020","Lockdown

The 21-day national lockdown (Page 1, “As COVID-19 toll touches 10, PM announces 21-day lockdown”, March 25)though in hindsight looks a bit belated, should be welcomed as the pandemic has begun playing havoc even in medically advanced countries. One wonders whether we procrastinated in screening international passengers, as a proactive action of early closure could have greatly prevented cutting transmission. Even delaying screening for domestic air passengers did not make sense, as local and international passengers often arrive or exit through the same points at many airports. The only bright part is that despite its political differences with the government of the day, the Opposition has not criticised the actions either during the janata curfew or the lockdown underway. While the government is making attempts to please the corporate sector with a slew of measures, the have-nots should also be taken care of equally; with such a prolonged shutdown, they are finding it difficult in making both ends meet.

V. Subramanian,

Chennai

The Prime Minister’s initiative to tackle the coronavirus pandemic by putting into effect a lockdown strategy is laudable. But what is disturbing is the still half-hearted approach and reach out to the downtrodden sections. How are they going to be insulated from the “hunger virus”? Many other nations have announced an economic package that takes care of many sections of society.

Shumara S. Muhammed,

Thamarakulam, Alappuzha, Kerala

As the whole nation is facing this type of a lockdown, perhaps for the first time, clarifications and a little elaboration on implementation would have been better. After all, basic necessities such as buying vegetables, or milk, or medicines cannot be done without a person going out. Door delivery of such essentials cannot work out for every one or at every place. A directive such as sending out one member of the family while going out to make purchases and the need for maintaining physical distancing could have helped stop the kind of rush one has seen in markets. In such a time, the police can also learn to be a bit more people-friendly rather than using this as an occasion to show their might by punishing so-called violators.

Such a step by the police will help make the public more confident about handling the situation.

There have been instances in Chennai where individuals seen walking on the roads have been stopped by police and then punished by being made to do sit-ups or ‘duck sitting’. The enforcing agencies could be a little more practical.

V. Hariharan,

Chennai

The challenge now is to convince people to not only stay indoors but also remain calm. People should be advised not to resort to hoarding that creates further hurdles for the government. Restrictions on the public and the availability of essential services should be honoured by civil enforcement agencies while also keeping in mind genuine requirements.

Varun Dambal,

Albert Uderzo

It is with sadness that I read the report, “Albert Uderzo, co-creator of Asterix and Obelix, is dead” (‘World’ page, March 25).

The drawings of Uderzo not only greatly complemented the text, but also immensely enhanced one’s reading pleasure as well.

Surprisingly, in the book Asterix and the Chariot Race, in which Asterix battles his way across Italy, the name of a Roman chieftain is “Coronavirus”. Now that is called some foresight.

369,2020/03/26,Covid-19: How Tamil Nadu’s grocers are handling the lockdown,"Heroes come in many forms during the 21-day lockdown, and your friendly neighbourhood grocer is one of them

“Salt and jaggery?” V Saraswathy, who runs G Ganapathy Stores in Coimbatore with her husband, attends to a customer, while she is on the phone with me. “Hold on,” she tells me, as she gets to work. It is 5 pm, three hours before Prime Minister Narendra Modi would announce a 21-day lockdown in India, owing to the COVID-19 situation. But it’s business as usual for Saraswathy. She does know that the State is in a lockdown and that she runs the risk of infection if she exposes herself to too many people. “But everyone in the neighbourhood will suffer if we close down,” she says.

As the country stays indoors to break the chain of COVID-19 infection, there are several others out there helping to keep our everyday lives running — medical professionals, the police force, mediapersons... then there are people like Saraswathy, who make sure that our daily supplies never run out. Grocery stores fall in the essential services category, which means that during the lockdown, they can remain open. But several of them have understandably shut down.

Muthu Irulandi, who owns a rice store in Coimbatore, says he has no plans to close his shop. “I sell the most essential of products and cannot afford to stay back home,” he says. “What if someone badly needs to buy rice and all other shops in the vicinity are closed?” Muthu does admit that he fears infection. “I make sure that I don’t talk unnecessarily with my customers. I quickly get what they need and also maintain a distance.” He adds that he suggests home delivery to those walking in, as a better option.

Tiruchi’s Kumudham Department Store now downs its shutter at 6 pm instead of the usual 9 pm. It has mandated personal hygiene and frequent sanitisation protocols for its staff in its five branches, and also offers home delivery to customers who phone in their orders. Says R Raja, managing partner, “Though it is a medical risk, we feel it is our duty to reach out to the customers, especially senior citizens or people with disability.”

Business on the store’s website has seen an uptick, with nearly 20-25 queries coming in daily. “Despite this, in Tiruchi, many people feel satisfied only if they are able to buy things after seeing them personally,” says Raja, adding: “This pandemic doesn’t give us an excuse to hoard things, whether we are buyers or sellers. If everyone behaves in a calm manner, and sets a time slot to visit the grocery, there will be less confusion and more people will get what they need.”

Flow of food

Sanjay Dasari, co-founder of multi-state grocery chain store SunnyBee, is less worried about real shortage of supply, and more about spurt in demand because of worried customers who want to stock up.

“The interstate transport restrictions are mainly for non-essential goods. Once they see that the vehicle is carrying food, like fruits and vegetables, they let it through. Even if that slows down in a while, there is enough crop that farmers produce within the State, to make sure enough vegetables and grains are available,” says the Chennai-based entrepreneur, whose stores are open in Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and a number of other cities.

“For example, in Tamil Nadu, vegetables that shouldn’t be an issue include lady’s finger, brinjal, all gourds, tomato, cauliflower and cabbage. [In Karnataka, tomatoes, flat beans and gourds are common, while in Andhra and Telangana, it is paddy, corn, tomatoes and red gram]. It is only some produce that comes from the North, like onion, potato and apples, whose supply might be delayed.”

SunnyBee operates directly with multiple farmer producer companies in different regions of the country. Sanjay emphasises, “Farms are not like manufacturing companies; this is not the kind of production that can just be stopped. Crops are still growing, and farmers still want to supply and sell it — a drop in demand and fall in prices would hurt them more. All we need is some time to get the new rules clarified.” For now, the restrictions and new written permissions, which will take some days to be sorted out, are what seem to be holding up the stores. Home delivery services are still on, and the store is prioritisng the elderly for it.

Vijay Kumar, who owns a small store in Chennai, says he plans to sell vegetables, milk and curd every day, since he is sure that he will be able to source them. He has run out of all other products. Then there are people like Vayala, who go door-to-door selling vegetables. “I go to the Koyambedu market by 2 am to buy vegetables. As long as there is supply, I will continue to sell them.”

There’s an eerie emptiness about Keela Maasi Veedhi, Madurai’s usually bustling provisions store hub. “They have been instructed by the authorities to shut down since they are all in close proximity to one another,” says E Senthil, who runs Ramana Stores in Othakadai. He, however, plans to keep his shop open. “We’ve been in the business for 40 years, and do not want to turn away our regular customers,” he says.

Senthil knows how serious the situation is. “Which is why we encourage only five people to enter the store at a time,” he says, adding that he is also taking steps to ration out their supply. “I request that people buy not more than three kilograms of lentils at a time.” But sometimes, tensions run high and arguments come up. He also knows that he is fast running out of supplies. “I’m good for the next three days, after that, it all depends on whether the police allow vehicles carrying groceries to ply.”",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/hpw1vv/article31172787.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26MPFOODLEAD2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/coronavirus-chennais-grocery-stores-in-lockdown/article31172794.ece

371,2020/03/26,Michael Perschke steps down as Automobili Pininfarina CEO,"Michael Perschke has announced his decision to step down from his role as the CEO of Automobili Pininfarina, a little over two years after taking over. In a statement on social media, Perschke said, “I have been thinking a lot in the last few weeks and defined for myself a goal — how I can personally contribute more and make a difference. I have therefore decided to step down as CEO of Automobili Pininfarina today.”

Confirming Perschke’s departure, company chairman and Mahindra MD, Pawan Goenka, said, “Michael was instrumental in the creation of Automobili Pininfarina’s business model and strategy. He can look back on an impressive success story in developing a disruptive product and founding this organisation. We wish to place on record our appreciation for Michael Perschke for his passionate contribution and wish him the very best for his future endeavours.”

Perschke took over as CEO of Automobili Pininfarina when Mahindra launched the EV start-up in 2018. It was under his leadership that Automobili Pininfarina went on to unveil the 1,900hp Battista hypercar in 2019, with a 150-unit limited production run. Prior to his role at Pininfarina, Perschke has worked for several carmakers, including a stint at the helm of Audi India.

Goenka confirmed that Automobili Pininfarina COO Per Svantesson will replace Perschke as interim CEO. Svantesson himself has previously worked with Volvo and EV specialist NEVS.

372,2020/03/26,Tata HBX to launch next year,"The HBX will be the entry-level SUV from Tata Motors, slotted below the Nexon

Tata has confirmed that its all-new mini-SUV, based on the HBX concept, will be launched in 2021. The HBX was unveiled at the Auto Expo earlier in the year as a close-to-production concept of the brand’s upcoming mini-SUV. The production SUV was originally expected to be launched in the second-half of this year, but the shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic could potentially delay its introduction.

The HBX is also likely to debut the direct-injection version of Tata’s 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine. While the base engine option is expected to be the same 1.2-litre, naturally-aspirated petrol used in the Tiago, Tigor and Altroz, the 1.2-litre turbo-petrol with direct injection will be a significantly more powerful alternative.

There will be no diesel engine on offer, but Tata is working on an all-electric version of the HBX, which should arrive in a couple of years. The production HBX will be Tata’s second model based on the new ALFA platform, with styling expected to be carried over from the near-production concept showcased at the Auto Expo.

Much like the exterior, most of the production-spec HBX’s interior, too, is likely to remain the same as that of the concept, minus some of the trinkets. Talking about features, the Tata’s mini-SUV is expected to get a part-digital instrument cluster, automatic climate control and a free-standing touchscreen for the infotainment system. Gearbox options for the HBX will most likely include a 5-speed manual and an AMT.

The HBX will be the entry-level SUV from Tata Motors and will slot below the Nexon in the company’s range, with its closest rivals being the Maruti Ignis and the Mahindra KUV100, which is also set to go down the petrol-only route. Expect Tata HBX prices to be in the range of ₹ 4.5 to 7.5 lakh (ex-showroom).",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/tbmnlf/article31169845.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HBO,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/tata-hbx-to-launch-next-year/article31169846.ece

The Civil Supplies Department is planning to engage retail grocery outlets for home delivery of essential food items during the 21-day COVID-19 lockdown period.

The department was in the process of gathering the address and contact details of small and big retail outlets before publishing in vernacular and social media for customers to contact the owners for home delivery.

“Already a prominent outlet is delivering grocery items to their regular customers. We have held talks with grocery dealers. The contact details of even small outlets functioning in residential areas are being collected. We are planning to roll out the programme by end of this week,” Special Secretary-cum-Director Civil Supplies E. Vallavan told The Hindu.

The delivery boys will have to adhere to the general precautions advised to prevent spread of novel coronavirus including wearing masks, carrying hand sanitizer and maintaining personal distance.

377,2020/03/26,FIFA monitoring coronavirus threat in India,"Women’s U-17 WC scheduled to be held here in November

World football governing body FIFA on Wednesday said it was monitoring the developments arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, which is scheduled to host the Women’s U-17 World Cup in November.

FIFA said it was also exploring “alternative solutions”.

The coronavirus outbreak has so far claimed lives of over 20,000 people across the world while infecting more than 4,25,000.

In India, the pandemic has affected over 600 people besides 10 deaths.

“FIFA is currently monitoring developments regarding the coronavirus outbreak in India to decide the future of the U-17 Women’s World Cup which is slated to be held in the country in November,” the apex body said in a statement after PTI inquired.

Alternative solutions

“With public health and safety in mind, FIFA is also working with the Local Organising Committee to identify any potential impact on preparations for the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup India 2020, as well as finding alternative solutions to upcoming events that were planned in India in the lead up to the tournament,” it added.

Sixteen teams will take part in the World Cup, of which only three have sealed their berths.

India has qualified as the host nation, while North Korea (winner) and Japan (runner-up) progressed from the Asian qualifiers.

The World Cup is scheduled to be held from November 2 to 21 with matches to be played in Navi Mumbai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Bhubaneswar and Guwahati.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/fifa-monitoring-virus-threat-in-india/article31167446.ece
378,2020/03/26,‘All pass’ announcement does not go down well with teachers,"The State Government's decision to promote all students of classes I to IX this academic year in consideration of the extraordinary circumstances prevailing over the COVID 19 pandemic has brought huge relief to parents, but a section of teachers is worried that this could turn counter-productive in the long run.

“The government’s announcement in itself is not a matter of surprise since such an approach has been adopted even when the students take up the examinations. The difference, of course, is that students are spared of the trouble of writing exams and the teachers do not have to go through the ordeal of carrying out the valuation,” a headmaster of a government high school in Thuraiyur Union said.

A section of teachers is not satisfied with the ‘all pass’ announcement. This section feels that the consolidated score of the students in the half-yearly exams and the revision exams could have been the basis for ranking the students even if there is no scope to fail any of them.

The teachers say there is little that they are able to do to improve the quality as they face pressure from all sides - the headmaster, students, parents, and the education department. On the one hand, the State Government had upgraded the contents of all the classes with the lofty intention of increasing the capability of the students on a par with that of their peers in Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) system. On the other, the system does not permit filtering of students who do not cope up with the improved content. The ground reality is that the teachers who seek progress and advocate the filtering mechanism are anathema to the existing system, a senior teacher lamented.

Heeding the request of 25 States, the Centre amended Right to Education Act last year to provide leverage for the State governments to fail students. Most of the States had sought an amendment reasoning out that a comprehensive evaluation of students was not possible. A Standing Committee appointed by Parliament had advocated rights for the States to fail undeserving students after determining the comprehension ability at different levels.

The Tamil Nadu Government has thought it fit to continue with its 'all pass' policy due to the fear that detention of students would lead to increase in drop out rates in schools, another headmaster pointed out.

""The State Government may be in a leading position in terms of the gross enrolment ratio in higher education. But then, the real intellectual progress is not happening until they complete their schooling, due to the 'all pass' policy. Eventually, but for the small section of bright students who would perform well even without the support of the teachers, the rest would end up acquiring academic degrees without any skill sets and remain jobless all through their lives,"" he explained.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/all-pass-announcement-does-not-go-down-well-with-teachers/article31175700.ece
379,2020/03/26,Fishermen families at sea,"A section of fishermen community in the coastal districts dependent on daily catch is in dire straits in the midst of the nationwide lockdown till April 14 to combat the spread of novel coronavirus.

Fishermen engaged as workers in mechanised boats are the worst hit as the fishing ban period for 61 days will begin the very next day after the culmination of the lockdown until April 14.

“The lockdown has come at a time when catches of country boats was very poor. Even the daily survival of fishermen families has become rather tough since the habit of saving money is nil in the community,” Kalidass, State Deputy General Secretary of AITUC Meenavar Sangam, who is based in Adhirampattinam in Thanjavur district, said.

“The problem now is that we are unable to reach out to the district administrations as the police vigil has deterred our movement,” Mr. Kalidass lamented.

The relief of ₹1,000 announced by the State Government for each family card would, of course, offer solace to the struggling fishermen, but that would hardly suffice to meet the cost of food and other essentials, he said.

As the business activities in fishing markets are, more or less, regulated by traders at the behest of owners of mechanised trawlers even in normal situations, the sustenance of fishermen in the lower economic ladder has been snuffed out, he explained, emphasising that the district administrations must accord priority for providing the struggling fisher families with essentials for the lockdown period.

Meanwhile, the Fisheries Department has found the social media effective in reaching out to the fishers with messages related to coronavirus pandemic.

Be it mechanised boats or country crafts, fishing activities has been halted till mid-April, the end of the lockdown period, considering the safety of fishers who usually venture into the sea in groups, Joint Director of Fisheries, Nagapattinam, Amal Raj Xavier said.

The department drove home the importance of personal distancing, and the need to remain safe and healthy to support their families in future, to justify complete stoppage of fishing activities.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/fishermen-families-at-sea/article31175468.ece

381,2020/03/26,COVID-19 lockdown puts banana growers and traders in severe distress,"For banana growers in Tiruchi and Karur districts, a major banana growing belt, the COVID-19 pandemic could not have come at a worse time. With the crop in harvest stage, transporting plantains to markets has become a problem due to police restrictions on movement of goods vehicles consequent to the imposition of prohibitory orders to contain the spread of the virus.

Banana growers, who were already reeling under a sharp drop in nendran variety for the second consecutive year, are now complaining that police were not allowing empty goods vehicles to head to fields to load the harvested crop. With the banana raised in thousands of acres in Tiruchi-Karur districts, a major banana growing belt in the State, coming to harvest now, farmers fear that they might suffer heavy losses if the plantain were not harvested within a week. Nendran, Elarasi, Poovan and Karpooravalli are some of the popular varieties raised here.

Banana, they insist, should also be included in the list of essential commodities. Traders too place a similar demand as they are unable to find buyers in view of the closure of fruit stalls across the State.

N.V. Arumugam, a banana grower and trader of Lalgudi in Tiruchi district, says that he is unsure of harvesting the crop in time as he has been struggling to find goods vehicles to transport the produce to markets locally or in far places such as Kerala or Karnataka. His banana crop raised on about 50 acres is ready for harvest and so are bunches in another 50 acres which he had bought as trader.

“Police allow vehicles loaded with banana to proceed, but stop empty vehicles heading to the fields to load the fruits,” he says. According to him, empty vehicles are stopped at check posts at No.1 Tollgate and Karur By-pass Road. “We hire goods vehicles mostly from Pettavaithalai or Perugamani and the vehicles have to pass through the check posts to reach our fields,” he points out.

Pointing out that a large number of farmers are at their wits end, he hopes that the district administration or the government will intervene quickly to save them from heavy losses. “If my crop is not harvested in another week’s time, I stand to suffer a loss of ₹40 lakh,” says Mr.Arumugam.

Farmers of the region can ill afford to suffer such major losses as they have sustained severe losses over the past few years and were hoping for a good harvest this season. The government should relax the norms in the interest of farmers to allow goods vehicles load banana from fields, said N.Veerasekaran, coordinator, Ayyan Vaical Pasanatharar Sangam.

Ayilai Sivasuriyan, district secretary, Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, also complained that goods vehicles transporting banana to Kerala are being stopped at Tamil Nadu check posts. “While transport of banana is being allowed in Kerala, it is unfair that the police stop our vehicles. The police say banana is not on the essential commodities list or seek a letter from the respective Collectors in original to allow the consignments,” Mr. Sivasuriyan alleged.

He pointed out that banana was a perishable commodity and claimed that farmers would suffer a loss of up to ₹2 lakh an acre if their produce was not marketed in time. “It has put the farmers in severe distress and the administration should allow loading, unloading and transport of banana without restriction,” Mr.Sivasuriyan demanded.

Open fruit shops

Wholesale traders at the Vazhakkai mandi at the Gandhi Market in Tiruchi too are in distress as there are not many takers for even the restricted arrivals at the mandi. Though the mandi is officially closed till March 31, about 2,000 bunches of banana are still being brought in here by farmers to be sold every day. “But very few buyers are coming in and we are not able to sell even the 2,000 bunches we are getting now against the normal average arrival of 25,000 bunches a day,” says K.P. Palanivel, president, Plantain Merchants’ Association, Gandhi Market.

Mr. Palanivel attributes the poor off take to the closure of fruit shops as they are not treated as essential commodities. “We depend heavily on buyers from neighbouring towns and districts. As fruit shops aren’t allowed to open, there are no buyers. Along with farmers we traders too are in distress,” he said appealing to the government to allow opening of fruit shops as they were essential to maintain good health and build immunity.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/auq7el/article31174848.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY27BANANATRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/covid-19-lockdown-puts-banana-growers-and-traders-in-severe-distress/article31174849.ece

383,2020/03/26,Coronavirus lockdown | 17 community kitchens to be opened,"District Collector S. Sivarasu said all 14 panchayat unions would have a community kitchen each. Each of them could prepare food for 1,000 persons.

To ensure supply of food to the poor, especially the homeless, 17 community kitchens are being set up in different parts of the district.

While three kitchens will come up in Tiruchi city, remaining 14 have been established in rural areas. Each kitchen is equipped to offer food to 500 to 1,000 persons every day.

Collector S. Sivarasu told The Hindu that all 14 panchayat unions would have a community kitchen each. Each of them could prepare food for 1,000 persons. Depending upon the need, the capacity could be increased. Besides kitchen, utensils, groceries and other essential commodities have also been arranged.

“We are in a position to open the community kitchen any time. We have sought report from the field officials to assess the demand. If need arises, we will open the kitchens immediately,” says Mr. Sivarasu.

In order to avoid too many people in a place, he said that foods would be packed in boxes so as to be distributed to the needy one after another. Foods would not be served in a common place. At least one metre of personal distancing would be followed when distributing food packets.

NGOs' assistance

The Collector said that a few non-government organisations have also come forward to distribute food packets to the needy. Services of like-minded agencies and individuals too would be utilised. The method of utilising their services was being worked out.

He said all 11 Amma Unavagams in the district had seen more crowds for the last two days. The quantum of food items being prepared in them has been doubled to meet the demand. All staff members of the Unavagams have been sensitised on the need to maintain personal hygiene and of the premises.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/17-community-kitchens-to-be-opened/article31174386.ece
384,2020/03/26,Private security guards find it tough,"The lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19 pandemic has put a question mark over the livelihood of security guards serving business establishments.

The impact was felt on the very second day of the 21-day curfew as some of these persons entrusted with the security of the business establishments found it difficult to reach their work spot in the absence of public transport.

They either pedalled their way to their workplace on bicycles or rode a two-wheeler only to be intercepted by patrolling police teams especially at the night as they returned home.

“I was asked to take a detour from the main carriageway to reach my home last evening even though I showed them the identification card issued by my employer. My colleague also faced the same issue when he returned home after his night duty”, said a security guard of a textile showroom on Gandhi Road.

Another issue faced by the private security guards posted for duty at the business establishments was the non-availability of food and snacks. “On the Janata curfew day itself we found it difficult as the eateries remained closed on the day. But some good Samaritans offered food packets to us at the behest of the police,” said private security personnel posted for duty at a furniture outlet.

Ramu (60) of Punnainallur, employed by a private security providing agency in Thanjavur, said the closure of eateries had really put him in a fix as he used to depend on the hotels for his lunch. “As I am living alone in a hut at Punnainallur, I use to leave for work around 7 a.m. hence I cook for myself only in the night”, he said.

Now with almost all hotels in the bazaar closing down, he has to prepare food both morning and evening. Closure of petty shops has also caused them some discomfort .

On the other hand, another set of security guards who were deployed in banking and other bigger establishments through security service providers having national-level or state-level network said their requirements such as food, tea or snacks were taken care of by the institutions that have engaged their agencies. Further, the identification cards issued by their companies save them during the checks conducted by the patrolling teams, they claimed.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/v7mwwh/article31174350.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY27GUARDTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/private-security-guards-find-it-tough/article31174352.ece

Hence, the group members were advised to remain quarantined at the house till the second week of April and to leave the place after getting clearance from the civic body.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/group-from-andhra-pradesh-quarantined/article31173856.ece
392,2020/03/26,Corporation encourages grocers to go in for e-commerce and door delivery,"The Tiruchi Corporation has decided to encourage supply of essential commodities to city residents through e-commerce by roping in leading grocery and departmental stores.

“We are touch with some of the grocery and department stores in the city. At least five players have come forward to be part of the special arrangement,” S. Sivasubramanian, Commissioner, Tiruchi Corporation, told The Hindu on Thursday.

He said that the general public may face some issues in getting essential commodities due to strict enforcement of curfew in the city. The demand for rice, dhal and other items might increase in the days to come as the items stocked up by residents could get exhausted. Hence, it has been decided to encourage grocery merchants in the city to supply essential items at the doorsteps of the customers.

This would help avoid people coming out on streets to buy groceries and vegetables. They could get the items by ordering online or over mobile phones.

Mr. Sivasubramanian said that the interested traders would have to follow all safety precautions while delivering goods to the customers. The mechanism for hassle-free and infection-free supply of essential commodities was being worked out.

He said that the list of interested grocery merchants and their contact addresses were being compiled. It would be publicised shortly. The City Police would be taken into confidence before implementing the supply of essential items to the people. The employees, to be drafted for supplying essential items, would be given identity cards while visiting houses for delivery.

The Commissioner said that there were complaints that few traders, who did not come under the purview of exempted list of essential commodity traders, have been transacting business clandestinely. Officials would closely monitor the enforcement of curfew. Tough action would be taken against violators, he added.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/corporation-encourages-grocers-to-go-in-for-e-commerce-and-door-delivery/article31173783.ece
393,2020/03/26,Lockdown aggravates crisis for fabrication units in Tiruchi,"MSME units which are entirely dependent on the public sector BHEL, Tiruchi, for sub-contracting orders are in deep trouble

The nationwide lockdown enforced to check COVID-19 has aggravated the crisis faced by the MSME fabrication units in Tiruchi region.

MSME units which are entirely dependent on the public sector BHEL, Tiruchi, for sub-contracting orders are in deep trouble. The units were already facing crisis due to the general recession for the last four years that had turned several production units into Non Performing Assets and pushed many others into disstress, said R. Rajappa Rajkumar, president, BHEL Small Industries Association, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The 21-day shutdown has burdened the industries that had already turned sick due to demonetisation, implementation of Goods and Services Tax and delayed payments from prime customers. “Since the promoters and workers are without income, a disastrous situation has arisen warranting intervention by the government for revival of the MSME sector,” Mr. Rajkumar said.

Irrespective of whether the assets of the MSME units were categorised as standard, sub-standard or NPA, financial support must be sanctioned with immediate effect as grant or interest-free loan to meet expenses towards salaries and other critical commitments. Otherwise workers would be pushed into penury, he cautioned.

Similar to the favourable moves for postponing the deadline for filing Income Tax returns, 2020, and filing GST returns for the current and following months to June 30, the Centre must consider the BHELSIA’s request made earlier for payment of arrears of GST in instalments along with the current payment with the holiday period of six months without cancelling the GST registration.

Legal protection should be provided to the MSME units for making arrears in Provident Fund and Employees State Insurance dues in instalments with the holiday period of six months. Considering the slow progress of the market conditions, banks must consider interest subvention of up to 5%, Mr. Rajkumar emphasised.

Alongside, a suitable rehabilitation programme for stressed units must be considered in consultation with promoters for viable operation. The Employees State Insurance Corporation must come forward to pay wages for workers for the lockdown period. All repayment commitments for housing loan, jewel loan and personal loan must be postponed without any penalty.

As a leading MSME organisatio n with 450 members, BHELSIA’s representative must be included in the monitoring committee, Mr. Rajkumar said in the letter, copies of which were also addressed to the Finance and MSME Ministries of the Central Government, the Reserve Bank of India, and the State Industries Ministry.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/6oyfz0/article31170809.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAJU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/lockdown-aggravates-crisis-for-fabrication-units-in-tiruchi/article31170810.ece

People expressed solidarity with the police, sanitation staff, officers of the Revenue, Fire, Medical and Health departments, the municipal corporation and other departments and journalists who are working round the clock to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Overwhelming response

Following the call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, people voluntarily observed ‘Janata Curfew’ for 14 hours on Sunday. The response to the 21-day lockdown call by the Prime Minister has been by large overwhelming till date.

Senior citizens, children and women came out of their houses and thanked the doctors who are treating the suspected and confirmed patients and other staff who were on emergency duties across the country.

“Doctors are great. When nobody is daring to go near the suspected patients, doctors are treating them. I request the government to rope in private hospitals to contain the dreaded disease,” said U. Ratnakar Babu, a businessman.

‘Follow govt. advice’

“I salute the doctors and Medical and Health Department personnel. I request the public to stand behind the doctors and the para-medical staff,” M. Bindu Madhavi, a teacher.

Several others who spoke to The Hindu, felt that people should stand united at this hour of crisis.

Residents, traders, auto workers, private transport operators and petty vendors should demonstrate their commitment by voluntarily observing home isolation for a few more days.

“We have to follow the advice of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Chief Minister, the Ministry of Health and Family and the municipal corporation and take all the necessary precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Let us join hands to fight against the dreaded virus, which has so far killed more than 16,000 people across the world,” said a Class 10 student S.

395,2020/03/26,VIMS designated as regional COVID-19 isolation centre,"It will cater to the needs of patients from four north coastal Andhra districts

The government has identified four hospitals in the State including Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS) in the city as COVID-19 isolation centres, Collector V. Vinay Chand said on Thursday.

“The VIMS has been designated as the regional COVID-19 isolation centre for four districts of Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram, Srikakulam and East Godavari. If any case is reported in these districts, the patients will be shifted to VIMS,” said the Collector after visiting the VIMS and asked the officials to arrange the necessary staff. VIMS will be made a dedicated COVID-19 treatment centre with 400-bed facility within a week.

Additional manpower

VIMS Director K. Satya Varaprasad told The Hindu that they were offering quarantine facility to relatives and acquaintances of Stage 1 and 2 COVID-19 patients at present.

“The State government has sanctioned a premier COVID-19 testing centre at VIMS. We have already initiated measures to acquire 400 ventilators and additional manpower to take care of the patients,” he said.

At present, isolation facility is available at King George Hospital (KGH) and Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases, but to only a limited number in the city. Testing to diagnose the positive cases is being done in Kakinada and Tirupati.

Treatment for those diagnosed positive is being rendered by Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases.

“It is a challenging situation to prevent community transmission as Stage 2 cases have already been confirmed in the city. Of the 400 beds, 100 will be earmarked to treat patients in isolation. We are hopeful of getting 50 to 100 ventilators in the next few days,” said Dr. Varaprasad.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/uj3bqa/article31176841.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27VZ3VIMS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/vims-designated-as-regional-covid-19-isolation-centre/article31176842.ece

In an attempt to ensure smooth supply of vegetables and maintaining the social distancing norms during the lockdown period enforced in the wake of COVID-19, the district administration has decided to increase the number of rythu bazaars from 14 to 32 in the city limits.

399,2020/03/26,Chaos at Vizag fishing harbour as 15 boats return with catch,"Retail traders throng auction platform despite lockdown

Even as lockdown has been enforced owing to COVID-19 threat, chaotic scenes were witnessed at the fishing harbour in the city on Thursday.

As many as 15 mechanised boats with fresh loads of fish returned to the shore. The boats had good catch of tuna, mackerel, goat fish and silver bellies fish.

Retail traders thronged the fishing harbour, not bothering about the lockdown. An utter chaos prevailed at the auction centre with fishermen and traders engaging in heavy bargaining, throwing the social distancing norms to the wind.

The personnel of State police and marine police, and the officials of Fisheries Department and Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT) had to intervene to contain the situation.

The officials, along with a large posse of police force rushed to the spot and held talks with Andhra Pradesh Mechanised Boat Operators’ Association and other organisations to hammer out a solution.

Sale allowed from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m.

Finally, it was resolved that the authorities will permit sale of fish from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. daily, after convincing the boat owners to use ice to enhance the shelf life of their catch.

Incidentally, the lockdown led to the closure of restaurants, hotels and exports by bulk purchasers, and the fishermen are forced to lower the prices to clear the stock.

Joint Director of Fisheries K. Phaniprakash told The Hindu that with the return of 15 boats, almost all vessels which went on a voyage from Visakhapatnam towards Gopalapatnam and Paradip to catch tuna and other fish have come to the jetty.

Assistant Director of Fisheries P.

401,2020/03/26,Reefer movement to Vizag port to resume today,"Passes will be issued to vehicles ferrying shrimp and fish products

The movement of reefers to Visakhapatnam Port from the Container Freight Stations and processing plants at Bhimavaram and other places in the Godavari districts which remained paralysed for the fourth consecutive day on Thursday owing to the COVID-19 lockdown will resume from Friday.

On an average, 40 to 50 containers carrying shrimp and other fish items are transported to Visakhapatnam port, after they are processed in the Godavari districts.

Owing to denial of permission by the police during the lockdown period now, the vehicles laden with containers are not able to ply on roads from the Container Freight Stations to the processing plants, and again to Visakha Container Terminal Private Limited (VCTPL), which manages the container berth of Visakhapatnam Port as a Build, Own and Operator (BOT) investor.

According to sources, as many as 200 vehicles carrying the export products are stranded owing to lockdown. VPT Chairman K. Rama Mohan Rao met Collector V. Vinay Chand on Thursday and a decision was taken allowing the port authorities to issue passes to the vehicles. DCP (South) B. Uday Bhaskar has been made nodal officer for smooth issuing of passes.

National Association of Container Freight Station vice-president G. Sambasiva Rao told The Hindu that they had represented about the issue to the port, district administration and police authorities, seeking issuing of passes so that they could carry out the transport activity.

Essential service

“Being essential service providers, we have been exempted. The reefers carry highly perishable commodities with a limited shelf life,” said Mr. Sambasiva Rao. Appreciating the measures undertaken for containing the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) in and around Visakhapatnam region, Mr. Sambasiva Rao said port activities would come under the Essential Services Act. “So, there is a dire necessity to move the raw materials used for food processing units, pharmaceutical units and power generation companies without any interruption,” he said.

Perishable goods

“If we cannot move the requisite raw materials on a priority basis, power production will be badly affected and perishable goods such as seafood will be destroyed and pharma units cannot manufacture drugs at this juncture. Reefer cargo also comes under Essential Services Act. Finished products/fish was stuck up at food processing plants due to space constraints in cold storage,” he added.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/n1ef63/article31176502.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27VZ3VCTPL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/reefer-movement-to-vizag-port-to-resume-today/article31176503.ece
402,2020/03/26,"Amar Chitra Katha compiles stories of India’s unheard-of, historic women","Pandita Ramabai, Muthulakshmi Reddy and Janaki Ammal are among the seven women whose stories are narrated in the form of a comic

Rukhmabai, an educated child bride, went on to question the intolerant society of the 1860s about why a woman cannot chose to leave her husband. She did this by incessantly writing letters to the then-editor of the Times of India. Muthulakshmi Reddy, the first woman legislator, after receiving the permission for education from the Maharaja of Pudukkottai, was pelted with stones while walking on the road for daring to study. Janaki Ammal, a woman from a tiny hamlet in Kerala, went on to become the first Indian woman botanist, and then the Director-General of the Botanical Survey of India shortly after. The list goes on...

How many of these names are familiar to us? How much information is left on these iconic women to research on? Zilch. How many of them could easily replace the male names of acclaim that time and again have been spoken of, even in our school textbooks? Probably, all. Amar Chitra Katha’s ambitious graphic volume, Women Path-Breakers: Stories of Success and Strength unearths the names and stories of such phenomenal women who have paved the way to a lot of the rights that today’s women enjoy.

Ideated by Reena Ittyerah Puri and scripted and researched on by Tripti Nainawal, the comic volume digs deep into the lives of seven women who have changed the course of the fields they were involved in.

Reena’s mother often told her stories that more or less proved as inspiration to this volume. “My mother, who will turn 101 soon, became a doctor in the 1930s. She was a path breaker herself who left Kerala at the age of 15 and travelled to Agra to study Medicine at a time when the British were encouraging women to become doctors because Indian women refused to visit British male doctors. She would later tell me the stories of her colleagues who had braved many odds to make themselves seen,” Reena recalls. Later when she joined Amar Chitra Katha as executive editor, she realised that a lot of the biographies that they did were of men.

Everyday sheroes

A few exceptions were there, of course. “But we wanted to talk about ordinary women from India, who did something for themselves; to be independent. I started off with just a handful of names, but we found over 50 women who we have not heard of, despite their accomplishments,” continues Reena.

The collection which was released at the end of December 2019, had been in the works for close to a year- and-a-half: the time of research and dearth of information are responsible for the time frame, she says. “Though we had marked the book for readers of the age group of eight to 16, Amar Chitra Katha is also read by a lot of adults. So this book is for them as well,” continues Reena adding that this volume is relevant to everyone, thanks to its content.

For Tripti, this was an eye opener: “What I found appalling about our own documentation was the fact there was absolutely nothing other than surface information. Take Muthulakshmi Reddy for instance: she has very many firsts and I just happened to find her. She was not even there in our first list,” says Tripti.

Writing a full fledged script with limited resources was a mammoth task; and the fact the comic books don’t have straight narratives did not help. However, to make the narratives more action-packed, a tad bit of fictionalisation has been done, only in terms of dialogues and interactions.

As in the case of all Amar Chitra Katha books, in this one too, the illustrations play a seminal role in the narrative. They were worked on panel by panel, after the editorial team went through the entire narrative, says Reena. Costumes, settings and the portraits of the women were referred to, with the limited amount of pictures they could find. This was another challenging process. “For instance, once they get the reference portrait, the artists would have to envision how they looked as a two-year-old,” explains Reena. Each of the stories has been illustrated by a different artist. Reena hopes that more of such stories will see the light in the coming days. As for now, they are working on a volume of women freedom fighters in a similar format.",books,https://www.thehindu.com/books/4m8haj/article31173435.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/494,https://www.thehindu.com/books/amar-chitra-katha-compiles-stories-of-indias-unheard-of-historic-women/article31173436.ece
403,2020/03/26,Kadhai Osai brings Tamil audiobooks to your playlists,"Deepika Arun’s audiobook company Kadhai Osai is currently bringing out a chapter of ‘Sivagamiyin Sabatham’ every day

Listening to, and telling stories, can be therapeutic in these uncertain times. While we have our pick of podcasts available globally, our choices when it comes to regional audiobooks taper down.

Chennai-based storyteller Deepika Arun, however, has found a way around this. On her podcast, Kadhai Osai, she has been releasing chapters of the mammoth Tamil book, Sivagamiyin Sabatham, daily for 10 days now. The over 1000-pager written by Kalki during 1944 to 1946, is set in 7th-Century South India. It is available on streaming software such as Spotify and YouTube.

This is just one of the many audio-tales for which Kadhai Osai is a storehouse. “I was introduced to the world of audiobooks through Stephen Fry’s Harry Potter,” says Deepika. “I am a huge Potterhead and I was not sure I would be able to enjoy the audiobook as much as I enjoyed reading it. But to my surprise, I was hooked to his narration.”

After that, she began searching for Tamil books to listen to. “There were a few YouTube channels who published audiobooks in Tamil. But most did not have the right tone or pronunciation.” So she decided to invest in a mic, and some sound editing software, and started Kadhai Osai last year, from the comfort of her room.

Founder of the Jhoola Activity Centre for children in Nanganallur, Deepika found that storytelling came naturally to her. “After I finished recording a few stories, my cousin came up to me and said, ‘I still remember how when we were kids, you would narrate stories at our grandmother’s house’.”

After Kadhai Osai’s success, Deepika was hired as a consultant for Swedish audiobook company Storytel’s India branch. “They were looking to expand to Tamil, and were speaking with publishers for rights. They brought me on as a consultant to speak to authors and get voice artistes to narrate these stories.”

While she collates voice artistes, she herself has given voice for Storytel as well, narrating authors Gokul Seshadri’s and Rajesh Kumar’s works. “For voice artistes, we need people with perfect pronunciation and the ability to modulate their voice. If they enjoy reading a story in Tamil, everything else just falls into place,” she says.

Whenever a story has to be recorded, Storytel holds an audition with the voices they have in their bank. “For example, a bass voice would be nice for a thriller, and a lighter voice would go with romantic stories.” Three-minute samples of these voices reading the story are then sent to the author, who decides which voice would suit his story.

Deepika’s pick I enjoy the Hindi podcast, Croc’s Tales. In it, Anand Sivakumaran, collects words or phrases from listeners, and makes up stories using these prompts.

On Kadhai Osai, however, she is the only narrator, and sticks to works available in the public domain such as books by Kalki, Lalgudi Saptarishi Ramamrutham, and Pudhumaipithan. Her father, Varadharajan, is also an author and his works feature in Kadhai Osai as well.

“One of the most important things I have learnt in this past year is that you should not be narrating in a sing-song voice,” she says, proceeding to describe it. “People generally listen to audiobooks while they are doing something else, like driving or cooking. The sing-song narration makes them zone out after 10 minutes.”

She also underlines the importance of modulating her voice according to each character she is playing. This skill, she happily discovered, her five-year-old daughter picked up as well. “I sometimes let her record her own books, and she was using different voices for the monkeys, owls, dogs and cats,” she laughs.

But the main purpose behind story narration for Deepika is to preserve the Tamil language in its correct diction. “I find so many people who have been born and brought up here, who don’t even say ‘Tamizh’ the proper way. If my channel helps people pronounce Tamil better, that would make me very happy.”

Sweet Sixteen (Yeah, Right!), Eighteen and Wiser: Not Quite, and Seventeen and Done (You Bet!) revolve around a smart and confident teenager Rinki. Vibha, a Chennai-based advertising consultant, says that Rinki resembles her only to a certain extent. “Rinki moves from Delhi to Chennai. I too moved to Chennai as a teenager from Kolkata. So the idea for the books have always been on my mind. Rinki initially finds it difficult to adjust, then she slowly begins to like her new life, and by the end she is a complete convert.”

Vibha is quite forthcoming about the criticisms she has received. “There are some Punjabi-bashing jokes which some reviewers didn’t like. The books are actually the perspective of a North Indian of the south, there is nothing more to it.” Penguin India got two deals to convert the books for screen, and one of them worked out.

Humour is among Vibha’s fortes, but her characterisation is equally interesting. For example Mahi in her recent book Bhatinda to Bangkok (Bloomsbury, 2019), a sequel to Ludhiana to London (Juggernaut Books), is super confident and doesn’t care that her English isn’t very good. “I have written the book in Hinglish. Mahi is a party planner and is rather good at her job. But then again I received criticism for using Hinglish. I think that the book should be judged on the merit of what it intends to convey rather than what you want it to be. And I think that a good book will find the right reader!”

Vibha is now working on a graphic novel The Secret Life of Debbie G, illustrated by Kalyani Ganapathy, published by Harper Collins, which will be released in May 2020. It is about how a 16-year-old becomes an online sensation overnight. And how that impacts her life and her emotional health. The novel is a departure from Vibha’s earlier books and she admits: “It involves a lot of hard work.”",books,https://www.thehindu.com/books/8yp7y/article31171571.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG1335-1,https://www.thehindu.com/books/author-vibha-batra-looks-forward-to-her-fiction-series-being-optioned-for-screen/article31171572.ece
406,2020/03/26,Sports-loving Sara is our new best friend,"Bookosmia has launched two stories in Kannada and Sara’s Corner where the 10-year-old will curate fun sporty content

Parents are under pressure now to keep children occupied and engaged at home. That was reason enough for Bookosmia to come up with programming for children to kill time creatively. Bookosmia made two Kannada stories available for free from March 25. The online platform recently launched Sara’s Corner, detailing the exploits of a 10-year-old sports-loving athlete. “In this section Sara curates fun sports stuff,” says Nidhi Mishra, Founder and CEO of Bookosmia, a company that provides content for children across physical and digital formats. “For instance, Sara has provided match predictions, interviews and cricket anecdotes from the recently concluded Women’s T-20 World Cup. Bookosmia’s aim is to make children fall in love with reading and writing.”

Nidhi spoke to MetroPlus about Sara’s latest adventures.

Excerpts

Could you tell us about the Kannada stories?

Bookosmia (smell of books) released two stories in Kannada for Ugadi. We are all trying to adjust to the new situation against the backdrop of coronavirus. We have children, adults and senior citizens — all cooped up at home. This self-imposed isolation is for our benefit, but staying isolated during a festival makes us feel bad, that is why we released stories for Ugadi. We thought it is not every day that one reads a Kannada story to one’s child, which talks about culture and festivals. These stories are perfect for children in the age group of two to six years.

How about content for older readers?

We have focussed on older children as well. The eight years and above segment is under served. Currently, the content for older readers is either too westernised or not age-appropriate. The problem is we classify everyone in the age group of two to 14 as children without distinguishing between the specific intellectual needs of children in each group. We are focussing on the eight years and above age group as it is too old for talking animals and too young for adult content.

How does the content you offer stand out in a market flooded with similar products?

We are disrupting the content industry for children, both in terms of uniqueness of our product, delivery and connection with children.

What can you tell us about Sara?

Sara loves sports and drama. She talks about current affairs including games and festivals. Sports is a powerful medium to give the message of the importance of struggle, persistence, teamwork and humility. Our content has organic roots. We held writing contests across India and received at least 500 stories from every corner of the country from Surat to Kolkata and Chennai to Jammu.

In creating Sara, we wanted to make something different — no mythology, no Hindi cinema, no rockets or superpowers. Sara is someone young people can relate to. She is just like them, figuring out the world, not just talking, but listening, reading and asking questions. You just have to look at her, see and listen to her and you will connect with her instantly.

Could you talk about Sara’s look?

Sara was designed by Parvati Pillai, ex design head of Chumbak. She is now based in Finland. She is famous for her quirky Indian designs and did a fabulous job. Sara is our brainchild. It is all teamwork — her expressions, language and posture. Bookosmia co-founder, Archana, wrote Sara’s dialogue.

Our Chief Visual Designer, Aayushi Yadav adapted these ideas to powerful images. She brought a perfect mix of humour and flair to the illustrations.

What was the brief to the designer and artist?

We defined her personality at length (how she talks, what bothers her, what she wears). We often laugh when we hear the creative team say, “Sara will not wear those clothes” or “Sara would ask this question.” We have emotionally invested in making Sara the girl we would love to hang out with.",books,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/bookosmia-launched-two-kannada-stories-for-children-to-read-while-cooped-up-at-home/article31170607.ece
407,2020/03/26,Author Nandini Nayar offers an online writing course for youngsters,"The goal of the course is to engage young adults in a creatively, in the literary space

Here’s good news for parents who look for options to keep their wards creatively engaged in this social distancing phase. City-based writer Nandini Nayar has come out with a three-week online writing course for children above 10 years.

The story writing class introduces them to elements that go into writing a story and guides them on the aspects to consider. “It is easy for children stuck at home to get bored and distracted. Also, there is tension at home with Corona news. This is the the time when one can turn one’s energies towards getting creative,” says Nandini who is also uploading storytelling videos on Instagram for toddlers.

Communicating through Gmail Hangouts, Nandini will also give assignments at the end of the session. She makes it clear that these are fun assignments “I want them to have fun even as they take to writing. Writing has helped me through many serious and stressful situations. I would like to pass this on to the children, so that they can enjoy themselves and keep writing so that it brings them solace. Even if one never wants to publish, just writing a diary can help one communicate emotions in a nice way.”

Any child above 10 years can sign up for the course. The only requisite is parents should make an honest assessment of their ward. “Children who love to read and write will benefit from this course than a child who dislikes reading and considers writing assignments an unpleasant chore,” she says adding some parents also asked her if they too can join. “There is no upper limit but I am referring to young adults so will be talking to them at their level. Parents also might be busy with most of them working from home and some mothers who are homemakers have children and chores to deal with.”

Nandini began writing for her son. In her 20-year-journey as children books author, she has written 54 books till now. “My son is in the first year of college, and he’s taken up reading again,” she says.
