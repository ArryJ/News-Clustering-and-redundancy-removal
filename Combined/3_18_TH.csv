0,2020/03/18,Coronavirus | IOC says no ‘ideal’ solution as athletes voice COVID-19 concerns,"Member Wickenheiser calls the decision to proceed ‘insensitive, irresponsible’

Olympic chiefs acknowledged on Wednesday there was no “ideal” solution to staging the Tokyo Olympics in response to a growing number of athletes expressing concern as the coronavirus pandemic swept the globe.

Football’s European Championship and the Copa America have been postponed for a year, but the International Olympic Committee says it is “fully committed” to holding the Games from July 24 as scheduled.

“This is an exceptional situation which requires exceptional solutions,” an IOC spokesperson said after criticism from top athletes that they would be forced to take health risks should the Games go ahead.

“The IOC is committed to finding a solution with the least negative impact for the athletes, while protecting the integrity of the competition and the athletes’ health,” the spokesperson continued.

“No solution will be ideal in this situation, and this is why we are counting on the responsibility and solidarity of the athletes.”

Olympic pole vault champion Katerina Stefanidi and Britain’s world champion heptathlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson both voiced concerns at the IOC’s stance.

“The IOC wants us to keep risking our health, our family’s health and public health to train every day?” Stefanidi tweeted. “You are putting us in danger right now, today, not in 4 months.”

Johnson-Thompson, who won her multi-event world title in Doha in October, criticised the IOC for telling athletes to train “as best they can”, saying it was at odds with stringent government health measures. “I feel under pressure to train and keep the same routine which is impossible,” she tweeted.

‘Bigger than even the Olympics’

Hayley Wickenheiser, a Canadian IOC member with four ice hockey gold medals, warned “this crisis is bigger than even the Olympics”.

“From an athlete perspective, I can only imagine and try to empathise with the anxiety and heartbreak they are feeling right now,” she said in a statement.

“The uncertainty of not knowing where you’re going to train tomorrow as facilities close and qualification events are cancelled all over the world would be terrible if you’ve been training your whole life for this.”

She added: “I think the IOC insisting this will move ahead, with such conviction, is insensitive and irresponsible given the state of humanity.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/np7ipd/article31102348.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19RING,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/coronavirus-ioc-says-no-ideal-solution-as-athletes-voice-covid-19-concerns/article31102349.ece

2,2020/03/18,Coronavirus | Kevin Durant among Brooklyn Nets players diagnosed with COVID-19,"“Everyone be careful, take care of yourself and quarantine. We're going to get through this,” Durant was quoted as saying.

Kevin Durant is reportedly among four Brooklyn Nets players who have tested positive for the new coronavirus and are in isolation.

The injured Durant, who has yet to play for the Nets since signing for the club last year, confirmed to The Athletic website he had tested positive for the virus.

“Everyone be careful, take care of yourself and quarantine. We're going to get through this,” Durant was quoted as saying.

Also read: NBA suspends season until further notice, over coronavirus

News that the two-time NBA Finals MVP was among those who had contracted the virus came soon after the Nets confirmed four players had tested positive for COVID-19.

“Four Brooklyn Nets players have tested positive for the COVID-19 virus,” the team said in a statement. “Of the four, one player is exhibiting symptoms while three are asymptomatic.

“All four players are presently isolated and under the care of team physicians.”

The Nets said they were notifying known contacts of the players including those from teams who played against the Nets shortly before the NBA shut down its season indefinitely on March 12.

The last team to play the Nets was the Western Conference-leading Los Angeles Lakers, who were stunned 104-102 by Brooklyn on March 10.

“All players and members of the Nets travel party are being asked to remain isolated, closely monitor their health and maintain constant communication with team medical staff,” the Nets said.

The four cases more than double the known number of cases of COVID-19 among NBA players.

Utah Jazz defensive standout Rudy Gobert was the first NBA player to test positive -- his illness triggering the NBA's current closure.

Teammate Donovan Mitchell and Christian Wood of the Detroit Pistons have also tested positive for the virus.

Woods was tested after reporting flu-like symptoms to the Pistons medical staff.

Mitchell was tested after Gobert's positive test, but had not experienced symptoms.

“I don't have any symptoms,” Mitchell said in an interview broadcast by ABC television on Monday. “I could walk down the street (and) if it wasn't public knowledge that I was sick, you wouldn't know it. I think that's the scariest part about this virus.

“You may seem fine, be fine. And you never know who you may be talking to, who they're going home to.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/uayjnr/article31095196.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILES-BASKET-NBA-NETS-VIRUS-HEALTH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/kevin-durant-among-brooklyn-nets-players-diagnosed-with-covid-19/article31095197.ece

5,2020/03/18,"Apple’s upgrade of the MacBook Air starts at ₹92,990","MacBook Air now features double the storage and support for upto a 6K external display

The new MacBook Air delivers up to two times faster CPU performance and up to 80% faster graphics performance, letting customers breeze through daily activities and play more games. Now starting with 256GB of storage, MacBook Air allows customers to store even more movies, photos and files. “With its brilliant 13-inch Retina display for vivid images and sharp text, Touch ID for easy login and secure online purchases, spacious trackpad, and all-day battery life combined with the power of macOS Catalina, it’s the best MacBook Air ever made,” comments the tech giant.

“Today we’re giving [the MacBook Air] a huge update, with two times faster performance, the new Magic Keyboard, double the storage, a new lower price of $999 and an even lower price of $899 for education,” said Tom Boger, Apple’s senior director of Mac and iPad Product Marketing.

Featuring the latest 10th-generation Intel Core processors up to 1.2GHz quad-core Core i7 with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.8GHz, MacBook Air delivers up to two times faster performance when compared to the previous generation. And with Intel Iris Plus Graphics, graphics-intensive activities like playing games and editing video are faster than ever.

Design and storage, bettered

There is also a major overhaul aesthetically. The new Magic Keyboard, first introduced on the 16-inch MacBook Pro, features a redesigned scissor mechanism delivers 1mm of key travel for a comfortable and stable key feel, while the new inverted-“T” arrangement for the arrow keys makes them easier to find without looking down.

Additional specs A three-mic array for more clear voice capture for FaceTime calls with friends and family.

The Force Touch trackpad for precise cursor control and multi-touch navigation.

Thunderbolt 3 ports for data transfer, charging and video output in a single connector.

Support for up to a 6K external display, a first for MacBook Air.

Advanced stereo speakers for immersive, wide stereo sound

Plus, the device features a unibody wedge design made from 100 percent recycled aluminum and comes in three finishes — gold, silver and space gray. The 13-inch Retina display delivers over 4 million pixels and millions of colors, so whether customers are reading an email, enjoying a movie or editing their photos, text is razor sharp and images are more true to life.

Nowadays, storage is everything. MacBook Air now starts with 256GB of storage, double that of the previous generation, so customers can store even more movies, photos and files. And for those who need even more storage capacity, MacBook Air offers up to a 2TB SSD, double the previous maximum storage.

Bump-ups with security

MacBook Air comes with the Apple T2 Security Chip, Apple’s own custom-designed second-generation silicon, which checks that software loaded during the boot process has not been tampered with and provides on-the-fly data encryption for everything stored on the SSD. This allows MacBook Air and any Mac with the T2 chip to deliver the most secure boot process and storage of any notebook. The T2 also protects Touch ID information, so whether customers are unlocking their Mac, entering an online password or making online purchases, their information stays safe.

6,2020/03/18,"Apple unveils its most advanced iPad Pro, prices starting at ₹71,900","The new iPad is equipped with the A12Z Bionic chip as well as a breakthrough LiDAR scanner

“Now with the A12Z Bionic chip, iPad Pro is faster and more powerful than most Windows PC laptops,” says the California-based tech giant.

The new iPad Pro adds an Ultra Wide camera, studio-quality mics and a breakthrough LiDAR Scanner that delivers cutting-edge depth-sensing capabilities, opening up more pro workflows and supporting pro photo and video apps. The LiDAR Scanner, along with pro cameras, motion sensors, pro performance, pro audio, the stunning Liquid Retina display and powerful apps, extends the lead of iPad Pro as the world’s best device for Augmented Reality (AR).

With iPadOS 13.4, Apple brings trackpad support to iPad, giving customers an all-new way to interact with their iPad. Rather than copying the experience from macOS, trackpad support has been completely reimagined for iPad. As users move their finger across the trackpad, the pointer elegantly transforms to highlight user interface elements. Multi-Touch gestures on the trackpad make it fast and easy to navigate the entire system without users ever lifting their hand.

Trackpad Support comes to iOS iPadOS 13.4 brings trackpad support to iPad for the first time for a more natural typing experience and added precision for tasks such as writing and selecting text, working with spreadsheets and pro workflows. Designed specifically for the touch-first experience on iPad, the cursor appears as a circle that highlights user interface elements, text fields and apps on the Home screen and Dock, giving a clear indication of what users can click on. Fluid gestures on the trackpad make it easy to switch between apps, access the app switcher and activate the Dock, Control Center and apps in Slide Over.

Improved displays, audio and cameras

The edge-to-edge Liquid Retina display — in both 11-inch and 12.9-inch sizes — is the world’s most advanced mobile display. Featuring P3 wide colour support, it lets customers see photos, videos, apps and games in vivid, true-to-life detail. ProMotion technology automatically adjusts the display refresh rate up to 120 Hz for ultra-smooth scrolling and responsiveness.

The Pro camera system on iPad Pro features a 12MP Wide camera for capturing stunning photos and 4K video, and now includes a 10MP Ultra Wide camera that zooms out two times to capture a much wider field of view. Adding a second camera doubles the photo and video possibilities, enabling different perspectives and multi-camera use — a game changer for creative pros.

iPad Pro now features five studio-quality microphones for capturing super clean audio and the quietest details, and delivers an immersive sound experience with four-speaker audio that automatically adjusts to any orientation, no matter how it is held.

What of the LiDAR scanner?

The LiDAR Scanner measures the distance to surrounding objects up to 5 meters away, works both indoors and outdoors, and operates at the photon level at nano-second speeds. New depth frameworks in iPadOS combine depth points measured by the LiDAR Scanner, data from both cameras and motion sensors, and is enhanced by computer vision algorithms on the A12Z Bionic for a more detailed understanding of a scene. The tight integration of these elements enables a whole new class of AR experiences on iPad Pro.

Every existing ARKit app automatically gets instant AR placement, improved motion capture and people occlusion. Using the latest update to ARKit with a new Scene Geometry API, developers can harness the power of the new LiDAR Scanner to unleash scenarios never before possible.

Additionally, the LiDAR Scanner improves the Measure app, making it faster and easier to automatically calculate someone’s height, while helpful vertical and edge guides automatically appear to let users more quickly and accurately measure objects.

The 11-inch iPad Pro, available in Indian markets soon, starts at ₹71,900 for the Wi-Fi model and ₹85,900 for the Wi-Fi + Cellular model, and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro starts at ₹89,900 for the Wi-Fi model and ₹1,03,900 for the Wi-Fi + Cellular model.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/pg7haf/article31099785.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Applenew-iPad-Pro03182020,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/apple-announces-most-advanced-ipad-pro-for-2020-with-lidar-scanner/article31099786.ece
7,2020/03/18,Coronavirus | World grapples with ‘once-in-100-year’ virulence,"COVID-19 has now infected more than 2,00,000 people in 164 nations; Australian PM warns crisis could last six months.

Hundreds of millions of people worldwide were adjusting on Wednesday to once-in-a-generation measures to battle the COVID-19 pandemic that is not only killing the old and vulnerable but also threatening prolonged economic misery.

The fast-spreading disease that jumped from animals to humans in China has now infected about 2,00,000 people and caused over 8,000 deaths in 164 nations, triggering emergency lockdowns and injections of cash unseen since Second World War.

“This is a once-in-a-hundred-year type event,” said Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, warning the crisis could last six months as his nation became the latest to restrict gatherings and overseas travel.

“Life is changing in Australia, as it is changing all around the world,” he added, as his government prepared for a potentially exponential rise after only six deaths so far.

Alarm in Italy

There was particular alarm in Italy, which has experienced an unusually high death rate — 2,503 from 31,506 cases — and was drafting thousands of student doctors into service before final exams to help an overwhelmed health service.

Around the world, rich and poor alike saw lives turned upside-down as events were cancelled, shops stripped, workplaces emptied, streets deserted, schools shut and travel at a minimum.

The crisis has created a wave of solidarity in some countries, with neighbours, families and colleagues coming together to look after the most needy, including dropping supplies at the doors of those forced to stay indoors.

In the hills of southern Spain, applause rings out every evening at 8 p.m. as self-isolated neighbours thank health services for their work and greet each other.

Spooked by a seemingly inevitable global recession, rich nations are unleashing billions of dollars in stimulus to economies, aid to health services, loans to tottering businesses, and help for individuals fearful for mortgages and other routine payments.

“We have never lived through anything like this. And our society, which had grown used to changes that expand our possibilities of knowledge, health and life, now finds itself in a war to defend all we have taken for granted,” Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez Sanchez told Parliament.

The chamber was nearly empty with most lawmakers kept away.

Taking their cue from the waning of the coronavirus in China, where it emerged at the end of last year, optimists predict a bounce back once the epidemic also passes its peak elsewhere — hoped to be within months.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday called for a unified national response to the COVID-19 threat, after coming under fire for downplaying the pandemic and allowing states to go their own way.

Mr. Trump’s call came as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the White House was presenting a massive economic stimulus plan to Congress and was looking at sending direct payments to all Americans, as well as aid to embattled airlines.

Bringing home that nobody is immune to catching the virus, one of the world’s most high-profile athletes, National Basketball Association star Kevin Durant, reportedly confirmed he tested positive.

In a White House appearance that was striking for its mostly measured and sober tone, Mr. Trump praised the Democratic Governors of New York and California — whom he has frequently tangled with — and excoriated States that were not adhering to strict new guidelines on social distancing.

“We are looking to save the maximum number of lives. Everything else is going to come back, but a life is not going to come back,” Mr. Trump said.

China will extend financial assistance amounting to $500 million to Sri Lanka to help the island nation combat COVID19 that has affected 50 persons so far. One patient has recovered, authorities said.

According to a press statement from the Chinese Embassy here, the Finance Ministry of Sri Lanka and the China Development Bank (CDB) on Wednesday signed the agreement, with “big concessional terms on both interest and tenure”, at Temple Trees, the official residence of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.

“The facility was urgently requested by the Sri Lankan government and supported by the Chinese side, under current financial situation in Sri Lanka and the background of fighting COVID-19 pandemic with all-out efforts,” the Chinese Embassy’s statement said.

15,2020/03/18,Iraq’s Shia parties line up to oppose new PM-designate,"They say President should have consulted them.

Iraq’s typically divided Shiite political parties lined up on Wednesday to signal their opposition to premier-designate Adnan al-Zurfi, less than 24 hours after his nomination.

The 54-year-old lawmaker and former Najaf Governor was nominated on Tuesday to be Iraq’s new Prime Minister, the second attempt to replace outgoing premier Adel Abdel Mahdi this year.

But several Shia blocs have already signalled their displeasure.

On Wednesday, the State of Law coalition, led by ex-PM Nuri al-Maliki, and lawmakers linked to the relatively moderate cleric Ammar al-Hakim said they opposed the President’s unilateral selection of the Prime Minister.

President Barham Saleh, they insisted, should have referred to Parliament’s largest bloc to select a nominee. The powerful Fatah bloc had also slammed Mr. Zurfi’s nomination as unconstitutional.

Along with smaller parties, those opposed could add up to more than 100 lawmakers voting against a Cabinet led by Mr. Zurfi.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kkwcq3/article31101891.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Iraqs-Shiite-parties-line-up-to-oppose-new-PM-designate,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iraqs-shia-parties-line-up-to-oppose-new-pm-designate/article31101892.ece

The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday rejected economically devastated Venezuela’s request for a $5 billion loan to help it cope with the onslaught of COVID-19 on the country that an aid agency warned is as prepared as war-torn Syria.

President Nicolas Maduro made the request earlier on Tuesday but, in a statement hours later, the Washington-based institution indirectly cited a dispute over Mr. Maduro’s leadership in denying his petition.

In a letter to IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva, Mr. Maduro said a $5 billion loan from the IMF “will contribute significantly to strengthening our detection and response systems.”

It was the country’s first loan request to the IMF since 2001. “Unfortunately, the Fund is not in a position to consider this request,” because there is “no clarity” on international recognition of the country’s government, the IMF said.

“IMF engagement with member countries is predicated on official government recognition by the international community, as reflected in the IMF’s membership. There is no clarity on recognition at this time,” the statement said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/imf-rejects-venezuelas-5-bn-virus-aid-request/article31101809.ece

18,2020/03/18,UK Finance Minister Rishi Sunak unveils £330 billion rescue package in coronavirus fight,"As part of his bailout package, Mr. Sunak extended a business rates holiday to all businesses in the retail and hospitality sector for 12 months as well as a cash grant to help them survive.

Britain’s Indian-origin Finance Minister Rishi Sunak on Tuesday unveiled a “bold” rescue package to help U.K. businesses and the economy survive the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer joined British Prime Minister Boris Johnson during his daily briefing from 10 Downing Street in London to announce that he is making available £330 billion of loan guarantees to businesses to help them meet their day to day needs amid the ongoing near-lockdown.

“The coronavirus pandemic is a global health emergency but it is also an economic emergency. We have never in peacetime faced an economic fight like this one,” said Mr. Sunak, who acknowledged that people’s anxiety about the disease is matched by their anxiety about their livelihoods and therefore “unimaginable” level of intervention is required.

“This is not a time for ideology or orthodoxy. This is a time to be bold. A time for courage,” he said, adding that he will do “whatever it takes” to support people’s jobs and incomes.

As part of his bailout package, Mr. Sunak extended a business rates holiday to all businesses in the retail and hospitality sector for 12 months as well as a cash grant to help them survive and said any business that needs help will be able to access a loan on attractive terms.

An agreed facility with the Bank of England will help support liquidity amongst larger firms and for smaller firms, the business interruption loan scheme will be extended to offer loans of up to £5 million.

Mortgage lenders will give a three-month mortgage holiday to people who need help and there will also be special help for airlines, hit particularly hard as a result of travel restrictions around the world.

“Yes this enemy can be deadly, but it is also beatable — and we know how to beat it and we know that if as a country we follow the scientific advice that is now being given we know that we will beat it,” Mr. Johnson said, as he reiterated Monday’s advice for everyone to avoid unnecessary social contact and travel.

“We must act like any wartime government and do whatever it takes to support our economy,” he said.

The near-lockdown in place across the U.K. to tackle the spread of COVID-19, which has claimed 55 lives in the U.K., has threatened the closure of large numbers of businesses in the country, including pubs, bars and restaurants.

The new financial package announced by Mr. Sunak builds on the £12 billion he had set out last week in his first Budget in the House of Commons, when he suspended business rates for many firms in England, put in an emergency temporary loan facility in place, extended statutory sick pay for workers, set up a “hardship fund” for local authorities and boosted NHS funding.

Mr. Johnson said: “As time goes on we will learn more and more about the disease and the effects of our actions. And while we need national unity, we also need international cooperation. And although we now need to impose physical distance between ourselves, we must at the same time have closer social support for each other.”

It follows draconian measures he had announced on Monday which calls on people not to go out, even to buy food or essentials, other than for exercise and in that case at a safe distance from others.

Advice on avoiding all social contact is “particularly important” for those aged over 70, pregnant women and those with other underlying health conditions, Mr. Johnson said.

People have been advised to start working from home “where they possibly can” and “avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues”.

It triggered a string of event cancellations across the board, including West End plays, sporting fixtures and the annual U.K. Asian Film Festival which was due to begin next week.

“We are in a war against an invisible killer,” U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said, adding that emergency legislation to tackle the virus would be introduced in Parliament on Thursday.

The total number of people in the U.K. to test positive for the virus has risen by 171 in a day to hit a total of 1,543. London is facing the brunt of the crisis and is said to be nearing the peak faster than other parts of the country, with the number of cases set to rise dramatically within days.

“It looks like we’re on the fast upswing or just about to get there and that’s the reason to want to get in quite quickly with these measures,” said Sir Patrick Vallance, the U.K. government’s Chief Scientific Adviser.

Measures would be escalated once again in the coming days, when those with underlying health problems would be told to isolate themselves for three months.

20,2020/03/18,At least 13 U.S. journalists facing expulsion from China,"The dramatic step, which shocked foreign journalists in China, is the latest retaliatory move in a series of disputes between the two governments.

At least 13 American journalists stand to be expelled from China in retaliation for a new limit imposed by the Trump administration on visas for Chinese State-owned media operating in the U.S.

The Chinese government announced on Wednesday that Americans working at three major U.S. newspapers would have to surrender their press cards within 10 days. They will all but certainly have to leave the country, as their visas are tied to their media credentials.

The number of affected journalists at the three papers - The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post - is at least 13 and could be higher depending on how broadly the group is defined, said the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China, or FCCC.

It would be by far the largest expulsion of foreign journalists from China in recent memory.

""There are no winners in the use of journalists as diplomatic pawns by the world’s two preeminent economic powers,” the FCCC said in a statement.

The U.S. announced earlier this month that five State-controlled Chinese media outlets would be restricted to 100 visas, the de facto expelling of about 60 journalists. It cited increasingly harsh surveillance, harassment and intimidation of American and other foreign journalists working in China.

The Chinese outlets employ about 160 Chinese citizens in the U.S. and include the official Xinhua News Agency and China Global Television Network, the overseas arm of state broadcaster CCTV.

The foreign ministry announcement said that American citizens working for the three newspapers with credentials expiring this year must surrender their press cards within 10 days. They will also be barred from working in the semi-autonomous territories of Hong Kong and Macao, the ministry said.

Until this announcement, China had expelled nine foreign journalists since 2013, the FCCC said.

Tariff and trade war

The dramatic step, which shocked foreign journalists in China, is the latest retaliatory move in a series of disputes between the two governments.

They remain enmeshed in a tariff and trade war despite a recent truce and have traded angry words over the coronavirus pandemic that first emerged in China and has spread worldwide.

Chinese State media published editorials after the foreign ministry announcement blaming the U.S. side.

""The impact of the U.S. move will not be limited to the field of media, but will create negative overall effects and new uncertainties to the relationship,” the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily newspaper said in an editorial.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo disputed the comparison between the U.S. and Chinese actions, telling reporters in Washington that they enjoy press freedoms that don’t exist in China.

""The individuals that we identified ... were part of Chinese propaganda outlets,” he said. “We’ve identified these as foreign missions under American law. These aren’t apples to apples, and I regret China’s decision today to further foreclose the world’s ability to conduct free press operations.”

The People’s Daily editorial said Chinese reporters in America have “always adhered to U.S. laws and regulations, journalistic ethics and the principles of objectivity, fairness, truth and accuracy.”

Newspapers condemn action

Editors of all three American newspapers condemned the Chinese action.

Dean Baquet, executive editor of The New York Times, said it was a “grave mistake” for China to cut itself off from some of the world’s top news organizations and called on the Chinese and American governments to move quickly to resolve the dispute.

""The health and safety of people around the world depend on impartial reporting about its two largest economies, both of them now battling a common epidemic,” he said, referring to the coronavirus pandemic.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/s3acrf/article31097550.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NYT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/at-least-13-us-journalists-facing-expulsion-from-china/article31097551.ece
21,2020/03/18,Three more Joe Biden victories increase pressure on Bernie Sanders to quit,"Joe Biden swept to victory in Florida, Illinois and Arizona on Tuesday

Joe Biden swept to victory in Florida, Illinois and Arizona on Tuesday, increasingly pulling away with a Democratic presidential primary upended by the coronavirus and building pressure on Bernie Sanders to abandon his campaign.

The former vice-president’s third big night in as many weeks came amid tremendous uncertainty as the Democratic contest collides with efforts to slow the spread of the virus that has shut down large swaths of American life. Polls were shuttered in Ohio, and although balloting went ahead as scheduled in the three other States, election workers and voters reported problems.

Still, Biden’s quest for his party’s nomination now seems well within reach. His trio of wins doubled his delegate haul over Sanders, giving the former vice-president a nearly insurmountable lead. Top Democratic leaders and donors have also increasingly lined up behind Biden as the best option to square off against President Donald Trump in November.

Using a livestream to address supporters from his home state of Delaware, Biden seemed ready to move past the primary. He paid tribute to the Vermont senator for advancing key issues like affordable health care and combating climate change.

“Sen. Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues. Together they have shifted the fundamental conversation in this country,” Biden said. “So let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Sen. Sanders, I hear you. I know what’s at stake. I know what we have to do.”

With the exception of North Dakota and the Northern Mariana Islands, Sanders hasn’t scored a victory since Super Tuesday on March 3. He made no immediate move on Tuesday to contact Biden, according to people familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity. During remarks early in the night, Sanders said little about the future of the race and instead focused on the coronavirus outbreak.

Trump, meanwhile, formally clinched the Republican presidential nomination after facing minimal opposition.

But much of the action was on the Democratic side, where higher vote totals in some key states suggested enthusiasm that even the coronavirus couldn’t contain. Turnout in Florida’s Democratic primary surpassed the 1.7 million who cast ballots four years ago.

Sanders’ path to the nomination is quickly narrowing, and some Democrats are now calling on him to drop out in the name of party unity. Top advisers have said he’s considering whether the political landscape could look different as the virus continues to reshape life across the country.

Still, the race increasingly favours Biden. He maintained strength on Tuesday with African Americans and older voters who have been the hallmark of his campaign. He also appeared to chip away at Sanders’ previous advantage with Hispanics that helped him win Nevada and California early in the race.

In Florida, Latinos made up roughly 20% of Democratic primary voters, and they largely sided with Biden. The former vice president received the support of 62% of Puerto Rican voters and 57% of Cubans, according to AP VoteCast, a broad survey of primary voters.

The public health and economic havoc wreaked by the coronavirus will nonetheless influence how the presidential contest unfolds. Rallies and other big events have been cancelled. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez urged States with upcoming primaries to expand vote-by-mail and absentee balloting, as well as polling station hours — trying to ensure the primary isn’t further hampered going forward.

“The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy, and we must do everything we can to protect and expand that right instead of bringing our democratic process to a halt,” Perez said in a statement.

But the damage may have already happened.

Four States — Louisiana, Georgia, Kentucky and Maryland — have joined Ohio in moving to push back their upcoming primaries, and others may yet do so. That has left the Democratic primary calendar empty until March 29, when Puerto Rico is scheduled to go to the polls. But island leaders are working to reschedule balloting there, too.

That means there is nowhere for Sanders to gain ground on Biden anytime soon, even if he could find a way to mount a sudden surge.

At least one of Sanders’ top advisers chided party officials for going forward with voting on Tuesday.

“The Democratic Party rightly berates the GOP for ignoring scientists’ warnings about climate change,” David Sirota tweeted. “The same Dem Party just ignored scientists’ warnings & pushed to continue in-person elections during a lethal pandemic, rather than delaying until there is vote by mail.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/z83k99/article31104411.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELECTION2020DEBATE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/three-more-joe-biden-victories-increase-pressure-on-bernie-sanders-to-quit/article31097547.ece

23,2020/03/18,World Bank increases coronavirus response fund to $14 Billion,"The package will strengthen national systems for public health preparedness, including for disease containment, diagnosis and treatment

The World Bank has announced increasing to $14 billion the amount of fast-track financing to assist companies and countries in their efforts to respond to the rapid spread of COVID-19, adding $2 billion to the initial package.

The announcement came amid fear of a major global recession in the wake of the coronavirus that has impacted more than 120 countries.

The package will strengthen national systems for public health preparedness, including for disease containment, diagnosis and treatment, and support the private sector, the bank said in a statement on Tuesday.

“It is essential that we shorten the time to recovery. This package provides urgent support to businesses and their workers to reduce the financial and economic impact of the spread of COVID-19,” David Malpass, President of the World Bank, said.

The World Bank Group is committed to a fast and flexible response based on the needs of developing countries. Support operations are already underway and the expanded funding tools approved today will help sustain economies, companies and jobs, he said.

The International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, will increase its COVID-19-related financing availability to $8 billion as part of the $14 billion package, up from an earlier $6 billion.

The bulk of the IFC financing will go to client financial institutions to enable them to continue to offer trade financing, working-capital support and medium-term financing to private companies struggling with disruptions in supply chains, the statement said.

IFC’s response will also help existing clients in economic sectors directly affected by the pandemic — such as tourism and manufacturing — to continue to pay their bills. The package will also benefit sectors involved in responding to the pandemic, including healthcare and related industries, which face increased demand for services, medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, it added.

“Not only is this pandemic costing lives, but its impact on economies and living standards will likely outlive the health emergency phase. By ensuring our clients sustain their operations during this time, we hope the private sector in the developing world will be better equipped to help economies recover more quickly,” IFC CEO Philippe Le Houerou said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uwgl9s/article31096184.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PLH-558x576,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world-bank-increases-coronavirus-response-fund-to-14-billion/article31096185.ece
24,2020/03/18,How art continues to heal and connect in the time COVID-19,"Auditoriums have fallen silent with music festivals and dance performances across the globe being cancelled

What is the one thing that never fails to soothe the mind and body during a calamity? It’s not hard to guess. Of course Art. It has once again emerged as a healer and also as a weapon to spread awareness about corona virus that has been causing illness and death across the world.

Dancers and musicians have not only cancelled shows, many of them have also joined hands with authorities in reaching out messages to people on how to cope with the virus.

Vietnamese lyricist Khac Hung’s song ‘Jealous Coronavirus’, based on the V-pop superhit ‘Ghen’ (means jealous in Vietnamese) tells people to wash hands, not touch their faces and avoid large crowds. After the song took Internet by storm, Vietnamese dancer Quang Dang choreographed moves for the hand wash routine in a viral video.

In Italy, which is under heavy lockdown, people have found a way out to beat boredom during self-isolation by singing and making music in the balconies of their houses. Videos posted from Turin, Naples, Siena and more show music is a great way to raise the spirits during tough times.

A widely shared video shows doctors and nurses in Iran, one of the worst hit countries, dancing in protective medical gear to keep patients' morale up, with some of them posting videos of dancing for quarantined patients.

Well-known dancer-choroegrapher Anita Ratnam recently posted a ‘20-second konnakol handwash’ on her Facebook. Aptly illustrated, it starts with TaDiTa as you place your hands under the pipe and ends with ‘Ta’ as you wipe the hands dry.

“We look at art usually from the entertainment point of view, it is during such trying times that we realise its true purpose of connecting souls and bringing succour when little else can. I am a great believer in the power of art. It can inspire, transform, protect and guide. From Tyagaraja to Beethovan, the best works of all great composers and most artistes have emerged out of adversity,” says U.S.-based veena exponent Saraswathi Ranganathan.

While major music and dance events, including The Coechella Valley Music and Arts Festival, held in California, have been postponed, Broadway shows in New York have been cancelled (playbill.com lists 15 plays and musicals you can watch on stage from home). In India, artistes and organisers have called off concerts. Mumbai-based National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA), Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts in Delhi, Rangashankara in Bengaluru, Ravindra Bharati in Hyderabad and The Music Academy and Hamsadhwani in Chennai have cancelled performances to encourage social distancing.

NCPA, however, has planned to take the performing arts to patrons in the safety of their homes. The social media pages of the organisation will be updated with videos of its popular ‘Meet the Maestro’ series in Indian music, lecture–demonstrations in diverse genres, dance workshops, Symphony Orchestra of India season highlights, etc.

Kathak exponent Aditi Mangaldas’s Drishtikon Dance Company has suspended classes. “We have also stopped online classes since it will require artistes to travel to the studio,” says Aditi.

“Learners can rehearse at home. More importantly, they could use the time to read and find their connect with dance. Most often in the frenzied schedule of classes and performances, we forget to look at aspects that are significant to the art and its practitioner,” she adds.

Writer Jennifer Stahl has come up with a timely story on how to keep your technique sharp from home with a list of online classes. Meanwhile, six star ballet dancers have decided to conduct classes via Instagram and Facebook. In India too some dancers like Bharatanatyam dancer-choreographer Ananda Shankar Jayant are offering online coaching.

There are more options to make the best use of this ‘no show’ phase. Pointemagazine.com tells, ‘Where to Stream Your Favourite Ballet Flicks’. Click on it to watch the best films on dance. It includes the classic, The Red Shoes, which was made in 1948 and tells the story of budding star Vicky Page, who has to choose between dance and her love for a young composer. The film stars British Ballerina Moira Shearer and features Red Shoes Ballet, choreographed by Robert Helpmann. You could also watch Center Stage, which is about how a group of dancers at the American Ballet Academy pursue their professional dreams, Billy Eliot shows the challenges faced by a boy dancer, The Turning Point is packed with world-class dancing and Black Swan focuses on the dark side of ballet.

“Dancers are resilient,” says celebrated London-based choreographer Shobana Jeyasingh. “They will exercise, eat well and keep their immune system strong, like everyone else. As for myself, I am not complaining about the lockdown. The lack of pressing deadlines for a change feels good. I hope things will be fine soon as I hope to premiere my next big production in September.”

Saraswathi, who is working with fellow musicians on e-concerts, says that authorities in Chicago are coming up with ways to offer temporary assistance to artistes who have incurred losses due to cancelled performances.

With the most-looked-forward to SXSW (South by Southwest) music festival, held annually in Austin, getting cancelled, organisers have urged music-lovers to support up-and-coming musicians who were supposed to perform by buying their music online and spreading a word about them on social media.

“Audience will get a refund on tickets, it’s the artistes who suffer from cancellations. But we need to be sensitive to this unprecedented situation,” points out dancer Rukmini Vijayakumar, who has now found comfort in yoga.

“Feeling Calm”, says Ananda Shankar Jayant’s on Facebook. While her post reads thus: “Where’s the time? Our usual litany. Now we have it...loads of time! Lets use it wisely”.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/wxspst/article31099426.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20FRDANCER-MASK,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/how-art-continues-to-heal-and-connect-in-the-time-covid-19/article31099428.ece
25,2020/03/18,‘The Test’ review: Amazon Prime docu-series is all about the Australian cricket team’s path to redemption,"Eight-part series charts the team’s journey following the ball-tampering scandal through an image rebuilding exercise, led by their feisty head coach Justin Langer

On the sidelines of the Perth Test of 2018, Australian captain Tim Paine quietly and cheekily admits to head coach Justin Langer in the dressing room that he broke the team protocol by having a dig at his counterpart Virat Kohli. Paine’s instructions to his team-mates prior was to completely ignore the opposing skipper, a very un-Aussie tactic. Yet, something snapped, and Paine now had to watch his every move thereafter to uphold the new team ethic that banter is fine, so long as it doesn’t cross the line into abuse.

That such revealing private conversations are on record, is thanks to the Australian players and management staff agreeing to allow cameras into the sanctum of the dressing room, in their bid to win back their fans. The Test: A New Era for Australia's Team, an eight-part documentary series streaming on Amazon Prime Video, a project sanctioned by Cricket Australia, gives viewers a fly-on-the-wall account (interspersed with one on one interviews with players, coaches, journalists) of the team’s journey from the bruising 2018 'Sandpapergate' ball-tampering scandal in South Africa till they retain the Ashes next year in England.

The Cape Town scandal led to lengthy bans to two giants – Steve Smith and David Warner – a shorter one to rookie batsman Cameron Bancroft, and the resignation of their coach Darren Lehmann. Whether the punishment fit the crime or not is a discussion for another day, but the fact was that in the eyes of the many in the Australian public, including their Prime Minister, the team’s “boorishness and arrogance” (which their former coach Mickey Arthur had written about) had well and truly hit the fan and it was time for urgent course correction.

The image rebuilding exercise brought a new management team in the feisty Langer as head coach and more amiable and down to earth captains in Tim Paine (Tests) and Aaron Finch (limited-overs). Delivering results was only one part of the job. As important was the need to introspect and self-correct.

The Test: A New Era for Australia's Team Director: Adrian Brown

Episodes: 8

Storyline: A behind the scenes look at how the Australian men’s cricket team fell from grace and was forced to reclaim its title and integrity

For the passionate Langer, it was challenge inheriting a dressing room with a fear of failure mindset, in contrast to the environment during his playing career. In the first series since Sandpapergate, an inexperienced one-day team gets a 5-0 mauling in England and Langer gives the team a tongue-lashing, belting out the F-word every few seconds, like a scene straight out of Good Will Hunting.

Langer’s brand of tough love was met with resistance initially by the outspoken Usman Khawaja, who had issues with the coach’s handling of the nets sessions. Langer admits privately that he respects Khawaja for his frankness. It’s part of the team’s new ethos of 'Elite Honesty', a curious catchphrase which Langer explained as, ""You look a bloke in the eye, tell them the truth and be happy to get some truth back, so that's elite honesty."" After losing the Melbourne Test to India, in a forlorn setting, Khawaja tells the coach, “The boys are a bit intimidated by you, Alf.”

What makes The Test most compelling is the kind of access director Adrian Brown and his crew were given to go behind closed doors and capture moments of vulnerability and softness. Frustrated batsmen literally let loose by flinging equipment around; Finch finds it ethically wrong to be lecturing his team on scoring more runs while he’s barely getting any himself but the coach tells him it’s okay for a captain to admit he is vulnerable; it’s okay to turn on the waterworks, like when an emotional Nathan Lyon breaks down when handing his close mate Travis Head his Test cap.

Things had gone to such a head for Langer following the series defeat to India that one day over breakfast, he recalled, his wife, broke down seeing the stress he had gone through. The coach himself did a bit of self-correction and learned to let go. He kept emphasising on the mantra of “we” not “me”, stressing on looking out for your mates, putting an arm around the shoulder (the bromance between Marcus Stoinis and Adam Zampa, of course, taking it to another level).

The most riveting scenes are reserved for The Ashes, thanks to the hostile reception the team received with the reintegration of Smith and Warner. The players grin and bear the hecklers at Edgbaston shouting, “Cheats, cheats” and “We saw you crying on the telly,” without any retaliation, a sign that the team had come far in their image rebuilding.

Yet, it’s hard to miss the irony when Langer later whines about the “booing”. Visiting players have copped an awful lot in Australia – ask Stuart Broad – so the Edgbaston heckling was Australian cricket getting a taste of its own bitter medicine.

England and Ben Stokes’s epic jailbreak at Headingley gets considerable airtime. As Australia commit one brainfade after another with England nine wickets down, Langer lets it rip, kicking a trash can and immediately sheepishly stuffing the rubbish back. The dressing room turns into a morgue, and Paine gives the team an earful for stuffing it up.

That the Australians did, eventually, turn the tables on England with Smith getting a standing ovation, lending a fitting finale to The Test. Yet, it doesn’t clearly reveal what the players felt about the team dynamics changing with the Smith-Warner reintegration. Another puzzling omission was that of Kohli gesturing to boisterous Indian fans at the World Cup to stop abusing Smith. It would have been nice to hear what the Australian camp thought.

Documentaries on Australian cricket in transition have always made for interesting viewing, thanks to the quality of footage available. Rookies, Rebels and Renaissance, on the team’s journey through the 1980s, shows how the team found its feet under captain Allan Border following the exodus of players for different reasons. The Test covers a much shorter period, more importantly, shows Australian cricket culture the mirror, in a step towards departing from the toxic culture that had festered.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/gm8qjx/article31097734.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/test1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/the-test-review-the-amazon-prime-cricket-docu-series-is-all-about-the-australian-teams-path-to-redemption/article31097735.ece
26,2020/03/18,Priyanka Chopra Jonas to feature on Spotify podcast series hosted by fashion designer Diane Von Furstenberg,"In the episode of InCharge with DVF, which airs tomorrow, Priyanka Chopra speaks about her late father, and her desire to take on motherhood

InCharge with DVF, a new podcast hosted by fashion designer Diane Von Furstenberg (known for revolutionising the wrap dress), is live exclusively on Spotify. One of the episodes, going live on March 19, features Priyanka Chopra Jonas, as one of the iconic women redefining what it means to be her.

The 37-year-old will unravel a different side of her journey from being a teenager to the stardom she enjoys today. Snippets of the interview include Priyanka’s nomadic childhood given her father was in the armed forces, her former desire to be an engineer, her experience in the pageant industry leading up to Miss World, her transition to the U.S., and finding a medium between the two cultures.

Having played a five-time boxing champion in Mary Kom, Priyanka says, “My work has been the greatest rock in my life. It’s like a plant – if you keep feeding it, it becomes a tree and gives you shadow. My work has been that.” This is what continues to inspire her as she plans to develop movies, based on true stories, featuring real life women on the helm. She also explains,“I want to be able I want to be able to have the part of the world or an audience of the world that may not know my work get introduced to me as an artist. And I'm hoping that will happen in the next few years. And I also want to taste motherhood. I want to be able to do both.”

In Diane’s words

The seven-episode series, features powerful women from different backgrounds and countries, in conversation with the designer, on their greatest successes and most challenging lessons. The celebrity guests include Kris Jenner, Elaine Welteroth, and Priyanka Chopra Jonas, among many more. The podcast launched on the streaming service on March 12 in celebration of Women’s History Month.

In an interview with Spotify ahead of the podcast launch, Diane details the mission behind the podcast, “I always mentioned the words ‘in charge’ when I was growing up. I didn’t know what I wanted to do, but I knew the kind of woman that I wanted to be, and what I wanted to be was a woman in charge. And now, the reason I give for being in fashion is basically to dress the woman in charge or to help her to feel in charge, to give her confidence. I think it’s important that when you have a voice, you use that voice, plus your knowledge, experience, and connections, in order to help others to have a voice and to be in charge.”

The 73-year-old Belgian designer —who was formerly known as Princess Diane of Fürstenberg — also describes the commonalities she finds with her podcasts guests. “The similarity is that all of those women, whenever they were faced with challenges, they owned it. That’s why I said the secret of life is owning it. Most of them had very different lives and everything, but how they dealt with the challenges and the strength and the courage is very similar, and that’s what [the podcast] is about.”",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/p0d1g0/article31097351.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY19-PRIYANKA,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/priyanka-chopra-jonas-to-feature-on-spotify-podcast-series-hosted-by-fashion-designer-diane-von-furstenberg/article31097352.ece
27,2020/03/18,"Producers Guild to set up fund for daily-wage earners, in wake of coronavirus shutdown","The measure has been taken to help those most affected by the closure of film, television and over-the-top productions owing to the COVID-19 pandemic

The Producers Guild of India announced on Tuesday that it would be setting up a relief fund for daily-wage earners most affected by the shutdown of film, television and over-the-top productions owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Siddharth Roy Kapur, president of the guild, said the total halt of all production-related activity in the foreseeable future is bound to have a significant impact on the lives and livelihoods of daily-wage earners in the industry.

“We would encourage the entire film fraternity to contribute to the fund to ensure that we can do all we can to minimise the disruption in the lives of our valued colleagues and associates in this difficult time,” he said, in a statement.

Earlier, in the wake of the lockdown, leading filmmakers had expressed concern about life ahead for the daily-wage earners who are the most affected by the decision, just as they were crippled during demonetisation in 2016.

28,2020/03/18,Tackling COVID-19 pandemic: Tips for parents working from home to keep their children engaged,"Are you a parent working from home and at your wit’s end wondering how to keep your child engaged? Here’s help

“There is a dark cloud over us,” says toy-innovator and science expert Arvind Gupta. The 67-year-old, who has made science fun for millions of children across the world through his ‘toys from trash’, says that there “is a silver lining” to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“As people opt for working from home, this is a golden opportunity for families to bond; parents and children can work on exciting projects together, discover what they always wanted to, but never got the opportunity to do.” Arvind says that the Internet is a good place to start. “There is a lot of junk out there on the Web,” he warns. “But it also has some great resources.”

Among them, is his website, arvindguptatoys.com that has over 4,000 videos on making science toys from everyday objects such as old CDs, rubber bands, straws, and PET bottles. They are available in 18 languages; there are books to download as well, and all of the above can be accessed for free.

Make the most of it Try your hand at gardening, household chores or create something new

With schools shutting down, and adults being advised to work from home, it is only natural that parents are at their wit’s end. How does one keep children engaged in something worth their while, keeping gadgets at bay?

Homeschooling parents share their notes. Chennai-based mother of three Deepa Packiyanath, who is home-schooling her 16-year-old daughter, says that they go on small walks around the neighbourhood. “We play UNO and board-games and also try our hand at some Zentangle; it can be relaxing.”

Deepa says that since the teen years can be tricky, what with their mood swings, she prefers to tailor the day around her daughter’s moods. “I sometimes pick a subject she is studying that day, say psychology, and keep all our conversations around it,” she adds.

She feels that keeping children completely off gadgets might be difficult. “I cannot restrict them entirely. Just the other day, their gang was making plans to play a game online together,” she says.

Parents of toddlers and young children need not look elsewhere for resources. “Involve them in age-appropriate everyday household activities,” says Madhu Karthik, mother of one, and founder of Lila Learning Space in Erode. “We can encourage them to chop vegetables with us, peel onions and boiled potatoes; and when we cook, we can teach them about the various flavours as we add the masalas into the dish,” she adds.

Even washing clothes can be made into a fun activity. And children love water. “Older children can help dry clothes; they can place pegs on the line with a parent to guide them,” says Madhu. It does parents good to invest in some open-ended toys such as blocks. “Children can play with them in multiple ways,” she adds. This is also a good time to stock up on art supplies. “We can come up with a theme a day. For instance, we can ask them to paint one animal each day for some variety.” This, she feels, will keep children occupied for at least an hour.

Madhu says with some soil, an empty coconut shell, and a handful of coriander seeds, children can be shown the joys of growing something on their own. Simply throw in a few seeds into an arrangement of soil inside the shell, encourage the child to sprinkle some water in it once in a while. “Imagine their excitement when they see it sprout and grow!” she smiles. “They will be hooked. Even after schools start, this exercise can continue. Tomatoes and chillies are easy to grow at home.”

R Senbaga Poonguzhali, a Coimbatore-based homeschooling mother, speaks to us over phone amid the din of children chattering around her. Poonguzhali says that while parents can bond with their children over even mundane tasks such as cleaning shelves at home or folding clothes, she prefers to just “let them be”.

“As adults, it can be difficult to keep playing with them,” she feels. And if left alone, children come up with their own games. “They come up with stories, characters...they approach me when they run out of ideas and I only gently suggest something. They take off from there.”

As Madhu puts it, “It is okay to get bored. Boredom is not a bad thing,” she feels. “It always leads to something creative.”",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/1uf6rj/article31098802.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19mpistock2,https://www.thehindu.com/society/home-not-alone/article31098803.ece

30,2020/03/18,BoM spots opportunity in COVID-19 crisis,"Asks staff to drive sales of insurance products citing demand due to virus spread

The state-run Bank of Maharashtra has sensed a business opportunity in the COVID-19 outbreak. It has issued a circular to all its branches and offices asking staff to beef up sales of health insurance products since such products are in demand now following the outbreak of the virus.

The circular, which has been reviewed by The Hindu, says the bank’s performance in selling life and non-life insurance products has been disappointing.

“The performance of the bank under this campaign is nowhere near expectations in both ‘life insurance campaign’ and ‘non-life insurance campaign’, which is very disappointing. To give a push to the campaign, it is decided to observe a dedicated four days (March 18-21, 2020) drive for health insurance,” the communication said. “Looking at the risk of the pandemic COVID-19, awareness and demand for health insurance have increased. This is the time for us to use this as a business opportunity and help our customers by offering suitable health insurance products,” the circular reads.

The Pune-based bank acts as an agent for insurance companies such as United India Insurance, Future Generali and ManipalCigna.

However, the directive has not gone down well with its staff. “It is shocking to observe that when the entire nation is struggling with this medical emergency as a national disaster, Bank of Maharashtra administration is looking at it as a business opportunity,” said Devidas Tuljapurkar, general secretary, All India Bank Of Maharashtra Employees Federation.

“Bank employees with great difficulty and risk are attending the bank and asking them to fulfill the target for health insurance is inhuman and asking customers to purchase those policies is cruel,” he said, demanding the circular be withdrawn.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/q8xcx4/article31101929.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THBUBOM,https://www.thehindu.com/business/bom-spots-opportunity-in-covid-19-crisis/article31101930.ece

Shares of Vodafone Idea closed 34.85% lower at ₹3.16 on the BSE on Wednesday, valuing the company at ₹9,080 crore.

Vodafone Idea recently computed its AGR dues at ₹21,533 crore, well below the over ₹58,000 crore arrived at by DoT.

Ramco Systems’ Innovation Lab has unveiled an advanced facial recognition-based time and attendance system.

Called RamcoGEEK, it is embedded with temperature recording and IoT sensor doors to enable organisations move towards a ‘touch-less’ attendance and workplace access, in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, said the company in a statement.

RamcoGEEK can detect and match the faces of staff members and mark their attendance along with temperature. Where facial-based attendance is a privacy concern, enterprises can replace it with voice to register access.

This system is linked to an IoT sensor powered door which can restrict access in case the temperature is higher than normal and auto apply leave on behalf of the employee.

It can communicate the information to HR and management in real-time and track the movements of a high-temperature staff in the workplace, the statement said.

“We have a major global health pandemic that has affected many. The spread of the disease has brought the focus back on hygiene and health of employees.

Betting heavily on sport utility vehicles (SUVs) as its future growth engine, German carmaker Volkswagen India has launched the new T-Roc, a compact SUV in India, at an introductory price of ₹19.99 lakh (ex-showroom all India).

This is the second SUV launched by the firm in less than two weeks. On March 6, it had rolled out the seven-seater New Tiguan Allspace at a starting price of more than ₹33 lakh. During Auto Expo, the company had announced it would introduce four SUVs in two years.

Out of the other two vehicles, the first made-in-India compact SUV Taigun will be launched in mid-2021 and the other subsequently. Volkswagen’s names all its SUV starting with the letter T.

The T-Roc, to be imported from Germany, will be delivered to customers from mid-April, 2020 and the company said it has received a ‘phenomenal’ response from customers, especially women who have liked the design, the features and colour of the vehicle.

The SUV provides performance, comfort, rationality and appeal to the urban lifestyle of an Indian customer, the company said. It is built on Volkswagen’s modular transverse matrix (MQB) platform and has been received exceeding well in the international market, company executives said.

The Saudi Aramco-led consortium is in talks with the government for the allotment of land for the proposed ₹4 lakh crore mega refinery and petrochemicals complex in Maharashtra.

The development of the project will be stuck if the government is unable to allot the land in the next few months, warned a member of the consortium.

Confirming the development, a director of the consortium-member told The Hindu, “We are engaging with the new government on land allotment. They (government) have offered an alternative site at Roha in Raigad district of Maharashtra.

“People in Ratnagiri also want us to come back. Land is not a constraining factor as of now. However, if we don’t see a clarity on the issue in the next few months, development of the project will be stuck.”

Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company hold 50% stake in the project with the rest is held by IOCL, HPCL and BPCL

IOCL holds 25% stake in the project while HPCL and BPCL hold 12.5% stake each.

“The ball is in government’s court on land allotment. We are going ahead with refinery configuration, allied infrastructures to be set up,” said another partner of the consortium.

39,2020/03/18,IndusInd promoters seek to raise stake to 26%,"Bank allays fears over asset quality as stock plummets

IndusInd Bank promoter — the Hinduja Group — has sought the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) approval to increase its stake in the lender to 26% from the 15% now, the bank said in a statement.

The move comes after the banking regulator allowed Kotak Mahindra Bank promoters to reduce their stake to 26%. The RBI norms had earlier capped promoter stake at 15%.

“... the promoter has sought RBI approval to increase shareholding to 26% and they await further guidance from the regulator,” the bank said.

The promoter has informed the exchanges about the simultaneous release of non-disposal undertaking with the creation of a pledge in relation to 23.8 million shares of the bank.

“No new borrowing was undertaken and was merely a formalisation of a three-year old arrangement. The money was originally raised to make an overseas acquisition which did not fructify — the pledge is a small fraction of the promoter holding in the bank,” the statement said.

The bank also said a couple of State government entities have made withdrawals amounting to less than 2% of the total deposits.

“We are engaging with them to reiterate the stance of the regulator that the government deposits in all private sector banks are safe,” it said. The moratorium on Yes Bank has led to some State governments withdrawing deposits from private banks. Another private lender, RBL Bank, also had a similar experience.

Heavy selling pressure

The statement from the Hindujas comes amid the bank’s stock coming under heavy selling pressure. IndusInd Bank was the top loser in the Sensex pack on Wednesday.

The stock lost nearly 24%, or ₹144.45, to close at ₹459.85 on the BSE. Earlier in the day, it fell to a 52-week low of ₹382.55, or nearly 37% lower compared with Tuesday’s close of ₹604.30.

In the last one month, shares of IndusInd Bank had fallen almost 60%, as the stock had closed at ₹1,144.15 on February 18.

In the statement, the bank tried to ally investors’ concerns regarding asset quality.

“...[the] bank is financially strong, well-capitalised, profitable, and a growing entity with strong governance,” it said.

On asset quality, the bank said its gross NPA ratio, which was 2.18%, was the second lowest in the industry amongst large private sector banks and the figures were expected to be pretty much in line with those of the last quarter. It expects net NPA ratio of 1.05% as at the last quarter to fall below 1%, which is in line with the aim to take provision cover beyond 60%.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/9sckor/article31101625.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THBUINDUS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/indusind-promoters-seek-to-raise-stake-to-26/article31101626.ece

41,2020/03/18,"As virus digs in its heels, stocks plunge to lowest in three years","BSE drops 5.6%, banking majors lead fall on fear of more loans turning bad

Indian benchmark equity indices fell to their lowest level in three years on Wednesday as stocks continued to reel under selling pressure on account of concerns regarding increasing threat to global growth due to COVID-19 .

The 30-share Sensex, that managed to stay in positive territory only for a few minutes after opening, continued to slide as the session progressed to close at 28,869.51, down 1,709.58 points or 5.59%. This is the lowest close for the benchmark since March 2017.

Lowest since Jan. 20 17

The broader Nifty ended the day at 8,468.80, shedding 498.25 points or 5.56% — its lowest close since January 2017. The fall was primarily led by banking majors as the increasing number of COVID-19 cases has made investors jittery about corporate health that could lead to higher quantum of bad loans for the banking sector.

The biggest losers among the Sensex pack were IndusInd Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Finance and HDFC Bank, among others.

Incidentally, the sectoral indices, representing banking and financial services, were the worst hit on Wednesday, plunging over 7% each.

Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) continued to press the ‘sell’ button with the quantum of net sales pegged at more than ₹5,000 crore on Wednesday. More than 2,000 stocks declined on the BSE as against less than the 350 gainers.

Most of the Asian indices also closed in the red on Wednesday with the Hang Seng plunging more than 900 points.

43,2020/03/18,Centre committed to revival of BSNL: Ravi Shankar Prasad,"But it is not possible to retain all its employees, says Telecom Minister

Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Wednesday said the Centre was committed to revival of the BSNL but it was not possible to retain all its employees.

Speaking during the Question Hour, he said the government had taken a conscious decision to revive the BSNL because they do public service in floods, earthquake etc.

“As of now nearly a lakh employees have sought the VRS and we are giving them packages.’’ The VRS was introduced as part of the revival efforts.

“We strongly believe in the existence of a Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) like the BSNL and it is important both for public service and also fairness in the entire system of communication. The BSNL has seen some bad times but during 2014-15, 2015-16 it became a bit positive,” the Minister told the House.

The Cabinet decision stands committed to providing 4G. “It will be given to them shortly.”

In his written reply, Mr. Prasad said the PSU had been incurring losses since 2009-10. On the basis of its financial performance and as per the guidelines issued by the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE), it was classified as “Incipient sick CPSE” in 2017.

It had a workforce of 1,55,296 employees as on October 1, 2019. The employee cost was 74% of its revenue for 2018-19, he said.

The Minister said the government had approved the revival plan on October 23, 2019 which inter alia, includes reduction in staff cost through VRS for employees of age 50 years and above.

He said 78,569 employees had opted for the VRS offered on October 4, 2019 and closed on December 3, 2019. Mr. Prasad said the PSU had said as per the provision, the posts falling vacant due to the VRS had been abolished and there was no recruitment against the vacancies.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/qlh42x/article30929286.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2TH-RAVI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/centre-committed-to-revival-of-bsnl-ravi-shankar-prasad/article31099778.ece

Singapore Airlines has said it is cutting flights across its network by half as countries around the world impose border controls in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Given the growing scale of the border controls globally and its deepening impact on air travel, the Singapore Airlines (SIA) said it expects to make further cuts to its capacity.

“Make no mistake — we expect the pace of this deterioration to accelerate. The SIA Group must be prepared for a prolonged period of difficulty,” SIA Chief executive officer Goh Choon Phong said in a release on Tuesday.

The SIA, he said, has lost a large amount of traffic in a very short time, and it will not be viable for the airline to maintain its current network.

Today’s suspensions mean that the SIA will operate only 50% of the capacity that have been originally scheduled up to the end-April, the airline said.

The SIA said it is actively taking steps to build up liquidity.

The group will also consult the unions (of employees) once again as it urgently takes steps to further cut costs. Additional measures will be announced when they have been firmed up.

This comes hours after Singapore expanded its travel restrictions to include travellers who have visited ASEAN countries, U.K., Japan and Switzerland.

The restriction, which took effect on March 16, applies to all travellers except for Singaporeans and Malaysians using sea and land crossings with Malaysia. Travellers who have visited these countries will be issued with a 14-day stay-home notice.

Singaporeans are advised to defer all non-essential travel abroad to reduce their risks of contracting the virus.

Airlines around the world are facing dwindling travel demand amid the travel restrictions imposed following the deadly coronavirus outbreak. The outbreak has led companies to scale back on business travel and discouraged tourism.

46,2020/03/18,Coronavirus | Rajasthan human rights body recommends meditation to fight COVID-19,"The Rajasthan State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) on Wednesday recommended “meditation in solitude” to fight the COVID-19 outbreak which has infected over 150 persons across the country. The Commission took up the matter suo motu, taking cognizance of the pandemic, and advised the affected persons to live in isolation.

“While those suspecting infection should immediately report to the nearest health centre and be sent to isolation for 14 days as per the World Health Organization’s guidelines, the Commission recommends that all people should meditate in solitude,” SHRC chairperson Justice Mahesh Chandra Sharma said in his two-page order.

Justice Sharma praised the State government's measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 and applauded the treatment given by doctors at the Sawai Man Singh Government Hospital here to three patients who had tested positive and have since recovered. The treatment regimen included a combination of drugs for swine flu, malaria and HIV.

As a judge of the Rajasthan High Court, Justice Sharma had created a flutter in 2017 with his remark that a peahen gets pregnant after swallowing the tears of a peacock. His comments came after he passed an order on his last working day asking the Centre to declare the cow as a national animal and increase the punishment for cow slaughter to life imprisonment.

Justice Sharma commented that a peacock was a lifelong ‘brahmachari’ (celibate) and it would never have sexual intercourse with a peahen to reproduce. He was appointed a member of the SHRC for a five-year term in 2018 during the previous Bharatiya Janata Party regime.

A direction to the State government on September 4, 2019, the Commission’s Bench, of which Justice Sharma was also a part of, asked for creating an awareness campaign to keep women away from live-in relationships, saying it was against their human rights as they could be “treated as concubines”.

47,2020/03/18,Coronavirus | Air India pares perks for crew in cost cutting bid,"Air India has announced a slew of cost-cutting measures aimed at the crew and officials including a cut in entertainment allowance for executive pilots, a reduction in layover or subsistence allowance and a 10% paring down in fuel reimbursement for all officers of the national carrier.

In a communication to regional executive directors and regional general managers (finance), Air India’s executive director (finance) S. K. Singh explained that steps to contain costs had become necessary in light of the position of the company and in the wake of the recent global developments that had forced several airlines worldwide to adopt very aggressive measures.

Air India would, with immediate effect, withdraw the executive entertainment allowance — of $50 per flight — to executive pilots. For cabin crew, the layover or subsistence allowance for both permanent and contractual crew rostered from April 1 would be revised to $100 for 30 hours — down from $75 a day or $150 for anything beyond 24 but under 48 hours — and thereafter $4 for every additional hour in excess of 30 hours. For ultra long range flights, $140 (down from $150) would be paid for the first 30 hours and $6 for every additional hour in excess of 30 hours.

The national carrier, whose deadline for completion of sale was extended by more than a month and a half on March 13, also announced a cut in fuel reimbursement limits for all officers. The reimbursement would be pared by 10% from April 1, initially for a period of six months.

48,2020/03/18,"Coronavirus | Airlines may have to shut shop by May, says CAPA","Carriers face a loss of up to $600 million on COVID-19 impact

Several airlines may be forced to shut down by May or June in the absence of government aid as private carriers stare at a loss of $500-600 million due to COVID-19, warns aviation consultancy CAPA.

Also Read Coronavirus | GoAir staff left in the lurch after contracts end

“All Indian airlines will report significant losses in Q1, even with oil prices at around $30/barrel. At an industry level, consolidated losses are estimated to be in the range of $500-600 million for the quarter (excluding Air India). However, these are very preliminary estimates,” says CAPA in its report on the impact of COVID-19 on India.

As a result of travel restrictions imposed by India and other countries, international capacity has dropped by 60-70%, as per CAPA. Earlier this month, the Ministry of External Affairs banned the entry of all foreigners as well as barred Indians from the U.K., European Union and Turkey from returning to the country. Foreigners alone account for 25% of international travellers to and from India.

As far as the domestic market is concerned, CAPA notes that since the beginning of March, all the airlines have reported a drop in yields by 12-15%, and forward bookings for the summer months are down by 30% compared with last year.

Passenger demand on domestic routes could see up to 40-50% drop and airlines may have to slash fares per kilometre by 25%.

The sharp fall in demand may force the airlines to ground as many as 150 aircraft in the beginning, which account for 23% of the total fleet size of all airlines. CAPA says that with the curtailment of domestic operations likely in the coming weeks, “a majority of fleet could be grounded by April.”

The dire straits that airlines find themselves in could impact the requirement of 30% of airline staff and 50% of ground handling staff, according to CAPA.

According to the report, Air India's privatisation maybe delayed and the government may have to commit $ 300-400 million as interim funding. CAPA also recommends that the government may have to devise a plan to operate the airline in the medium term until the sale is concluded.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-airlines-may-have-to-shut-shop-by-may-says-capa/article31101994.ece
49,2020/03/18,Coronavirus | GoAir staff left in the lurch after contracts end,"Termination letters go viral on social media

A day after GoAir suspended international operations alongside putting its employees on a rotational leave-without-pay programme, letters terminating employee contracts, mostly those of expatriate pilots, went viral on social media.

A spokesperson for the airline said that as India had temporarily banned travel to and from a host of countries, with airlines across the world taking drastic measures to handle the extraordinary situation, GoAir had been forced to terminate the contracts of its expatriate pilots in line with its reduced international capacity.

On Tuesday, GoAir had temporarily suspended all international flights from March 17 to April 15.

“No sooner than the situation improves, GoAir will reinstate these flights and operate them at the earliest opportunity,” an airline spokesperson said.

“Knowing that this will put a financial burden on the affected employees and having studied what companies have done in other countries to help guide our plans, this decision was not taken lightly,” a spokesperson said referring to the two decisions.

Drastic step

GoAir said the airline had to take these drastic steps as India had temporarily banned all passengers coming from a host of countries and vice-versa.

50,2020/03/18,BJP suspends dharnas for a month,"Four to five office-bearers would submit memoranda to authorities when necessary

BJP president J.P. Nadda on Wednesday issued a circular to all State units to desist from large protests and demonstrations for a month in view of the advisories issued by the government of India on large gatherings etc following the outbreak of the COVID-19.

The circular followed a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a parliamentary party meeting of the BJP had asked the MPs to spread awareness among the people in small groups about the virus and suggested that they should refrain from launching any mass agitation till April 15.

“Prime Minister Modi had, yesterday, in the parliamentary party meeting, desired that we should avoid any type of agitation, dharna, demonstration. Keeping that in view, the BJP has decided that for the next one month the party won’t participate in any agitation, demonstration,” Mr. Nadda said.

He said four to five office-bearers of the party would submit memoranda to authorities concerned whenever necessary to avoid “conglomeration of people”. All State units had been told about the decision and a circular had also been issued, he said.

“All party units have been asked to spread awareness and they must discuss the dos and dont’s in small groups. While on one hand we have to see to it that we keep ourselves clean, we also need to make sure that we do not panic.

51,2020/03/18,Next Assam NRC step may not begin on March 20,"Over 19 lakh people excluded from the register are to be issued rejection slips

The process of issuing rejection slips to the 19.06 lakh people excluded from Assam’s National Register of Citizens (NRC) is unlikely to start on March 20. The coronavirus pandemic is one of the reasons, officials said.

Other reasons include replacement of the bulk of some 55,000 Assam government employees engaged in the NRC exercise for five years and delay in scanning the speaking orders issued while processing the objections raised against the excluded during the updating process.

The State government had told the Assembly on March 2 that the rejection slips would be issued from March 20 after speaking orders were scanned. It had said that 12% of the speaking orders remained to be scanned.

The NRC authorities are also learnt to be segregating the names of some declared foreigners or doubtful voters who have made it to the updated list published on August 31, 2019. Their cases are pending in 100 Foreigners Tribunals across the State. The NRC authorities have declined to disclose the number of such people, but it is estimated that more than 1,000 people may have been included in the list “erroneously.”

To move Supreme Court

Meanwhile, Assam Public Works (APW), the NGO whose petition before the Supreme Court led to the NRC updating exercise in Assam, has said it would meet the heads of the Madhya Pradesh government, besides Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah for “punitive action” against former NRC Coordinator Prateek Hajela.

The Supreme Court had in November 2019 transferred Mr. Hajela, an IAS officer of the Assam-Meghalaya cadre, to his home State Madhya Pradesh. He has since been accused of having indulged in corruption during the exercise that the government said costs ₹1,348 crore.

“The investigating agencies have not recorded our statements despite a case filed against him days ago. We suspect the government is delaying intentionally for fear of getting exposed if the investigation is done. We will meet the Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister in May and hand over the details of Hajela’s corruption during his tenure as NRC Coordinator,” APW president Aabhijeet Sharma said.

The APW had filed a case against Mr. Hajela, accusing him of tampering with data and records associated with NRC. The NGO has also been demanding total re-verification of the NRC applications for an “error-free” list.

52,2020/03/18,"Nation needs NRC, Centre tells Supreme Court","“It is a necessary exercise to identify citizens from non-citizens”

More than a month after Lok Sabha was informed by the government that no decision had been taken to prepare the National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Ministry of Home Affairs filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court on Tuesday stating that preparation of NRC is a “necessary exercise for any sovereign country for mere identification of citizens from non-citizens.”

The MHA submitted before the Supreme Court that it was the responsibility entrusted on the Central Government “to identify/detect illegal migrants and thereafter, follow the due process of law.”

The affidavit added that Foreigners Act, 1946, conferred upon the government the power to expel foreigners from India. “It vests the Central Government with absolute and unfettered discretion, and as there is no provision fettering this discretion in the Constitution, an unrestricted right to expel remains,” the affidavit said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a public rally on December 22 in Delhi that “there had been no discussion, no talk on an NRC for India since his government had taken power in 2014.” On December 9, Home Minister Amit Shah told Parliament that “there is no need to create a background for NRC... we are clear that NRC ought to be done in this country, our manifesto is the background.”

On June 20, 2019, soon after the Narendra Modi government was re-elected, the President in a joint address to members of both Houses of Parliament said that the “government has decided to implement the process of NRC on a priority basis in areas affected by infiltration.” His speech on February 1 this year, however, skipped any mention of NRC.

More than a dozen States have vociferously opposed the updating of National Population Register (NPR), slated to begin April 1 along with the house listing phase of the Census. According to Citizenship Rules 2003, NPR is the first step towards compilation of NRC. The modified NPR form is yet to be made public, but it is likely to include contentious questions on “date and place of birth of father and mother, last place of residence and mother tongue.” The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 passed by Parliament on December 11 allows citizenship on the basis of religion to six undocumented communities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who entered India on or before December 31, 2014.

The exact number of people the CAA will benefit are not known, but Mr. Shah had told the Rajya Sabha on December 11 that “lakhs and crores” will benefit.

For the first time, the MHA, through the affidavit in Supreme Court, has indicated what these numbers could be like. In the affidavit, the MHA submitted a report by the then Ministry of Rehabilitation for the year 1964-65 on the “new influx of members of minority communities from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) into West Bengal, Assam and Tripura which began in January 1964” and “assumed formidable proportions in the months of March, April and May, 1964.”

The report states that the number of persons who migrated from erstwhile East Pakistan till 31 January, 1965 was 8,94,137. “Out of the said persons, 2,61,899 came with migration certificates, while 1,76,602 came with Pakistani passport and Indian visas. Approximately 4,55,636 persons came without any travel documents. A striking feature of the new influx was that several thousand Buddhists and Christians came from the erstwhile East Pakistan along with Hindus,” the affidavit said.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee pointed out on March 3 that all those who came from Bangladesh were already citizens of India and they had been voting in elections.

The MHA cited 18 orders issued by the MHA between 1952 and 2012 advocating preferential treatment for “Hindus and Sikhs” from Pakistan and Afghanistan who entered India with or without a valid visa.

The affidavit mentions a Cabinet note prepared by the then Home Secretary in January 1986 that while “illegal crossers should be pushed back,” the request of the members of the minority community from Pakistan who desired to get Indian citizenship after coming here on a short term visa should be “considered liberally”.

There are apprehensions that the CAA followed by a country-wide NRC will benefit non-Muslims excluded from the citizens’ register, while excluded Muslims will have to prove their citizenship. The government has denied that CAA and NRC are linked.

Mr. Shah also assured the Rajya Sabha on March 12 that furnishing information under NPR was voluntary and none will be marked “doubtful” citizens. The Citizenship Rules 2003 has the provisions to place residents under this category. This rule is yet to be amended or withdrawn.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nation-needs-nrc-centre-tells-supreme-court/article31101913.ece
53,2020/03/18,"Amid surveillance concerns, DoT avers call data being used to improve service quality","Amid questions over possible surveillance and violation of privacy following bulk call data records being sought by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), the government on Wednesday asserted that the data was only being collected to analyse and improve the quality of telecom services and ruled out any form of surveillance.

The explanation follows a letter dated February 12 from Rajan Mathews, Director General, Cellular Operators Association of India, to the Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash, wherein Mr. Mathews had noted that some local units of the DoT “continue to seek voluminous CDR details from the licensees on regular basis in contravention” of the standard operating procedure for providing CDRs to law enforcement agencies.

In a statement, the DoT said that given the numerous complaints about quality of service on the country’s telecommunications networks including call drops, echo, cross connections, incomplete or poor caller experience, the DoT had developed a software tool to analyse big data and accurately ascertain call drops in any area.

“For this purpose, data on calls made from mobiles in any tower coverage area is analysed to ascertain calls terminated within 30 seconds and made again,” the department said. “DoT will be better equipped to take up such cases and areas with the telecom service providers based on actual data. For this purpose, total data of calls made during any particular time period from the identified cell phone tower locations from where the complaints are received is collected to enable analysis,” it added.

The government stressed that this data was anonymous and did not contain the names of either the maker or receiver of calls. “There is no infringement of privacy of any person. No personal details are collected. There is no tracking of any phone number,” the DoT asserted. “There is also no question whatsoever of ascertaining the content of the call... The data collected is anonymised. There is no surveillance of any kind,” it added.

The mobile phone services industry body had in its letter added, “in all such monthly as well as ad hoc bulk CDR details sought by various LSA units of DoT, neither the intended purpose for requirement of CDRs is mentioned nor the identity of the subscriber(s)... Further CDRs sought for specific routes/areas may lead to allegations of surveillance, especially in a State like Delhi having numerous VVIP zones having offices and residences of Ministers, MPs, Judges etc.”

Observing that the government was already empowered under Rule 419 of the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951, to access such anonymous data for improving network quality, the DoT asserted: “Moreover, DoT has also put in place an in house standard operating procedure so that any authorisation of such access to call drop data can be approved only by very senior officers. Further, it has been decided to seek such data only for short time period i.e. three to six hours normally covering the peak load of traffic on the network for any cell tower.”

In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Mathews said the department had discussed the issue with COAI in the wake of the letter and explained the reasons for seeking the data. “Being satisfied, we have cooperated with the DoT to source the information sought by DoT to improve network quality and address call drops,” he added.

Mr. Mathews reiterated that the data was anonymised and did not contain the names of either the maker or receiver of the calls. Hence, there was no threat of infringement of privacy of any person. Personal data and tracking of phone numbers were not sought, he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6qk7o0/article31101871.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-1091436276,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amid-surveillance-concerns-dot-avers-call-data-being-used-to-improve-service-quality/article31101872.ece
54,2020/03/18,Seeking phone call records infringement of Right to Privacy: Congress,"The government has decided to carry out mass surveillance against citizens, says Congress leader Manish Tewari

Seeking call data records (CDR) of phone subscribers is infringement of Right to Privacy, the Congress said on Wednesday in response to reports that the Department of Telecommunication (DoT) had sought CDR for specific days on specific routes.

Though the Congress had moved an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha on the issue, the Chair did not allow it.

However, party MP Manish Tewari addressed a press conference in which he said that seeking CDR this way “is contrary to top court’s judgment that held Right to Privacy as a fundamental right.”

“Reports which have emerged in the public space are extremely disturbing because the government has decided that it will carry out mass surveillance against citizens of India. A sinister, premeditated, orchestrated plot has been put in place in order to unleash the mass surveillance programme against the citizens of India, which is absolute transgression of the Right to Privacy guaranteed by the Supreme Court in a 9/0 judgment,” Mr. Tewari said.

“We strongly condemn and deprecate the assault on the freedom and fundamental rights given by the Constitution,” he added.

The Opposition parties in a scathing attack had pointed out Justice Gogoi’s own statement that post-retirement appointments are a scar on independence of judiciary. Justice Gogoi on Tuesday said he accepted the position to ensure more cohesion between the judiciary and the legislature.

56,2020/03/18,Eleven candidates elected unopposed to Rajya Sabha,"3 each in Assam and Haryana and 5 in West Bengal declared winners

A candidate each of the Bharatiya Janata Party, its alliance partner Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) and the Opposition comprising the Congress and the All-India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) were elected unopposed to the Rajya Sabha from Assam on Wednesday.

Returning Officer Amarendra Deka said the three were declared winners ahead of the election date of March 26 as there were no contenders.

Former Congress MP Bhubaneswar Kalita will be representing the BJP in the Upper House, while Biswajit Daimary will represent the BPF for the third straight term. The current terms of Mr. Kalita, Mr. Daimary and Sanjay Sinh, who joined the BJP from the Congress, end in April.

The third seat went to former journalist Ajit Kumar Bhuyan, who has been one of the leading activists against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, in Assam. He was the Congress-AIUDF combine’s consensus candidate.

Mr. Bhuyan, who came under flak for “holding the hands of the AIUDF” to get the Rajya Sabha berth, justified his decision. “I had no intention of becoming an MP and never sought a ticket. I agreed to be the candidate of the Congress and the AIUDF as both have vehemently opposed the CAA,” he said. He thanked the AIUDF chief and perfume baron Badruddin Ajmal for nominating him.

5 elected in West Bengal

All five candidates in the fray from West Bengal were elected unopposed to the Upper House on Wednesday.

Mausam Benazir Noor, Arpita Ghosh, Dinesh Trivedi and Subrata Bakshi of the Trinamool Congress and Bikash Ranjan Bhattachrya of the Left-Congress combine were given the Certificate of Election at the end of the time for withdrawal of nominations on Wednesday.

The nomination of Dinesh Bajaj, TMC-supported independent candidate, was cancelled on Tuesday after it was found to be incomplete.

57,2020/03/18,Supreme Court strips Manipur Minister of his office,"He defected to BJP after contesting on Congress party ticket

In an extraordinary display of its constitutional powers, the Supreme Court on Wednesday stripped Manipur Cabinet Minister T. Shyamkumar, who is facing disqualification proceedings for defection, of his office and banned him from entering the Assembly with immediate effect.

“Given the extraordinary facts in the present case, we are constrained to use our powers under Article 142 of the Constitution. Respondent No. 3 [Mr. Shyamkumar] is restrained from entering the Legislative Assembly till further orders of this Court. Needless to add, he will cease to be a Minister of the Cabinet immediately,” a Bench led by Justice Rohinton Nariman ordered.

The court agreed to take up the case again on March 30.

On January 21, the Bench had given the Speaker a month’s time to decide on the disqualification of Mr. Shyamkumar under the anti-defection law for switching sides to the BJP after contesting on the Congress party ticket.

However, despite the judgment, the Speaker had returned to the apex court seeking eight weeks to take a decision.

On March 18, the Speaker asked for 10 days’ time and said the decision on the disqualification would come on March 28.

58,2020/03/18,"Parliament proceedings | Lok Sabha passes Budgetary proposals for J&K, Ladakh","Opposition attacks govt. in marathon seven-hour debate; PM Modi will be celebrating International Yoga Day in Ladakh, says Jitender Singh

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday told the Lok Sabha that corruption had ended and things had become more transparent in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) after the region’s special status under Article 370 was diluted on August 5 last year.

Responding to the debate on Budgetary proposals and the demand for grants for the Union Territories (UTs) of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, she listed the positive developments, including a rise in exports, and informed that soon the Centre would hold a special conclave on start-ups, with experts from Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Gurugram sharing their expertise with Kashmiri youth.

In a discussion that went on for close to seven hours, most Opposition members attacked the Modi government for the political detentions in J&K and demanded the immediate release of former chief ministers Omar Abdullah (National Conference) and Mehbooba Mufti (Peoples Democratic Party).

Opposition members also asserted that the Budget for J&K should be discussed in its State Assembly and not in the Parliament of India.

Ms. Sitharaman pointed to several past instances between 1991 to 1996, when the Parliament passed the J&K Budget with the then State being under Central rule.

‘New dreams, hopes’

Participating in the discussion, Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office Jitendra Singh claimed that J&K had not seen a more peaceful eight-month period in the militancy-hit region than since August 6, when its special status under Article 370 was abrogated.

“New dreams, new hopes and new aspirations have taken birth there under the leadership of Modi,” he said, while stating that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would be going to the newly created UT of Ladakh to celebrate International Yoga Day on June 21.

Dr. Singh hit back at the Opposition by saying that while they [the Opposition] were concerned “about two-three families”, they were not worried about the over 40,000 people who have lost their lives in the last 30 years of militancy in J&K.

When Dr. Singh said that a section of people believed J&K had been peaceful because “potential troublemakers” had been kept inside, Opposition members protested at his comment.

The Minister asserted that construction under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna has “massively gone up”, fund utilisation had increased by as much as 48%, over 50,000 new jobs would be created, and several medical colleges have come up, including two All India Institute of Medical Sciences’ (AIIMS).

Initiating the discussion, Congress leader Manish Tewari said that the economy had collapsed as trade and tourism were adversely affected because of restrictions imposed in J&K over the past eight months. “The government should open its ears and listen to the voices of people as a dangerous situation is developing there,” he said.

Internet restrictions

When Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad intervened to say Internet restrictions were in place to ensure terrorists did not spread fear and threaten people, Mr. Tewari said that terrorism was not a new phenomenon and “this could not be an excuse to close Internet services”.

The Congress leader said that not only were schoolchildren impacted, with 11,308 schools remaining shut for months, the administration of justice too had taken a hit as 459 habeas corpus petitions were pending since August 2019. “So what kind of country do we want to make?” he asked, alleging courts were not listing these petitions.

Trinamool Congress’ Saugata Roy too attacked the government and said that a democracy could not function by locking up political leaders.

‘On-ground assessment’

Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s A. Raja asked why the government could not send an all-party delegation to J&K for an on-ground assessment.

National Conference MP Hasnain Masoodi said the picture that was being presented was quite different from the ground reality and asked the government to examine J&K afresh.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/7kkzr7/article31101724.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18TH-THGRP-NIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliament-proceedings-lok-sabha-passes-budgetary-proposals-for-jk-ladakh/article31101725.ece
59,2020/03/18,"Parliament proceedings | Rajya Sabha passes Bills to set up commissions for homoeopathy, Indian system of medicine","MPs raise concern over the lack of research in these forms of medicine

Two Bills to set up national commissions for the Indian system of medicine and homoeopathy were passed by the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, with the government assuring the House that similar legislation for yoga and naturopathy would be brought as well.

The National Commission for Indian System of Medicine Bill, 2019 and the National Commission for Homoeopathy Bill, 2019 had been introduced in the Rajya Sabha in January 2019, after which they were sent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare.

Speaking during the discussion on the Bills which were taken up together, Samajwadi Party MP and chairperson of the committee Ram Gopal Yadav said 15 of the 37 recommendations of the panel on the Indian system of medicine Bill and 13 of the 24 recommendations on the homoeopathy Bill were accepted. He urged the government to include yoga in the ISM Bill, which covers Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Sowa-Rigpa. The two Bills also repeal legislation on the related medical councils.

In his reply to the discussion, Minister of State for Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) Shripad Yesso Naik said the traditional forms of medicine would be strengthened by the Bills. Responding to the suggestions from several MPs, Mr. Naik said the government would bring legislation for yoga and naturopathy too.

Earlier in the discussion, MPs raised concern over the lack of research in these forms of medicine. Biju Janata Dal MP Amar Patnaik said though the Bills talk about scientific research, they don’t elaborate on it. “The lack of research in these branches of medicines has resulted in people not having confidence,” he said.

DMK MP P. Wilson said his party opposed the Bills and demanded that they be sent to a select committee. He said the commissions to be formed under the Bills would replace elected professionals in the existing councils with bureaucrats.

Congress MP Jairam Ramesh said the government should work towards integrating all forms of medicine with modern medicine.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rs-passes-bills-to-set-up-commissions-for-homoeopathy-indian-system-of-medicine/article31101716.ece
60,2020/03/18,Opinion | Why parliament must disperse immediately,"The comparison between parliament being in session and doctors, security personnel and others being at work a rather silly, frivolous equivalence.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the BJP parliamentary party on March 17 that the ongoing session of parliament will continue until April 3 as scheduled. According to Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi, the PM told MPs, “If media, doctors, pilots, state-owned transportation, airport, policemen, railway stations can work in this (the fight against coronavirus) direction, MPs have to do their job too. They have to keep the House running and simultaneously take care of their people.”

This is grandstanding, but does not help the fight against the coronavirus. In fact, this attitude could damage the wide-spectrum earnest efforts of his own government in containing the risk of a nationwide outbreak. The comparison between parliament being in session and doctors, security personnel and others being at work a rather silly, frivolous equivalence. The spread of the virus at the moment is uneven across the country, depending on the varied global linkages of particular regions. Parliament members can be super-spreaders of the infection who could carry the virus from one corner to the entire country. They must disperse soon, not because they are scared for their own safety, or they want to skip work — but to save the country.

Also read | Masks debut in Rajya Sabha; MPs demand curtailing of Budget session

To understand the gravity of the situation, look at what happened to Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan. Kerala, where he comes from reported the first COVID-19 case in India. Being a highly-globalised State, Kerala has been reporting a high prevalence. Mr. Muraleedharan was exposed to the virus during his public interactions in Kerala, and only because he knew that he was exposed, could isolate himself. It is unclear whether he visited parliament house before he got to know that. It is highly unlikely that other MPs from highly affected States are entirely entirely unexposed to the contagion.

Every MP meets dozens of people every day, and more active Lok Sabha members meet hundreds. When 800 of them congregate under one roof, in a constricted space, and sit on crammed benches, and goes to their constituencies and States over the weekend and return to the parliament building to repeat this cycle all over again, they are not showing solidarity with doctors or doing their bit to fight corona. They are making the longest possible contact chains any individual can make in a working week and complicating the job of doctors, and other emergency workers. Far from inspiring doctors, a parliament in session is making the largest contact network that spreads into the noon and corner of the country. Doctors, army and security personnel, airport security, milkmen and newspaper vendor — all are doing their jobs in the face of risk to themselves. But they are not endangering anyone. If parliament continues its session on the pretext of doing its job, it is contributing nothing to the fight against the virus. On the contrary, it could endanger the whole the country.

The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday accorded approval for the procurement of 83 indigenous Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas Mk-1A from the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) by “finalising the contractual and other issues”. The deal is expected to cost around ₹39,000 crore, official sources said.

“The proposal will now be placed for consideration of the Cabinet Committee on Security [CCS],” the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in a statement.

The DAC had given initial clearance for the 83 aircraft in November 2016 and the IAF issued the Request For Proposal (RFP) to HAL in December, 2017. However, negotiations got stuck due to the steep price quoted by HAL which the IAF had said was more than the price of a Su-30MKI.

The 83 jets are in addition to the 40 LCA already ordered by the IAF in two batches of 20 each in the Initial Operational Clearance (IOC) and the Final Operational Clearance (FOC) configurations.

The MoD statement said following the separation of duties between the Department of Defence (DoD) and the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) headed by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), the first meeting of the DAC was held with the “Acquisition Wing being the Secretariat of the DAC”. “This would lead to better coordination and faster processing of cases with the Acquisition wing being in the overall charge of the capital acquisition process,” it said.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday said its primary duty in the Madhya Pradesh political controversy is to independently verify whether the 16 dissident MLAs are holed up in Karnataka or have been held “captive” in the BJP-ruled State.

Also read: Rebels in Bengaluru speaking under duress, must be freed immediately: Madhya Pradesh Minister

A Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta said Speaker N.P. Prajapati was yet to decide on the resignations of these absent MLAs and the Congress has accused the BJP of holding the MLAs incommunicado in Bengaluru. In such circumstances, the court had to devise a fool-proof mechanism to satisfy itself that the legislators were not being held against their wishes.

The court declined an offer by senior advocate Maninder Singh, representing the rebel MLAs, to arrange a one-to-one videoconferencing with the MLAs or have the Karnataka High Court Registrar General to check on them. Mr. Singh said TV channels had beamed visuals of the MLAs holding press meets to declare they were in Bengaluru of their own accord. But the court said it cannot decide cases from what was aired on TV. Mr. Singh then suggested bringing the MLAs to the Supreme Court but the court declined it as inappropriate.

The court said it was anxious to avoid horse-trading in Madhya Pradesh but senior advocate A.M. Singhvi, for the Speaker, said the “horses are already in captivity”. Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, for the Congress, informed the court that senior party leader Digvijaya Singh was detained by the Karnataka police when he tried to meet the legislators.

“The duty of an MLA, as per his own oath, is not to run away when somebody promises him a chartered flight and a beautiful hotel stay. His duty is to the people,” Mr. Dave submitted. He said stable governance should become a part of the Basic Structure of the Constitution.

Kamal Nath’s plea

Chief Minister Kamal Nath, represented by senior advocate Kapil Sibal, insisted on the court allowing him to meet the MLAs. “I am a member of the Congress party. I am the Chief Minister. I want to meet them”.

But Justice Chandrachud responded that “there is a problem with your plea for access, this is not like the custody of a child”.

The BJP, represented by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, said “the MLAs have already made it amply clear to the Congress that ‘we do not want to go with you to Bhopal or even look at you’”. It said a floor test should be held immediately. Governor Lalji Tandon had written a stern letter to Mr. Nath to hold the floor test or accept that his government was in the minority

Mr. Rohatgi said it was Mr. Nath’s “lust for power” that led to the adjournment of the March 16 floor test in the name of COVID-19. Mr. Rohatgi denied Mr. Singhvi’s argument that the Governor was trying to “short-circuit” the power of the Speaker to run the Assembly.

“It is the duty of the Governor to see that governance continues as per the Constitution,” Mr. Rohatgi argued. He pooh-poohed the Congress’s claim that by-elections should be held in six months if the Speaker acceptedthe resignation of all 22 MLAs (16 rebel MLAs in Bengaluru and six State Cabinet Ministers whose resignations were accepted by the Speaker).

“They [Congress] have lost the moral, constitutional right to continue in the government. The letters of resignation of the 22 MLAs are identical. They [rebel MLAs] don't want to be MLAs or in the government. To hold a by-election is not the duty of the court,” Mr. Rohatgi submitted. He urged the court to order a floor test without delay.

Samba Khara, a Maoist cadre with a ₹2 lakh reward offered by the Odisha government on his head, along with seven other militia members, surrendered before the police in Odisha’s Malkangiri district on Wednesday.

The tribal youths surrendered at the Malkangiri District Police Headquarters before Malkangiri Superintendent of Police (SP) Khilari Rishikesh Dnyandeo, and Commandant A. K. Arya, In-Charge Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of the Border Security Force (BSF). As precaution against the COVID-19 threat, all surrendered persons wore masks on their faces.

Khara was involved in the murder of Telugu Desam Party (TDP) MLA Kidari Sarveswar Rao, and former MLA of the same party, Siveri Soma, in the Dungriguda Police Station area of Visakhapatnam district in Andhra Pradesh on September 24, 2018. He was also involved in several other cases of Maoist violence in the Malkangiri and Koraput districts, including the blasting of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED), murder of civilians, and exchanges of fire with security forces.

Losing ground

All eight persons who have surrendered are from ‘Swabhiman Anchal’ of Malkangiri district, hinting that Maoists are losing ground and support base in an area that was once their stronghold. Khara hailed from Luchhapani village. Five of the Maoist militia members were from Semilipadar, while one each is from Tarabeda and Goudaput villages.

As precaution against the COVID-19 threat, all surrendered persons wore masks on their faces.

Khara, who joined the Maoists in 2017, was a member of Andhra Odisha Border (AOB) Military Platoon-01 under the Andhra Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee of the outlawed Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-M) organisation. The seven militia were providing physical, strategic and logistical support to Naxalites in ‘Swabhiman Anchal’, but they had not been elevated to Maoist cadre-level yet.

“Youths of Swabhiman Anchal have started snapping ties with Maoists to surrender before the police and join the mainstream. So, frustrated Maoists are falsely alleging that police is arresting them,” said Malkangiri SP.

‘Sense of security’

According to Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police (south-west range), Shefeen Ahmed K., people of Swabhiman Anchal have started to realise that the police is facilitating development and a sense of security in the area so that they can pursue any profession without the fear of Maoists. With the establishment of a police post at Jodambo, several nearby villages in Swabhiman Anchal are requesting police posts in their areas, the DIG added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6opmpe/article31099779.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200318-WA0012,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/maoist-cadre-militia-surrender-in-malkangiri/article31099781.ece

67,2020/03/18,NHRC seeks action in case of Assam man assaulted for selling beef,"The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has issued a notice to the Assam government asking why a Muslim man assaulted almost a year ago for selling beef should not be paid ₹1 lakh as compensation.

The commission instructed the State’s Chief Secretary to reply within six weeks from March 12. It gave a similar deadline to the State’s Director-General of Police to submit an action-taken report against the police officials found guilty of letting the assault happen.

Some vigilantes had assaulted 68-year-old Shaukat Ali for selling beef in his restaurant at a weekly market in north-eastern Assam’s Biswanath Chariali town. There were allegations that the local police were mute spectators when the vigilantes assaulted him on April 7, 2019.

The NHRC had taken up the case after Debabrata Saikia, Congress MLA and Leader of the Opposition in the State Assembly, lodged a complaint on April 12, 2019, against the assault and the indifference of the police in pursuing the case even after an FIR was registered.

Citing a report of the Biswanath district magistrate (DM) of September 14, 2019, the NHRC said some local unemployed youths had accompanied a profession tax collector who was collecting ‘tax’ from vendors and shopkeepers in the market that had not been leased out for three consecutive financial years.

“The market is in Hindu inhabitation area and selling of beef hurts the religious sentiments of the local people and some youth thus insulted and disgraced Shaukat Ali,” the NHRC observed, citing the DM’s report. “Some unidentified persons also inserted something in his mouth but it could be ascertained if it was pork,” the magistrate had added.

“It is clearly discernible from the report that public servant was collecting revenue from the market involving some local unemployed youths which is against the law,” the NHRC concluded. “The victim was found insulted and disgraced on basis of caste/religion, therefore, human rights of the victim were violated by collecting revenue by a public servant i.e. profession tax collector illegally. Police has apprehended 15 persons and forwarded them to judicial custody,” the rights panel added.

Ruling that the assault on Mr. Ali violated the provisions of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, the NHRC accordingly prescribed a compensation of ₹1 lakh to the victim of what it categorised as a ‘mob lynching’ and issued the show-cause notice to the State’s Chief Secretary.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/7ic2v8/article29597379.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-Mob-lynching,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nhrc-seeks-action-in-case-of-assam-man-assaulted-for-selling-beef/article31099733.ece

Bihar Assembly Secretary-cum-Returning Officer Bateshwar Nath Pandey told PTI that certificates were handed over to all the five candidates after the deadline for withdrawal of nomination papers at 3 p.m.

Two candidates each were from the Janata Dal (United) (JD(U)) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), and one from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Since no other candidate had filed nomination papers, the voting, which was scheduled on March 26, was done away with.

Elections were necessitated for the seats as they were falling vacant next month upon the expiry of term of the sitting Members all of whom belonged to the JD(U)-BJP combine in the state.

The JD(U) candidates were Harivansh, who is currently the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, and Ram Nath Thakur. They will be serving a second consecutive term.

Harivansh is a veteran journalist, who has edited the Prabhat Khabar for long, and is considered a confidant of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who is also the JD(U)’s national president.

Ram Nath Thakur is the son of former chief minister Karpoori Thakur, arguably the tallest OBC leader from Bihar who Mr. Kumar and other socialist leaders of his generation consider their political guru.

BJP candidate Vivek Thakur, a former MLC who makes his parliamentary debut, is the son of former Union Minister C P Thakur, whose Rajya Sabha tenure ends next month.

The RJD candidates are Prem Chand Gupta and Amarendra Dhari Singh.

Mr. Gupta, who is a close aide of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, hails from Haryana and had served as a Minister in the UPA-I government at the Centre.

Mr. Singh, who is an entrepreneur, is not known for prior involvement in politics.

His candidature had caused much bewilderment in the five-party grand alliance headed by the RJD, one reason being that he is a Bhumihar, the upper caste known to be most vocally opposed to Lalu Prasad in Bihar.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/all-5-rajya-sabha-candidates-in-bihar-elected-unopposed/article31099299.ece

70,2020/03/18,"COVID-19: Govt asks CAPFs to axe non-essential leaves of troops, get into ‘battle mode’","A four-page directive was issued by the medical wing of the Union Home Ministry on Tuesday stating that the next three weeks are crucial in checking the spread of the virus and lack of caution can affect the forces.

All non-emergency leaves of paramilitary personnel should be “cancelled” in order to minimise the risk of contracting coronavirus during travel and they should get into “battle mode” to combat the pandemic by ensuring personal and public safety, according to a government order.

A four-page directive was issued by the medical wing of the Union Home Ministry on Tuesday stating that the next three weeks are crucial in checking the spread of the virus and lack of caution can affect the forces, around 10 lakh personnel-strong, deployed for ensuring the country’s internal security and border protection.

The Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) or the paramilitary forces include the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and Sashatra Seema Bal (SSB) apart from the counter-terrorist force National Security Guard (NSG) and the Assam Rifles.

“All non-emergency leave of any kind may be cancelled forthwith. This will cut down travel risk as well,” the guidelines, accessed by PTI, said.

“Avoid international or domestic air, bus or train travel for at least a month except when it is essentially required. Long distance travel is biggest cause for spread (of the virus),” it said.

It has also asked these forces to postpone all meetings and regular departmental reviews related to promotions, medical review, sports tournaments and recruitments.

“There is a need to get into battle mode and plan ahead not only in theory but through practical demonstration and drills,” the guidelines on occupational safety and health of the forces’ personnel said.

Apart from reiterating the medically-certified best practices of avoiding hand shakes and ‘social distancing’, heads of these forces have also been asked to keep “extra emergency budget” for purchase of sanitation items and disinfectants.

It has also asked the headquarters of these forces to make aware their field offices, troops and their families about the importance of self-quarantine.

“For those in quarantine, enable contact with outside world through mobile, laptop, television and newspapers. Chargers and adaptors with sufficient charging points are a must. Sufficient items of clothing, medicines, food and groceries should be ensured,” it said.

Personnel and their families have been asked to not go to public places that witness large gatherings like malls, gyms and swimming pools.

The guidelines specifically seek protection for healthcare staff as they are at “maximum risk.”

If and when health and medical service officials fall sick, the guidelines stated, the healthcare system is likely to become over-burdened.

“They (health workers) are prone to be anxious, worried, irritable and even angry and may even be attacked by the public when resources are limited and may suffer fatal injuries,” it said.

The guidelines state that the personnel should be cautioned against forwarding “unscientific and unsubstantiated messages” on social media platforms.

“Our consistent position is that issues, if any, between India and Pakistan should be resolved bilaterally and peacefully, in an atmosphere free of terror, hostility and violence,” he said.

“The onus is on Pakistan to create such a conducive atmosphere, including by taking credible, verifiable and irreversible action to not allow any territory under its control to be used for cross-border terrorism against India in any manner,” Mr. Muraleedharan said.

He said as a result of “persistent efforts”, the Indian government has been successful in securing the release and repatriation of 2,100 Indian fishermen, from Pakistan’s custody since 2014.

77,2020/03/18,Masks debut in Rajya Sabha; MPs demand curtailing of Budget session,"Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu asks TMC MPs to remove masks

Trinamool Congress (TMC) members who came wearing masks in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday were asked by Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu to remove them immediately. This prompted members to demand deferring of the ongoing Parliament session in the backdrop of rising cases of coronavirus.

Minutes after the House convened for the day, after the obituary references were read out, Mr. Naidu directed the TMC members to remove the black masks. He said the rules of the House did not allow masks.

While, the TMC MPs remained mum, Congress member Rajeev Gowda interjected saying that while the government itself is advising everyone to practice social distancing, Parliament continues to function. He said the parliamentarians should set example to the rest of the country. “We meet people from everywhere across the country and we are probably most at risk within Parliament, and the House of Elders with extremely senior people are also at risk. So, I would urge upon the government to set aside other issues and focus on whether the Parliament sittings can be postponed or the session can be adjourned and postponed to a later date,” Mr. Gowda said.

‘Don’t spread panic’

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said the fight against COVID-19 was humanitarian and not political. Parliamentarians should not spread panic.

Mr. Naidu once again appealed to the members to remove the masks after the papers were laid down. He told the TMC members, “I have already made an appeal that the members who are wearing masks, may please go and remove it. Otherwise, it is difficult to conduct the House.”

In response, Congress MP P. Chidambaram said the matter should be left to the judgment of individual members whether he felt vulnerable or not. “If you impose a standard and say, nobody should wear a mask, I think that is not fair,” he said.

Mr. Naidu agreed to his submission, saying that if members feel vulnerable, they can make preventive arrangements. “I leave it to the members,” he said.

Seeks suggestions

Mr. Naidu said MPs could make suggestions on further strengthening measures in the Parliament House complex to check spread of the coronavirus.

Meanwhile, the TMC has issued instructions to its members, especially the older members who fall in the vulnerable category. Following this, TMC chief whip in the Rajya Sabha Sukendu Sekhar Ray has written to Mr. Naidu seeking leave. In view of the growing number of COVID-19 cases, the government has said that large gatherings should be avoided. “In view of such unprecedented alarming situation which is fast deteriorating, I have decided to remain in self quarantine at home for the remaining part of the ongoing Budget session,” Mr. Ray said in his letter.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hutrfm/article31097987.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/mask,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/masks-debut-in-rs-mps-demand-curtailing-of-budget-session/article31097988.ece

Mr. Abdullah was already under detention — from August 5 last year when the Centre removed the special rights of the Kashmiri people under Article 370 — when the PSA was slapped on him on February 5, 2020.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday slammed the government and telecom majors for doing “self-assessment or reassessment” of the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues worth lakhs of crores of rupees as determined by the apex court in its verdict of October 24.

“How can there be self assessment or reassessment of payable dues? Who has permitted this? How is this not sheer contempt?” a visibly angry Justice Arun Mishra asked lawyers in the case.

Almost five months after winning its legal battle in the Supreme Court against telecom majors including Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel for the payment of AGR dues, the Centre recently did a virtual u-turn by filing an urgent application in court to give the companies a 20-year window to pay the money.

In the application, the government said it had — after “detailed and long-drawn deliberations” — devised a “formula” to soften the blow from the October 24, 2019, judgment of the Supreme Court directing the companies to cough up the AGR dues within three months.

“Do companies feel they are more powerful on earth? If anyone feels they are more powerful or try to influence us they are wrong. Bills were raised and CAG had audited… How can self-assessment be done now?” Justice Mishra asked, before adjourning the case for two weeks.

Justice Mishra said the court could not allow a third round of litigation over the AGR dues. The court said the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had fought for its dues for the past two decades.

“These dues are public money that were not paid for 20 years. Government had fought tooth and nail,” the court observed.

A document annexed to the application shows that the total demand of the DoT as in October 2019 was ₹1,69,048.65 crore from 16 major telecom service providers (TSPs).

A 32-year-old woman from Pune with a travel history to the Netherlands and France, and a 21-year-old youth who had visited he Philippines, Singapore and Sri Lanka, became the latest in the district to test positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday, taking the tally in Pune to 19 — the highest in the State.

With this case, Pune now has eight COVID-19 positive cases and Pimpri-Chinchwad has 11.

The Pune district administration has already issued advisories directing all IT companies and industrial units to permit their employees to work from home wherever possible.

The authorities have been enforcing all kinds of social distancing measures by shutting down schools and colleges, gyms, malls and museums, with hoteliers’ and traders’ associations each taking voluntary decisions to keep their establishments closed for three days to curb the spread of the virus.

The city’s iconic landmarks such as the Shaniwarwada and the Dagdusheth Halwai Ganapati Temple have been temporarily shut, while shops in the usually bustling old Pune have all downed their shutters.

The Pune Municipal Corporation has formed 125 teams, and the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation another 50, to conduct home surveillance across the twin cities, with nearly 16,000 houses being covered thus far.

Since January 18, as many as 900 people have been placed in isolation for displaying coronavirus-like symptoms. The samples of 779 of these have returned negative, while 42 have tested positive. The results of the others are awaited.

In just a single day on Monday, the Madhya Pradesh government elevated three Congress leaders to helm State Commissions, prompting the BJP to approach the Governor, requesting him to block all decisions taken by the government in the past three days, as they claimed it was in minority.

A delegation of BJP leaders that included former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and State party president V.D. Sharma submitted a letter to Governor Lalji Tandon at the Raj Bhavan that said: “The minority government is continuously making appointments of which several are of Constitutional nature, and which have a set term.”

They stressed that in “times of such a Constitutional crisis”, the right to make important appointments and transfers was vested in the Governor under Articles 163 and 166 of the Constitution.

“Therefore, kindly direct the Kamal Nath government that it doesn’t misuse those rights in the present situation of being in minority,” they wrote. “We also request you to stop decisions taken by the minority Kamal Nath government in the past three days.”

A 34-year-old jawan from Ladakh Scouts in Leh has tested positive for COVID-19, making it the first case in the armed forces. His father returned from Iran recently.

As a precautionary measure, the entire garrison of the Ladakh Scouts Regimental Centre had been put under lockdown beginning Wednesday morning and the entry and exit had been prohibited, Army sources said on Wednesday.

The jawan went on casual leave from February 25 to March 1 and rejoined the unit on March 2, Army sources said.

“His father returned from Iran after a pilgrimage by Air India flight on February 27 and was quarantined from February 29 at Ladakh Heart Foundation,” an Army source said.

86,2020/03/18,S&P lowers India’s growth forecast to 5.2% in 2020,"The agency had earlier projected a growth rate of 5.7 per cent during the 2020 calendar.

Standard & Poor's (S&P) on Wednesday lowered India’s economic growth forecast to 5.2 per cent for 2020, saying the global economy is entering a recession amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The agency had earlier projected a growth rate of 5.7 per cent during the 2020 calendar.

Also read: IMF lowers India growth estimate to 4.8% for 2019

Asia-Pacific economic growth in 2020 will more than halve to less than 3 per cent as the “global economy enters a recession”, S&P said in a statement.

“An enormous first-quarter shock in China, shutdowns across the United States and Europe, and local virus transmission guarantees a deep recession across Asia-Pacific,” said Shaun Roache, chief Asia-Pacific economist at S&P Global Ratings.

By recession, S&P meant at least two quarters of well below-trend growth sufficient to trigger rising unemployment.

“Our estimate of permanent income losses is likely to at least double to more than USD400 billion,” said Roache.

As per the statement, external shocks from the fallout of the global viral spread add a new dimension. People flows from the US and Europe will be decimated for at least two quarters, heaping more pressure on the tourism industry.

If lingering uncertainty results in a strong preference for US dollars, policymakers in Asia’s emerging markets may be forced into a damaging round of pro-cyclical policy tightening, Roache said.

Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

The countries most vulnerable to capital outflows remain India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, he added.

“We lower our forecasts for China, India, and Japan for 2020 to 2.9 per cent, 5.2 per cent and -1.2 pre cent (from 4.8 per cent, 5.7 per cent, and -0.4 per cent previously),” S&P said in the statement.

The global policy response, including the Federal Reserve’s policy-rate cut to zero and the Bank of Japan’s scaled-up asset purchases, will help cushion but not quickly reverse these shocks, it said.

Local measures aiming to support vulnerable sectors and workers may help but their effect will “wane the longer the crisis lasts“.

It further said the timing of a recovery depends, most of all, on progress in containing the viral spread.

Even if major progress is made during the second quarter, after a sustained period of stressed cash flow many firms will be in no position to resume investing quickly, the S&P said.

Households that have either lost their jobs or have worked fewer hours will spend less and banks will be busy managing the deterioration in asset quality, it said.

87,2020/03/18,Bill to grant statutory status to DGCA passed in Lok Sabha,"It seeks to improve India’s aviation safety ratings as suggested by ICAO

The Lok Sabha on Tuesday passed a Bill that will provide statutory status to regulatory institutions, including the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and seeks to improve India’s aviation safety ratings as suggested by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Puri also took the opportunity to assure the House that the aviation sector would emerge from the current challenges posed by the coronavirus outbreak that had forced countries across the world to enforce travel restrictions.

The Aircraft (Amendment) Bill, 2020 provides for statutory backing to the DGCA, the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) and the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB). The Bill also proposes to increase the fine amount for violations of new rules from ₹10 lakh to ₹1 crore for aviation industry players.

Air fares

Replying to the issues raised by members during the debate, Mr. Puri said while air fares needed to remain affordable, airlines should also remain viable. He pointed out that the civil aviation sector had been deregulated with little role for the government to set air fare.

He said airline companies were under stress due to the COVID-19 outbreak as there had been a drop in demand.

Air India issue

On the disinvestment of Air India, the Minister said the national carrier was ‘bleeding’ with a daily loss of ₹26 crore and it was likely to get worse because of the coronavirus outbreak.

Answering a query on shortage of air traffic controllers (ATCS), the Minister said India had 3,500 trained ATCS as of now and 250 more would be hired next year.

Participating in the debate on the Bill, M.K. Vishnu Prasad (Congress) said cases of “near miss” in the skies had increased and stressed on increasing the strength of ATCs to avoid any possibility of mid-air collisions.

Praising the effort of Air India during the evacuation of Indians from the coronavirus-hit China, the Congress said the government was selling “family jewel” to manage its expenses.

At a time when the world is grappling with COVID-19, an MP on Tuesday claimed that medicinal herbs prescribed in the Siddha system of traditional medicine could keep all viral infections, including the pandemic, at bay.

Vijila Sathyanath of the AIADMK said Siddha could not only prevent the COVID-19 infection but bring the dead back to life.

91,2020/03/18,What has government done about Law Commission report on Uniform Civil Code: Jairam Ramesh,"Seeks response to report on reform of Family Law mooted by Law Commission

What has government done 19-months after the Law Commission's report on Reform of Family Law which clearly said a Uniform Civil Code is “neither necessary nor desirable”, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh said in Rajya Sabha on Tuesday.

The comments are to be read in context of repeated efforts by BJP MP Kirodi Lal Meena to table a private member’s bill proposing a Uniform Civil Code. After the law banning triple talaq and the scaling down special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370, many believe that a Uniform Civil Code is next on the Narendra Modi government’s agenda.

Also read: Delhi High Court to hear plea for drafting uniform civil code next week

Mr. Ramesh pointed out that in June 2016, the Ministry of Law and Justice, made a referenec to the Law Commission to examine all matters relating to the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code. The Law Commission submitted a report “Reform of Family Law” in August 2018.

The report states that diversity of Indian culture can and should be celebrated, specific groups, or weaker sections of the society must not be ‘dis-privileged’ in the process. Resolution of this conflict does not mean abolition of difference, it said.

“This Commission has, therefore, dealt with laws that are discriminatory rather than providing a Uniform Civil Code which is neither necessary nor desirable at this stage. This is the conclusion of the Law Commission,” Mr. Ramesh said.

The Law Commission report said the way forward may not be a Uniform Civil Code but the codification of all personal laws so that prejudices and stereo-types in every one of them would come to light and could be tested on the anvil of Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution. “By codification of different personal laws, one can arrive at certain universal principles that prioritize equity rather than the imposition of a Uniform Civil Code,” Mr Ramesh added.

He further pointed out that the Law Commission has already suggested certain amendments in personal laws including setting the marriageable age for boys and girls at 18 years so that they may marry as equals, making adultery a ground of divorce for men and women and to simplify divorce procedures. Recommendations were also made to abolish polygamy by law.

“Sir, I would like the Minister and the Government to inform the House what action has been taken on the recommendations of the Law Commission, and I would request you to allow some time for a discussion on this very important subject,” Mr Ramesh said.

Opposition members have been stalling a discussion on Mr. Meena’s bill — “The Uniform Civil Code In India Bill, 2020”. It was first listed for February 7. Last week it was again listed. Opposition members, in February, had written to Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu objecting against moving such a bill that could “fan communal passions” especially in backdrop of ongoing protests against Citizenship Amendment Bill.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/99dcyv/article31094807.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYDERABADLITERARYFESTIVALHLF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/what-has-government-done-about-law-commission-report-on-uniform-civil-code-jairam-ramesh/article31094808.ece

93,2020/03/18,Navy to get 4 more P-8I aircraft from May,"Plans on to install encrypted communication systems on the earlier 8 P-8Is

The Navy will start receiving four more P-8I long-range maritime reconnaissance Anti-Submarine Warfare aircraft from Boeing from this May and the process will be completed by January 2022, according to Navy sources.

“These aircraft will also be in the same configuration as the earlier eight aircraft. Plans are on to install encrypted communication systems on the earlier ones,” a Navy source said.

These systems are available to India following the conclusion of the foundational agreement Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) with the US.

In November 2019, the Defence Acquisition Council, chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, approved the procurement of six additional P-8I aircraft. These aircraft, for which the deal is being processed, would come fitted with the encrypted systems as and when they are delivered.

The Navy had procured eight P-8Is in a $2.2 billion deal in 2009. The aircraft are part of the 312A Naval Air Squadron based at Arakkonam in Tamil Nadu. In 2016, the Navy exercised the optional clause for four more P-8Is in a deal worth over $1billion.

“We have operationalised COMCASA and already exchanging information,” the source stated on the status of implementing the agreement. India had created created a common account of $5 mn., from which deductions would be done for services or information sought from the U.S. under COMCASA.

In March 2019, the Indian and U.S. navies signed a loan agreement and installed two Pacific fleet provided CENTRIXS (Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System) kits at the Indian Navy headquarters and discussions are on for more systems to be installed in a variety of places. These kits enable encrypted communications between the navies, enabling Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), a key focus area between the two countries.

The original proposal was for 10 more aircraft but it was cut down to six due to budgetary constraints and the Navy adopting some fleet rationalisation measures.

94,2020/03/18,Apex court upholds SECdecision on local body polls,"Govt. also gets relief as its plea to lift model code is granted

The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the Andhra Pradesh State Election Commission (SEC)’s decision to postpone the local body elections by six weeks, but gave the government a reprieve by exempting it from enforcing the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) and allowed the implementation of existing development programmes till the resumption of the election process.

Hearing a writ petition filed by the government for striking down the SEC’s order to put on hold the elections to municipal bodies and ZPTCs and MPTCs due to the coronavirus scare, a three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde and Justices B.R. Gavai and Surya Kant refused to intervene at this juncture and directed the SEC to announce a fresh schedule later in consultation with the government.

Presenting the government’s arguments, Additional Solicitor General A.N.S. Nadkarni and A.P. Advocate-General S. Sriram raised an objection to the continuation of the MCC during the six-week period and alleged that the SEC kept the government in the dark about its consideration of postponement of the elections.

The respondent (SEC)’s advocate claimed to have followed the procedures and it (SEC) had no political motives. Rather, the SEC was concerned with the COVID threat and hence believed that the government would be in a better position to prevent a possible outbreak of the dreaded virus if the elections are suspended for a while.

Nod must for fresh activities

The court also ordered that the government should be allowed to take necessary steps for curbing the menace of coronavirus and it should take permission from the SEC if it intended to undertake fresh developmental activities.

It may be noted that State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar declared the postponement of elections citing the COVID threat on March 15 and it evoked a strong reaction from Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, who made serious allegations against the commission.

Besides, the government challenged the SEC order in the apex court, arguing among things that the postponement would scuttle its efforts to mobilise funds due from the 14th Finance Commission.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/apex-court-upholds-secdecision-on-local-body-polls/article31102377.ece

97,2020/03/18,COVID-19 scare takes the shine off Punganur Jatara,"With visitors keeping off event, attendance dwindles to a few thousands

The COVID-19 scare has cast its shadow on the Suguturu Gangamma Jatara, with the two-day fair at Punganur town in Chittoor district turning a lacklustre affair.

The annual event that commenced on Tuesday night at the local royal palace witnessed a few thousands of devotees, as against the usual crowd that runs into lakhs. The festival concludes in the early hours of Thursday with the immersion of the processional deity.

The jatara, with dates back to over 300 years, attracts devotees not only from the western mandals of Chittoor, but also from several parts of Karnataka. When the zamindari system was at its peak, the Punganur samsthan saw its glory. After the system disappeared, the zamindar families left Punganur, settling down in Bengaluru, Chennai and other cities in the north, while some families migrated to foreign countries.

The families of the erstwhile zamindari establishment visit Punganur a couple of days prior to the event to participate in the special rituals and pujas to the deity at the palace, which is under the control of government. Hundreds of families in Punganur and surrounding villages invite their relatives. Since a decade, the two-day witnessed a turnout of close to four lakh.

The COVID-19 scare this time resulted in the attendance dwindling to a few hundreds. Every year, tents used to be erected on the outskirts to accommodate the guests. Usually, about 10,000 goats and sheep will be sacrificed in two days, but this year the figure fell to a below 1,000.

Murali, a local resident, said that for the first time in the history of Punganur jatara, guests from other places did not visit the town. “Owing to coronavirus scare, many families that settled abroad have kept off the jatara. From Bengaluru alone, 40,000 people arrive here, but this time, the arrival is not even a thousand,” he said.

A senior priest said it was for the first time that he saw the jatara almost deserted. “Concerning public health, the decision of devotees to avoid coming here is appreciable, but it is unfortunate that this historical jatara had to bear the brunt of the dreaded virus,” he said.

Meanwhile, a fair that was set up as part of the event looked deserted on Wednesday. The migratory groups, which set up stalls are a disappointed lot, complaining that they could not even get money enough to arrange for the transportation of the material to their next destination.

The municipal authorities also were active in creating awareness among the local people to desist from inviting relatives from other areas.

98,2020/03/18,BJP cries foul over SC/STcase against party leader,"Home Ministry, poll panel intervention sought

The district unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party has sought the intervention of the Union Home Ministry and the State Election Commission over “the misuse” of the SC/ST Act under which a case was filed against party senior leader Pakalapati Sanyasi Raju and others.

The party organised a meeting here on Wednesday over the filing of the case against him when he raised objections to “irregularities” in the election process in the Nellimarla ZPTC constituency.

Addressing a media conference here, district president Reddi Pavani alleged that the entire administration was misused to benefit YSRCP candidates and to harass BJP-Jana Sena candidates. She said the historic Act was aimed at protecting the interests of Dalits but its misuse would lead to injustice to the real victims.

‘Officials biased’

Mr. Sanyasi Raju said a man forced his way into his office to threaten their Nellimarla ZPTC candidate D. Appalachari. He said he was not aware of the caste of that person and therefore the possibility of abusing him in the name of caste did not arise.

AP Dalit Ikya Vedika president and Jana Sena ZPTC candidate of Vizianagaram Adada Mohana Rao said they had lost faith in the officials, and demanded that election be conducted under the supervision of the Union government and the Election Commission of India.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bjp-cries-foul-over-scstcase-against-party-leader/article31102308.ece

100,2020/03/18,No ‘holy dip’ in Tirumala’s Pushkarini from today,"A temporary closure to contain the spread of COVID-19 virus, says TTD management

Amid growing concerns regarding the rising number of positive COVID-19 cases across the country, the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), in a rare move on Wednesday has announced the closure of Pushkarini (temple tank) for the public.

With this, no pilgrim will be allowed to take bath in the Pushkarini with immediate effect.

Avoiding mass contact

According to statistics about one third of the visiting pilgrims numbering anywhere between 20,000 to 25,000 pilgrims take a ‘holy dip’ in the temple tank every day.

It is learnt that taking a cue from reports that several State governments have ordered closure of schools, colleges, national parks, theatres, malls and swimming pools, etc., in their respective States, the management is said to have taken the decision.

Showers to bathe

However, respecting the sentiment attached to the practice of taking bath in the temple tank during their pilgrimage to the holy town by the devout, the TTD has set up 18 showers on the upper banks that will pump the tank water.

Speaking to media, TTD Additional EO A.V. Dharma Reddy said: “The restriction is temporary, and will be lifted should the ill-effects of the dreaded virus subside.”

More precautionary measures

Further, he said the TTD has already embarked on several precautionary measures to contain the spread of the dreaded virus like regulating a direct line for the deity’s darshan, cancellation of certain sevas, supply of masks to its staff, social distancing and avoiding mass congregations, and periodical spraying of disinfectants at all the vital points where the congregation of pilgrims is large.

The decision to keep the temple tank out of bounds for the public for a while is just another step in that direction, according to Mr. Reddy.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pk3szb/article31087350.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16tm-TTD-fundinGRR78HHCI8jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ttd-closes-pushkarini-for-public/article31097861.ece

107,2020/03/18,Dadi slams poll official for not permitting house site distribution,"‘State has taken the decision before the poll schedule’

YSR Congress Party general secretary and local body elections in-charge Dadi Veerabhadra Rao on Tuesday attributed motives to State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar for denial of permission by the State Election Commission for distribution of house sites to 26 lakh poor families on Ugadi.

Speaking to the media, he said the State government had taken the decision long ago and made all the preparations to distribute them before the announcement of election schedule. He said in the past also, the election authorities had allowed then Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu to distribute ‘Pasupu Kumkuma’ to women beneficiaries last year.

Stating that there were several precedents on distribution of welfare programmes during the election process, he wondered why Mr. Ramesh Kumar had denied the poor families from getting house sites on Ugadi. Even the letter written by him to Chief Secretary Neelam Sawhney contained the points raised by Mr. Chandrababu Naidu. SEC was an independent authority an he should not function at the behest of the TDP president who appointed him when he was heading the government in 2016.

Mr. Rao said the local body polls in other States had been put off as election process was yet to begin there. “A.P. is a separate case wherein here the entire process would have been completed by month-end,” he pointed out.

The e-panta would help the government in taking steps to ensure remunerative prices to the agricultural produce. Linking e-panta with banks would help the farmers in sanctioning of loans in time, he said and added that the farmers would also get the loans for the crops which they had raised. Also, it would be useful in availing the crop insurance.

In the past, the farmers faced problems due to uploading the information on web land and a similar problem should not crop up again, the Chief Minister said. He asked officials to ensure that every farmer was registered under e-panta. The government would be able to monitor the prices in the market and intervene through rythu bharosa centres if the farmer was incurring losses. As it would be possible to know which crops the farmers had cultivated in advance, necessary planning could be done to market the same, Mr. Jagan added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/e-panta-will-be-a-milestone-in-farm-sector-jagan/article31093984.ece

113,2020/03/18,Nourishment increases beachfront area in Vizag,"Subdued tidal waves also contribute to the phenomenon: expert

The most frequented area in the city — the beachfront area — has increased significantly, thanks to the nourishment of eroded beaches undertaken by the Visakhapatnam Port Trust and the lull in the activity of tidal waves.

The phenomenon, which has brought cheers among the locals as well as the tourists, is expected to last for sometime. “Till onset of southwest monsoon or occurrence of a system in the Bay of Bengal the extended beachfront will continue. This is mainly because low tidal wave activity leading to less taking away of sand into the sea,” V.S.N. Murthy, former officiating director of National Institute of Oceanography, told The Hindu on Tuesday.

The VPT has engaged Dredging Corporation of India Ltd (DCIL) for the nourishment project after entering into an agreement with it last year for a three-year contract at a cost of ₹39.96 crore. Beach nourishment is an annual project for the port. It is undertaken in February-March when the climate is very conducive for nourishment.

Under the present project, two lakh cubic metres of sand will be extracted from the ‘Sand Trap’ between the Dolphin’s Nose and the South Breakwater. Nourishment is undertaken since 1976, the construction of Outer Harbour.

Sand Trap extended over three to four km is created to stock sand for use whenever is required. However, formation of frequent systems in the Bay have led to declining sand deposits and the total accumulation has come down from four lakh cubic metres by half over last few years.

NIO Visakhapatnam Regional Centre in-charge G.P.S. Murthy said a combination of factors like low velocity in wind speed, reduced pace of winds and nourishment of severely eroded beaches near YMCA and Kali Temple have led to increase in beachfront area.

He said slow wave action would lead to receding of sand that led to creation of wide stretch beachfront in the coming months. The authorities gave up proposal for installation of tubewells, underwater dykes and geosynthetic mesh following recommendation by an experts committee after severe beach erosion led to sea surge a few years ago.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/pjfky5/article31093944.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18-VZ-BEACHFRONT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/nourishment-increases-beachfront-area-in-vizag/article31093945.ece
114,2020/03/18,Private hospital owners press the panic button,"Govt. must bail out the sector by according industry tag to it, they say

The health sector, which was considered to be a most profit-making one, is now struggling to keep afloat in the State, say experts. As many as 500 hospitals out of 2,500 in the State have closed in the last one year due to the unprecedented financial crisis and the rules and regulations imposed by the government.

Managements of as many as 20 corporate hospitals are desperately trying to sell them unable to pay huge EMIs, according to representatives of The Andhra Pradesh State Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association, Indian Medical Association-AP chapter and The Andhra Pradesh Super Speciality Hospitals Association.

Representatives, who recently met in Vizianagaram, resolved to create a common platform soon to protect the sector. APNA State president V.S. Prasad said the outlook for hospital industry was bleak.

‘Multiple regulations’

“The managements are forced to take permissions and renewals from 22 government organisations every year. The rule to follow safety norm for small and medium hospitals is seen as a major financial burden as each management has to invest at least ₹25 lakh for equipment. Round-the-clock availability of doctors, nurses and other staff is mandatory for 50-bed hospitals and consequently, payment of salaries has become a difficult task,” Dr. Prasad added.

ASHA State past president Muralikrishna Voonna and ASHA governing body member Poosarla Visweswara Rao urged the government to recognise the sector as an industry.

“Single window system for all licences and renewals is need of the hour. Soft loans, subsidy on power bills, GST reduction on purchase of medical equipment and prompt payment of dues with regard to Aarogya Sri scheme will help the industry to some extent,” they added.

IMA past president Daggumati Srihari Rao said incidents of physical attacks on personnel by kin of some patients had emerged as an area of concern.

“Many patients are filing cases under the Consumer Protection Act-1986 and hospitals are forced to pay huge fines when verdicts come in favour of patients and their family members. This has forced many proprietors to don the role of employees in corporate hospitals and medical colleges,” said Dr. Srihari Rao.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/private-hospital-owners-press-the-panic-button/article31093931.ece

117,2020/03/18,"Coronavirus | Next three weeks are crucial, says Karnataka Minister K. Sudhakar","He cites instances of countries witnessing deaths within a week of relaxing measures

The next two to three weeks are going to be crucial in preventing the spread of COVID-19 in the State, said Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar.

The Minister explained to the Assembly that there were four different stages in the spread of the disease and presently, Karnataka was in the first and second stages. The examples of countries like Spain and Italy had shown that complacency could derail the entire process. These countries, he said, had initially desisted from declaring lockdowns through a ban on large social gatherings.

“But you know what happened later. The instances of deaths rose within a week in Italy. In fact, that country saw 368 deaths in a single day,” Dr. Sudhakar said.

It’s in this context that the State had continued the lockdown and restrictions on large gatherings till March 31, despite knowing that it would impact the economy in a serious way, the Minister said. “In the interest of the health of people of the State, such a measure is strongly needed even if it means that the economy will be affected,” he maintained.

Explaining the sensitiveness of the State, the Minister said nearly 20 lakh persons were working in the State’s IT sector that would make them either travel to foreign countries or come in contact with those who have an international travel history. In addition to this, a large number of foreigners were visiting Bengaluru frequently, he pointed out.

The only way to keep the disease from spreading was to ensure social distancing,” Dr. Sudhakar said.

The government wanted to cover more number of people under the test for COVID-19 as presently, the State was testing an average of only 10 persons among a population of 10 lakh, he said. Israel was testing 276 persons for 10 lakh population, while Bahrain had covered 8,354 persons under such tests for the above size of population, he explained.

The State had introduced a system of getting health updates from quarantined persons through automated calling system, under which an automatic calling facility records their health status after a gap of 15 days.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/r3oav2/article31102077.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGFUMIGATING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/next-three-weeks-are-crucial-sudhakar/article31102078.ece
118,2020/03/18,Rider to inter-caste marriages leads to heated debate,"Govt. has sought consent from parents in such cases

The State government-sponsored mass marriage, Sapthapadi, scheduled in April and May at Muzrai temples, came under sharp criticism for being restrictive to inter-caste marriage as the government has sought consent from the parents in such cases.

Under pressure from the Opposition, Muzrai Minister Kota Srinivas Poojary finally said they would “go by the law”.

It all began when the Minister said in the Legislative Council: “For inter-caste marriages, there is a condition that the consent of parents is mandatory.” It was in reply to a question by Congress member Jaimala, who sought to know whether inter-caste marriage, remarriage of widows and divorcees are permitted under the scheme.

The marriages at Muzrai temples will be held on 24 April and 24 May, and so far, 710 applications have been received. The government will be spending ₹55,000 on each couple.

Leader of the Opposition S.R. Patil pointed out that under the Hindu Marriage Act no such consent is required in case of inter-caste marriage. “If the bride and the bridegroom have attained the age of 18 years and 21 years, respectively, they have the right to get married. Why is parents’ consent needed?”

The Opposition members criticised the government for taking the conservative approach in a mass marriage funded by the government. “What will you do if the parents do not consent?” asked senior Janata Dal (Secular) member Basavaraj S. Horatti even as another JD(S) member Bhoje Gowda said it was illegal to seek such consent if the couple has attained marriageable age.

Terming the move to seek consent as being “conservative,” JD(S) member Marithibbe Gowda also questioned the government rationale to spend money on the couple utilising the hundi collection.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/8qmui2/article31102059.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGPOOJARY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/rider-to-inter-caste-marriages-leads-to-heated-debate/article31102060.ece

121,2020/03/18,COVID-19 | Karnataka seeks DGCA permission to screen domestic passengers,"Only international passengers are being screened now.

With more people testing positive for COVID-19, there is a growing demand that domestic passengers at airports in the State be screened. Health Minister B. Sriramulu said the State government has written to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) seeking permission to screen domestic passengers. At present, only international passengers are being screened.

MLA and former Health and Family Welfare Minister U.T. Khader also underscored the need to screen passengers returning from other countries at domestic terminals. Talking to reporters in Mangaluru, Mr. Khader said a few days ago, he saw foreign tourists in the domestic flight that he was on that was headed to Mangaluru International Airport. “These passengers left without being screened for COVID-19,” he said.

On social media too, frequent flyers are demanding that authorities extend the screening facilities to domestic air passengers.

This exercise will be a mammoth undertaking in Bengaluru given the volume of passengers at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA). Though KIA has seen a drop in numbers this month, it remains one of the fastest growing airports in the world.

From Bengaluru, 36 passenger carriers provide connectivity to 82 destinations that include 25 international cities. Last year, the airport had operated on an average 560 domestic flights per day both arrival and departure.

There are also demands to introduce screening facilities in major bus stands operated by the KSRTC which offers long-distance services. The corporation has approached the health department to provide screening facilities at the airport.

10% drop in Vayu Vajra passengers

Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation officials claim that COVID-19 has had only a marginal impact on ridership of Vayu Vajra services operated to KIA. “For the last couple days, there has been a 10% drop in the number of passengers using Vayu Vajra services. We are operating 100 buses on various routes to the airport. There is no plan to reduce these services,” said a BMTC official, adding that the corporation plans to keep sanitizes in all the buses. “Talks are on to procure them from manufacturers.”

Buses to quarantine facilities

The BMTC has provided ten non-AC buses to the health department to transport people to quarantine facilities. “The non-AC buses have been provided on contractual basis to the health department. Five buses operate during the day, and the remaining five at night.” Identified airport passengers are ferried to facilities located close to the airport.

127,2020/03/18,"New Bill halves terms of presidents, VPs of local bodies","The terms have been reduced from five years to 30 months

In an attempt to bring about major changes in the functioning of the rural local bodies in Karnataka, the government on Wednesday tabled a new Bill to reduce the term of the offices of presidents and vice-presidents of gram panchayats, taluk panchayats, and zilla panchayats from five years to 30 months.

The Karnataka Gram Swaraj and Panchayat Raj (Amendment) Bill, 2020, tabled in the Assembly by Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister K.S. Eshwarappa said no-confidence motion could not be moved against the presidents and vice-presidents of all three-tiers of local bodies before 15 months from the date of election. The Bill is aimed at amending the 1993 Act. At present, no-confidence motion can be moved within 30 months from the date of election.

The Deputy Commissioner would preside over the meeting while no-confidence motion is considered in taluk panchayat and the regional commissioner would preside in the case of ZP. In case the no-confidence moved is defeated, then no such motion is to be moved again in the next six months.

The Bill envisages some electoral reforms and that included closing of liquor shops 48 hour before closing polling of panchayats.

On tax collection

The Bill has rationalised property tax collection that GPs can do with respect to industries and vacant lands. It has proposed no tax on vacant land in airport or industrial area or industrial areas where plantations are grown. It proposes to levy 0.10% tax on the capital value of the property on runway area of an airport.

The Bill also deleted the provision which said that in Bengaluru Urban district, every one ZP member should have a population of 20,000.

The Bill makes it mandatory for GPs to provide sanitary latrines to all new houses. At present, GPs have been asked to provide sanitary latrines to only 10% of the households every year to achieve full coverage as early as possible.

The provisions say that GPs should conduct animal birth control measures to control the number of street dogs. A written permission from the GP would be required to erect advertisement hoarding on buildings. It said that the Panchayat Development Officer has to execute all lawful decisions and resolutions taken by the GP.

With regards to rotation of seats reserved, the Bill said seats reserved for SCs, STs and OBCs will be rotated every five years instead of 10 years.

On abuse of power

The TP and ZP member would be disqualified for six years if he or she found guilty with regard to misuse or abuse of power. Currently, it is three years. Again, the disqualification would cease to operate after the expiry of six years from the date of the order.

In case a member of the TP applies for leave and the TP fails to inform the applicant of its decision on the application within a period of seven days from the date of application then the leave applied would be deemed to have been granted by the TP.

The new Bill has made MLC, registered as voter in that taluk, as vice-chairman of the taluk planning and development committee. The MLA was the chairman. Currently, the MLC was not part of the committee. The TP president is co-chairman.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/qrktzn/article31105434.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGESHWARAPPA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/new-bill-halves-terms-of-presidents-vps-of-local-bodies/article31100515.ece

134,2020/03/18,Leopard tranquilised,"A 6-year-old female leopard was tranquilised and captured by the Forest Department personnel near Halanuru village in Tumakuru taluk on Wednesday.

The people of Halanuru informed the Forest Department that a leopard was hiding near a bridge around 10 a.m. The department personnel rushed to the spot and blocked both the sides of the bridge and a veterinary doctor tranquilised the animal around 12.30 p.m. It was then shifted to a cage.

Deputy Conservator of Forests Girish said it is one of the suspects whose image was found in the camera traps in the vicinity of the villages where four people including two children were killed in leopard attacks since October 2019.

Four leopards traced

Mr. Girsh said that though we could not identify the man-eater leopard, we have identified four leopards which were sighted very frequently in that area and their images were captured in the camera traps placed in that area.

He said as no images of leopard attacking humans were captured in the camera traps, it is not possible to identify the killer-leopard. “But we are planning to capture all the four leopards which were frequently sighted in that area based on the ‘rosettes’ on their bodies.

With the help of four tamed elephants, the Forest Department personnel are carrying out combing operations to capture the leopard which is attacking and killing people.

They are also using the drone of the Police department for the purpose.

A drone will be designed as per the requirements of the Forest departmentby a drone expert in Tumakuru, Drone Pratap.

He said one of the four leopards was found on Thursday while carrying the combing operation using the elephant. By the time the doctor tried to shoot the dart, the animal escaped without giving them any chance to tranquilize it.

Four cases

Lakshmamma (60) of Bannikuppe village was found dead on October 17, 2019. Anandaiah (58) of Doddmaralavadi, which is neighbouring Bannikuppe, died in a leopard attack on November 29. Samarth Gowda (5) was killed in a leopard attack in Manikuppe village in Gubbi taluk of Tumakuru district on January 10, 2020.

Mr. Karjol specifically directed the officers to tighten preventive measures at religious places that would attract devotees in large number.

“The holidays have already been declared for schools and colleges. Take measures to safely send students staying at hostels to their native places. Health and Family Welfare Department should work to ensure that medical professionals in government facilities work around-the-clock on shifts. Don’t compromise in the supply of safe drinking water. If you find any shortage of funds or medicines, bring it to the notice of the government immediately and we will ensure that the issue is addressed on a priority basis. You can use the State Disaster Response Fund, if need be,” Mr. Karjol told Mr. Sharat.

Mr. Sharat said that a 5m radius area from the residence of the COVID-19 victim has been categorised as a buffer zone for focussed preventive measures.

“We have identified houses for intense monitoring and awareness campaign. To reduce mass gatherings, we have already ordered the closure of cinema halls, multiplexes, shopping malls, bar and restaurants, and other business establishments,” he said.

Any unusual death of birds can be cause of worry and therefore the authorities are on high alert.

At Karanji Lake, the birds are watched in detail twice – morning and evening. If any sick bird or dead bird is noticed, the zoo vets are alerted. So far, no such birds had been sighted. The surveillance data is maintained every day. Intensive surveillance and passive surveillance is done.

ZAK Member Secretary B.P. Ravi said the zoo birds are doing well and there is no cause for worry with their health statuses monitored constantly along with tests on the bird droppings done every month at the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases in Bhopal.

The closure of Mysuru zoo has helped the management to put in place certain steps that required more time for the staff to bring them to reality and facilitate them to plan some new measures too.

So far, no migratory bird had been sighted inside the zoo, and the smaller water bodies inside the zoo are also under observation.

143,2020/03/18,Madhya Pradesh crisis: Digvijaya Singh stopped from meeting rebel Madhya Pradesh MLAs staying at Bengaluru resort,"Police take Digvijaya Singh into preventive custody outside Bengaluru resort; court rejects his plea for access

Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh was taken into preventive custody here on Wednesday while trying to meet the rebel Congress MLAs from Madhya Pradesh staying in a resort. The Karnataka High Court rejected his plea for a directive to the police chief not to stop him from meeting the MLAs.

Mr. Singh, along with other Congress leaders, was held at the Amrutahalli police station where Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar arrived.

He plans to meet Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and request that he be allowed to meet the MLAs.

Mr. Singh flew down to the city earlier in the day with a few Ministers and senior Congress MLAs from Madhya Pradesh.

As he tried to enter Ramada Resort near Yelahanka, the police stopped him. He started a sit-in on the street. “I am a candidate for the upcoming Rajya Sabha election, and my voters are inside the resort. Please let me in alone. I will appeal to my voters and come back,” Mr. Singh was seen appealing to police officers.

However, they refused permission, citing a letter from the MLAs in which they said they did not want to meet anyone and they also perceived a threat from Congress leaders.

Speaking to presspersons, Mr. Singh alleged that the Congress MLAs were kept captive in the resort. “Not just these MLAs, even those outside have been offered ₹25 crore to ₹30 crore by the BJP to switch sides. These MLAs were brought in a chartered flight, paid for by the BJP, and BJP leaders accompanied them, proving this is a conspiracy by the BJP to unseat an elected government,” he said.

As Mr. Singh refused to leave without meeting the MLAs, the police took him into preventive custody along with other leaders, including Krishna Byre Gowda and N.A. Haris of Karnataka.

MLAs holed up there. He was also detained by police and not allowed to meet the MLAs.

Editorial | For a floor test first: On Madhya Pradesh crisis

The court said the police action, stopping Mr. Singh from meeting the MLAs, “cannot be termed [an act of] high-handedness or violation of the rule of law” because the rebel MLAs had written a letter to the Director-General and Inspector- General of Police (DG&IGP) with a request not to allow any Congress leaders to meet them.

Court stand

Justice R. Devdas, before whom Mr. Singh’s petition was taken up for an urgent hearing in the evening, also noticed that the MLAs staying in the resort had also written a letter, requesting the DG&IGP to ensure that no such person was allowed to meet them.

Going by the content of the letters, the court said, the police action could not be termed illegal. On the allegation that Mr. Singh was illegally detained, the court asked the State to file its statement of objection and adjourned further hearing till March 26.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/3noxo2/article31096749.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ktaka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/digvijaya-singh-detained-after-trying-to-meet-rebel-madhya-pradesh-mlas-staying-at-bengaluru-resort/article31096750.ece
144,2020/03/18,HC sets aside KSPCB’s environmental compensation charges on industries,"Court says there was no direction to KSPCB from NGT to collect such charge

Observing that there was no specific direction from the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) to demand Environmental Compensation Charges (ECC) from industrial units, the High Court of Karnataka on Monday set aside demand notices issued to several industrial units at Peenya industrial area here.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi, after going through the NGT orders, and the demand notices issued by the KSPCB, said there was no direction to the KSPCB or other State pollution control board to demand the ECC.

Also, the Bench said that the KSPCB, except demanding the ECC quoting the NGT order, had not pointed out in its notices any violation of the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Air Pollution Act), 1981, the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 or the Environment Protection Act, 1986.

The Bench clarified that it was setting aside the demand notices only on the ground of the KSPCB’s failure to justify the demand notices by citing any statutory provision to demand the ECC.

However, the Bench made it clear that it is the obligation of the KPSCB to enforce all the statutory provisions to protect environment, and the industries also will have obligation to strictly adhere to the laws.

Receiving end

Earlier, replying to the queries posed by the Bench, KSPCB counsel said the board was not a party to the proceedings before the NGT cases in which issue of levy of the ECC was discussed, and there was no power to the KPSCB to levy such charges under any statute.

The counsel also pointed out to the Bench that though the present chairperson of the KSPCB, after securing legal opinion, has accepted that the KSPCB has no statutory power to demand the ECC, the chairman is at the receiving end both from the State government and the executive for arguing that demand is not as per law.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hc-sets-aside-kspcbs-environmental-compensation-charges-on-industries/article31094546.ece
145,2020/03/18,"Yediyurappa in damage-control mode over complaints of family interference, inaccessibility","Party insiders say alternative leadership remains still untested

With dissidence in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) growing, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has swung into damage-control mode. He has started meeting disgruntled MLAs in an attempt to placate them. He has also reportedly assured some of them that he would consider accommodating them in the Cabinet during the reshuffle in June.

An unsigned letter, reportedly by BJP legislators, circulated in the past week targets the Chief Minister’s son B.Y. Vijayendra for his alleged interventions in governance. This is the second such letter to surface. This, and “inaccessibility” of the Chief Minister, were the main grievances aired by several MLAs at a recent legislators’ meeting.

Faction-ridden party

Strategists close to the Chief Minister argue that this is the handiwork of some disgruntled ministerial aspirants. Party sources, however, indicate that this is being used by a faction with support from a section of the party high command to try to dislodge Mr. Yediyurappa. “Unfortunately, the party in the State has been faction-ridden for over two decades and there has always been an anti-Yediyurappa faction, which is actively pursuing a campaign to dislodge him,” said a senior Minister.

However, seniors in the party cutting across factions do not think a change of leadership will happen right away. “The party is definitely looking for a leader beyond Mr. Yediyurappa, who is 78. The party does not see him leading the government beyond 2023. The party has been talent scouting and gave opportunity to C.N. Ashwath Narayan and Laxman Savadi, making them Deputy Chief Ministers. But there is no alternative to Mr. Yediyurappa on whom the party is ready to bet on as yet,” said a senior leader.

They point out that the BJP was down to 40 seats in 2013 when Mr. Yediyurappa quit the party to form a regional outfit. The BJP bounced back in the State after he rejoined and led the party in polls. It emerged as the single- largest party just shy of majority in the 2018 Assembly polls though it paved the way for the Congress-JD(S) coalition government. Mr. Yediyurappa-led efforts to woo MLAs from the Congress and the JD(S) and brought the party to power through ‘Operation Lotus’ defections. The victory in 12 of the 15 Assembly seats in the recent bypolls has also strengthened his position in the party. The party also won 25 seats in the 2019 parliament elections with him in the lead.

“It is unlikely that the high command will take the risk of disturbing a secure government in Karnataka when the BJP has been suffering setbacks in multiple States,” one of his associates argued.

‘Right time to test a new leadership’

On the other hand, those seeking a change of guard argue that this is the right time to test a new leadership. “A leader who cannot lead the government in the coming term cannot lead the party into elections,” a senior party functionary and an RSS leader argued.

At the moment, more than a clamour for change of guard, what seems to be the immediate triggers for dissidence are the perceived inaccessibility of the Chief Minister, MLAs not receiving funds for works in their constituencies, “interference” of Mr. Vijayendra, and disgruntled ministerial aspirants. “Mr. Yediyurappa has often been accused of not taking along all legislators, a complaint that was voiced at the recent legislators’ meeting,” a senior Minister said.

Seniors said that there were two similar attempts to dislodge Mr. Yediyurappa as Chief Minister in 2009 and 2010. Many attributed disruption of hierarchy and skewed opportunities for newcomers over old-timers because of ‘Operation Lotus’ as being the reasons for the situation both now and back then. The family was accused of interference earlier too.

Despite the Chief Minister going into a damage-control mode and meeting MLAs, the disgruntlement in the party is expected to simmer at least till June when the next round of Cabinet reshuffle is scheduled. With a long list of aspirants, the only way to accommodate them would be to drop some of the incumbent Ministers, a suggestion aired at the legislators’ meeting. “The next big challenge for the Chief Minister is to balance the June reshuffle,” a senior leader said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/lun1td/article31094498.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGBSY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yediyurappa-in-damage-control-mode-over-complaints-of-family-interference-inaccessibility/article31094499.ece

On the one hand, the State government has asked people to practise social distancing, but on the other, the DPI has asked teachers to conduct a meeting with the School Development Monitoring Committee and finalise an education plan for schools. Some of the other tasks they have been asked to complete over the next two weeks include formulating a three-year plan for the school based on the assessment of resources, and finalising the academic plan for the 2020-21 academic year.

They have also been asked to come up with teaching solutions for students after analysing learning outcomes of students, set a question paper before the bridge course for students begins, frame content for road safety and civic lessons, and sort out books for the library as well the sports items. “Apart from this, we have to prepare teaching aids and take up initiatives to beautify the school, come up with a waste management plan, and so on,” said one teacher.

It doesn’t end there. A circular listing the assignments, which was issued on Tuesday, notes that teachers should brainstorm on activities for two Saturdays in a month that are bagless days.

Manjunath H.K., president of the Karnataka State High School Assistant Masters' Association said, “Is the health of the teachers not important? Many of our teachers travel nearly 30 kilometres to reach school. They also use public transport. When the government has asked people to stay at home and stay safe, it should apply to our teachers as well,” he said.

Another primary school teacher said most of the planning could be done from the comfort of their homes as well. “These are things we always plan and do not need officials to chalk out a timetable for us,” she said. Department officials however said that the timetable has been planned after much deliberation.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/xv2rgv/article31093916.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGSCHOOLCHILDREN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/schools-shut-but-teachers-have-to-report/article31093917.ece
147,2020/03/18,Battle-grade LCA makes first flight,"The first Light Combat Aircraft in the ‘FOC’ or a level fit for battle, flew for the first time here on Tuesday. The 40-minute sortie took off from the HAL airport at 12.30 p.m. and was flown by Chief Test Pilot (fixed wing) Air Cmde K.A. Muthanna (retd).

State-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, which manufactures the indigenous fighters for the Indian Air Force, said, “This would pave the way for production of the remaining 15 fighters from the FOC block which are planned to be delivered during the next financial year [that is, 2020-21.]”

The fighter received the FOC or the final operational clearance in February 2019, signifying that the Indian designer - the DRDO - has developed it to the level where the plane is good to be used in a combat.

FOC-standard LCAs have advanced capabilities such as air-to-air refuelling and a missile system that is beyond visual range (BVR), among others.

HAL said it achieved the feat in record 12 months at its two LCA assembly lines in Bengaluru after receiving the drawings and protocols from the Centre for Military Airworthiness and Certification under the DRDO.

HAL’s CMD R.Madhavan was cited as saying, “This flight signifies exemplary team work among various stakeholders of the LCA Tejas programme such as HAL, the Directorate General of Aeronautical Quality Assurance, CEMILAC, IAF and ADA.”

ADA or the Aeronautical Development Agency is the DRDO’s special purpose arm which has designed and developed the LCA as a modern generation-4 fighter for the IAF.

HAL is making the planes in two batches of 16 each - FOC standard and the previous version called the IOC or initial operational clearance. It is also due to produce eight more of the LCAs - four two-seater trainers in each version.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/battle-grade-lca-makes-first-flight/article31093892.ece
148,2020/03/18,Volunteers to help tourists at 12 key destinations,"To arrange accommodation, ensure tourists’ safe return

Volunteer groups are in place in 12 key tourist destinations in the State to provide assistance to domestic and foreign tourists and to help the government check the spread of COVID-19 infection.

Twelve groups, comprising entrepreneurs in the tourism sector and representatives of hotels, resorts, travel agents, tour operators, and house boat operators will arrange accommodation for vacationers in the State and ensure their safe return back home.

The groups will work with the health authorities and the district administration that is coordinating the programmes to check the spread of the deadly virus.

The decision to form the groups comes close on the heels of reports of tourists being denied rooms in hotels, access to restaurants and rest rooms, and singled out and harassed by the public, branding them as carriers of virus.

Reports of two French and Italian nationals going without food for four days in Kannur had also expedited the move.

Set up under the Kerala Travel Mart Society that organises the Kerala Travel Mart (KTM), the groups have the cooperation of the government, the Confederation of Kerala Tourism Industry (CKTI) and various associations in the tourism industry.

Designated sites

The volunteer groups have started working in Thiruvananthapuram, Kovalam, Varkala, Kollam, Marari, Kumarakom, Kochi, Munnar, Thekkady, Wayanad, Bekal, and Neeleswaram, said CKTI president E.M. Najeeb. The group has a convenor, joint convenor and a coordinator. The mobile numbers of the members have been made public.

Anish Kumar P. K., the convenor of the group and a leading travel operator in the capital, said they had launched the work on Wednesday by shooting an awareness video on how to sanitise a tourist taxi. “This video will be of use to taxi and autorickshaw drivers,” he said.

Visa curbs

The number of foreign tourists in the State has come down from 5,000-odd to 1,000 after COVID-19 cases surfaced in Kerala and travel and visa restrictions were imposed by several countries, he said. In Kovalam, there are 92 guests, who are staying in leased houses.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/volunteers-to-help-tourists-at-12-key-destinations/article31102275.ece
149,2020/03/18,A forest on 20 cents for Asramam,"Area will be transformed into a thick Miyawaki forest with native trees in 3 years

Asramam, the first biodiversity heritage site in the State, will now have a dense green island in the form of a Miyawaki forest. The mini-forest in the heart of the city will be developed by the Kerala Development and Innovative Strategic Council (KDISC) in association with the District Tourism Promotion Council.

The method propagated by Japanese botanist and plant ecologist Akira Miyawaki helps minimise the damage caused by natural disasters and environment pollution. The KDISC, as part of its Innovation Climate Change Mitigation strategy, will afforest 20 cents of land in 10 districts to protect Kerala’s terrestrial ecosystem. In Kollam, the urban forest will come up at Asramam.

The Revenue Department has earmarked 20 cents at the Asramam ground where the project will be implemented by the Nature’s Green Guardian Foundation. A variety of saplings of the native species will be planted, transforming the area into a thick forest within three years.

The many benefits

This will also contribute to natural groundwater recharging, organic enrichment of the soil, reduced carbon footprint, and a cleaner and cooler environment.

The Miyawaki forest will also be home to butterflies, insects, and birds. The forest is expected to attract visitors for exploring this natural ecosystem. It will provide children a chance to have the real forest experience without travelling too far.

The Kollam Corporation has formed a 12-member committee for preparing a management action plan for the conservation of the site. The area is home to several plant species, some of them facing the risk of being endangered or going extinct. Environmentalists have recommended various measures to conserve and maintain the site including the construction of a mangrove avenue and installation of bioswales.

Mangrove cover

While biofencing can stop encroachment and waste dumping at certain parts, some areas need more protective measures.

Despite intensive efforts to extend the mangrove cover, currently the area has only 11 types of mangroves compared to the earlier 16.

The Asramam ground, Government Guest House complex, the mangrove stretch, and the backwaters are part of the 57-acre land which has been declared as biodiversity heritage site.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/rn0fxq/article31102235.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19tvkomiyawaki1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-forest-on-20-cents-for-asramam/article31102236.ece
150,2020/03/18,No new COVID-19 case for second day running in State,"Avoid crowding at places of worship, says Chief Minister

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said no new COVID-19 case was reported in Kerala for the second consecutive day on Wednesday.

However, public health authorities have brought additional 7,862 persons under observation. As many as 57 are in hospitals and the rest in their homes.

So far, 4,662 people have tested negative for COVID-19. Only 24 cases have tested positive for the virus in the second wave. They are under treatment.

Speaking to mediapersons after reviewing the epidemic situation in the State, Mr. Vijayan said an estimated 25,603 persons were under observation in Kerala, a majority of them in their homes.

Continued vigil

Mr. Vijayan said the indications on Wednesday were heartening. But society could ill-afford to abandon caution. It could not let the illness to overwhelm its finite health-care resources.

Kerala will outpace and finally halt the seemingly relentless march of the pestilence by more rigorous testing and self-imposed social distancing. The government has instructed public health centres, backed by local doctors, to remain open till evening, he said.

Mr. Vijayan held a conference with religious leaders to reduce crowds at places of worship to block the community spread of the virus. He shunned the crammed conference hall and opted to meet journalists in the open air outside the Secretariat North Block that houses his office.

Religious practices

The situation demanded that mosques and churches avoid crowding at Friday prayers and Sunday Mass respectively to prevent crowding, he said.

The Pattalam Palli mosque in Kozhikode has set an example by cancelling Friday prayers until further notice. The organisers of the Kodungalloor Bharani festival have decided to stick to rituals and disallow crowds at the temple.

The Marthoma Church and Kerala Catholic Bishops’ Council have supported the government's initiative to limit crowds at churches. Madrasas could conduct examinations and but should remain closed afterwards.

Mr. Vijayan pointed out that several COVID-19-hit countries had closed down places of worship to prevent crowding. Kerala, with its sizeable population of senior citizens, was required to be extra vigilant against large gatherings.

Enforced policy

Mr. Vijayan hinted that discouraging large public gatherings to obstruct the spread of the disease would be an enforced policy until the situation improved. The government has tasked the district administration and the police to implement it.

The Chief Minister said marriage hall owners should refund rent or advance taken from families who have cancelled weddings and other social events following the virus threat.

The government would commandeer hotels and lodges to house persons under observation for suspected COVID-19, if necessary. He suggested that traders implement online-shopping until the crisis was over.

Mr. Vijayan and Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala would chair a videoconference with panchayat members and municipal councillors to mobilise local-level volunteers for disease prevention.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/1ol5bn/article31102248.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19TVCOVID-19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/no-new-covid-19-case-for-second-day-running-in-state/article31102216.ece

A total of 3,125 persons, of whom 1,894 had come from abroad, have been quarantined at their homes in the district as on Wednesday evening, according to the medical bulletin released here. Of these, 1,254 are the primary or secondary contacts of the infected persons from Aythala in Ranni who are in the isolation ward of the Pathanamthitta General Hospital for 11 days.

Test positive

District Medical Officer A.L. Sheeja said all the five under isolation at the General Hospital tested positive for the infection on Tuesday too. The Health Department collects their throat swab and blood samples for clinical examination on alternate days.

A total of 128 throat swab and blood samples have been sent to the virology laboratory in Alappuzha for clinical examination. Nine of them tested positive and 62, negative, Dr. Sheeja said.

She said 636 persons had come to the district from abroad on Wednesday alone and the throat swab and blood samples of one of them with fever symptoms have been sent for clinical examination.

Teams screened 8,846 persons for symptoms of COVID-19 at the Thiruvalla railway station and at the bus stations at Pathanamthitta, Thiruvalla, Mallappally, Adoor, Ranni, and Konni on Wednesday.

152,2020/03/18,Farmers turn bullish in Palakkad,"Traditional tilling method yields good result in groundnut cultivation

Groundnut cultivation is poised to come back in a big way in the eastern part of Palakkad district.

Farmers in Eruthenpathy, Vadakarapathy and Kozhinjampara panchayats have increasingly turned to groundnut cultivation. But they are using the traditional tilling method by hiring bulls from neighbouring places in Tamil Nadu.

Farmers say ploughing the land with bulls will give them better yield than the mechanised ploughs. Agriculture Department officials too have extended full support to recapturing the traditional farming method.

Farming protocol

Abdul Khader, agriculture assistant at Eruthenpathy, has prepared a complete traditional farming protocol to help groundnut farmers in the region. Shaktivel in Ward 1 one of Eruthenpathy grama panchayat says he is returning to groundnut using traditional ploughing with bulls after 30 years.

He has sown the groundnut seeds in one-and-a-half-acre land with black soil and used about 40 kg of seed for one acre. Although the seed cost him about ₹100 a kg, Mr. Shaktivel is hopeful that the traditional farming method will bring him a better yield. The groundnut brings up to ₹50 a kg in the market.

According to him, one acre farmland used to give a yield of up to 45 sackfuls of groundnut with each sack weighing about 75 kg. In other words, one acre would give a yield of 3,375 kg groundnut.

“Using the traditional tilling method with bulls, we expect to get an additional yield of up to 750 kg,” says Mr. Shaktivel. Mr. Khader says that using the traditional plough with bulls, the farmer would get the advantage of deeper planting of the seed. With deeper rooting, he says, the moisture of the soil could be retained for about a month. The seed will sprout on the eighth day. After a month, deseeding has to be done. After two months, farmers will apply gypsum to control the alkalinity of the soil. Groundnut becomes ready for harvest by the 90th day.

Organic manure

Farmers are using organic manure for groundnut. One acre land is prepared by applying five tractor load of cattle manure. One tractor load of manure costs ₹3,500. The farmers will also get the government subsidy under the location specific scheme.

Officials say farmers had abandoned the traditional method because of various factors, including difficulty in maintaining the bulls.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cg5lsg/article31102162.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19tvmpm-TraditionalFarming,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/farmers-turn-bullish-in-palakkad/article31102160.ece
153,2020/03/18,Calicut varsity panel submits report on student’s suicide,"‘Humanitarian approach missing from college authorities’

A subcommittee of the Calicut University Syndicate has said that the authorities of Malabar Christian College, Kozhikode, should have implemented the regulations related to students’ attendance with a “humanitarian approach”.

The subcommittee submitted its report after probing the suicide of Jaspreet Singh, a third-year student of Economics at the college, at its meeting on Wednesday. Jaspreet was not allowed to write the final-semester exams owing to attendance shortage. The report observed that the redressal mechanism at the college was not effective as the attendance issues of students had not been addressed properly at the department council or staff council. The college management failed to substitute the faculty members who were on leave, leaving the classes free for final-semester students. This caused a lax academic atmosphere in the department. This lapse should be inquired into, the committee said.

The department also imposed maximum lawful punishment to students without looking properly into their circumstances. The Syndicate would instruct college Principals to forward grievances related to attendance shortage in fifth and sixth semesters to the university. Two seats in undergraduate and postgraduate courses will be reserved under the all-India quota to students from other States, the report said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/calicut-varsity-panel-submits-report-on-students-suicide/article31102152.ece
154,2020/03/18,HC dismisses State’s plea in church case,"Appeal against takeover of Kothamangalam church

A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Wednesday dismissed the appeals filed by the State government and the Jacobite faction of the Malankara Church against a single judge’s order directing the Ernakulam District Collector to take over the Kothamangalam Marthoman Cheriyapally and all its properties and hand them over to the vicar of the Orthodox faction after removing the protesters from the church premises.

The Bench comprising Justice A.M. Shaffique and Justice V.G. Arun, while dismissing the appeals, observed that it had become necessary for the court to issue appropriate directions in order to maintain law and order and to ensure that rule of law was adhered to by all concerned, including the majority group which had lost their battle before a civil court.

SC order supreme

The orders of the Supreme Court were to be complied with in letter and spirit and the losing party could not take law into their hands.

The court said the government and its machinery had to be utilised for maintaining law and order and to ensure that rule of law prevailed over all the opinion expressed by a dissident faction.

When the law was laid down and the apex court had specifically declared that the management of the church had to be done in accordance with the 1934 Malankara Church constitution, no one else could prevent the administration of the church by using force.

The court said the district administration and the police had a duty to ensure that the court order was complied with.

When the single judge had issued directions to the Collector and the police under Article 226 to enforce the order, such directives could not be found fault with.

In fact, the single judge had issued the directions to enable the vicar to conduct the services when he was prevented from entering the church. No grounds were made out to interfere with the single judge's directives, the Bench observed.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hc-dismisses-states-plea-in-church-case/article31102131.ece
155,2020/03/18,Major blow to tourism in Idukki,"Hotels, homestays in Munnar, Wagamon, Thekkady shut shop

The tourism destinations in the district wore a deserted look after a U.K. citizen staying at a Kerala Tourism Development Corporation hotel in Munnar was diagnosed with COVID-19. The hotel has been temporarily closed.

As news spread, local people began to keep indoors. The Mattupetty boat landing station was deserted after the District Collector restricted tourism activities. Tourism sector stakeholders said the industry was just about returning to normalcy after the floods in 2018 and 2019 when this infection struck. “This time the industry has come to a standstill. The industry is co-operating with the government initiative to block the infection. It is a situation when the stakeholders themselves came forward to stop booking,” said a member of the Munnar Hotel and Resorts Association.

Last year’s case

“The hoteliers here could not benefit from the last winter season as the usual frost was missing from the hills. This year, COVID-19 has struck a ruthless blow,” he added.

The main tourism destinations are Munnar, Thekkady, Wagamon, Ramakkalmedu, Panchalimedu, Marayur, and Idukki-Cheruthoni dam. The homestays and the resorts in Munnar, Wagamon, and Thekkady were shut down after the district administration issued an advisory.

Staff on long leave

Some hotels and tourism-related business too were closed and the staff were asked to go on long leave.

Thousands of people depend on the tourism industry in the district. District Tourism Promotion Council secretary Jayan P. Vijayan said the inflow of foreign visitors was expected to come down by 15%. Last year, the figure had posted an increase of 17%.

156,2020/03/18,Medical students stuck in Philippines,"72-hour window for non-Filipinos to leave country and travel ban by India spoil plans

Hardly a few months ago, they had flown from Kerala to the Philippines for medical studies. Now, with the Philippine government imposing sweeping restrictions following the COVID-19 outbreak, they are looking at all possible options to get back home safely.

One of the reasons they want to be home is the high cost of COVID-19 testing and treatment there.

Twelve Keralites, who are all first-year medical students at the First City Providential College in San Jose del Monte City, around 35 km from Manila, had earlier booked tickets home for April 21. Now, with the Philippine government announcing a window of 72 hours for non-Filipinos to leave the country, they have been scrambling to reschedule their travel.

“I came here only in January. With the reporting of the first COVID-19 case in our city a week ago, our college was closed. As the Philippine government’s 72-hour window was announced, we tried to reschedule tickets, when we heard that India has imposed a travel ban. We have been communicating with the Indian Embassy and the Ambassador. COVID-19 cases have been reported from a street next to ours. So, we do not feel safe here,” says Mohammed Aslam from Malappuram.

Passport with agency

In Manila, P.K. Adithyan, a second-year medical student at the AMA School of Medicine, has a more complicated problem on his hands as his passport is with the National Vidya School, an Indian consultant for medical education abroad, for the visa renewal process.

“There are around 30 Malayali students here. Some of my friends have already got their passport back after visa renewal, but some of us are concerned whether we will be stuck here in case of an evacuation. The medical expenses here are huge, with ₹8,500 for non-Filipinos and ₹2,500 for Filipinos, for COVID-19 testing. The treatment would be even costlier. If the country goes to a total shutdown, which looks likely, it will be tough for us,” says Adithyan.

According to Mary Jose, mother of Steffi Jose from Alappuzha, a medical student at San Jose del Monte City, they have been in touch with Health Minister K.K. Shylaja, who has offered all support to bring the students back.

On Wednesday, the issue was also raised by MPs P.K. Kunhalikutty and N.K. Premachandran in Parliament.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ee2q8p/article31102113.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19tvtvphilip,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/medical-students-stuck-in-philippines/article31102114.ece
157,2020/03/18,147 birds culled in mop-up round at Palathingal,"One-km area to be sanitised by Thursday evening as per protocol

As many as 147 birds, mostly poultry, were captured and killed in a mop-up round of culling on Wednesday at Palathingal, where avian flu was detected a few days ago.

Rapid response teams of the Animal Husbandry Department searched the area within one kilometre from Palathingal and found 147 birds that went undetected in the culling held on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. Apart from the birds, 18 eggs were also destroyed in the mop-up round. The entire area will be sanitised by Thursday evening.

Animal Husbandry Department field coordinator Haroon Abdul Rashid, camp coordinator B. Suresh, and Deputy Director A. Ayub are leading the operations at Palathingal.

Under control

They said avian flu was under control at Palanthingal. But there would be restrictions on rearing, sale, and transporting of birds in the region for the next three months.

Bird flu can hit human beings with such symptoms as fever and cough and can lead to pneumonia and cerebral damage. Any suspected case should be observed from four days to 16 days. As there is no vaccine or cure for avian flu, destroying the birds within one kilometre area from the epicentre of the disease and sanitising the entire area is the only protocol available to address this dangerous malady.

All birds, irrespective of viral infection, will be destroyed and their feed, feeding utensils, cages, and other accoutrements also destroyed. None will be allowed to rear or bring birds in the region for three months, a period of certification that the area is avian flu free.

People are advised to properly cook meat and eggs and use gloves and masks for handling meat and eggs. They should also sanitise their hands after use.

According to the Word Organisation for Animal Health, pathogens H5N1 and H7N9 are causing avian flu.

From migrant birds

District Animal Husbandry Officer Rani K. Oommen said avian flu could affect all birds such as fowls, ducks, turkey, doves, pigeons, and quails. It would also affect exotic, ornamental birds, and migrant birds. She said the influenza could be transmitted from migrant birds or pigeons to domestic birds. From domestic birds, the disease could spread to all birds in the neighbourhood.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/if28qy/article31102116.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19tvmpm-Mopup-Culling,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/147-birds-culled-in-mop-up-round-at-palathingal/article31102112.ece
158,2020/03/18,"Coronavirus | Kerala’s temple festivals go lean, cut down on celebrations","While most committees fall in line after TDB advisory, some have to be reined in

Temple festivals in the State have assumed a sombre note. The characteristic gaiety and razzmatazz that mark such celebrations have given way to an abiding caution to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.

The Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB), which manages about 1,200 temples, has taken the lead in observing the protocol set by the government. The board has issued a circular to the temple advisory committees comprising mostly residents in each locale to suspend all cultural programmes and mass feasts held as part of the festivals till normalcy returns.

The best example in this score is the board put up by Palkulangara Sree Bhagavathy Temple here, where the annual festival is set to commence on Thursday.

Only rituals

The temple advisory committee has announced its decision to suspend the feast and the cultural programmes and clarified that the festival will be confined to the rituals. Most importantly, it says that sanitising facilities too have been arranged for the devotees reaching the temple.

TDB president N.Vasu says that the circular issued by the board soon after the government insisted on raising the preparedness has had the desired impact.

“We have directed all festival committees to desist from conducting programmes that would lure huge gatherings. The first step in this regard has been made at Sabarimala, where the board has urged pilgrims across the country to abstain themselves from the monthly pujas in March. The response has been positive,” Mr.Vasu says.

The board’s cautioning against the flow of devotees has had its impact on the revenue collection in Sabarimala and other temples, but it is adhering to the precautionary measures initiated to prevent the virus spread.

Govt. directive

“We are keen on following the government directive to a tee and will not compromise under financial pressures,” Mr.Vasu says.

This does not mean all advisory committees have fallen in line and are following the board directive in letter and spirit. The board has been constrained to crack the whip in the case of recalcitrant committees that made an attempt to flout its direction. “Certain temple committees tried to gloss over our directive but we persuaded them to fall in line,” Mr.Vasu says.

But the new order seems to have gone well and is being religiously observed all over the State.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vknwmz/article31102100.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19TV1PALKULANGARATEMPLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/temple-festivals-shorn-of-glamour/article31102095.ece

Kerala Tourism has instructed the newly constituted district-level help desks to function round the clock and assist tourists to make their stay hassle-free, provide basic amenities in emergency situations, and sort out issues relating to visas and quarantine against the backdrop of COVID-19.

The help desks should provide all assistance to tourists who have no prior booking and sought accommodation in the State, as per a 11-point advisory issued on Wednesday.

“If rooms are not available in private hotels, resorts, and classified properties, the matter should be brought to the notice of the managing director, Kerala Tourism Development Corporation, for arranging accommodation in the nearest Kerala Tourism Development Corporation property,” it said.

The advisory, issued by Tourism Director P. Bala Kiran, also mandates the help desks to arrange food, water, and local transport in emergency situations.

Visa expiry

The help desks should immediately intimate the police and the District Collector if they find that the visa period for tourists under quarantine has expired.

“If any asymptomatic tourist wants to go back to his/her home country, he/she should be directed to the COVID-19 district cell of the Health Department for medical examination as per the guidelines issued by the Health Department on March 17, 2020,” it says.

Daily reports

The department also made it mandatory for the help desks to furnish a daily report to the State-level help desk by 3 p.m. by e-mail (helpdesk@

keralatourism.org).

While asking the help desks to remain vigilant to address any related issues, they should monitor the latest developments with utmost care.

Also, they should be in constant touch with the volunteer group committees comprising members of tourism trade associations.

Besides, the help desks need to be in touch with the State-level help desk at 9995454696 and 9447363538.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/help-desks-to-provide-assistance-to-tourists/article31102084.ece

Chief Minster Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday directed the district administration to take necessary steps to avoid crowding in connection with the Kondungalloor Bharani, which falls on March 27.

The Chief Minster was speaking at a videoconferencing on Wednesday for discussing steps to be taken for avoiding crowds at religious functions as part of preventive measures against COVID-19.

Thousands of people from various districts take part in Kodungalloor Bharani. District Collectors should discourage people who prepare to go for the festival, which will be celebrated at the end of this month.

“Christian, Hindu, and Muslim religious organisations should take steps to avoid crowds in connection with rituals. At a time when the country is facing a serious challenge, we should be ready to ignore small discomforts. We are trying to check the spread of the disease. The service of the Armed Forces will be utilised for arranging care centres,” the CM said.

In all, 3,088 people are under observation in the district as part of the COVID-19 prevention mission. Of them, 35 are in various hospitals.

“People should take maximum precautions as there is chance for mass-level spreading of the disease in the next two weeks,” the CM said.

The district administration has given letter to the Transport Secretary to stop toll collection at the Paliyekkara toll plaza against the backdrop of COVID-19.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kodungalloor-bharani-advice-to-avoid-crowds/article31102079.ece
161,2020/03/18,102 passengers from State denied entry to Oman,"Ban on entry of non-Omanis comes into effect

As many as 102 passengers from the Cochin and Thiruvananthapuram airports who reached Muscat on two Air India Express flights on Wednesday were denied entry to the country citing a ban imposed by the government on entry of all non-Omanis in the wake of COVID-19.

Arabs on the flights, that left Cochin at 8.25 a.m. and Thiruvananthapuram at 7.30 a.m. respectively, were allowed to complete the immigration and customs formalities and enter Oman.

The Keralites have been held up in the Muscat airport since 10.30 a.m. Airline sources said the pleas of the stranded passengers that the ban on entry to non-Omanis in the Sultanate would come into effect only at 12 noon local time went unheeded. The intervention of the airline staff also did not help.

The IX 543 flight from Thiruvananthapuram had 69 passengers and the IX 443 flight from Cochin had 63. They will now be able to enter Oman only after the ban is lifted.

To be brought back

The Air India Express diverted their aircraft in Abu Dhabi to Muscat to bring back the stranded passengers. “The 102 passengers from Muscat will reach the Cochin international airport at 8.10 a.m. on Thursday,” airline sources said. From 12 noon Muscat time, the Omani authorities have suspended exit for Omani nationals and imposed quarantine for all arriving in the Sultanate, including Omani nationals. Transit passengers are allowed to travel through Oman airports. Nationals of Oman are allowed to enter with a national ID card if they used the card when they departed from Oman.

Screening

More than 1,000 passengers who will arrive by flights from Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah on Thursday will be screened at the Thiruvananthapuram international airport by a team of doctors. Travellers exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 will be shifted to isolation wards in hospitals while the rest will be transported home in government vehicles for quarantine.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/102-passengers-from-state-denied-entry-to-oman/article31102076.ece
162,2020/03/18,State banks on inputs from scientists,"RGCB to take up epidemiological studies to improve the strategies to contain COVID-19

As it braces for the next stage of COVID-19 epidemic, when community transmission of the disease could derail even the best laid-out plans and overwhelm an already strained health system, Kerala is banking on the strength of inputs from the scientific community to guide the State through what could be a prolonged engagement with the pathogen.

The Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) is conducting epidemiological investigations into the ongoing epidemic of COVID-19 which could help the State improve its strategies in surveillance and containment.

On Wednesday, the Indian Council of Medical Research approved the RGCB as one of the official testing sites for COVID-19. Sample testing will commence as soon as test kits are received. With four PCR platforms, the RGCB can handle nearly 500 samples daily.

Pneumonia cases

“The focus should not just be on diagnosing and counting cases. Unless we look more closely at the acute pneumonia cases being reported in hospital ICUs, we could be missing the silent transmission of COVID-19 in the community. The RGCB had already initiated the screening of all acute cases of pneumonia being reported in private hospitals. The State has now requested us that we include cases from the government hospitals and medical college hospitals too in our surveillance study,” RGCB Director M. Radhakrishna Pillai told The Hindu.

All hospital-based cases of acute pneumonia with bilateral lung infiltration should be screened to determine whether it was bacterial or viral pneumonia and the causative agent should be identified.

If at all a case of viral pneumonia due to SARS CoV-2 is detected, (which is not officially accounted for), it could be the first indication of COVID-19 silently transmitting in the community.

What is proposed is the identification of sentinel sites, at least 10 hospitals in each district, from where respiratory samples (from pneumonia cases) would be collected and diagnosed using RT-PCR assay. Detecting community transmission early can help the State intensify surveillance and containment efforts.

Strain identification

“We also propose to do the whole genome sequencing of the virus and strain identification studies. Another major study we are initiating immediately is sero surveillance studies amongst health-care personnel working in hospitals to detect SARS-CoV 2 viral antibodies (IgG or Immunoglobulin G) in their blood samples. This is another indication of community spread because front-line health-care workers would be the first persons in the community at risk of contracting infection from a potential COVID-19 case,” Dr. Pillai said.

COVID-19 mostly presents as a mild infection, and it is very difficult to clinically distinguish it from common cold or even H1N1, from which healthy young individuals recover normally. IgG studies amongst health-care personnel would thus indicate the asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19.

The RGCB also plans to conduct epidemiological studies by studying the blood samples of COVID-19 patients who have since recovered from the disease.

“The magnitude and impact of COVID-19 is huge and the virus is going to be with us for a long time. The sooner we invest in real science, the better grip we will have over the epidemic,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-banks-on-inputs-from-scientists/article31102071.ece
163,2020/03/18,Kodungalloor Bharani as usual,"Oracles to adopt safety steps, to use shawl instead of masks

Thousands of oracles who will reach the Kodungalloor Bhagavathy Temple for the annual Bharani festival this month will adopt health precautions in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.

They may not be wearing any protective masks during the mass procession and temple rituals. Instead, would cover their nose and mouth with shawl and stay at safe distance from each other. The traditional practice of oracles, who would all be dressed up in red and singing devotional songs, spilling blood by hurting themselves on the forehead using long sickle-shaped swords would continue.

Oracles and devotees

Oracles and devotees, mostly from the northern districts of Kerala, especially Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode and Wayanad, would travel to Thrissur district on March 26 and 27 to attend the festival. A large number of them would spend a couple of days in the town before going back.

The Cochin Devaswom Board, which manages the temple, has called for scaling down the crowd and confining the festivities to rituals in the wake of the outbreak of the disease.

Usually, thousands of devotees and oracles reach the temple during the festival days.

A large number of oracles participate in the annual ritual of Kavutheendal which takes place on March 27. The board has decided to approach the District Collectors concerned to appeal to the masses to bring down the number of devotees, said A.B. Mohanan, board president.

A meeting of the authorities concerned would be held on Thursday to discuss the issue, he said.

T. S. Gireeshkumar Menon, State vice president of the Kodungalloor Bhagavathy Velichappad Sangham, the organisation of oracles, said they have appealed to its various units to cut down on the number of persons who would be travelling to the temple.

“We have requested the devotees and oracles to comply with the safety and health guidelines issued by the authorities and to remain at safe distance from each other during the festival. Moreover, we have requested them to go back to their homes on the same day of arrival after completing their prayers,” he said.

The practice of spilling blood in memory of the mythical war waged by Goddess Kali with Darukan, the demon, cannot be done away with, as the oracles would calm down only when the blood is spilt. Most of the oracles would not even apply medicine on the wound or even take tetanus vaccine as Goddess Kali would heal them, he said.

The sangham would discuss the preparations at a meeting to be held on Thursday, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vjs7mq/article31103220.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19tvbharani,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kodungalloor-bharani-fete-as-usual/article31100065.ece
164,2020/03/18,"Fix prices of sanitizers, masks, HC tells govt.","Court seeks action against those creating artificial scarcity

A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Tuesday directed the State government to publish a notification fixing maximum retail prices of face masks and hand sanitizers forthwith.

The Bench comprising Chief Justice S. Manikumar and Justice Shaji P. Chali directed the State government to take stringent action against those who were creating artificial scarcity of face masks and hand sanitizers in the State.

The court, while disposing of a public interest litigation seeking to control the prices of hand sanitizers and face masks, directed the State government to create awareness the maxim prices fixed for the said items. The court also directed the government to create awareness through the print and electronic media.

In its petition, Justice Brigade, an organisation of Kochi-based lawyers, in its petition said that with the number of COVID-19 cases on the increase, sanitizers and masks had disappeared from shelves of medical shops and other outlets.

The State government submitted that the district administration and the government were taking various measures to proactively handle the reported shortage of face masks. The Kerala State Drugs and Pharmaceuticals, based in Alappuzha had started production of hand sanitizers to beef up their availability in the market. There was scarcity of sanitizers and masks because of the huge public demand for them all of a sudden, the government said in a statement filed before the High Court.

In fact, the Drugs Controller had made all efforts to boost the production of sanitizers by permitting three additional manufactures to produce them. As a result, sufficient quantity of these products were made available for the day-to-day use in the State. Besides, the drug control departments had conducted State-wide raids to unearth illegal manufactures of the products.

The government further submitted that the officers of the drug department had also ensured that sanitizers were not sold at exorbitant prices. The officers had also been asked to maintain strict vigil on the unscrupulous activities such as hoarding and charging of excess prices for sanitizer and hand masks.

All District Collectors had issued orders under the Disaster Management Act authorising the Assistant Drugs Controller to initiate action against black marketeers. The Health Department was taking all steps to prevent the spread of the virus and coordinating all activities on a day-to-day basis.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fix-prices-of-sanitizers-masks-hc-tells-govt/article31099998.ece
165,2020/03/18,The pandemic robs the fragrance of ornamental flower business in State,"Traders say cancellation of weddings is the main reason for the low demand

The COVID-19 lockdown has caused the cut-flower business in Kerala to wilt.

Madhu Sankar, florist and owner of Lalith Flora here, says the orders have plummeted.

“Sales have dipped from ₹10,000 a day in February to ₹3,000 in mid-March. Trade has shifted significantly from walk-in buys to online orders,” he says.

The epidemic has eclipsed the demand for flowers. Cancellation of weddings, the mainstay of the floral business, is the main reason. The government has put a limit on gatherings to retard the pace of the viral outbreak, putting marriage halls, malls, jewellery showrooms, textile shops and cinemas out of business for now. Hotels laid low by the outbreak are in no mood for ornamental flowers and foliage to decorate tables and embellish foyers.

Rahul Raveendran, an ornamental horticulturist, says orchid stems are in full bloom. However, the seasonal harvest is not paying dividends because of the dip in demand. By a rough estimate, at least 30 acres in rural Thiruvananthapuram is dedicated to the cultivation of orchids, ornamental plants and foliage.

Farms

The farms are spread out over the suburbs of Neyyattinkara, Kallambalam, Navaikulam, Nedumangadu and Kazhakuttam.

Exotically named Aranthera, Teacher Julin, Anne Black, Beatrix, and Spider grow under shade nets in what was once fallow land. Heliconia varieties, decorative foliage and genetically tweaked miniature gingers, pineapples and plantain are also cultivated.

Mr. Raveendran says orders from New Delhi have dropped from twice a week to once a fortnight. The intake of ornamental foliage and flowers by clients in Mumbai and Bangalore has also plummeted.

In Tamil Nadu, the marriage season is over and so has the demand. Ornamental horticulture in Kerala is minimal compared to other neighbouring States. Most of the cultivation is on smallholdings or terrace tops. The sector provides employment and income to many. With the outbreak slowing down the demand further, flower growers feel the forecast is not rosy for them till the COVID-19 threat recedes.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tcoilo/article31103256.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19tvtvflower,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-wilts-floral-business-in-state/article31099468.ece

In order to ensure the safety of participants during the auctioning of toddy shops in the wake of COVID-19, the State government has issued certain guidelines to be adhered to during the auctions.

In a circular, the Excise Commissioner has ordered that a team of doctors be made available at the auction place. The hall should be sanitised after auctioning of each range and an interval of 45 minutes should be ensured between each auction.

The Excise Commissioner has also ordered avoiding auctions in an air-conditioned room. Instead, it should be conducted in a place having sufficient air circulation. Also, only one auction should be held at a time. The circular said only persons eligible to participate in the auction need be allowed to enter the auction hall.

Masks and hand gloves

The proceedings of the auction should be recorded. All persons, including officials participating in the auction, should wear face masks and hand gloves. Those who wear masks should avoid frequent contacts on it and destroy them in open space. The seats of the participants should be arranged in such a way that the distance between each seat is one metre.

The circular was produced in the High Court when various Abkari cases came up for hearing. The auction of 641 toddy shops in Ernakulam district is slated on March 18 and 19 at the Ernakulam Collectorate.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/safety-first-policy-at-toddy-shop-auctions/article31094417.ece
167,2020/03/18,COVID-19 | Effort to make people at home in isolation ward,"Separate menu for Indians, foreigners

People undergoing treatment at the isolation ward of the Government Medical College Hospital, Kalamasserry, for symptoms of COVID-19 are being fed a nutritious diet through the day with the Health Department adhering to separate menu for local residents and foreigners.

The breakfast served to Indians comprises dosa and sambar, two boiled eggs, two oranges, tea, and mineral water followed by a fruit juice three hours. Foreigners are served soup, fruits (raw cucumber, orange or banana), and two boiled eggs followed by pineapple juice at 11 a.m. Breakfast is being served as early as 7.30 a.m.

Free copies of The Hindu are being given along with the breakfast as part of the organisation’s corporate social responsibility initiative.

For Indians, two chapattis, rice, fish fry, thoran, curry, curd, and a one-litre bottle of mineral water make up the lunch served at 12 noon. Foreigners get toasted bread, cheese (if needed) and fruits for lunch. Indians get tea, biscuits/banana fry/vada at 3.30 p.m. whereas fruit juice is served to foreigners 30 minutes later.

Dinner for locals served at 7.30 p.m. comprises appam, vegetable stew, two bananas, and a litre of mineral water while foreigners are served toasted breads, scrambled eggs, and fruits while children also get milk.

District Collector S. Suhas said in a Facebook post that the administration was trying to provide all amenities to those in isolation.

169,2020/03/18,COVID-19 | Sabre-rattling over closing liquor outlets,"Government’s rejection of Opposition demand over COVID-19 outbreak opens battlefront

The decision of the government to reject the demand of the Opposition to close down crowded liquor outlets given the COVID-19 outbreak is shaping up to be another battlefront between the rival coalitions.

Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullappally Ramachandran had said it was ironical that the government allowed liquor shops but closed schools.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, and Congress leader V.M. Sudheeran warned the government that it would make itself vulnerable to accusations of endangering public health if the administration did not immediately shutter the 270-odd outlets to prevent the peer-to-peer spread of the illness.

An indication that the United Democratic Front (UDF) would politicise the issue came when Youth League workers tried to force the closure of a Bevco outlet at Sarovar in Kozhikode recently.

Heft of social forces

The UDF appeared intent on harnessing the heft of influential social forces that back prohibition, including church and Muslim organisations, to try to put the government on the defensive in the run-up to the local body elections and the Assembly bypolls in Chavara and Kuttanad.

Excise Commissioner S. Ananthakrishnan told The Hindu that sharply limiting the availability of legal liquor might open the door for bootleg alcohol of dubious quality and questionable provenance into the State.

He said excise officers would inspect liquor outlets, bars, and private member clubs to ensure that the management observed the safety protocol mandated by the government.

They would also look for overcrowding and ensure that managements provided enough social distance between customers.

The government has asked Bevco authorities to plot out measures to ensure that public health is not compromised when people turn up at liquor outlets in significant numbers.

The options before the government included opening more counters. It has for now decided against extending timings or altering liquor laws to allow for the online sale of legal alcohol. Bevco has issued personal protective equipment to those who manage its counters. The corporation has also provided hand sanitisers for the public.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/7zjoah/article31094266.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18tv-BEVCO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sabre-rattling-over-closing-liquor-outlets/article31094267.ece

171,2020/03/18,"Isaac seeks Central aid, GST arrears to tide over crisis","‘Liberalise SDRF norms to support affected families’

Kerala has sought an enhanced allocation for the health sector, liberalisation of the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF) norms to support COVID-19-affected families, and immediate release of Goods and Services Tax (GST) arrears of ₹3,000 crore to tide over the State’s crisis.

In a letter to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman on Tuesday, Dr. Isaac said additional financial and material assistance should be provided to the States for managing the brewing crisis and demands. The testing facilities for COVID-19 should be expanded immediately.

The SDRF norms should be further liberalised to compensate the families that lost members and also meet the medical expenses of positive cases.

Considering the deleterious impact of the pandemic on the economy, the Centre should either immediately wipe out the GST compensation arrears amounting to ₹3,000 crore or raise the borrowing limits for the current financial year by 0.5%.

Pension arrears

The Centre should at least permit the State government to front-load market borrowing for next financial year so that the payment arrears pending since 2019-20 could be cleared and the five-month arrears of social welfare pensions due to 55 lakh elderly could be disbursed during the Vishu festival.

Dr. Isaac sought a six months’ moratorium on loans extended by commercial banks so that the micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME) sector would not be rendered bankrupt.

He made a plea for reducing the fuel prices to contain the inflationary pressures and for extending larger credit to prop up the MSME sector that is in distress.

The Centre should increase the number of mandays and increase the wage rate of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. Since the financial year is drawing to a close, steps should be taken to extend the programme up to April and May. Kerala has planned a drive to clean up canals to an extent of 50,000 km and plant one crore fruit-bearing trees under the scheme, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/isaac-seeks-central-aid-gst-arrears-to-tide-over-crisis/article31094156.ece
172,2020/03/18,COVID-19 | Expert committee to guide State on evolving situation,"No new cases in Kerala, but woman in Mahe who returned after Umrah in Mecca tests positive

The government has decided to set up an expert committee, including public health professionals and scientists, to guide it on the evolving situation involving COVID-19. It intends to create a repository of all scientific studies and research happening all over the world on the new disease.

Briefing media here on Tuesday, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said it had been decided to set up an interactive web portal to disseminate all current information and scientific facts on the COVID-19 situation to the public and health-care professionals.

The State did not report any new positive COVID 19 cases on Tuesday. However, a whopping 5,372 persons have been added to the surveillance network, including 65 new hospital admissions. As on Tuesday, the State has 18,011 persons under surveillance, of whom, 17,743 are on home quarantine and 268, in isolation in hospitals.

The Union Territory of Puducherry reported its first case of COVID-19 with a 68-year-old woman in the enclave of Mahe testing positive for the virus. The patient had been under observation at the Government General Hospital in Mahe since her return from Umrah in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.

Awareness drive

The government is planning to utilise the services of medical students to create large-scale awareness in the community on COVID-19. The Kerala University of Health Sciences will coordinate this initiative. A digital consultation service for the public on all aspects of the disease would be started with the help of the Indian Medical Association. Mr. Vijayan requested the entire medical fraternity to lend support to the government in assuaging the fear and anxiety over COVID-19 among the public.

He said the network of pain and palliative care services would be utilised to give special attention to the geriatric population as the disease resulted in high mortality amongst the elderly.

Mr. Vijayan said the government intended to set up more COVID 19 testing facilities across districts. Though there have been serious lapses in surveillance over the past few days, the level of alertness and vigil should be high as the virus is highly transmissible, he said.

Uninterrupted power supply would be ensured so that IT professionals who are working from home do not face work disruptions.

There is no reason why foreign tourists in Kerala who do not have the disease should not return to their home country and the government will enable their safe return.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vmen4i/article31094145.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18tv-Covidcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/expert-committee-to-guide-state-on-evolving-situation/article31094136.ece

174,2020/03/18,COVID-19 | Residents join drive against the pandemic,"From cleaning common utilities to sensitising public, associations leave no stone unturned

Residents associations in the district have come out with various efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 by ensuring cleanliness within their surroundings.

While some associations have distributed hand sanitisers, liquid soaps and masks, almost every unit has become part of the government’s ‘Break the Chain’ campaign by providing facilities to wash hands at common places.

Residents near the Government Medical College Hospital are leaving no stone unturned in adopting precautionary steps.

The Sanjeevani Apartment, located around 300 m from the hospital where several COVID-19 positive and suspected patients have been admitted, has been witnessing an intensified sanitation regime of late.

Frequent disinfection

Common facilities are disinfected at frequent intervals.

“Besides being in the close vicinity of the hospital, we also have residents who work or study at the medical college. Under the circumstances, we have been cleaning the lift every two hours. In addition, we have made it mandatory for those entering the premises to wash their hands using sanitisers or handwash at the entrance.

The security staff have been directed to enforce the practice for residents, visitors, food deliverers and others,” says Joyas Jose, treasurer of the TRIDA Sanjeevani Apartment Owners Association.

The association has also evolved a plan to deal with exigencies such as urgent medical care for symptomatic persons.

The Janamaithri Suraksha Samithi of the Medical College police, an umbrella forum of 125 residents associations in the station limits, has also been playing an active role in spreading information. Committee convener Lambodharan Nair, who is also the president of the Murinjapalam Eanthivila Residents Association, said that experts from the medical college had been leading sensitisation programmes, which helped bust misconceptions.

He said some hospitals in the region had also been supporting the residents associations by supplying hand sanitisers and other protective items.

On alert

The Federation of Residents’ Associations Thiruvananthapuram (FRAT), the apex body of residents associations in the district, has also been in the forefront of coordinating the activities.

According to FRAT chairman M.S. Venugopal, all associations have been advised to remain vigilant and inform health authorities and the nearest police stations of the arrival of residents from abroad in case they did not do it themselves.

The district administration has identified care homes in the district that can be utilised to quarantine at least 5,000 people who have come from abroad. Efforts to identify additional facilities to accommodate those placed under observation come amidst concerns of dwindling spaces in government hospitals.

District Collector K. Gopalakrishnan has said that all arrangements were in place at the care homes to deal with any exigencies. He added that more officials had been designated to coordinate the activities at the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport. With this, over 50 officers have been assigned the special purpose by the district administration.

According to official statistics, a total of 222 people were placed under observation in the district on Tuesday. In all, 1,584 people are under observation, including 680 under home quarantine.

The health authorities reported that 17 of the 30 samples collected from the primary contacts of the Italian, who tested positive for the disease, tested negative. The results of the remaining were awaited.

As many as 1,583 passengers were screened at the international airport, and 86 in the domestic terminal on Tuesday.

Passengers were also screened at the Thiruvananthapuram Central, Pettah, Nemom, Kazhakuttam, Kochuveli, Varkala, and Parassala railway stations; KSRTC Central bus station at Thampanoor; and at inter-State borders at Amaravila, Kozhivila, Uchakkada, Vellarada, and Karakkonam.

The district administration continues to receive plenty of calls from the public, seeking information. While 614 calls were made to the District Collectorate control room, the Disha call centre received 149 calls.

Reviewing the existing arrangements, the Collector expressed satisfaction at the steps being implemented . The administration has been receiving the assistance of public representatives, including MLAs, in this regard.

Currently, 18 squads have been operationalised to coordinate the activities. The Collector has also constituted an animal surveillance team to keep track of the possibility of a bird flu outbreak.

Travel flow-chart

Meanwhile, the district authorities released a partial travel flow-chart of the doctor of Sree Chitra Thirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST), who was diagnosed with COVID-19 two days ago.

The patient, who had arrived in Thiruvananthapuram in a flight (QR506) from Doha at 1.20 a.m. on March 2, went to Ulloor Gardens on the same day.

He had also gone to Hotel Bismi at Kumarapuram between 6 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. He is reported to have gone to Hotel Ambadi Kannan in the Medical College Junction at 7.30 p.m. on March 3; Hotel Bismi at Kumarapuram at 6 p.m. on March 4; and Thamarassery Churam, another restaurant, at 6 p.m. on March 5.

He visited Kunnil margin-free market at Medical College Junction between 7.30 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. on March 8, Thamarassery Churam between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. on March 10, and Kochi Peediya restaurant between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. on March 11.

176,2020/03/18,COVID-19 | Thiruvananthapuram eateries hit by workers’ exodus,"Some close down, some rework menus or hire Malayalis as migrants leave

Misinformation on WhatsApp groups combined with a genuine fear of the spread of COVID-19 and pressure from family members back home seem to have led to an exodus of migrant workers who used to be employed in various restaurants here, to their native States. Some restaurants were forced to closed down on Tuesday, while some others had to rework their menu after temporarily hiring Malayali workers to replace those who left.

According to Mohammed Zeeshan, assistant manager of Zam Zam Restaurants, around 400 of the total of 600 migrant workers in their various restaurants in the city had gone home in the past few days.

“Most of those who have left are from Assam, Nagaland, West Bengal and Jharkand. We have hired a few Malayali staff to replace them. The menu had to be shortened. Many of them did not want to leave, but there was so much panic and they were getting frequent calls from family members requesting them to come back,” says Mr. Zeeshan.

Ayaz Sait, an office-bearer of the Kerala Hotel and Restaurants Association, who runs three restaurants in the city, had to close down two of them due to staff shortage on Tuesday.

“A couple of days ago, an old video clip shot elsewhere of police personnel publicly announcing to migrant workers to return to their homes due to the dangerous situation circulated in several of the workers’ WhatsApp groups. That created a lot of fear and many of the uneducated workers fell for it, choosing to return home. We talked to some of them and instilled some level of confidence, but following the District Collector’s press conference, when the entire city almost shut down, some more of them left for home. If this continues for a week or so, only 20% of the restaurants here will be able to function,” says Mr. Sait.

Fall in customers

The fall in customers over the past few days, with quite a few following social distancing strictly, too have forced restaurants to limit their menu. According to Railway officials, trains towards Guwahati and Howrah, have been experiencing an increased rush of passengers, much above the normal rate.

At the same time, most of the migrant workers in the construction sector have stayed back, and civil work has been progressing. Experts attribute this to the limited public contact in the construction sector, compared to the hotel industry, contributing to less fear of contacting the virus.

“Construction activity has not suffered at all and all the projects are progressing. The Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations (CREDAI) has released its own guidelines for worksites as well as the places where the workers stay. The workers have been asked to wash their hands while entering as well as leaving. Those who are taking public transport have been asked not to come, as most of them stay near the worksites. They have also been asked not to leave the workplace except in case of emergency,” says S. Krishnakumar, Chairman, CREDAI.

According to a source in the Labour Minister’s office, the department is organising regular visits of Labour and Health officials to migrant workers’ camps and sites, for creating awareness of precautionary measures. Campaigns are being run in multiple languages.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/9phhvp/article31094070.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18TVCOVID-19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-thiruvananthapuram-eateries-hit-by-workers-exodus/article31094071.ece
177,2020/03/18,Steven Spielberg: ‘West Side Story was one haunting temptation I finally gave in to’,"Filmmaker says that he wanted to reimagine the musical for the big screen, as a film against xenophobia and racial prejudice

Filmmaker Steven Spielberg says that he wanted to make a film on the battle against xenophobia and racial prejudice.

That’s the reason he decided to reimagine the musical West Side Story for the big screen.

“West Side Story was actually the first piece of popular music our family ever allowed into the home. I absconded with it —this was the cast album from the 1957 Broadway musical —and just fell completely in love with it as a kid. West Side Story has been that one haunting temptation that I have finally given in to,” Spielberg told Vanity Fair.

The classic New York tale tells the story of two lovers: Maria, a Puerto Rican, whose brother Bernardo is the leader of the “Sharks” street gang and Tony, a former leader of “The Jets”, who battled The Sharks.

Maria will be played by Rachel Zegler, while Baby Driver actor Ansel Elgort will star as Tony. The first looks of the 20th Century Studios distributed film were released recently.

The film, slated to release in December, is both a romance and a crime story. It is a story of street gangs, racism, and violence in the shadows of rising skyscrapers.

“This story is not only a product of its time, but that time has returned, and it’s returned with a kind of social fury,” Spielberg said, adding: “I really wanted to tell that Puerto Rican, Nuyorican experience of basically the migration to this country and the struggle to make a living, and to have children, and to battle against the obstacles of xenophobia and racial prejudice.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/9e1sx1/article31100754.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILM-THEPOST,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/steven-spielberg-west-side-story-was-one-haunting-temptation-i-finally-gave-in-to/article31100755.ece
178,2020/03/18,Kay Kay Menon on playing a RAW officer in Neeraj Pandey’s ‘Special Ops’,"The actor plays Himmat Singh in the recently-released web series, a story on the hunt for a terror mastermind

Tense SUV rides through the subcontinent’s crowded old cities, photographs of dead men who stare back from cork boards in operation rooms, War Room briefings, the hunt for the mastermind... spy dramas are tumbling out of the web series shelf like never before.

The latest to release is Hotstar Special and Friday Storytellers’ Special Ops — the story of a 19-year hunt for the man behind the biggest terror attacks on India — co-directed by Neeraj Pandey and Shivam Nair. The eight-episode series spans 12 countries, six agents and the terrorist behind the 2001 attack on Parliament, the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai and other blasts in Kashmir.

Pandey says for the first time in the history of Indian entertainment, the Parliament attack has been recreated on celluloid, a sequence with a relentless drumbeat of tension with which the web series opened on March 17.

The manhunt is mounted on a large scale and was shot across numerous countries such as Turkey, Azerbaijan, Jordan and India, and is showcased through an ensemble cast, including Kay Kay Menon, Divya Dutta, Vinay Pathak, Karan Tacker, Sajjad Delafrooz, Sana Khaan, Saiyami Kher, Meher Vij, Vipul Gupta and Muzammil Ibrahim.

But the weight of the mission to nail India’s Public Enemy No.1 falls on Himmat Singh, senior analyst and logistics head at the Research and Analysis Wing, portrayed by the lean and dapper Kay Kay Menon. The 53-year-old film, stage and television veteran known for his stellar roles in Sarkar, Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi, Baby, Black Friday and Shaurya, shot close to two months for the web series.

In answer to how he prepared for a role that is lived out in the shadows of the modern world, Menon, in a telephone interview, says, “I invest a lot in the text and discussions with the writer and director as it is ultimately their vision. And then I work within the parameters instead of bringing in external research. What I deliver becomes an intensely distilled product. There are finite roles, but people are infinite. I play the person and not the role. I’m interested in Himmat Singh and not the RAW agent he is. Cinema is to do with people and their inter-relationships on screen.”

Written by Pandey, Deepak Kingrani and Benazir Ali Fida, the storyline is a result of years of research on the ways of Indian intelligence agencies. “As the demographic is different, I did not watch the glut of series on the CIA or KGB. I’m sceptical about meeting people whose work may have inspired the story. I rather have a third person’s point of view. Neeraj has met many of them. I prefer to go with his take, to avoid what I call, mannerism marketing which can be stifling. Unless, it’s a historical plot which calls for some research, I believe all cinema is necessarily fiction,” says Menon.

“Undercover agents are the unsung heroes of our time,” adds Menon. “They appear to lead normal lives but are constantly protecting the nation from threats. Special Ops tries to bring forth the lives of these agents.”

The web series, available in seven languages, follows the now-familiar style of contemporary action thrillers that tells you in which timeline and where in the world the story is unfolding. Menon’s character is situated in India but he deploys a team of remarkably skilled agents, men and women, across the globe. Himmat Singh has brains, brawn and, at most times, a Scout’s moral code but the action is left to the agents on the field.

“I love action because I’m a sportsperson, but my role is one of a serious man at the helm. It comes through my emotional valency. The actor in me had to look at that... although I would’ve loved to jump off a cliff,” says Menon. “I approached the role with positivity. It’s 60 days of my life that’ll never return, so it needs to be engaging. After it’s done, I’m dispassionate about it.”

On having traversed the theatre-television-film format before arriving at the web series door, Menon says, “I don’t act less because its television or more because its cinema. The web series genre lies comfortably in the middle; allows enough time to juice out the character. All tools are sacrosanct; it depends on who is using it. I blank myself as far as the media is concerned. The medium for me is the camera.”

179,2020/03/18,"‘Rajinikanth is an absolute trooper’: Discovery Plus launches in India, headlined by ‘Into The Wild with Bear Grylls’","The infotainment brand enters the OTT streaming space with their new app, curated for the Indian market, with a host of specials

Joining the OTT platform race in the country is now infotainment giant Discovery with the launch of its streaming app Discovery Plus, that will lock horns with the other binge-watching mediums that already exist in India today. The difference? Everything is unscripted.

“We come from a background of providing 25 years of factual entertainment, and our content is hugely valued by our loyal audience. In the recent past, we have also focused on localisation, and now our programs are present in several regional languages as well. While the television network continues to be in demand, why enter the OTT space now? We realised that over 40-odd streaming websites existed, but they all provided only scripted entertainment. At the most, some had a few shows that cater to the unscripted segment, but there was no dedicated platform,” explains Megha Tata, Managing Director – South Asia, Discovery.

The Discovery Plus app has been formulated to allow easy discoverability of content

The app launched earlier this week with an introductory offer of INR 299 per year, and has been curated specifically for India. Offerings include marquee programs from Discovery’s massive library of content such as Bear Grylls (Running Wild with Bear Grylls, Man vs Wild), Josh Gates (Expedition Unknown); kid-friendly shows like Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman, Crikey! It’s The Irwins, Kids Baking Championship; blue-chip documentaries and specials like Racing Extinction, First In Human, India Emerges: A Visual History, and all-time favorites like Body Hack, Say Yes to the Dress, American Chopper, Deadliest Catch and more.

“Our content is replenished every year, and the aim is for it to reach the tier 1 and tier 2 cities as well, where consumption on OTT platforms are increasing too,” adds Megha.

Megha Tata

The Discovery Plus app is instantly pleasing to the eye, and the easy-to-use and accessibility features indicate the level of design and insight that has gone into its making. Says Issac John, Business Head – Digital (South Asia), Discovery, “The app has been formulated to allow discoverability of content, as nobody has the time to go wade through hours of shows. We have features such as ‘#MindBlown’, which is a curated destination featuring learning focused collections of kids-friendly science and wildlife content, and ‘Shorts’ that will feature hundreds of free short-form videos that will satisfy the emerging Indian mobile user looking for infotainment on the go.”

The offerings are spread across 40-plus genres, including Science, Adventure, Food and Lifestyle, in 8 languages including Hindi, English, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Bengali and Marathi. The content will be curated from brands such as Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, BBC, TLC, Discovery Science, Discovery Turbo, ID, Food Network, HGTV, Cooking Channel, Travel Channel, DIY Network, Motortrend and VICE.

Issac John

Issac also says, “We put in about two months of user research, another two-and-half-months to design the architecture, and then another eight solid months of coding before we finalised the app. We also didn’t want the price point to be a barrier for the Indian user, and came up with a figure that is really economical and among the cheapest when we compare it to other platforms.”

The line-up for Discovery Plus’ premium content across all key genres includes their much-anticipated Into the Wild with Rajnikanth, Coronavirus: The Silent Killer, Mythbusters, Wild Karnataka and Project Runway among others.

In fact, Rajinikanth’s TV debut show will be launched first on Discovery Plus at 6:00 am on March 23 much before the television premiere which is at 8:00 pm. Discovery Plus will also have exclusive videos including Behind The Scenes for the Superstar’s fans.

“After the unprecedented response to PM Narendra Modi’s episode with Bear Grylls, we were looking for other big names to participate in this adventure. We had a lot of actors who were interested and approached us, in fact. But then we reached out to Kavithalaya for the opportunity to collaborate with Rajinikanth sir for an episode with Bear Grylls, and once they agreed, it was a no brainer,” smiles Megha.

“Rajinikanth sir agreed to the proposal immediately, and he was as excited as us to make his television debut after 43 years in the industry. What an absolute trooper he was! The episode will speak volumes about his commitment to his craft of entertaining people, and it truly will feature him in a never-before-seen avatar,” they sign off.

Google Pay’s collaboration with Discovery Plus

Discovery Plus is also launching with one-of-a-kind rewards with mobile payments app, Google Pay. Google Pay users who tune-in to the premiere of Into the Wild with Bear Grylls featuring Rajinikanth on March 23 at 8:00 PM on Discovery, can match the audio for the first four minutes of the show or the promos leading up to the show with Google Pay’s ‘On-Air’ feature, and get a reward upto 100% off on Discovery Plus annual subscription price.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kpded8/article31099166.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Into-The-Wild,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/rajinikanth-is-an-absolute-trooper-discovery-plus-launches-in-india-headlined-by-into-the-wild-with-bear-grylls/article31099169.ece
180,2020/03/18,"Sobhita Dhulipala on ‘Made in Heaven’ Season 2, working across industries and ‘Ponniyin Selvan’","The pan-Indian star looks forward to a busy 2020, as she looks to navigate film industries across the country

Has anyone had a better 2019 than Sobhita Dhulipala? The pan-Indian star absolutely owned the web-series space with two big-budget shows — Made in Heaven on Amazon Prime (now renewed for a second season) and Bard of Blood on Netflix — both of which endeared her to audiences, and put her on level pegging with the likes of Radhika Apte as the queen of OTT platforms in India.

She followed that up with a brutally raw act in Geetu Mohandas’ Moothon, and while her role in Jeethu Joseph’s Bollywood outing The Body may not have added much to her repertoire, her performance in Ghost Stories at the beginning of 2020 came for much appreciation.

It gets better; the 26-year-old has also been roped in to star in director Sashi Kiran’s Major, which marks Telugu superstar Mahesh Babu’s debut as producer and is inspired by 26/11 martyr, Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan.

And the icing on the cake: Sobhita will soon join the cast of Mani Ratnam’s magnus opus Ponniyin Selvan, which is based on the classic novel about the life of Raja Raja Chozhan I, by Kalki Krishnamurthy. Though Sobhita’s role in the project hasn’t been revealed yet, she will join the ensemble cast of A-listers that include Vikram, Jayam Ravi, Karthi, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Trisha to name a few.

Talking to The Hindu, here’s the star’s take on how 2020 will pan out for her. Excerpts from an interview:

Was it always your goal to become a pan-Indian actor and balance industries?

I have always been passionate about telling stories and belonging in many worlds; it is my curiosity about human behaviour and situations that guides me in choosing projects. I have clarity that language is a tool, not a medium.

What can you tell us about your role in ‘Ponniyin Selvan’?

Kindly allow me the joy of official announcements? My lips are sealed on this matter for now!

Okay, but do you follow the Tamil movie industry? Any other actors or directors you’d like to work with in the future?

I do, wonderful stories are told in Tamil cinema which is populated with brilliant actors and directors, I would be delighted to work with Vetrimaran, Thiagarajan Kumararaja, Bala, karthik Subbaraj, Ram, Shankar, Sasi Kumar, Ameer Sultan, Gautham Menon... the list goes on!

What will Tara’s arc be like this time around in the second season of ‘Made in Heaven’?

Kalki Koechlin and Sobhita in ‘Made in Heaven’

Can’t let the cat out of the bag yet! Season 2 will be out roughly around the start of 2021, we begin filming in about a month, it’s an exuberant yet sensitively narrated project that has been well-received and the team is motivated to further it with as much effect as eloquence.

Considering you feature heavily in both spaces, is there a difference between working on a web-series for a platform like Netflix/ Prime and shooting for a movie?

I don’t think so, no, my work as an actor remains the same irrespective of the platform. What may be different is perhaps the amount of time that is allotted to detail a character. In my experience, a series allows for silence in it’s screenplay and that often speaks the most: a luxury that film can not afford much.

Since you’re working across industries, how do you internalise or prepare for a character if it’s a film in a language you aren’t fluent in?

It has been a very insightful experience to be able to understand emotions without the attachment of words and then to combine them in expression. This deconstruction has made me much more focused and present; I love the discipline.

I don’t see roles as tough or easy, but consuming and liberating, yes. Most of all, they have been enriching. They make my empathy steeper.

You’re popular on social media for your personality: what do you do outside work? Do you see an alternate career outside films?

I haven’t thought about alternate careers, to be frank, I have been a bookworm since school and indulge in reading a lot, I occasionally write, I enjoy travelling when I can.

I don’t know about popularity, but I do know that I am very much my own person, and wear my heart on my sleeve, no matter how inconvenient… whether on social media or in real life.

A sneak-peek into what 2020 looks like for you?

Sobhita will be seen in ‘Kurup’ with Dulquer Salmaan

I’m currently shooting for a Hindi film Sitara produced by Rsvp, a Hindi-Telugu film Major by the same team as Goodachari being produced by Sony pictures and Mahesh Babu, *the project I won’t/can’t quote* and I will be kickstarting the second season of Made in Heaven.

With the World Health Organisation declaring COVID-19 a pandemic, cinema, OTT and television production the world over have been adversely hit, and the thriving south Indian film industry is no exception. The Tamil and Telugu film industries, which account for a sizeable chunk of box-office revenues annually, have witnessed the postponing of film releases and shooting, with artistes, filmmakers and technicians ensuring caution over commerce.

Theatres are shut, and films will release only after the situation is calmer. Among films that have been directly hit is Mohan Krishna Indraganti’s film V, starring Nani, Sudheer Babu, Nivetha Thomas and Aditi Rao Hydari, which was set to hit the screens on March 25. The makers will now announce have to announce a new release date.

Hemanth Madhukar’s Nishabdham, starring Anushka Shetty and Madhavan is another film that has been pushed. Rana Daggubati’s ambitious jungle adventure, which was to release as Kaadan in Tamil and Aranya in Telugu was scheduled to open on April 2. The film, which also had a Hindi version titled Haathi Mere Saathi, now stands postponed indefinitely.

Shooting schedules have been badly hit, too. Naga Chaitanya’s Love Story as well as his father Nagarjuna’s Wild Dogs are both said to be put on hold.

A major shoot that has been cancelled for now is the Baahubali franchise director SS Rajamouli’s next biggie, RRR. The ambitious film stars Ram Charan and Jr. NTR with Bollywood stars Alia Bhatt and Ajay Devgn. Irish actors Ray Stevenson and Alison Doody also feature in prominent roles in the film. The film might not release in January 2021, as was being said.

Films that were already released have also suffered. In Tamil Nadu, Harish Kalyan’s Dharala Prabhu, which released last Friday, will be re-released when the theatres reopen. The actor took to social media to pen an emotional note thanking audience for the love and support given to his film, which managed to get a theatrical run of only a few days.

The Tamil industry is indeed concerned because the weeks ahead had a big line-up for the fans featuring several superstars. These include Vijay’s Master, Suriya’s Soorarai Pottru, Dhanush’s Jagame Thandhiram, which were set to release in April. These films will now have to settle for fresh release date.

183,2020/03/18,Alagiri slams ex-CJI's nomination to Rajya Sabha,"“If the BJP provides such post retirement posts to judges, it raises the fear of courts losing their uniqueness, ” he said

Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri slammed the ruling BJP at the Centre over the nomination of former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi to the Rajya Sabha, terming it as a very big attack on the judiciary and an unforgivable crime for shaking the foundations of the Constitution.

In a statement, Mr. Alagiri said it was a long-standing tradition that Supreme Court judges should not accept any post for two years after their retirement. But this tradition has been demolished by the appointment of Justice (retd) Gogoi to the Rajya Sabha and also referred to late BJP leader Arun Jaitley’s views on such appointments.

Referring to the cases presided over by Justice Gogoi, such as the Rafale deal, the Ram Mandir case, overseeing the National Register of Citizens in Assam, the case relating to the abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir, Mr. Alagiri said the judgements in these cases saved the BJP from various dangers.

He also pointed to various arguments being put forth by the BJP about appointment of judges to different posts and said those judges had taken up positions only after three years or more after retirement.

“If the BJP provides such post retirement posts to judges, it raises the fear of courts losing their uniqueness.”

Mr. Alagiri demanded that Justice Gogoi must reconsider his decision to take up the Rajya Sabha post, as there are widespread protests against to nominate him. “If he doesn’t do so, he will be responsible for criticism that he has brought disrepute to the independence of the judiciary,” Mr. Alagiri said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/alagiri-slams-ex-cjis-nomination-to-rajya-sabha/article31101478.ece

Tamil Nadu recorded its second positive case of coronavirus disease, COVID-19, on March 18. A 20-year-old youth, who had travelled from Delhi to Chennai in a train, tested positive for COVID-19 and is already in the isolation ward of Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH).

Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar, in a tweet, said the patient was in isolation and his condition was stable. He is under the observation of an expert team.

Health officials said the youth was a resident of Uttar Pradesh and worked in a salon. He had reached Chennai on March 12. He was staying with a friend in the city and was in search of a job.

He approached the RGGGH on March 16 with symptoms of fever, cough and sore throat and was admitted to the isolation ward. His nasal, throat swabs and blood samples were lifted and sent for testing to the King Institute of Preventive Medicine, Guindy.

The department is now tracing all persons with whom he had come in contact with. The government will also reach out to the Delhi government to trace his contact history there.

186,2020/03/18,"COVID-19: Increase testing in Tamil Nadu, says Ramadoss","The PMK founder urged the State government to test all those exhibiting symptoms for the virus

PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Wednesday urged the State Government to intensify community testing as per the World Health Organisation’s recommendations. In a series of social media posts, he said that WHO has recommended increased testing for all those who exhibit COVID-19 symptoms.

“Test, test, test. Test every suspected case. This is the recommendation of WHO. The recommendation should be taken seriously by the State Government and tests should be intensified,” he said.

Dr. Ramadoss said that COVID-19 tests and screenings are being done only to those who are coming into Tamil Nadu from foreign countries at the airport. “The testing and screening should be extended to those inside Tamil Nadu and exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms. Employees of Chennai Airport and Ports should also be tested,” he said.

He recommended the shutting down of weekend markets and government offices where large number of people congregate to prevent the spread of the virus. “While schools and colleges have been shut, the teachers and other employees have been asked to report to work. This will not help in preventing the spread of the disease.

187,2020/03/18,"COVID-19: Work from home, a difficult strategy for non-IT companies to adopt","In sectors such as manufacturing, it will be difficult to adopt a work from home policy, experts said

The work from home strategy is well established in the IT sector, but it won’t be easy to adopt for the manufacturing sector in the wake of COVID- 19, due to various infrastructure bottlenecks, experts say.

“In case of non-IT sectors most of the employees work on desktops and organisations have not provided laptops. The tools used to perform business operations are not accessible from outside the network without VPN access,” Sunil C., Head – Specialized Staffing, TeamLease Digital, said.

Aditya Narayan Mishra , CEO of staffing firm CIEL HR Services, said that in terms of manufacturing, only a few support functions like Human Resources, Finance and Planning can be provided with the work from home option. However, he said most firms won’t have the infrastructure in place to opt for it immediately.

“Work from home is not an evolved model and organisations do not have monitoring IT tools. Since the concept is not widely practiced in non-IT sectors, the change may take some time. Managers should trust employees and not call them frequently to check on them,” Mr. Sunil said. Mr. Mishra points out that some companies are worried about performance-related issues and how they can tackle them.

K. Vaitheeswaran, advocate and tax consultant, said that while bigger companies and technology-driven companies operate on their own IT platforms which enables work from home, it is not the same for other companies. “This would mean that the employee would be given access to documents and records of the company through storage media or shared emails or would be provided physical copies. Even in the first case, while the employee would be logging in to the network of the company, the employee would be using systems at his/her residence which may not have the same degree of protection and security,” he noted.

Mr. Vaitheeswaran said companies should ensure that matters of secrecy or significant confidentiality are not the subject matter of a work from home policy, and confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements should be put in place and executed with the employees.

K.E. Raghunathan , past president, All India Manufacturer’s Organisation said the new-age concept of work from home is hugely irrelevant for the micro, small and medium enterprises ector, which is already reeling under various other challenges in the last three years due to measures like demonetisation, GST implementation and general economic slowdown.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/2na8d/article31098240.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18MARTH-WORK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/covid-19-work-from-home-a-difficult-strategy-for-non-it-companies-to-adopt/article31098241.ece

Scores of students pursuing teacher education courses in 56 institutions in the State are facing the danger of their studies getting disrupted, with the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) withdrawing recognition to the institutions.

The withdrawal will come into effect from the next academic season, according to the minutes of the meetings of the Southern Regional Committee of the NCTE, held in January and February.

While most of the 56 institutions are private, the Department of Physical Education at Bharathiar University, which is offering D.P.Ed course, has also not been spared. Though it is not yet known how many students will be affected, a senior official of the Tamil Nadu Teachers Education University, to which most of the institutions are affiliated, says that on an average, the intake of each institution is 100, with two units of 50 students. Totally, 719 institutions in the State are offering courses in teacher education.

When his reaction was sought, Higher Education Minister K.P. Anbalagan said the total number of affected students may not be of the order of 5,000.

However, if the institutions submit “rectification reports” to the NCTE, withdrawal of recognition would be revoked, the Minister said.

Another official said the action was taken only after seeking an explanation from the institution. “The committee takes a decision only after scrutinising the response of each institution,” he claimed, adding that actions are based on the NCTE (Recognition Norms and Procedure) Regulations of November 2014.

In its meeting on March 3, the Southern Regional Committee of the NCTE decided to reject a request made by the Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, Tirunelveli, for grant of retrospective recognition to its pre-school teacher education course.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/56-teacher-training-institutes-in-tn-lose-recognition/article31094110.ece

“There is no need to fear. I also went to the hospital for a test, and you can also get it done. The State has a population of eight crore, and only one person has tested positive for COVID-19 (since discharged). Diseases are natural, and no one can prevent them.

Secretary in the Chief Minister’s Office Smita Sabharwal on Wednesday inspected the ongoing works of Baswapur reservoir, under package 16 of Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Scheme (KLIS) here, and instructed officials to speed up works.

Along with District Collector Anita Ramachandran and irrigation officials, she was on the field to inspect the regulator and embankment works that are under progress. Ms. Sabharwal also held a review with officials from the Irrigation Department and contractors of the reservoir at the Baswapur camp office.

“The deadline is next June/July and the aim is to fill 1.5 tmcft water in the reservoir,” she told them, stressing that works should gain pace.

In that direction, the Secretary also instructed that land acquisition at Baswapur, Wadaparthy and Thimmapur villages surrounding the reservoir should resume, and the required fund allotment was being released.

The capacity of Baswapur reservoir as per the plan is 11.38 tmcft, and along with Gandhamalla reservoir’s 9.87 tmcft capacity, the scheme will supply irrigation to a total 2,51,800 acres.

203,2020/03/18,Ranganayakasagar to receive Godavari water soon,"Annapurna reservoir to fill the 3 tmcft capacity project designed to irrigate about 1.1 lakh acres of land

The Ranganayakasagar balancing reservoir, constructed on the outskirts of the district headquarters, is all set to welcome the Godavari water from Annapurna (Anantagiri) reservoir. For the first time, the Godavari water has reached Siddipet area promising a bright future for the farming community in the district.

Godavari water from Kaleswaram has reached Annapurna from Mid-Manair. From here, the water would be released to Ranganayakasagar reservoir. Already test run was conducted for two motors at Annapurna reservoir and the remaining would be completed in the next few days.

The Ranganayakasagar reservoir, completed at an estimated cost of ₹ 4,000 crore with 3 tmcft capacity, is designed to irrigate about 1.1 lakh acres. Here, the water would be lifted to 120 metres height. In addition to providing water for irrigation from Right and Left canals, about 50 tmcft water would be pumped to Mallannasagar reservoir from here. The full reservoir level (FRL) will be 490 metres and serve the needs of drought-prone areas in both the districts of Siddipet (three constituencies – Husnabad, Jangaon and and Siddipet constituencies) and Sircilla (Manakondur and Sircilla constituencies).

About 2,700 acres were acquired for the construction of the reservoir and there was no submergence of any village except acquiring farm land. The length of the ‘U’ shaped bund is 8.65 kilometres and at 7.7 kilometre point head regulator was constructed to pump water to Mallannasagar through four pumps.

The right main canal (RMC) will discharge 309 cusecs water and irrigate about 40,000 acres followed by left main canal (LMC), which will discharge 512.062 cusecs and irrigate 70,000 acres. Here, the surge pool has a capacity to retain as much as 1 tmcft water. About 65 tanks will be filled from this reservoir.

From Ranganayakasagar the water would flow 18.5 kilometres (16 kilometres tunnel and 2.5 kilometres open canal) and reach Mallannasagar after water is pumped through four pumps.

“The construction, establishment of sub-station, and control centre are complete and ready for inauguration. A guest house is also coming up and completed. Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao would release water from Ranganayakasagar on March 25, Ugadi,” said an official.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/qjsbr0/article31101607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY16RANGNAISAGR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ranganayakasagar-to-receive-godavari-water-soon/article31101608.ece
204,2020/03/18,Sixth COVID-19 case in TS is a foreign returnee,"Youngster reached Hyderabad from Scotland on Mar. 16

The sixth case of COVID-19 was detected in Telangana on Wednesday. The patient is a 21-year-old youngster who returned to Hyderabad from Scotland in the early hours of March 16. He spent the entire day at home with three family members and developed cough, fever the next day. The youth got admitted to Gandhi Hospital on Tuesday. The State Health staff are trying to track all people he came into contact with.

Of the six cases from the State, the index (first) case was discharged last week. The remaining five patients are undergoing treatment at Gandhi Hospital. Telangana Health Minister Eatala Rajender said that no one among the current patients have health complications such as pneumonia or multi organ failure.

The second patient is a 24-year-old woman who returned from Italy, third is a 48-year-old man who has travel history to the Netherlands, fourth is a man in mid 40s who returned from Scotland and fifth is a 58-year-old Indonesian.

The case of the fifth patient is a matter of great concern. The Indonesian is a preacher and he travelled with a team of nine people, all from his country for preaching. He got on to the AP Sampark Kranti Express (Train No. 12708) on March 13 (7.15 a.m.) and reached Ramagundem at 5.10 a.m. on March 14. A total of 82 people travelled in the non-air conditioned sleeper coach including him.

Informed Railway sources said that the COVID-19 patient already had flu symptoms when he got into train, which seem to have only worsened after he reached Karimnagar by road from Ramagundem. Mr Rajender said the patient stayed in a mosque in the town for two days . He was confirmed COVID-19 positive on Tuesday. Mr Rajender said that test results of samples collected from the remaining nine Indonesians were awaited.

The Health Minister said passengers in the coach who had travelled more than 1,400 km with the Indonesian team have been identified. The health staff is tracking people from Telangana and they will be isolated soon. “We have identified the people they had food with. The district Collector and Police Commissioner had a meeting with Health department officials. They are taking measures according to the protocol,” said Mr Rajender.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/sixth-covid-19-case-in-ts-is-a-foreign-returnee/article31101507.ece
205,2020/03/18,Coronavirus | Parents of stranded students in Italy seek govt. help,"Students not allowed to travel back to India

Family members of students stranded in Italy have appealed to the State and Central governments to make arrangements to bring them back to India.

Parents, grandparents and close relatives of students who went for higher education to Italy conveyed their distress as the students were not being allowed to travel back from Italy which registered high number of coronavirus cases.

Addressing a media conference here on Wednesday, Shabari Sireesha’s father Upendra, Nerella Sushma’s grandparent Gurucharan, Sridevi and other family members of stranded students with anxiety and despair writ large on their faces said that their children were left helpless at the airport in Italy.

The students who finished their courses and reached airport in Italy on March 11 to return to India were not being allowed to leave the country.

The students who already vacated their hostel rooms in Italy had no other accommodation to go back to and as a result they were literally waiting on the roads to get back to their country, they lamented.

There was none to come to the rescue of Indian students waiting at the airport for the last eight days, family members said. They urged the Central and State governments to bring their children back from Italy on humanitarian grounds and authorities could quarantine the students in India as long as the government decided.

The family members also said they had already met Health Minister Eatela Rajender and expressed their anguish.

The Italian authorities have already collected blood samples of their children twice but keeping them in the airport itself without giving any test reports.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/parents-of-stranded-students-in-italy-seek-govt-help/article31101181.ece
206,2020/03/18,Coronavirus: Adilabad district’s quick response to threat from Maharashtra,"With three postive cases in Yavatmal district and frequent cross-border movement, the threat is real; Adilabad District Collector rules out sealing border as people are being screened thoroughly

With the threat of COVID-19 entering Telangana from neighbouring Yavatmal district in Maharashtra following detection of three COVID-19 positive cases in that town, the Adilabad district administration has initiated a quick response. The three positives belong to villages and towns with which people from Adilabad have a regular contact.

For example, the three COVID-19 affected with a travel history to Dubai last month are pesticide traders belonging to Kurli, Mohda and Yavatmal district headquarter also moving in Pandharkawda taluk. Farmers from almost all bordering villages along the Penganga river regularly visit these places and the traders are assumed to have come in contact with at least some farmers from this side of the border during the period between their return from Dubai on March 1, and before they became COVID-19 suspects on March 9.

District Collectors’ collective

“We are in touch with Collectors of Nanded, Yavatmal and Chandrapur districts which share part of their borders with our district. They are screening people thoroughly in their respective districts which rules out sealing our borders, an option that was being assessed,” revealed Adilabad Collector A. Sridevasena.

In fact, a check post has been set up at the local railway station and another at the Pipparwada toll plaza, about 15 km from Adilabad town and some four km inside the inter-State border on NH 44. “The teams manning these round-the-clock posts will just sensitise people coming in from across the border,” disclosed Ms. Sridevasena of the arrangements made to counter the threat.

House to house visit

“There are other teams comprising the concerned Village Revenue Officer, ANM or ASHA worker and Panchayat Secretary which will visit every house in all the villages on our side of the border. These teams will create awareness on the issue and impress upon people that the spread of the virus can be contained with their participation,” the Collector added.

Though the government has not issued a standard operating procedure on surveillance and other activities to contain the COVID-19 import from across the border, the district administration is banking on vigilance and education of people. “Availability of personnel at check posts and in villages will help in vigilance and educating the people,” Ms. Sridevasena observed.

Tabs sought

“Many of our people from villages like Kamai, Akoli, Pedalwada, Mandagada and Bhoraj, to name a few, visit Yavatmal for medicare facilities there. The government should keep tabs on such people who form the high risk category,” suggested B. Sanjiv Reddy, former sarpanch of Kamai.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/te60fa/article31105531.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY19ADB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/adilabads-quick-response-to-threat-from-maharashtra/article31099471.ece
207,2020/03/18,COVID-19: Devotees being screened with thermal guns before entry into Vemulawada Temple,"Dharmagundam (holy tank) where devotees take a holy dip before offering prayers closed; district authorities mulling Ramanavami celebrations keeping devotees away

In a bid to check the spread of COVID-19 following the arrival of thousands of devotees at the Sri Raja Rajeshwara Swamy Devasthanam in Vemulawada, devasthanam authorities have started screening them with thermal guns.

The Devasthanam staff and Special Protection Force (SPF) police wielding thermal guns have been deployed at the shrine at various locations to screen the pilgrims and check their for fever symptoms. Besides, the Devasthanam authorities have also intensified their sanitation drive, and making audio announcements informing the devotees to wear masks or cover their face with towels, etc.

A first

Moreover, for the first time, the authorities have closed the dharmagundam (holy tank) where devotees take a holy dip before offering prayers. Devotees were informed to bathe instead in the cottages.

Responding to a news item “Undeterred by COVID-19, pilgrims throng Vemulawada” published in these columns on Tuesday, Collector D. Krishna Bhaskar had instructed the temple authorities to screen the devotees and intensify sanitation works. He also instructed the devasthanam authorities to ensure that all the temple staff wear masks. Shop-keepers in and around the temple shrine too have started wearing the masks to avoid spread of COVID-19.

Sanitation drive

According to official sources, suspects identified by the thermal scanners of suffering from fever would be barred from entering the temple. Instead, they would be directly sent to the isolation ward at the District Headquarters Hospital in Sircilla textile town, they added.

However, as the pilgrim rush had dwindled from Tuesday, it has enabled the staff to sanitise the queue lines to check the spread of COVID-19. Temple authorities were expecting a heavy rush of pilgrims from Sunday for the auspicious Monday pujas, and the ensuing Ugadi festival on Wednesday.

Sans EO, authorities concerned

For the annual Sri Ramanavami celebrations at the shrine where around two lakh devotees would normally throng to witness the celestial wedding, temple authorities said the district authorities have mooted the idea of conducting the celebrations this time without devotees to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Incidentally, there is no temple Executive Officer (EO) during this crucial period. Presently, Endowments Vigilance Officer Krishnaveni is acting as in-charge EO of Vemulawada and she is on leave for a week causing concern among the devasthanam authorities.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/devotees-at-vemulawada-temple-being-screened-using-thermal-guns/article31099021.ece

213,2020/03/18,Army finds ‘war-like stores’ in jungle of poll-bound BTC,"Cache of arms recovered from Chirang Reserve Forest belonged to an unspecified faction of the now-disbanded NDFB, say Army officials

Soldiers of the Army’s Red Horns Division on Tuesday found “war-like stores” comprising assault rifles and grenades in a jungle in the poll-bound Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) area.

Army officials said the cache of arms recovered from the Chirang Reserve Forest belonged to an unspecified faction of the now-disbanded National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB). Four factions of the NDFB had signed a peace accord with the Centre in January.

The weapons include 12 assorted rifles, an AK-56 assault rifle, 10 pistols, a grenade launcher, 20 grenades, material to make improvised explosive devices, a satellite phone, assorted magazines and 414 rounds of assorted ammunition.

“A process is on to hand over the recovered items to the Bishmuri police station closest to the reserve forest,” an Army spokesperson said.

Army officials attributed the recovery to intelligence inputs, but it is believed that a rival faction of NDFB led the security forces to the weapons hidden in the jungle about 170 km northwest of Guwahati.

BTC elections

The recovery assumes significance because of the BTC elections scheduled on April 4. The elections have had a history of violence because of intense rivalry between political parties allegedly backed by extremist groups. The BTC areas have also been prone to communal and ethnic clashes.

A few NDFB leaders have filed nominations for the elections across 40 seats. They include B. Saoraigwra, who joined the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) that has been ruling BTC since 2003, and Gobinda Basumatary, who joined the rival United People’s Party Liberal.

Mr Saoraigwra was the head of the NDFB (S) faction, while Mr. Basumatary had headed the NDFB (Progressive).

Many BPF leaders, including BTC chairman Hagrama Mohilary, were members of the Bodo Liberation Tigers, an extremist group that was disbanded in 2003.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/army-finds-war-like-stores-in-jungle-of-poll-bound-btc/article31099160.ece
214,2020/03/18,Lucknow banners: Allahabad HC grants govt time till April 10 to file report,"The Allahabad High Court recently directed removal of ‘name and shame’ hoardings of those arrested in protests against CAA

The Allahabad High Court has granted the Uttar Pradesh government time till April 10 to file a compliance report in the ‘name and shame’ hoardings case.

Terming it an “unwarranted interference in privacy” of people and a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution, the High Court recently directed the Lucknow administration to forthwith remove the controversial ‘name and shame’ roadside hoardings of those arrested during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act last December.

The court had also asked the District Magistrate Lucknow to submit a compliance report by March 16 and directed the government to not place such banners on roads, containing the personal data of individuals, without having authority of law.

The government, however, sought more time citing the pendency of a Special Leave Petition (SLP) filed by it against the order in the Supreme Court. It also did not remove the hoardings.

The District Magistrate of Lucknow filed an application seeking extension of time for compliance of the order.

Advocate General of U.P. submitted that in light of pendency of the SLP before the Supreme Court, it would be appropriate to have compliance report after disposal of the SLP.

215,2020/03/18,Defence Ministry denies rumours of member on DIAT campus having contracted COVID-19,"Information circulating in social media is “false” and “hearsay,” it says.

With rumours flying thick and fast in the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, defence authorities on Wednesday said that information circulating in social media about a member on the campus housing the Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT) — the country’s deemed university specialising in the training of officers of Indian Armed forces and paramilitary forces — allegedly having been afflicted by coronavirus was “false” and “hearsay”.

The DIAT, which was bifurcated to form the Military Institute of Technology (MILIT), is at Pune’s verdant Girinagar locality next to the Khadakwasla Dam and is close to another premier defence training institution, the National Defence Academy (NDA).

“Information in social media about a member of MILIT/DIAT campus having been affected by coronavirus is false and hearsay. No symptoms associated with coronavirus have been detected in any personnel of MILIT/DIAT. All necessary arrangements are in place to regulate screening of individuals reporting with cough, cold and fever in conjunction with medical authority,” read a release issued by the Ministry of Defence.

Meanwhile, as a precautionary measure, authorities have cancelled all educational tours and outdoor hikes scheduled for the cadets of the NDA till further orders while visitors, be they parents of the cadets or the general populace, would not be permitted entry on the campus.

“All cadets and personnel in the National Defence Academy are being briefed, sensitised about the causes and symptoms of NCOV-19 by Commanding Officer of Military Hospital. They are also being advised to ensure personal hygiene at individual level. All large public gatherings, celebrations, mass activities, visit to crowded places, guest lectures, movies have been suspended till further orders,” said the MoD release.

It further said that the cadets have been told to refrain from visiting crowded places while all non-essential mass gatherings had been suspended.

“The cadets are being closely monitored for any symptoms of COVID-19 by their divisional officers, seniors, and civilian instructors. Any person showing signs of flu, cough, cold is advised to report immediately and is to be screened and treated separately. In case of doubt they will be shifted to AFMS hospital.

216,2020/03/18,‘Rebel Cong. MLAs under duress’,"The lawmakers did not appear to attest resignations, says Speaker Prajapati

Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha Speaker N.P. Prajapati on Tuesday informed Governor Lalji Tandon that the 16 Congress MLAs in Bengaluru had written their resignations under duress, as neither they nor their family members had appeared before him during submissions.

“If the resignation letters were presented willingly, then wouldn’t have their family members, acquaintances or their workers been present? This confirms the apprehension that surely the letters have been written under pressure,” Mr Prajapati wrote to Mr. Tandon. “Isn’t this apparently a violation of the fundamental Right to Freedom under the Constitution?

As for the MLAs, pledging allegiance to Jyotiraditya Scindia who had switched over to the BJP, releasing videos on social media and holding press conferences to reassert they were in Bengaluru of their own accord, Mr. Prajapati asked: “Like other politicians of the State, are they giving statements before the press willingly in an independent atmosphere without fear?”

The Speaker had served notice on 22 rebel MLAs asking them to appear before him to attest their resignations that had been submitted by BJP leaders. So far, Mr. Prajapati has accepted resignations of six MLAs, who were removed as Ministers, claiming they were not fit to be members as they failed to appear on two occasions.

Mr. Prajapati wrote to the Governor that despite directions to them under Rule 276-1(B) relating to the functioning of the Vidhan Sabha to appear before the Speaker, they had failed to appear. And even during the session on March 16, they remained absent.

“Family members of some of them have even expressed concern over their security,” he wrote, “As the presiding Speaker of the Vidhan Sabha, I am extremely worried about these members going missing.”

‘Pressure from officials’

Meanwhile, the BJP accused the Congress government of “pressing, threatening and luring” families of rebels using government officials.

Party vice-president and former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, “We are preparing a list of such officials, and want to make it clear they won’t be spared.

“It would be wise for them to stick to their administrative roles, and not immorally interfere in politics.”

Leader of the Opposition in the Bihar Assembly and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav on Wednesday said that in view of the Coronavirus threat he has postponed his ongoing Berojgari Hatao (remove unemployment) yatra till March 25.

He also released a toll free number for those who wish to be a part of his yatra.

Slamming the NDA government in Bihar led by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar while addressing mediapersons in Patna, the RJD leader posed 18 questions before it.

“Why IT (Information Technology) companies and Special Economic Zone (SEZ) could not be created in the State in last 15 years regime of the present government,” asked Mr. Yadav.

Among the questions were: Why Food Processing Units could not be established in the State?; why Bihar could not provide suitable atmosphere to fishermen to increase fish production and why industry specific clusters are not being created?

“The government should also answer why dairy-related big industries are not being set up in the State?; why Bihar could not be developed as a tourist place despite huge potential in the sector?; why lakhs of vacant posts in government jobs are not being filled and why recruitments are not being transparent,” asked Mr. Yadav.

He further asked “why small scale industries are not being set up in the State in last 15 years?”.

Currently, Mr. Yadav is on Berojagari Yatra across the State and has been attacking Mr. Kumar’s government on several issues in every public meeting in the districts.

Meanwhile, the late night meeting of former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi and Mr. Kumar on Tuesday has fuelled speculation of a new political alliance. Mr. Manjhi met with his party — Hindustani Awam Morcha-Secular — leaders at his residence on Wednesday to mull over his new strategy. However, party leaders said he met Mr. Kumar on Tuesday night to discuss some inaugurations in his constituency and issues related to his security.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/z2siz3/article23308965.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TEJASWI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/covid-19-rjd-leader-tejashwi-yadav-postpones-yatra-till-march-25/article31097886.ece

This was in response to Mr. Prajapati’s letter on Tuesday, flagging the security of the MLAs.

The Governor wrote in the letter: “You and I are continuously receiving letters from the allegedly missing MLAs. In any of the letters, wherever they are now, they have not stated any problem...”

Mr. Tandon reminded the Speaker that the responsibility for the security of all citizens in a State rests with the executive, and not with him. “So, your letter seems to have been forwarded to me by mistake.”

Mr. Prajapati informed the Governor that the MLAs had written their resignation letters under duress because neither they nor their families appeared before him when the letters were handed in. “Had the letters been presented willingly, wouldn’t have their family members, acquaintances or workers been present? This confirms the apprehension that the letters have been written under pressure,” he wrote. “Isn’t this a violation of the fundamental Right to Freedom under the Constitution?”

Responding to the questions, Mr. Tandon wrote, “The expectation of answers must certainly be under some rules, and you must have perused them. Kindly take the trouble of forwarding me the rules concerned.”

The election agent of BJP Rajya Sabha nominee Sumer Singh Solanki on Wednesday requested the Chief Election Commissioner to act against Congress nominee Digvijaya Singh for allegedly violating the model code of conduct by trying to meet the 16 Congress MLAs in Bengaluru.

219,2020/03/18,"Bengal BJP chief says no harm in drinking cow urine, party MP contradicts","Mahila Morcha president of BJP’s Bengal unit and Lok Sabha member Locket Chatterjee said such “unscientific beliefs” should be shunned

West Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh on Tuesday said there is no harm in drinking cow urine and he has no qualms in admitting he consumes it but party MP Locket Chatterjee sought to differ, terming this an “unscientific belief” that should be shunned.

A cow urine-consumption programme was organised in north Kolkata on Monday out of the belief that it will protect people from coronavirus or cure them in case they have already been infected. At the programme held at a cowshed at the Jorasanko area, many consumed cups of cow urine.

A civic volunteer who was seen consuming urine filed a police complaint on Tuesday against the organisers alleging them of fooling him to drink cow urine as “chanramrit” (prasad).

In his reaction, Ghosh said he supported consumption of cow urine, adding there is no harm in it.

“There is no harm in consumption of urine. For ages, people in our country has consumed urine, all of them have been fit and fine. I have no qualm in accepting that I consume cow urine and will again do so. I am not an opportunist,” he said.

However, Mahila Morcha president of BJP’s Bengal unit and Lok Sabha member Locket Chatterjee said such “unscientific beliefs” should be shunned. “When science has made so much progress, we should shun such unscientific beliefs as it would in no way help us in combating this pandemic. It would rather create more confusion,” she said.

The claim that consumption of cow urine can cure coronavirus drew sharp criticism from the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and opposition Congress too.

“This is completely unscientific and absurd. When scientists across the world are working to fight this virus, such claims are not only shameful but are also a crime. I would urge everyone not to fall into such a trap,” state Parliamentary Affairs Minister Partha Chatterjee said.

Congress’s chief whip in the state Assembly Manoj Chakraborty said because of BJP’s “obsession” with cow such “superstitions have spread in the society”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5wmp77/article31070515.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14COW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bengal-bjp-chief-says-no-harm-in-drinking-cow-urine/article31097177.ece

In the wake of the rising COVID-19 cases, the Maharashtra government has cracked down on the illegal sale of masks and hand sanitisers, and seized goods worth ₹21 lakh.

State Minister for Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) Rajendra Shingne carried out multiple raids across the city on Wednesday along with his staff, and identified pharmacies and medical shops hoarding sanitisers or selling them at more than the maximum retail price (MRP).

Watch | Coronavirus: Can masks protect you?

A senior official of the department said, “In the last seven days, we have taken action at 21 locations across the State. We have found people who have been bringing poor quality hand sanitisers from Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh and selling them in Mumbai and Pune. Goods worth a total of ₹21 lakh have been seized.”

Senior officials said hoarding of hand sanitisers and face masks is prohibited as the items have been notified under the Essential Commodities Act. The Maharashtra government has put masks and hand sanitisers under Essential Commodities Act (ECA) up to June 30, 2020 to ensure proper availability of these items in market at correct price in view of the outbreak.

FDA officials said they received information about widespread hoarding taking place at some locations and carried out searches on Tuesday and Wednesday. The raids were conducted under the statutory rules and regulations that prohibit hoarding and illegal sale of essential commodities.

The Minister made surprise checks at two pharmacies in Colaba and also inspected shops outside Bombay Hospital and the Medical Research Centre in Marine Lines. Mr. Shingne warned shopkeepers against hoarding sanitisers and masks and informed them that the number of complaints about illegal sale of the items has been growing. He conducted his final inspection at Worli, where he went through the billing records at two shops.

Mr. Shingne said, “We have recovered fake masks and sanitisers from locations in Pune and Mumbai. I will continue to inspect these locations and ensure that in times of crisis, citizens are able to access essential commodities.” He also said the FDA is looking into medicines sold at pharmacies that claim to counter COVID-19.

In Aurangabad, FDA officials caught owners of pharmacies replacing the expiry date labels on hand sanitiser bottles to profit from panic buying during the outbreak.

There have been complaints of surgical masks being sold at rates 20 times above the MRP in Mumbai and Pune. In its notification last week, the FDA had declared sanitisers, surgical masks and N95 masks as essential commodities and warned of action against people hoarding these articles.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/fom5xn/article31102282.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BMHand-sanitisers,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maharashtra-govt-raids-pharmacies-selling-hand-sanitisers-above-mrp/article31097020.ece

222,2020/03/18,Bengal dairy farmer’s sale of cow urine as COVID-19 medicine sparks political debate,"State BJP president Dilip Ghosh questions the police’s justification in apprehending the man

The arrest of a Muslim dairy farmer in West Bengal’s Hooghly district for selling cow urine and dung as an antidote to COVID-19 has sparked a political row, with the State BJP president Dilip Ghosh questioning the police’s justification in apprehending the man.

Police on Tuesday arrested Mamud Ali, alias Sheikh Mamud, in Hooghly district’s Dankuni, about 25 km from Kolkata, for attempting to “outrage religious feelings” and booked him under Sections 295A and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.

He was also slapped with a charge under the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954. “He is arrested and his objective is now being investigated, ” a senior official of the district police, Humayun Kabir, told reporters.

Mr. Ali is reported to have been inspired to set up a stall to sell the bovine excreta after watching television footage that featured a Hindu Mahasabha leader talking about the efficacy of cow urine and dung as a “medicine” for dealing with the latest worldwide coronavirus outbreak.

The dairy farmer, who reportedly owns two cows, told local journalists that he now regretted his decision to sell the bovine excreta, given the trouble he had landed himself in.

“I realised I can make more profit by selling cow urine and dung. Now, I can utilise every part of cows in my business,” Indo-Asian News Service quoted Mr. Ali as having said. Mr. Ali was selling cow urine and dung at about ₹300-500, according to the police.

The police action against Mr. Ali drew flak from the BJP’s Mr. Ghosh, who said that distributing cow urine was not a crime.

“Many consume cow urine but do not confess in public, they have a habit of consuming cow excreta with other milk products secretly. I myself have consumed cow urine many times and will keep consuming it for its health benefits,” said Mr. Ghosh, who is also the BJP’s Lok Sabha MP from Midnapore. Another party leader Sayantan Basu said: “It has not been proved or disproved that cow urine is bad… so what is the problem”.

224,2020/03/18,COVID-19: Odisha teachers wary of NPR survey,"The fear of coming in contact with diverse sections of people during the survey has increased their anxiety

Amid COVID-19 scare, teachers in Odisha are reluctant to participate in house listing and updation of National Population Register (NPR), scheduled to be taken up between April and September.

During the 45-day survey, more than 1.5 lakh teachers will be deployed to collect data on 31 different questions regarding house-listing and housing census, a precursor to the population enumeration exercise of the main census in 2021.

Although schools are closed till April 15 and teachers are off the duty in the State, the fear of coming in contact with diverse sections of people during the survey has increased their anxiety.

“We have already seized of the matter. The issue is being discussed in our association. We cannot dishonour official direction if asked to participate in the survey. But question arises as to who will come forward to share information when we knock their door during survey,” said Rajendra Prasad Rout, senior zonal member of Lower Secondary Teachers’ Association of Kendrapara.

Many teachers on condition of anonymity said that when there was acute shortage of masks and sanitisers to take care of personal hygiene, it was difficult to risk one’s life during the survey in April and May when the coronavirus outbreak was expected to peak then.

Appeal to govt.

Prakash Chandra Jena, general secretary, All Odisha Lower Secondary Teachers’ Association, said, “Under the Right to Education Act, teachers cannot say no to their deployment in census and election duty. We are preparing a memorandum for requesting the government to postpone the survey. Teachers will have no problem in taking up the survey if the government announces that the society is safe from coronavirus.”

When asked, Premananda Khuntia, Director of Census Operations and Director of Citizen Registration, Odisha, said, “There are around 3.5 lakh teachers in Odisha. We are going to engage 1.5 lakh teachers, who are tech savvy, because the survey work will be done in mobile application. At this moment, we are not in a position to give any concrete assurance. The State government will come up with another notification for survey.”

“This is a national phenomenon. We are waiting for a direction from the Centre as we are in an evolving crisis,” Mr. Khuntia said. Meanwhile, three of 30 district administrations have stopped training for the house-listing and NPR updation in the light of coronavirus scare.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/7jl2pt/article31094809.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ODISHA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/covid-19-odisha-teachers-wary-of-npr-survey/article31094810.ece

Severe restrictions in the wake of the COVID-19 epidemic forced the cancellation of the famous Chaitra Jatra festival at Tara Tarini hill shrine in Odisha’s Ganjam district on Tuesday.

The foot hill as well as the temple at the hill top, that sees a congregation of around 1.5 lakh devotees for the festival, wore a deserted look throughout the day. Except for servitors and police personnel, no one was allowed to reach the hill top.

Ganjam district administration and Tara Tarini Development Board (TTDB) decided to cancel the Chaitra Jatra as a precautionary measure. Since Monday, entry points of all major roads leading to the hill shrine had been blocked and police were deployed to turn back visitors. “Police and the administration also closed the stairway, ropeway and the ghat road that connects the foot hill to the hill top. Only the servitors were allowed to take the stairs to reach the temple,” said secretary of TTDB, Pramod Panda. All servitors wore masks.

Besides, restrictions under Section 144 of CrPC imposed by administration was strictly enforced at the hill shrine. No shops either in the vicinity of the hill shrine or by the side of the road leading to it were allowed to open.

The temple was, however, decked up and servitors performed all the rituals according to schedule. The deity was ready in ‘Mahalaxmi Besha,’ but there were no devotees for the darshan. Large sheds had been erected for the ‘mundan ceremony,’ where thousands of children usually tonsure their heads as an offering to the deity. Around 500 barbers of the area, who make a tidy sum during the Chaitra Jatra, were in for a disappointment.

Servitors said they had never seen the temple deserted like this during the Chaitra Jatra. Senior servitor Tapan Rana said they accepted it as the need of the hour in these testing times.

According to the TTDB, over 1.5 lakh visitors were expected to arrive for the festival on Tuesday. Out of them, around 50,000 would have reached the hill top to offer puja to the deity, while the rest stayed back for the festival at the foothill.

The Madhya Pradesh Congress on March 17 approached the Supreme Court for a direction to grant it access to and communicate with its 16 ‘rebel’ MLAs spirited away to Bengaluru ahead of the Assembly floor test against the Kamalnath government.

“The insistence of the BJP to hold a floor test without the participation of the 16/22 confined/captive MLAs belonging to the Congress is a classic textbook example of an attempt to pervert a constitutional process and frustrate the very purpose of holding a floor test,” the petition, filed by advocate Amit Pai, said.

Centre made respondent

The petition has made the Union government , the BJP and the State of Madhya Pradesh, along with the 16 ‘rebel’ MLAs, respondents in the case.

The BJP has already moved the apex court for early holding of the floor test. The court has urgently scheduled the hearing for March 18.

The confinement of the MLAs since the beginning of March and holding them in resorts in Bengaluru is a fraud on the Constitution, the Congress petition said.

The petition sought a direction to allow the rebel MLAs to participate in the ongoing Budget session of the Assembly.

Alternatively, if the MLAs have resigned and their seats fallen vacant, a trust vote cannot be held until by-elections to these seats are held, the Congress argued.

The Congress complained to the apex court that the BJP has confined the legislators in Karnataka with the aid of the State apparatus. They have been held incommunicado to even families and party members.

The petition said “the floor test can only be meaningful when all the elected representatives are able to attend and exercise their freedom without any pressure or duress.”

“For that, even assuming but not conceding that the MLAs have tendered their resignations from the Assembly, they are still members of the Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee. As such there is no reason as to how and why members of the INC not be allowed to meet these persons,” the petition said.

In a letter to Mr Tandon, Mr Nath said, “They have been made to stay in a hostage-like situation where no one can meet them, talk to them, and they are being stopped from returning to Bhopal, while BJP leaders are meeting them, influencing their minds... forcing them to make false statements before the media.”

Meanwhile, the State BJP leaders approached Governor requesting him to block all decisions taken by the government in the past three days, after three Congress leaders were appointed to head State Commissions.

Mr. Nath implored the Governor to allow them freedom so that they could stay home for five-seven days “in an open environnement without any kind of pressure or fear or influence so that with an independent mind they can take a decision.”

Resignations of the MLAs, supporters of Jyotiraditya Scindia, are pending with the Speaker.

Furthermore, he pointed to several letters and meetings with the Governor where he had stated MLAs were brought to Bengaluru by BJP leaders in chartered flights and with the aid of the Karnataka police and were held hostage.

On Monday, Mr. Tandon had directed him to prove a majority before March 17. Mr. Nath wrote that it would be “unconstitutional for being completely baseless” for the Governor to conclude the government didn’t have a majority in the Vidhan Sabha if the test wasn’t conducted within the prescribed time framework.

Moreover, he asserted that in the past 15 months, the government had proved its majority on several occasions in the Assembly. “Now if the BJP is making the accusation that I don’t have a majority, they can move a no-confidence motion. It has been brought to my notice that they have already given a proposal for the motion which is pending before the Speaker. When the Speaker proceeds with it according to the rules, then automatically it will be proved that we the majority.”

Alluding to a letter of the Governor on Monday, Mr. Nath said Mr. Tandon didn’t consider it appropriate to mention why the Vidhan Sabha session was adjourned. “Like you know our country and the world is affected by the coronavirus and the World Health Organisations has declared it a global pandemic,” he wrote.

The Government of India, he added, had released an advisory in this regard and had issued instructions to stay away from ceremonies, public places and crowds. “That’s why the Vidhan Sabha Speaker has adjourned the proceedings to 11 a.m. on March 26,” he wrote.

In a continuing spar between Mr. Nath and Mr. Tandon through letters, Mr. Nath wrote: “In my 40-year-long political life I have always been respectful and upheld propriety. After reading your letter dated March 16, I am upset that you have accused me of not abiding by Parliamentary propriety. I didn’t have any such intention , still if you felt so, I express regret.”

Responding to Mr. Nath’s previous letter, the Governor had shot back saying the language and tone of his letter was “not in consonance with Parliamentary propriety.” The Chief Minister had accused Mr. Tandon of overstepping powers conferred on him under the Constitution and held his “prima facie belief” of the government being in minority based on the BJP’s opinion, while ignoring the Congress government’s charge against it.

Both the BJP and the Governor had claimed the government had wilfully ignored the Governor’s direction to conduct the test on Monday, as Mr. Tandon contended prima facie the government was in minority, a charge refuted by Mr. Nath who claimed it was the Speaker’s domain to decide on a floor test.

In the letter on Tuesday, however, Mr. Nath informed the Governor that he had forwarded all his directions addressed to him to the Speaker.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/vqawyv/article31094454.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KAMALNATH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/allow-16-rebel-congress-mlas-freedom-to-take-decision-without-fear-kamal-nath-to-governor/article31094455.ece
228,2020/03/18,Farooq Abdullah visits incarcerated Mehbooba Mufti’s family in Srinagar,"Purely a courtesy visit, says Iltija Mufti

National Conference (NC) president and Member of Parliament Dr. Farooq Abdullah on Tuesday afternoon visited his political rival Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti’s family in Srinagar.

Sources said Dr. Abdullah, who was released on March 13 after over seven months of detention, enquired about the family of still incarcerated former Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, who remains in an isolated detention centre in Srinagar.

Sources said Dr. Abdullah reached the Fair View residence of the Muftis located on Srinagar’s Gupkar Road around 4 p.m. and spent around two hours with them. Sources said Ms. Mufti's mother Gulshan Ara and daughter Iltija Mufti received Dr. Abdullah.

“It was purely a courtesy visit. Dr. Abdullah being the senior most leader in the political landscape of J&K, it's a gesture we appreciate,” Ms. Iltija told The Hindu.

Dr. Abdullah's gesture is significant in the wake of the Gupkar Declaration signed by the regional parties jointly on August 4 in Srinagar, just a day ahead of the Centre's decision to revoke J&K's special status.

The NC leader has already hinted that he will not take any position on the episode of August 5, 2019 “unless and until other detained leaders” are released in in J&K.

229,2020/03/18,Displays of deep linkages at Shrishti Art Gallery’s ‘Entwined’ exhibition,"The Hyderabad gallery presents a multi-artist show ‘Entwined: Stories in Thread and Weave’ address our inherent connections despite the current time of social distancing

The space of Shrishti Art Gallery smells of fresh paint and the muted suede tones of the walls allow the varied works of the latest exhibition to take centre stage. A multi-artist show, Entwined: Stories in Thread and Weave is curated by Goa-based curator Lina Vincent. It is a visual anthology of different legacies of stitching, embroidery and textile through artists’ lens on the macro and the micro of existence.

The aforementioned artists are Alpana Vij, Seema Kohli, Gopika Nath, Paula Sengupta, Lavanya Mani, Jagannath Panda, Sanjeev Khandekar and Vaishali Narkar, and Pranati Panda — prominent names in the national art sphere but relatively new to the local gallery scene.

Agreeing, Lakshmi Nambiar says the exhibition marks the 18th anniversary of the gallery which was started by her mother, the late Remani Nambiar. “I wanted something powerful with mixed mediums, particularly fabrics and textiles.”

The conversation for such a show between Lina and Lakshmi started over a year ago and artists were finalised four months later. Lina explains regretfully that some logistics could not facilitate the works of some artists to be shipped over so some ended up dropping out. “Curation was a very specific process because we had to curate for the Hyderabad art audience, and I am used to curating for the global art audiences,” she smiles, as if recalling her recent tour of the U.S. where she gave a presentation on Indian art and diaspora.

Instinctive connects

Through her ever-growing artist network, it was instinctive for Lina to include these nine artists. A walkthrough of the exhibition would present the viewers with a goosebump-inducing visual journey. “I had gotten to know Paula and Gopika in particular as we worked together but this show was about their works so there was a new level of collaboration! And Jaganath’s works have long been on my radar.”

Lina was adamant on bringing Singapore-based Alpana Vij’s works into Entwined. Upon closer examination, one will notice Alpana employs Korean Joomchi for her mulberry paper base that combines three layers of paper with gold thread. She then uses agitation and water to allow the paper to disintegrate and reconstitute as it dries. More noticeably, she uses 24-karat gold stitching in empty spaces on dried leaves placed on concrete, which belie her inspiration by the Buddhist concept of śūnyatā or emptiness that focuses on the transitory and ephemeral nature of life around us.

Very similar to Alpana’s works are those of Lavanya Mani who does amoeba-like stitchings on a canvas in golden and brown hues. The applique patterns unite multiple canvases and feature a unifying border of earthy dyes. Relevant to the COVID-19 outbreak, ‘Anomalies’ explores the relationship of body and landscape and how they are subjected to the unknown.

Known for touching on themes of sensuality and womanhood, Seema Kohli’s intricate works, from The Golden Womb series, offer the viewer a great sense of free energy. “Seema’s works centre on versatile feminine energy which narrate stories of the self in the universe. She collaborated with artisans from the Rajat initiative where she developed her work.”

Themes of womanhood are also explored by Pranati Panda. She uses dark branch-like embroidery and fine red threads against a stark white textile to starkly confront the viewer with the reality of fertility. Her husband Jaganath contribution is a single large mixed medium on canvas with carved ribbons of backing fabric which make up the mane of a giant mythological creature. Often, Jagannath’s works reconcile the technological and mythological, especially in this heaving industrial age.

Paula Sengupta, an academician, curator and artist based in Kolkata, melds humanity and mother nature in paintings on textiles. “She’s currently in the process of making her own textile,” says Lina, “but, here, one can see the way in a single line, she goes from plant to animal to fruit.” Paula’s works do not stop there; she has created a pankha using multi-textile works are hung from the ceiling against wooden grass mats. The imagery is provoking, exploring the ongoing destruction and conflict around heritage and colonialism on The Buddha Trail.

Geo-politics make a foray into Entwined, courtesy Sanjeev Khandekar and Vaishali Narkar who use shattered glass, incense sticks, cowry shell dice, smoke-on-canvas and stitchwork to delineate the still-growing Islamaphobia around us as well as the strife in Kashmir.

Winding up Entwined on a lighter note are Goa-based Gopika Nath’s works which bind together elements of nostalgia and the sea. She explores the ideology of Vignaharta and the visarjan and what sometimes wash up on shore after these intense spiritual rituals. The artworks feature stitching, photography and shells which combine to perhaps point out to us the state of our planet’s main water body.

230,2020/03/18,It is not business as usual at inter-State border in Anaikatti,"The long road snaking through hills with dried shrubs to Anaikatti and Mannarkad in Kerala is free of the usual movement of vehicles.

It has been so for over a week now, ever since the governments on both sides of the border (Tamil Nadu and Kerala) started taking preventive measures and creating awareness among commuters to contain the spread of COVID-19, says M. Senthilkumar, a taxi diver who carry people from border habitations in Kerala to Coimbatore city.

“Usually we, the drivers in the stand at the border, go on two or three trips each a day. But in the last few days we have not moved out.”

Even the calls the drivers get from resort managements to take their customers to Coimbatore have dried up as the resorts are closed, says R. Nataraj, another driver.

“The only trips we have made are from our houses to the stand in the mornings and back to houses in the evenings.” There are more than 15 vehicles in the area, near the check post, that take people to various parts of Coimbatore – for shopping to Cross Cut Road and Oppanakara Street, for vegetables to T.K. Market and for machinery and spare parts purchase to Kattoor.

Mr. Nataraj says the drivers there have also seen the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation cut a few bus services as a precautionary measure. The fewer movement of people across the border is impact business for shopkeepers in Anaikatti. “I’m seeing a drop of almost 75% commuters. The impact of the reduction is that I’m seeing poor business – it is down by almost 50% in the last few days,” says T. Krishnasamy, a shopkeeper.

Buses to Anaikatti from Coimbatore are seeing fewer commuters, says G. Raja Pandian, a conductor with a Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation bus. “From around ₹ 13,000 a day, my collection has come down to ₹ 8,000.”

Across the border, a Kerala medical team from the Anaikatti Primary Health Centre led by Medical Officer V.C. Jayakumar is screening passengers who cross the border. “After noting down vehicle numbers and names, the team asks the passengers about their travel history or contact with persons who have returned from abroad. If they say yes or show symptoms of fever, the team takes down their address and phone number to relay to the Government Tribal Speciality Hospital at Kottathara.” Or through senior officials pass on the details to the health department staff to various districts for follow-up action.

Back in Tamil Nadu, a mobile medical team led by Medical Officer S. Bhageerathi from the Dhaliyur Block Primary Health Centre has been camping in Anaikatti to check people going to Kerala and entering Tamil Nadu.

The team has an employee of the local panchayat who sprays disinfectants on vehicles going in both the directions. It also has Health Inspector Vigneshwaran who seeks details of travel history from people crossing the border.

The team also enters buses to educate people on preventive measures like hand washing techniques.

Dr. Bhageerathi says the 24-hour camp records vehicle numbers, names, etc. of people in all private vehicles. In cases where people show symptoms of fever, she checks them using a hand-held thermal scanner.

During the past week, the cooperation from the passengers has improved as they come forward with answers and cooperate to checking.

Mr. Vigneshwaran says the team does not exempt even two-wheeler riders who move across the border. “We can make out if someone on a two-wheeler is a local resident or commuter or not. The size of the bag he or she carries is a give away.”

And, thus far, the team has not come across anyone showing symptoms of Covid-19, the doctor adds.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/it-is-not-business-as-usual-at-inter-state-border-in-anaikatti/article31102356.ece

A press release from the police said that Haneefa was arrested for assaulting Sundarapuram area secretary of the RSS N. Suryaprakash (26). The provisions of UAPA were invoked against Haneefa, as during investigation it was found that he was involved in a conspiracy that infringed the peace in Coimbatore city.

Police said that two men including Haneefa barged into the shop run by Suryaprakash on Madukkarai market road late on March 11 and assaulted him before fleeing the place.

243,2020/03/18,Tourist spots in the Nilgiris to remain shut till March 31,"The Nilgiris has been closed to tourists till March 31, with all tourist places shut down by the district administration in an effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

J. Innocent Divya, Nilgiris district collector, said that all tourist spots, including the Government Botanical Garden, Rose Garden, Boat House and the Sims Park have been closed till March 31. She also said that notices had been issued to hotels, resorts and homestays to get their guests vacate their premises by Wednesday morning.

The Forest Department said that the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve had been closed to tourists, while all the tourist spots in forest areas run by ecodevelopment committees (EDCs) too had been shutdown.

Ms. Divya also said that teams have been posted at all border checkposts to advise tourists to return home, and not enter the Nilgiris.

“The strategy has been implemented to minimise contact between people and to prevent a nation-wide pandemic,” said Ms. Divya, stating that the necessity to implement such measures had been accelerated due to two people in neighbouring Wayanad having tested positive for COVID-19.

She said that a decision on the fate of the summer festival season, set to start from May 2, will be taken at a later date.

People who need to enter or leave the district till March 31 can still do so, but the district administration has advised residents from travelling outside the Nilgiris as much as possible. People entering the district will be screened for symptoms of COVID-19 infection before being allowed in, officials said.

More than 40 teams have also been formed to sanitise public spaces such as bus stands and markets in the district, while the Collector said that strict action would be taken against people spreading false rumours about the spread of COVID-19.

She added that action would be taken against people or businesses found to be hoarding surgical masks or selling them at costs higher than the specified maximum retail price. “People can share information about such businesses at the toll-free number 1077,” said Ms. Divya.

The sudden decision by the State Government to order the closure of all resorts, homestays and hotels has severely impacted foreign tourists, many of whom have nowhere to stay following the announcement.

Sven, a tourist from Switzerland who arrived in the Nilgiris on Monday, said that he had originally planned to stay for more than a week, but was told by the people running the homestay where he was staying to vacate the room by Wednesday. “We have nowhere to stay now as hotel owners across Tamil Nadu are not taking any room bookings, so we are quite unsure about where to stay,” said Sven.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/x6nxl4/article31093914.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OT18BOATHOUSE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/tourist-spots-in-the-nilgiris-to-remain-shut-till-march-31/article31093915.ece
244,2020/03/18,Public places closed to visitors,"Government offices take precautionary measures

With the State Government scaling up the precautionary measures taken against COVID-19, there were fewer people on the roads and at shops in the city on Tuesday.

“All the shops are kept open on Oppanakara street. But the number of customers is less,” said one of the shop owners.

The State Government on Monday announced that museums, gymnasiums, swimming pool, theme parks, zoos, and educational institutions will remain closed for 15 days. The government also advised the public against large social gatherings.

K. Selvaraju, who takes part in marathons and trains in gymnasium regularly, said he will have to start workouts at home as he will not be able to go to the gym. “It is going to be difficult as I cannot do all the exercises at home,” he said.

Swimming pools and gymnasiums in the city were closed down on Tuesday following the orders.

“We have closed all the common facilities, including swimming pool and gymnasium, till March 31,” said S. Balamurali, president of the Mayflower Sakthi Garden Owners’ Association. The gated community has 290 residential units.

The private and government museums in the city will also remain closed until further orders.

“There is no one in the stadium area and we are also closed to visitors. The staff will take up regular work such as cleaning during these two weeks,” said C. Sivakumar, government museum curator here.

Private museums in the city also downed shutters. “Apart from foreign visitors, we (Gedee Car Museum) get visitors from other States on Sundays too . The museum has more than 300 visitors a day on weekdays. We have closed down the museum until further orders from the Government,” said Akila Shanmugham, Director of Gee Dee Institutions.

The Gass Forest Museum at Tamil Nadu Forest Academy campus in Coimbatore was closed on Tuesday. Visitors will not be allowed to the museum till March 31. Cinema theatres and the zoo will also remain closed.

Arjunan, who sells tiffin out of his push cart in Pappanaikenpalayam for the last 35 years, said that since Sunday all the push cart food vendors have been asked to shut down. “I do not know if it is because of coronavirus or because of communal tensions in the city. I start serving food from 7.30 p.m. and it goes on till 10.50 p.m. Initially they told us to stop sales by 10 p.m. On Sunday, the police told us that we should not open shop. Every area in the city has 500 to 600 street side food vendors. For most of them, their daily earning comes from the sales. If hotels can be kept open, we should also be permitted to operate,” he said. At Goethe Zentrum, the exams that were scheduled for this month have been postponed. “We had 41 students from Kerala for the examinations held on March 14. They were screened before the exams. Since the exams include spoken tests, the Institute has postponed the exams to next month,” Ms. Akila said.

It was not just private institutions and organisations, but Government departments also stepped up precautionary measures and sensitised the staff.

The Department of Post has provided hand sanitisers to its staff and asked them to use masks, if necessary. All public events have been deferred. The Registration Department has used disinfectants to clean the sub-registrar offices that see huge crowds. “We expect less registrations this month as not many registrations happen during the Tamil month of Panguni. We have asked our staff to be careful. We plan to display boards to create better awareness among the public,” said a senior official of the Department here.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/wc35xw/article31093900.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB18CINEMATHEATRES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/public-places-closed-to-visitors/article31093901.ece
245,2020/03/18,Tasmac bars closed,"However, all liquor vending outlets function as usual

Following the Government directive, bars attached to Tasmac outlets in Coimbatore district remained closed on Tuesday as a precaution against the spread of COVID-19.

A senior official of the Tasmac for the region told The Hindu the bars attached to all liquor outlets were closed on Tuesday while liquor vending outlets functioned as usual. Of the 310 outlets functional in Coimbatore south and Coimbatore north limits most of them have bars attached to them. Meanwhile, staff at the outlets were directed to use mask and hand sanitisers. They were also asked to sanitise hand rails at the counters where customers place their hands.

With the bars closed down, many employees remained jobless. A bar generally employs at least 10 people including cook and suppliers.

John Antony, state vice-president of Tasmac Oozhiyargal Sangam affiliated to the CITU, wanted the State Government to close down the liquor outlets as well, considering the threat posed by the virus.

“Those working at the liquor outlets handle hundreds of people a day. This makes them vulnerable to various infections. The employees also go to main office of Tasmac and banks for various purposes before going to their houses,” he said.

246,2020/03/18,Hanuma Vihari to play in English county,"‘I wish to take the game to the next level’

Indian Test cricketer Hanuma Vihari will play for a leading team in the English county championship in August.

The 26-year-old Vihari, who has played nine Tests so far, scoring 552 runs with a century and four fifties, says it should be a great experience.

“It is obviously exciting to play for the first time in English county which is said to be a rewarding experience. I hope to keep improving, which is the key for longevity at the highest level,” Vihari said in a chat with The Hindu on Wednesday.

Returning back from the just-concluded TNCA League in Chennai, where he played in the first division for Nelson Sports Club, Vihari said he will be playing the last four games for the County side in view of the on-going Coronavirus threat and the precautionary measures in place.

“I feel that things are going in the right direction right now as far my cricketing career is concerned and I wish to take the game to the next level,” he said.

“I am taking a break right now (he led Andhra in the Ranji Trophy before joining the Indian team on the tour to New Zealand). The aim will be to focus on my fitness and try to keep improving in every aspect of the game,” Vihari said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/yc6uch/article31102469.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19HANUMA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/vihari-to-play-in-english-county/article31099622.ece
247,2020/03/18,Will play county cricket once COVID-19 is under control: Hanuma Vihari,"The batsman said that he was supposed to play four English county games, but didn’t reveal the team as the paperwork is on hold

Hanuma Vihari wanted to utilise the summer months playing county cricket in England but the COVID-19 pandemic has put paid to the India all-rounder’s plans for the time being.

Slowly becoming a key member of the Indian Test side, the 26-year-old wants to hone his skills with a prominent county side but now the deal will be inked when the situation comes under control and travel bans are lifted globally.

“I was supposed to play four English county games this season. I would only be able to tell you the name when all the paperwork is complete. Right now, it’s on hold due to the unavoidable situation (COVID-19),” Vihari told PTI.

The Andhra batsman is confident that he will be able to travel to the UK during the latter part of the county season which is played from April to September.

“Hope once it’s under control, I will be able to play those games. It will be a learning experience for me,” said the soft spoken Vihari.

The BCCI, in recent years, has allowed top cricketers who are not playing in the IPL to compete in county cricket during the summer months.

The likes of Cheteshwar Pujara, Ishant Sharma, Ravichandran Ashwin and Ajinkya Rahane are some of the prominent Test specialists who have plied their trade in division 1 and 2 of English county.

Vihari played for his employers Nelson CC in the Tamil Nadu CA league on Tuesday. He scored 202 not out against Alwarpet CC in a drawn game.

“I work for Nelson and I am committed to play when I am available. It was good match practice. Now I am back in Hyderabad. I will be taking a break for the time being,” he informed.

Adaptability

Talking about his 55 off 70 balls against New Zealand on a green top at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch, the gutsy right-hander was a touch disappointed.

“I wouldn’t call it my best innings. Yes, I was playing well but that innings didn’t get a victory for my team. It was good to score runs in tough conditions but you value it more when the team wins,” he said.

Vihari, who made his debut in England, has a decent Test record of 552 runs in nine games with an average of just under 37. Incidentally, he has played all his Tests abroad.

“I have the self belief and the team believes that I have the technique to get success in overseas conditions,” he said.

So, what has been the key to his four half-centuries and a century in countries like England, West Indies, New Zealand?

“Adaptability. I believe I have been able to adapt well in all conditions and I have confidence that I can perform any role that the team assigns me,” he said.

India will be playing nine Test matches (four away against Australia and five at home against England) between November 2020 and February 2021.

“I am sure that I will get a chance to play in home conditions as well. My job is to work hard and be prepared for any situation,” he said.

With no cricketing activity right now due to COVID-19, Vihari, like all other sportspersons, is at home but will follow the routine given by India’s strength and conditioning coach Nick Webb.

“We all have individual training chart during off time. I will try and follow that,” he said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/s9yjva/article31099409.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HANUMA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/will-play-county-cricket-once-covid-19-is-under-control-vihari/article31099410.ece
248,2020/03/18,Bangladesh approaches Sanjay Bangar for Test batting consultant’s position,"Bangar was with the Indian team from 2014 to 2019 and was replaced by Vikram Rathour at the start of the home season in September

The Bangladesh Cricket Board has approached former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar to become the national team’s consultant in red-ball cricket.

A BCB official told PTI that Bangar was approached for the Test batting consultant’s role but there has not been any clear response from him.

“He has been offered but we are not sure. We are hearing that he could also be occupied elsewhere,” the official said.

Former South Africa international Neil McKenzie is currently working with the Bangladesh batsmen in the shorter formats.

Bangar was with the Indian team from 2014 to 2019 and was replaced by Vikram Rathour at the start of the home season in September. The West Indies tour, which took place after the World Cup, was his last assignment.

In fact, Bangar was the only one to get the axe in the Indian support staff with head coach Ravi Shastri, bowling coach Bharat Arun and fielding coach R. Sridhar retaining their roles.

Bangar has been busy commentating on the game ever since his sacking. The 47-year-old played 12 Tests and 15 ODIs for India between 2001 and 2004.

“We have spoken with Bangar (for Test batting consultant) but nothing is finalised yet,” BCB chief executive Nizamuddin Chowdhury told reporters in Dhaka on Wednesday.

“We are negotiating with a few others as well. McKenzie is looking after the red-ball cricket despite being a white-ball consultant and till we get a batting consultant for Test cricket we are expecting him to do the job (in red ball),” he added.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/bangladesh-approaches-sanjay-bangar-for-test-batting-consultants-position/article31099246.ece

The South African cricket team has been asked to self-quarantine for the next 14 days after returning midway from an ODI tour of India due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cricket South Africa’s chief medical officer, Dr Shuaib Manjra, was quoted as saying that the players have been told to isolate themselves and will be tested for the deadly virus in case any symptoms show up.

“We have recommended the players social distance themselves from others and self-isolate for a minimum of 14 days. I think that is proper guidance to protect themselves, people around them, their families and their communities,” he was quoted as saying by the media here.

“In that period, if any of them have symptoms or any other factors that is cause for concern, we will ensure this is investigated appropriately and managed accordingly with the protocols that are in place,” he added.

South Africa were to play three ODIs during the tour that was aborted after the washed out opening game in Dharamsala. India’s tally of COVID-19 patients has crossed 100, including three deaths. The global death count is nearing 8,000 while the number of infected is close to 200,000.

“Some of the players wore masks while we were travelling. Others decided not to wear masks - that was up to them. We were pretty isolated during travel and largely immunised from the outside world,” said Dr. Manjra while describing the journey back.

The Proteas halted in Kolkata before heading back home.

“We have looked at the recommendations made for different countries by the World Health Organisation and other authoritative bodies. We have since educated the players about the disease - what it is, what it means, what its symptoms are,” Dr. Manjra said.

“We have educated them on how to monitor themselves about temperature and the other symptoms that come with COVID-19.

Shivam Dube’s exploits from Ranji Trophy to India-A last year came at a time when Hardik Pandya and Vijay Shankar were nursing injuries, so the burly cricketer was catapulted into the India squad.

The Mumbai allrounder has had a topsy-turvy ride so far in his 13 T20Is and a solitary ODI. The six-hitting sensation opens up in a chat with The Hindu on being considered as Hardik’s replacement and that fateful over in February in which he conceded 34 runs in the last T20I against New Zealand. Excerpts:

You have had limited opportunities with the bat and ball in international cricket. Easy to pick the best moment yet, right?

Yes, kind of. That knock in Thiruvananthapuram (30-ball 54 after being promoted to No. 3 against West Indies) was satisfying. Any good outing, be it with the ball or the ball, in international cricket gives you a lot of confidence. What really pleased me about that knock in Hyderabad was that it came under pressure.

Now that Hardik is back, you have had to make way for him. How do you look at it?

Whenever I am reminded that you are here to replace Hardik Pandya, I have said: “No, I am not here to replace Hardik Pandya, I am here to perform well and win matches for India”. Obviously Hardik is a senior and a crucial player, so whenever he is fit, he is going to walk into the team.

I feel playing with two allrounders is always good for any team. It gives many options to the captain. I think there’s more percentage of winning matches with two allrounders.

Can you talk us through that one over in Mount Maunganui?

You saw all about that over, why do you want to ask me about it! But I’ll tell you about that. There was a dropped catch, a misfield and all that. It’s part of the game. I know I went for 34 runs but it’s okay. It happens sometimes under pressure. What matters the most is we won the match.

The series was already won but despite that over, we won the match. After the match, all the teammates told me “don’t worry, it happens”. Even I thought the same. There was no point in keeping on thinking about it.

What is the goal you have set for yourself for the next 12 months?

I was really looking forward to playing the Irani Cup (suspended due to COVID-19 outbreak). For me, it’s just the beginning, I need to improve myself a lot.

I am not someone who sets goals in terms of numbers. Be it on the field or off it while working on my fitness, I just have to ensure that I keep getting better as a cricketer.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/x9xbre/article31092649.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18SHIV,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/here-to-win-matches-for-india-not-replace-hardik-says-shivam-dube/article31092650.ece

254,2020/03/18,Coronavirus | Delhi HC satisfied with govt’s steps to rescue Indian students in Iran,"The court also noted that authorities have done more than what was expected

The Delhi High Court Wednesday expressed satisfaction over the steps taken by the central government in getting in touch with and bringing back most of the Indian students stranded in Iran in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

Justice Navin Chawla was informed by the counsel for the Centre that 119 Indians students, who were stuck in Iran and had moved the court through their parents, were tested for COVID-19 and that one student has tested positive and is undergoing treatment there.

Central government standing counsel Anurag Ahluwalia, representing the ministries of home, external affairs, health and aviation, told the court that out of those 119 students, 110 have returned to India and while five did not go for sampling, four have tested negative for the virus and are in Iran.

After perusing the status report filed by the government, the judge said, “I am satisfied with the steps taken by the respondents (authorities)“.

The court also noted that authorities have done more than what was expected.

It was hearing a plea moved by the parents of the Indian students, who were stranded in Iran due to travel restrictions following the coronavirus outbreak, seeking directions to the Centre to evacuate them.

Advocate Fozia Rahman and M. Qayam Ud Din, who appeared for the parents, said they have been able to contact several Indian students in Iran and as and when they will get in touch with other students, they will inform the Indian authorities.

The court also noted that in case the parents are able to contact the remaining students there, they shall inform the authorities who will then act expeditiously. The petition was disposed off by the bench.

The court had earlier directed the Centre to ensure that the Indian embassy in Iran gets in touch with the Indian students stranded there in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, instead of “merely issuing advisories”, and to assure them of all assistance.

It had asked the central government to “do a little more” than what it was doing till then to evacuate over 3,000 Indian nationals, including pilgrims, fishermen and students, presently stranded in Iran.

The Centre’s counsel had earlier told the court that all possible efforts were being made to work out modalities to operate a limited number of flights to enable early and safe return of Indians stranded in Iran.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/itiwnn/article31098078.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI16-03-2020000192B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/coronavirus-delhi-hc-satisfied-with-govts-steps-to-rescue-indian-students-in-iran/article31098079.ece
255,2020/03/18,Nirbhaya case: Delhi High Court dismisses convict Mukesh Singh’s plea,"The trial court had dismissed his plea and asked the Bar Council of India to give appropriate sensitisation exercise to his counsel.

The Delhi High Court on Wednesday dismissed a plea by Mukesh Singh, one of the four death-row convicts in the December 16, 2012, gang rape and murder case, challenging the trial court’s order rejecting his claim that he had not been in Delhi when the crime had taken place.

Justice Brijesh Sethi ruled that there were no grounds to interfere in the detailed and reasoned order of the trial court.

“There is nothing on record to suggest that trial stands vitiated because material evidence was concealed. There is, thus, no infirmity, illegality or irregularity in the order passed by the trial court,” Justice Sethi said.

Separately, counsel for the four death row convicts moved a local court seeking a stay on their death penalty, on the ground that a second mercy plea from one of them was still pending.

Additional Sessions Judge Dharmendra Rana issued notices to the Tihar jail authorities and the police on the plea and said he would hear the matter on Thursday.

On Tuesday, the Delhi sessions court had rejected Singh’s plea, claiming that he was arrested from Rajasthan and brought to Delhi on December 17, 2012, and was not present in the city on December 16, when the crime took place. In his plea Singh also alleged that he had been tortured inside Tihar jail.

The trial court had asked the Bar Council of India (BCI) to ensure that Singh’s counsel was provided with appropriate sensitisation.

On March 5, a trial court issued fresh warrants fixing March 20, 5.30 a.m., as the time for the execution of convicts Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31).

On December 16, 2012, the paramedical student was gang raped and brutally assaulted by six men in a private bus and thrown out of the moving vehicle along with her male friend. The victims later died of their injuries.

The High Court and the Supreme Court had upheld the death sentences against the four convicts and the President has also rejected the mercy pleas of all four convicts.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/frnpql/article31097757.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CANDLELIGHT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/nirbhaya-convict-mukesh-moves-hc-against-trial-court-order-claims-not-in-delhi-at-time-of-incident/article31097758.ece

The Delhi government on Tuesday began a disinfection drive for public service vehicles such as autorickshaws, gramin sewa, phat-phat sewa, maxi cab, eco-friendly sewa and others. The Delhi government said, 1,751 vehicles were sanitised in the first shift from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. These included 1,182 autorickshaws and 194 e-rickshaws among others.

People should not panic, but needed to remain cautious and must consult a doctor if they feel any symptoms, he added.

261,2020/03/18,Coronavirus | Demand for chicken drops by up to 75% in several cities,"Poultry industry hit by rumours that COVID-19 can be caused by eating meat

Despite several reports stating that COVID-19 does not have any effect on animals, poultry businesses across several cities have taken a hit due to rumours on social media. Narender Singh, who runs a shop at Prithviraj Market, said that over the last one week, sales have dropped by 50%.

“Sales, especially in the last one week, have been really low with not even half of the stock being sold. As a result, prices have also come down slightly and now chicken is being sold at ₹180 per kg instead of ₹200,” added Mr. Singh. Business has also hit bigger establishments like Green Chick Chop and Republic of Chicken, said representatives of the respective shops.

Sandeep Singh of Republic of Chicken in South Extension said, “Even though for us prices have not been affected, sales have dipped by nearly 15%-20% since the beginning of this month.”

Mohammad Haroon, a poultry shop owner based in Mayur Vihar said, “In Delhi, it has started hitting with low sales, however, we are hearing that places outside the city has been worse. Over the last one week, since the time, the panic around the COVID-19 began, sales have started slowing down.”

For Ashu Qureshi, who runs a small restaurant Delhi-6 Special in Pasonda area of Ghaziabad, COVID-19 has come as a bad omen.

“We are staring at joblessness. There is 70% fall in business. Chicken business runs on the patronage of Hindu families and they have stopped eating since the rumours spread that eating chicken causes the new flu,” he said.

“The wholesale prices have dropped to around 100 a kg and even less depending on quality but we sign agreements with suppliers which say that for six months we have to buy chicken at ₹160 a kg. Now we can only reduce the quantity, we can’t change the rate,” he said, adding he had a staff of 15 to look after.

Mohd Ilyas of Chicken Supreme Corner echoed, “It is all a creation of WhatsApp messages. During bird flu, similar rumours were spread,” he said. Mr. Ilyas said that the dip in demand for chicken has a spiral effect. “The business of a tea seller that stands in front of our shop has also come down,” he added.

‘Blessing for some’

Mohd Suhaib of Pakeezah Meat Corner at Garima Garden here had a different take. “The dip in prices has come as a blessing for the underprivileged. We are seeing a rush of auto wallahs and daily wagers as now chicken is selling at the price of vegetables. They are not concerned about the rumours,” he said.

Meanwhile, Broilers Breeders Association, North India, Gurbinder Bisla, told The Hindu that the demand for chicken had dropped by around 75% and the prices had also nosedived to around 20 % of the total production cost causing a huge loss to the poultry industry.

“Over the past month, the sale has reduced to around 25% and the prices have also fallen drastically. While the cost of production is around ₹80 per kg, some States have witnessed the sale at ₹12-15 per kg. The price for Tuesday was ₹30 per kg,” said Mr. Bisla, a resident of Haryana’s Jind. He said there were around 15,000 broiler poultry farms in Haryana alone.

Mr. Bisla said that despite clarification by the government that the virus cannot transmit from animals to humans, the rumours have gained ground and the demand had plummeted.

He said that the association was in talks with government officials to provide surplus wheat and rice to poultry farmers at a subsided rate of ₹10 per kg to reduce production cost.

Confirming the trend, an employee at Fresh and Frozen, Vatika Town Square, Sector 83, Gurugram, confirmed that the demand for raw meat, including chicken, mutton, fish and kebab, had decreased by more than 50% over the past five days due to COVID-19 scare, though the baked meat items were still in demand.

However, Sumit, who runs franchise store of “Sardar — A Pure Meat Shop” in Sector 31, Gurugram, said the sales at his shop were not affected. “We cannot do much about the myths being spread on social media about meat consumption, but we have not suffered any fall in demand,” said Mr. Sumit.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/915jwk/article31094188.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17DELPRIYAPOULTRYANUJ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/demand-for-chicken-drops-by-up-to-75/article31094190.ece

263,2020/03/18,Savarkar road sign vandalised in JNU,"It sparked off a blame game between students’ outfits

The signage for a road recently named after V.D. Savarkar was defaced on Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus on Tuesday, sparking off a blame game between students’ organisations. The sign was painted over with the name B.R. Ambedkar.

The JNU Administration had put up a signboard near Purvanchal Bus Terminal naming the road V.D. Savarkar. This was done on the basis of recommendations made by a committee set up to name roads on campus. The report was presented at an Executive Council meeting on November 13, 2019.

The JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) said the administration knows that “Savarkar and his ideology is unacceptable to JNU students”. “Mr. Savarkar’s apology to the British, his antipathy to Muslims and women, and his endorsement to the two-nation theory are well known and he cannot be accepted as an icon of a secular, plural and inclusive nation,” the JNUSU said in a statement. “JNU believes in the ideals of Bhagat Singh and Ambedkar, and not Savarkar as the ABVP does,” it added.

Reacting to the incident, JNU Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar said, “Last night some miscreants indulged in defacing the road signage on our campus. This is highly regrettable. In an educational institution, one can disagree intellectually but stooping down to such acts is unwarranted.”

The ABVP alleged that students belonging to Left outfits defaced the signage. “The ABVP strongly condemns this act of the Left in defacing public property on the JNU campus. The campus had witnessed similar incidents during the struggle against fee hike,” Shivam Chaurasia, president of ABVP (JNU) said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ps0ja7/article31094168.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18DESIGN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/savarkar-road-sign-vandalised-in-jnu/article31094169.ece
264,2020/03/18,Coronavirus | National Restaurant Association of India issues advisory to members to shut operations,"National Restaurant Association of India issues advisory even as eateries in city record low footfall

The National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) has issued an advisory to all its members to shut down their restaurant operations from March 18-31, or till such a time when no new COVID-19 cases are reported.

This comes at a time when the hospitality industry is taking a beating due to dwindling sales because of the virus outbreak.

In a statement on Tuesday night, the NRAI said: “We find ourselves in an unprecedented situation where we are compelled to make difficult decisions which have massive financial implications on our businesses but we are doing this in the larger benefit for our teams, guests and communities.”

The association said that most employees use public transport to commute and they run a huge risk of getting infected and further becoming carriers of the virus.

“Therefore, to avoid such risk, we have advised all our members to shut down their operations and help curtail the spread of the deadly virus,” the NRAI said.

Tough decision

Explaining that the decision was a tough one to make, the NRAI said that that food service industry works on a fairly high proportion of fixed operating costs and therefore, the decision to shut down was very hard. “We intend to work with all stakeholders in the ecosystem — from landlords to various departments of the government, banks and financial institutions and seek their support in mitigating our losses as far as possible,” the NRAI added.

One of the first to announce that they will be shutting all restaurants from midnight on March 17 is a group called First Fiddle that owns a number of restaurants in the city.

Priyank Sukhija of First Fiddle said, “In the wake of COVID-19 outbreak, the First Fiddle family is committed to safety. These are times when we need to think about our staff and patrons more than our business. At midnight Tuesday, we at First Fiddle are shutting down all our restaurants till March 31, across the country. We will be back with a bang once the virus is gone,” he said.

He added that he also urges the government to take similar steps to curb the COVID-19 outbreak before it goes out of our hands.

Even those restaurants open have reported low footfall. Anil Kharb, assistant manager at Kampai located in Aerocity, Delhi, says that his restaurant mostly caters to Japanese customers and a few Indians but recently, since the past few weeks there has been a 70% reduction in the footfall due to the virus scare.

“We ensure safety of our guests by taking suggested measures. Hand sanitisers are kept at the entrance and at every table. Our serving and kitchen staff are strictly complying to wearing masks,” Mr. Kharb said.

“We used to receive close to 45-50 guests each day but now it has come down to 2-3 a day. The ones visiting are trusting us with the hygiene and we are dedicated to ensuring that. We are strictly following the use of masks, gloves, sanitisers along with infra-red thermometers installed for the staff,” said Bhaskar Joshi, Food and Beverage Executive at Prego - The Westin Gurgaon.

With those practising social distancing avoiding malls, restaurants that normally see walk-in customers throughout the day are finding business tough. Niranjan Sharma, assistant manager of Vasant Kunj Socials said, “We are located inside Ambience Mall, so most of our customers are mall visitors. People are avoiding such crowded public spaces which is reflected in the restaurant business as well. The reduction is more visible in foreigner crowd as compared to Indians.”

Food delivery app Zomato has also told customers that they can instruct delivery valets to leave the package at the door of the order that has been paid for.

It added that customers can check hygiene ratings of restaurants through the hygiene rating filter on the app before ordering food.

“We are continuously training and educating our delivery partners on the best practices of personal hygiene, proper method and frequency of hand washing/sanitising as well as what to do in case they have any symptoms of COVID-19. We are especially emphasizing on best practices on how to handle food packages to ensure safe and hygienic delivery,” Zomato said.

265,2020/03/18,Report calls for ramping up medical services to riot victims,"Police stopped our team of doctors from reaching hospital: Progressive Medicos and Scientists Forum

Progressive Medicos and Scientists Forum (PMSF), one of the first groups to send medical relief to riot-hit parts of north-east Delhi, on Wednesday came out with a report on the medical emergency in the wake of violence here. The report details the role of police and calls for ramping up of medical services.

A team of about eight doctors, under the banner of PMSF, had made repeated attempts to reach Al Hind Hospital in Old Mustafabad, which had reportedly been overrun with victims with grievous injuries, on February 24 and 25. However, they were allegedly stopped by the police as well as rioters, the group said. Ambulances were only able to reach the area following a High Court directive to the police to ensure safe passage, it added.

Al Hind Hospital, which catered to about 30-40 patients a day, had more than 200 patients on February 24 itself, the report reads. Quoting a doctor at the hospital, it says: “These people [referring to attackers] had severely assaulted the victims that they were dying of agony and we had nothing in our hands. Despite being doctors, we couldn’t do much because the vital organs were punctured. Some had their skulls open from both sides with knives. Police had even beaten up a pregnant woman brutally.”

Services at the hospital were reportedly kept up by the relentless efforts of registered medical practitioners and volunteers from the area before help could arrive.

Medical response

The report also calls into question the “sincerity and quality” of medical response from the government. It states that “even as the bodies in the GTB Hospital mortuary were mounting, the hospital authorities failed to perform the post-mortems on time as they were waiting for “instructions” from the government”. Post-mortems were finally carried out only after the Delhi Minorities Commission ordered the hospital Superintendent to conduct the procedure on all cases within 24 hours of their arrival, it added.

A statement by the group lashes out at the poor state of health infrastructure in the area with “not even one mohalla clinic in the entire Mustafabad” and the publicly funded health insurance scheme not working out.

The team, which had reportedly set up a medical camp at the Idgah in Mustafabad, in a statement, called upon government authorities to organise efforts to “heal the physical, mental, physiological, and financial wounds which have disfigured the lives of people,” an effort that could not be managed by civil society alone, they argued.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/s9fe3y/article31094153.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL18-RIOTS2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/report-calls-for-ramping-up-medical-services-to-riot-victims/article31094154.ece
266,2020/03/18,"Women, activists write to CMs of States seeking de-linking of NPR from census","‘In Assam, vast majority of 19 lakh left out of NRC are women’

Women, including rights activists, doctors, lawyers, academics, anganwadi workers and others, on Tuesday wrote to Chief Ministers of all States, registering their reservations against the National Population Register (NPR) and demanding that it be de-linked from the census house listing.

“Women constitute nearly 50% of India’s population and this opposition is based on clear evidence from our own lives,” read the letter to the CMs.

Addressing a press conference, activist Annie Raja said, “Women often do not have land or property in their names, have low literacy rates and leave their natal homes upon marriage with no documents in tow. In Assam, a vast majority of the 19 lakh left out of NRC are women. That is the reality.”

Stating that Home Minister Amit Shah’s statement that no one will be marked “doubtful” in the NPR “carries no legal sanctity,” social activist Anjali Bharadwaj said that the statement would only hold true when relevant statues and rules are formally amended.

Activist Farah Naqvi added: “Women and children from Adivasi communities, Dalits, Muslims, migrant labourers, small farmers, domestic workers, sex workers and transgenders, if asked to “prove” citizenship will all be at grave risk of being disenfranchised.”

In the letter to the Chief Ministers, women have demanded that each State de-link NPR from the census and send enumerators out only with the census schedule.“Each State government must issue executive orders to de-link NPR and census immediately,” they demanded.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/women-activists-write-to-cms-of-states-seeking-de-linking-of-npr-from-census/article31094141.ece

268,2020/03/18,Manish Sisodia directs officials to expedite relief disbursement,"More security to be in place as families shift back to homes

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday convened an urgent meeting to discuss the status of relief disbursement to riot victims.

Health Minister Satyendar Jain, District Magistrate (N.E.), District Magistrate (Revenue), Joint Commissioner of Police and other senior officers were part of the meeting.

As families affected by the riots are in the process of moving back to their homes from the relief camps, the Deputy CM asked for more police officers to be deployed in north-east Delhi, the Delhi government said in a statement.

“As the families are all set to move from the relief camps, it is important for us to ensure a safe environment for them. Tightening security by posting more police officers to the affected regions is a step to get their fears quelled and to restart their lives again. It is also important for us in our peace restoration measures,” Mr. Sisodia was quoted as having said at the meeting.

Errors, duplications

Citing discrepancies in a few forms in the context of misspelt names and duplications, Mr. Sisodia said, “I want to finish relief disbursement as soon as possible. All irregularities with respect to names of victims should be sorted out. I also want you to direct your respective SDMs to speed up the verification process and remove all kinds of duplication found in the relief compensation forms. I want my team to work day and night and wind up the verification immediately,” the Deputy CM was quoted as having said.

So far, a sum of ₹13,51,51,590 has been disbursed to the riot victims, the statement said.

According to the Delhi government, 214 forms have been received for substantial damage to households and 203 of them have been provided with full monetary compensation. Also, 221 forms for households with minor damages have been received out of which 163 have been fully compensated.

Acid attack cases

The Delhi government’s Relief Response Team highlighted three cases in which children were victims of acid attacks, the statement said.

“Acid attack cases have to be treated under the category of grievous injury and the compensation should be given accordingly. It not only impacts someone physically but also pushes the victim into a phase of immense mental trauma,” Mr. Jain was quoted as having said.

Mr. Sisodia, the statement said, also demanded a heightened security system in the form of civil defence personnel deployed at relief camps to keep infiltrators away.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dbji83/article31094132.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL18-SISODIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/manish-sisodia-directs-officials-to-expedite-relief-disbursement/article31094133.ece
269,2020/03/18,Vandalised medical shop in Gautam Vihar opens shutters weeks after violence,"Customers, neighbours told us not to be afraid anymore, says shop owner

In what can be called the first few glimpses of rebuilding lives, a medical shop run by Salman was finally opened on Monday in riot-hit Gautam Vihar. The shop was entirely vandalised and looted by a mob during the violence on February 25.

Showing a video shot by a neighbour which is still on his phone, Salman explained how the shutter was broken and articles in the shop were taken away by men, some of whom had covered their faces with handkerchiefs.

Recalling the incident, Salman said, he and his brother Waseem closed the shop in a hurry, leaving behind the day’s earnings and ₹2 lakh which they had to pay to a distributor. Being the only Muslim-run shop on the stretch, Salman had asked his neighbours to take care as his house in Yamuna Vihar is about 3 km away from the shop and the neighbours tried their best, he said.

Neighbours’ support

“Our neighbours in the street are good people. They told the mob not to harm the shop,” he said.

Referring to one ‘Bablu bhai’, he said: “He [Bablu bhai] had told that if you really worship Lord Ram then don’t do this, but they didn’t listen and continued to chant Jai Shri Ram.” However, the neighbour ensured that the shop was not burnt to ashes. “While I think none of our neighbours were involved in vandalism, there could be others in the area who could have told the rioters that the shop is run by Muslims”.

They damaged one refrigerator and burnt another, he said, adding that most drawers in the shop were broken and looted. “We were informed about the situation by our neighbours. So we called the welder and asked him to at least fix the shutter the same day but when the welder was working, rioters again came and didn’t let him work,” he said.

Salman said he called the police three times on February 25, but no help came his way. “They called me back three days ago to ask why I had called on that day. I told them I have already got an FIR registered,” he said.

Salman and his family didn’t visit their shop for a week after the incident and finally visited later. On the same day, after taking stock, they went to New Usmanpur Police Station and informed the police. The FIR was registered without any hassle, he said.

The 28-year-old said that they still didn’t have the courage to open the shop but their customers encouraged them due to which they could take the decision. “Our customers called us and sympathised. One of the female customers even cried. People residing and working near our store also called and said that we should open again and shouldn’t be afraid anymore,” he said.

Restored back to shape

A week ago, after Holi, the repair work began. A few NGOs raised money for the shop and the family also received a compensation of ₹3 lakh from the government. “We got the whole shop re-painted, changed the shutters, got new mirror shelves and purchased a new refrigerator. We have also started stocking up medicines. Thankfully, our distributors have told us to pay them when we are in a position to,” he said.

With the shop running, the two brothers feed the family of 15, including six children, residing in a four-storey rented accommodation.

“The funds were drying up. Till when could we sit at home? Thank God, we have been able to open,” he said heaving a sigh of relief.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/puh0k5/article31094128.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL18-MEDICALSHOP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/vandalised-medical-shop-opens-shutters-weeks-after-violence/article31094129.ece

272,2020/03/18,Agencies fined ₹1 crore for flouting dust norms,"Delhi Police, DDA among those penalised by the DPCC

The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) on Tuesday issued fines to ongoing construction projects at Delhi Armed Police Line in Dwarka, India International Convention Centre in Dwarka, and multiple projects of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), among others for not following dust-control measures and thus causing air pollution.

Fines worth a total of ₹1 crore were issued to 19 projects across the city following an inspection drive.

“We have issued fines to the Delhi Police, DDA, CPWD (Central Public Works Department) and other private builders for violation of dust control measures. We have issued fines to the agencies that took environmental clearance for these constructions,” a senior DPCC official told The Hindu.

“They will have to pay the fine and then send us a report on corrective measures taken. Later, we will also inspect some of them,” the official added.

The DPCC had carried out an inspection drive from February 15-28 and inspected 57 construction sites. “Of these, 18 project proponents were fined ₹5 lakh each and one has to pay a fine of ₹10 lakh,” the official said.

A set of guidelines on dust control, issued by the Central Pollution Control Board in November 2017, lists outs several measures, including use covering sheets [plastic, tarpaulin, etc] on construction material that can easily get airborne, and on construction and demolition debris.

“Enforcement of dust control measures in building and road construction will have to be strengthened. The government has to ensure compliance and accountability with strong deterrence,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, head of the ‘Clean Air’ programme at the Centre for Science and Environment, Delhi.

“In road construction, no one follows dust control norms. In building construction, big firms follow the measures, but the smaller ones do not,” said C.R. Babu, professor emeritus at Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems, Delhi University.

“Usually such inspection is done during summer, and when pollution peaks in winter. But this year, we have started early and plan to continue the drive,” the DPCC official said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/agencies-fined-1-crore-for-flouting-dust-norms/article31094118.ece

The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), Southern Region, has said the situation arising from COVID-19 pandemic for exporters is grave and many factories across sectors will be forced to slow down or even stop production.

Seeking urgent intervention of State and Central governments, FIEO-SR chairman Israr Ahmed there was a possibility of large-scale cancellation of orders, supply chain disturbance, delayed or even non-payment by the buyers, which would seriously affect cash flow of all exporters.

This put the export sector, especially MSMEs, in a very serious spot, he said. On their part, industries were trying to provide all possible help to employees and co-operate with the government for containing this serious issue.

Mr. Ahmed said this while urging the government to initiate measures for the benefit of exporters, including relaxation of NPA (non-performing asset) norms to accommodate delay in getting payment. “Lack of business coupled with fixed cost will force units to close unless NPA norms are not relaxed,” he said.

Figuring in the list of such measures sought by FIEO-SR are instructions to banks to facilitate faster clearance of credit applications and extend up to 25% automatically the existing credit, extension of export realisation period from 270 to 360 days, instant provision of all ITC/IGST refunds to exporters and deferring ESI payments for three months as well as Advance Tax payment till at least September 30.

279,2020/03/18,Young and in love,"The third segment of Pennaal, a five-part musical tribute to womanhood, releases

The piece begins with a staccato rhythm of the looms. Soon, melody takes over, luring the listener into a dreamy soundscape. ‘Youvanam’, the music video, is a take on youth and its most defining character — love. Director Shyla Thomas says she didn’t have to think twice about the theme. “Youth is a period in one’s life, which is rife with possibilities. And I thought why not choose love to define the period.”

However, she also wanted to keep it simple and relatable. Shot at a weaving unit at Manjavilakam near Neyyattinkara run by Padmashree-winning weaver Gopinath, the hand looms and threads offer a colourful setting for the song. “Love being the central theme, I wanted to draw parallels between the process of weaving and love,” says Shyla. In fact, as the song progresses, the entire process of weaving takes place as a back-story.

The album is a sensitive portrayal of love – the longing, anticipation and joy included.

‘Youvanam’ is from the makers of Pennaal, a collection of five songs that depict the five stages in a woman’s life. Conceptualised by Shyla Thomas and Shani Hafees, Pennaal is a tribute to womanhood.

The previous segments, says Shyla, received encouraging feedback. The first in the series, titled ‘Baalyam’, was released in March 2019 and starred singer Shreya Jayadeep. The video captures the innocence of childhood. In July the same year, the second album, ‘Koumaram’, was released. Directed by national award-winning actor Surabhi Lakshmi, the album depicted adolescence and its complex spectrum of emotions. “Surabhi used elements of Nangiarkoothu to give life to the emotions. And we felt adolescence could be depicted best through dance,” says Shyla.

Shyla, who has dabbled in journalism, poetry, anchoring and direction, says she had been mulling over a concept such as Pennaal for some time. The idea took form and shape after she discussed it with friend and singer Shani. “Surabhi, who is also a dear friend, encouraged me,” says Shyla, who has to her credit a number of songs.

The lyrics, music, direction and acting are mainly by women. ‘Baalyam’ and ‘Koumaram’ were written by Shyla and music was scored by musician Gayathri Suresh. Shani has sung for ‘Koumaram’, which was directed by Surabhi. ‘Youvanam’ was written and sung by Shani and directed by Shyla. The music has been scored by Hindustani singer Madhuwanti Narayan. “We wanted to include as many women on board as possible. In the later segments, we have included violinist Roopa Revathy and tabla artist, Ratnashree Iyer,” says Shyla.

The next in the series is ‘Mathruthwam’ (motherhood), written by Shyla, tuned by Gayathri and sung by Shani. After that comes ‘Vardhakyam’ (old age), also composed by Shyla and composed by Gayathri. The videos are expected to be released this year.

The album consists of a bonus track as well titled Thusharam, a ghazal, which on the pain of separation. Written by Smitha Saleem and composed by Archana Gopinath, it has been sung by Gayathri Suresh.

Cinematographer Pappinu, sound designer Ranganath Ravee and Colourist Ramesh CP have been part of the project too.

‘Youvanam’ was released on actor Mohanlal’s FB page and the poster was released by actor Asha Sarath. Dhanya Ananya, who played a policewoman in the film Ayyapanum Koshiyum, features in the album. The videos are being produced by Timesworld Media and Ayurdha Media House (owned by Shyla and Shani).",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/g3zd5u/article31098539.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpyouvanamjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/youvanam-a-music-video-pays-a-tribute-to-youth/article31098482.ece
280,2020/03/18,Visitors banned in Kozhikode hospitals,"Patients from outside district should inform DMO control room

Visitors have been banned in hospitals in Kozhikode district as a precautionary measure against the spread of COVID-19. A patient being admitted to a hospital should not have more than one bystander.

This is part of the guidelines issued by the Kozhikode district administration to hospitals for COVID-19 treatment in the wake of a suspected patient from Mahe refusing to get admitted to the isolation ward at the Government General Hospital last week. She was later tested positive for the virus.

District Collector S. Sambasiva Rao said in a release on Wednesday that the hospital superintendent should ensure that those under observation for COVID-19 are given proper treatment. Patients coming from outside the district should inform the control room at the office of the District Medical Officer and travel by designated ambulances.

If people under home quarantine need treatment, they should inform the medical officer in the ward-level rapid response team, who should take them to either the Government General Hospital or the Government Medical College Hospital by designated ambulances. The patients should first approach the help desk set up at hospitals and get themselves examined through the triage system. The help desks should have at least one police personnel on duty 24 hours.

Patient coordinators need to ensure that all the patients registering at the help desk are undergoing treatment as per the protocol. These patients should not venture out into public places or use public transport. Those with symptoms needing further treatment should go home by ambulances if they don’t require hospital admission. The ambulance should wait till the examination of the patients at triage-2 are complete. There should be sufficient staff to monitor the movement of people admitted to isolation wards.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/visitors-banned-in-kozhikode-hospitals/article31100432.ece
281,2020/03/18,COVID-19 | Kochi police adopt multi-pronged approach to tackle virus,"Focus on facilitating treatment, set up 70 help desks

The city police commissionerate has stepped up the fight against COVID-19 by adopting a multi-pronged approach focussed on facilitating treatment to the infected and stopping the spread of the disease through intense screening.

The police have set up 70 help desks, 20 each at the South and North railway stations and the Collectorate and five each at Vytilla mobility hub and the KSRTC station, for screening

“We are carrying out screening of everyone entering the city either by bus or train with the help of paramedical staff, which is very critical to identify potential carriers and quarantine them. Apart from screening and checking their temperature, we also track their travel and contact history. Those with symptoms are sent to the government or taluk hospitals where they further screen them and send the potentially serious cases to the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH) at Kalamassery where they are either admitted or quarantined,” said District Police Chief (Kochi City) Vijay Sakhare.

The police screened 2,500 passengers on Monday, out of which 55 suspicious cases were sent to the MCH where five were admitted while the rest were asked to remain quarantined at home.

On Tuesday, 1,700 people were screened, out of which 41 suspicious cases were sent to MCH and all of them were asked to remain in home quarantine. The idea is to identify every suspicious case and quarantine them to ‘break the chain,’ Mr. Sakhare said.

Around 220 people are remaining in home quarantine within the city limits and the police have stepped up monitoring to ensure that they are indeed remaining quarantined and not moving around.

“Every single person is being visited by five different teams and they are being educated about the dangers they pose to their dear ones and others by breaking the quarantine protocol. We also make daily video calls to them and offer them every possible assistance, which is psychologically soothing as they are convinced that they are being cared for,” said Mr. Sakhare.

Besides, the police are cracking down on the fake social media posts, including unscientific advices with the help of the Cyberdome and the Cyber Cell.

The police have suspended giving permissions to all kinds of mass gatherings, whether political or religious, and warned of legal action against those found violating them.

Aid for foreigners

Besides setting up an exclusive control room for the fight against COVID-19, the city police also have started a foreigners outreach desk offering all support to foreigners from accommodation and transport to food.

With 14-days quarantine made mandatory for every foreigner entering the city, the city police commissionerate has commandeered 500 rooms with the approval of the District Collector for quarantine purposes.

“We are also tracking down all foreigners, whether they are in homestays or hotels. They will be asked to undergo the 14-day quarantine either at their place of stay or alternative space will be arranged if they want to move out,” said Mr. Sakhare.

On their part, the police have avoided all physical meetings and shifted them to the virtual platform with the aid of an app. Every police station has also been supplied with protection gear.

The city police commissionerate has also stepped up the social media presence by posting informative videos of authorised agencies on fighting and preventing the epidemic on the Facebook page of the commissionerate.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/omm9en/article31096499.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18KICORONA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/coronavirus-kochi-police-adopt-multi-pronged-approach-to-tackle-virus/article31096500.ece

287,2020/03/18,COVID-19 | A people’s front against the virus,"From Kumbalanghi to St. Teresa’s College in Kochi, commoners are doing their bit to fight the disease

In the famed tourism village of Kumbalanghi, Metilda Michael is engaged in stitching up double-layered, reusable cotton masks. At St. Teresa’s College in Kochi city, a group of the college alumni is busy producing a four-minute video presentation on how to make cotton masks that can be used repeatedly with proper sterilisation. A group of young people at Chembumukku on Kochi’s outskirts has set up a place for passers-by to wash their hands using soap.

The city’s response to the growing threat of COVID-19 has been varied and many.

While Ms. Metilda and her group have been producing masks for use in churches, they are now being supplied to the larger public under Kudumbashree activity groups.

Grace Mathew, 77, a member of the 1962 physics batch at St. Teresa’s College in the city, is part of a team which is producing hundreds of cotton masks that can be reused after being washed in boiled water.

The St. Teresa’ College Women’s Study Centre, Bhoomitra Club and Social Entrepreneurship Unit are involved in the activity.

“The reusable masks are mostly being supplied to personnel in the Police Department who man public spaces including railway and bus stations across the city,” said Nirmala Padmanabhan of the college. There was also a 74-year-old alumni who had volunteered to stitch masks that could be distributed free to police personnel, said Ms. Nirmala.

“We are also producing a short video on how to make masks that can be used safely by the public,” she said.

The masks have been certified by the district medical authorities for their effectiveness. At present, they are being given to police personnel in the city, six each to each of the police personnel so that they will have sufficient time to wash the masks and use them properly.

“Disposable masks have left a huge problem. Thousands of masks are used only once and then thrown away. Reusable masks pose no such issues,” said Ms. Nirmala.

Meanwhile, the Chemistry Department of St. Teresa’s College has come out with a hand sanitiser that has been tested to be effective by the Department of Zoology. Ten litres of the hand sanitiser have already been supplied to the Police Department.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/wkicxb/article31093979.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18KIGRACEMATHEW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/covid-19-a-peoples-front-against-the-virus/article31093980.ece

The government of the People’s Republic of Nagalim, run by the Isak-Muivah faction of NSCN, on Tuesday announced the cancellation or postponement of a string of programmes “to stand in solidarity with the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation”.

“We have decided not to celebrate our Republic Day and postpone our budget session indefinitely,” a spokesperson of the extremist government said from Hebron, the NSCN (IM) headquarters near Nagaland’s Dimapur town.

March 21 is the NSCN (IM)’s Republic Day. The outfit’s government holds the budget session during the last week of March for working out its “tax” structure and expenditure for the fiscal that follows.

The outfit imposes a range of levies such as the annual house tax and periodic taxes on the income of salaried people, professionals and traders. Taxes are also collected from transporters ferrying goods across Nagaland, adjoining Manipur and other areas where the group operates.

The NSCN-IM – other factions too – justify such taxes “because running a government and taking care of those who run it” is expensive.

The other events postponed by the outfit includes the silver jubilee celebration of the Naga Freedom Fighters Widows’ Welfare Federation.

Severe restrictions in the wake of the COVID-19 forced the cancellation of the famous Chaitra Jatra festival at Tara Tarini hill shrine in Odisha’s Ganjam district on Tuesday.

The foothill as well as the temple at the hill top wore a deserted look throughout the day. Except for the servitors and police personnel, no one was allowed to reach the hill top.

Ganjam district administration and Tara Tarini Development Board (TTDB) decided to cancel the Chaitra Jatra as a precautionary measure. Since Monday, entry points of all major roads leading to the shrine have been blocked and police deployed to turn the devotees back.

Besides, restrictions under Section 144 of CrPC imposed by the administration was strictly enforced at the hill shrine. No shops were allowed to open.

The temple was, however, decked up and the servitors performed all the rituals.

A special court of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday accepted the bail plea of Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti leader Akhil Gogoi, who has been behind bars for more than three months.

The NIA had on December 12, 2019, arrested Mr. gogoi for his alleged links with the Maoists and for “abetting, inciting hatred and causing disaffection towards the government” during the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

He was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

Mr. Gogoi’s counsel had on Monday moved the bail petition, which the special court accepted as the NIA could not file a charge sheet against him within 90 days. He was granted bail on a surety of ₹30,000.

NIA officials said they will appeal against the special court’s decision.

291,2020/03/18,COVID-19 casts shadow on Bodoland polls,"Many have raised concerns about election rallies where people would come in close contact

The Assam government’s decision to restrict large gatherings as a precaution against the COVID-19 may cast a shadow on the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) elections scheduled for April 4.

Most of the candidates have filed their nominations for the 40 seats straddling the four districts that comprise the BTC. The deadline for submitting papers is Wednesday and the last date for withdrawal of candidature is March 21.

People across the BTC, particularly in headquarters Kokrajhar and other towns, have raised concerns about the poll campaign and election rallies where hundreds of people come in close contact.

No instructions yet

“We have not had any instructions,” said Pramod Boro, president of the United People’s Party Liberal, which seeks to end the 17-year rule of the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) in the BTC. “So the election is on unless a decision is taken in view of the pandemic,” he added. Mr. Boro filed his nomination from the Tamulpur council seat on Monday.

A former ally of the Congress, the BPF has also been ruling Assam as one of two minor regional partners of the Bharatiya Janata Party since 2016.

“Our feedback is that there is no threat of the virus in the BTC areas, as people from outside are not involved in campaigns,” Assam’s Social Welfare Minister Pramila Rani Brahma told The Hindu.

“There is no need to panic and impact the polls,” she added.

Ms. Brahma represents the BPF from the Kokrajhar East Assembly constituency and is one of the key campaigners of the party.

The Congress, however, contended that it would be foolish to think that the people of BTC were immune to the virus that has killed more than 6,000 people across the globe.

‘Take no chances’

“Why was the decision to hold the polls taken in such a crisis,” asked State Congress general secretary Durga Das Boro. “I have told the State election authority that we should not take any chances against the pandemic,” he added.

The State Election Commission, which is conducting the council polls, said any decision on rescheduling the polls would be taken by the Governor, who is the constitutional head of areas under the Sixth Schedule.

The 8,871 sq km BTC falls under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution.

Governor Jagdish Mukhi could not be contacted immediately, but a Raj Bhavan official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the matter would be discussed.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/covid-19-casts-shadow-on-bodoland-polls/article31093909.ece
292,2020/03/18,Splurge another day,"Fashion industry goes into a pause mode as social distancing gains priority and weddings and gatherings are called off

The summer wedding season in Hyderabad began in February and will continue till the end of April 2020. Many who are part of the fashion and textile industry count on the wedding season to make a tidy sum. The cheer is usually prevalent across the board — from design studios dealing with couture and pret to the gullies of Ameerpet, Abids and lad Bazaar where retailers sell fabric and garments, and craftspeople are engaged in block printing and zardosi embroidery.

It looked like there was no stopping this revelry until COVID-19 positive cases began to emerge in the city. With the focus shifting rightfully towards health, hygiene and essential supplies, the fashion and textile industry is on a pause mode. There have been fewer walk-ins at stores and designers admit that online orders too have slowed down, as not many are in the mood to buy.

It’s a similar situation in other cities. Mumbai designer Nachiket Barve puts things in perspective when he says, “Buying clothes is the last in everyone’s priority at the moment; people are stocking up on medicines and food. Fashion is supposed to be celebrated in a feel-good environment where you can step out and socialise with their friends and families. Given the Coronavirus outbreak, globally the fashion business has taken a hit.”

The Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI) postponed the India Fashion Week that was scheduled from March 11 to 15 in New Delhi. Multi-designer lifestyle exhibitions in different cities, organised by fashion entrepreneurs, have also been rescheduled.

Change in schedule India Fashion Week scheduled to be held in New Delhi from March 11 to 15 has been postponed.

Copenhagen Fashion Summit 2020, scheduled to be held in May, will now be held in October.

Valmort Barcelona Bridal Fashion Week has been deferred to June instead of April, as originally planned.

Others who’ve rescheduled their meets include the Sustainable Apparel Coalition that had planned an event in Bangkok, Intertextile Shanghai Apparel Fabrics Spring Edition, and Kingpins Hong Kong.

At the Milan Fashion Week in February, Giorgio Armani showcased his new collection in an empty, closed studio and preferred to live stream it than invite visitors, as Italy witnessed a spurt in Coronavirus cases. COVID-19 spread being declared a pandemic by World Health Organisation led to international stores shutting down and the ripple effects began to be felt in India, especially in design houses that export orders. “Inevitably, manufacturing will slow down,” says Nachiket.

Hyderabad-based designer Ganesh Nallari points out that in the city, the impact of the slowdown will be felt by the smaller vendors than design studios: “A cradle ceremony for which we had designed has been cancelled. People have postponed weddings scheduled in April. We design classic pieces that are not bound by changing trends or seasons and hence can be sold later, when things look up. There’s less demand now and it’s a dull scenario everywhere. In case of traditional South Indian weddings where brides prefer Kanchi pattu saris, nothing will go out of fashion. But if there’s a lot of stock that doesn’t move, how much more orders will the weavers continue to get?”

Having visited Krishna Nagar market earlier this week, Ganesh observes how the usually bustling shops barely have customers: “A few shopkeepers have brought their children along to the store since schools are shut.”

Ganesh Nallari

At his Chic Pea Studios in Banjara Hills, the staff has been sensitised about safety measures. “We are taking a call on a day to day basis on running the studio, so that no one is put to risk,” adds Ganesh.

Textile designer Gaurang Shah is also witnessing the change in scenario. Within an hour of the Hyderabad store opening in the morning, he’s habituated to seeing at least 20 walk-ins, which has now trickled down to one or two. “Buying has come down to about 10%,” he says. Production hasn’t slowed down yet for Gaurang’s label, and he attributes it to his orders being primarily taken up by weavers in rural pockets across the country who work from home. As for his store, he too avers that decisions will be taken on a day-to-day basis.

Manufacturing units that deal with materials that were until now being sourced from China will be roughing out, explains Nachiket, pointing out how manufacturers of shoes and handbags use heels, buckles and zips sourced from China.

The workflow has slowed down at Nachiket’s production house as film shootings in Mumbai have been cancelled. “Social distancing is our priority,” he affirms.

293,2020/03/18,Taxi drivers crying for a little compassion,"Corona scare adds to their professional crisis

The taxi drivers in the State are requesting the compassion of the State government to tide over their professional crisis due to the COVID-19 situation.

A State-level meeting of Karuna Taxi Drivers Organisation here recently urged the government to take immediate steps to reduce the financial burden on them at a time when they are struggling to make ends meet.

“With the shut down of the tourism sector, and all public functions and weddings cancelled, there are not many customers. The arrival of tourists is minimal,” said Kasim P.K., State general secretary of the organisation, pointing out that the taxi sector had barely recovered from the setback caused by Nipah infection and the two floods, before the COVID struck.

Most of the taxi drivers have purchased their vehicles on loans, some from private money lenders. The agencies are breathing down their necks in March threatening to seize the vehicles. The government can issue a moratorium to free the drivers from their bank loans, but even that does not apply to private loan sharks. “The government could at least request them to give us some time, at least a couple of months to recover from our losses,” Mr. Kasim said.

The government’s insistence for the taxis to be equipped with GPS and speed governors is also being questioned by the taxi drivers. “The GPS is a big business. If the government is concerned about travellers’ safety, it could bring out its own software and distribute among the taxi drivers, not encourage the private service providers,” he said pointing out that the GPS ould cost a driver around ₹15,000.

He suggested that the speed governors be made mandatory for all, not just taxis which are driven by very experienced drivers. “It is usually private vehicles driven by youngsters that land in accidents. They are the ones that need to have speed governors,” Mr. Kasim said, adding that the State could help the taxi sector by not insisting on speed governors and GPS at a time when there are more pressing matters at hand.

The organisation has brought these issues to the notice of the Chief Minister and ministers of Transport and Finance and awaiting action.

Meanwhile, the drivers have received specific guidelines on measures to be taken while transporting passengers to and fro the airports. “We are not to stop anywhere on the way, not even for food,” he added.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/taxi-drivers-crying-for-a-little-compassion/article31100721.ece
294,2020/03/18,IMA calls for caution toavoid community spread,"People urged to opt for social isolation for two weeks

The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has urged the people to exercise caution in the next two weeks to stop the community spread of COVID-19 in the State.

IMA north zone secretary Ajit Bhaskar and former State president V.G. Pradeep Kumar told the media on Wednesday that people some how were under the impression that the infection was not as dangerous considering its low mortality rate. This had led to laxity and people were found to come out of their homes avoiding guidelines on social distancing. This would turn out to be counterproductive, they warned.

The IMA functionaries pointed out that the infection could spread in an exponential way if community spread happens and thousands might get affected in just 10 days. It would have an adverse impact on those aged above 60, whose mortality rate could go up to 15%. “In such a situation the focus will be on reducing the number of deaths. This would force both private and government hospitals to work on a war footing. The IMA is collecting details about the intensive care units and ventilators in Kozhikode district,” Dr. Bhaskar said.

To avoid such a situation, Dr. Pradeep Kumar said, the people should opt for social isolation and social distancing. Those returning from abroad should force themselves to 14 days of home quarantine. “Also, we need to void unnecessary travelling. We need to avoid social events such as weddings and other gatherings for the time being,” Dr. Pradeep Kumar said.

The IMA also sought restrictions on hospital visits. It suggested online consultation for those who are undergoing continuous treatment for diseases such as diabetes and cardiac problems. Operations other than emergency ones should be postponed. Both the patients and their relatives and bystanders should be given tips on hygiene. The IMA has set up a helpline (9895410576) to clarify the doubts of people.

“We need to avoid a situation where the infection spreads among the health fraternity. If doctors are quarantined, their services will not be available for the next 14 days. That will lead to a disastrous situation,” Dr. Bhaskar cautioned.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/ima-calls-for-caution-toavoid-community-spread/article31099444.ece
295,2020/03/18,"No COVID-19, but girl ostracised","MADURAI

A 19-year-old girl from a village near Usilampatti who tested negative for COVID-19 faced hostility from the people of her village who asked her not to come back home on Wednesday.

The girl, who was waiting at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) here said though she was completely fine, she could not comprehend why people were scared of her presence.

Her mother said their relatives even refused to speak to them over the phone because they were worried about catching COVID-19. “By showing her picture, the media created a lot of panic about our child’s cough even without confirming the results,” she said.

On Monday, the girl, accompanied by her mother, visited the local Primary Health Centre (PHC) with severe cough. “Since the cough got worse, we went to Usilampatti Government Hospital, where the doctor asked me why I had brought my daughter to the hospital. She said I was spreading the infection to other patients and immediately sent us to Madurai Government Rajaji Hospital in an ambulance,” she said.

The mother added that it took only a few hours for the doctors there to diagnose that she had infective bronchitis. “The whole village panicked after the media circulated her picture. Nobody wants us to return home. We are wondering if we should stay in Tiruppur for a couple of days,” she said.

Deputy Director (Health) P. Priya Raj said employees of the nearest PHC were sent to the village to sensitise the people . “We will ensure that education is passed on to them to put an end to the panic,” she said.

The girls’ father said they were armed with a number of certificates proving that she was in good shape. “This has definitely affected our livelihood as people would boycott our family business.

298,2020/03/18,COVID-19 scare: police invoking Disaster Management Act,"Two persons have been arrested under the Act in Madurai district

MADURAI

Within days after the Centre declared COVID-19 a national disaster, Tamil Nadu police are invoking the Disaster Management Act against those who are violating the restrictions and the regulations imposed by the State government to prevent spread of the viral disease. Two cases were booked under the Act in Madurai district on Tuesday.

While Madurai City police booked a person for running a bar attached to a TASMAC retail shop in violation of government’s order to close bars till March 31, Madurai District police booked a person for spreading “false” message through Whatsapp about the threat of ‘Corona virus’ spreading.

A team of Prohibition Enforcement Wing on Tuesday found that one N. Ibrahim of Ramanathapuram had kept the bar open in Mela Anupanadi and entertained a big gathering of customers with liquor and eatables. The State government had ordered closure of schools, colleges and some commercial establishments from Tuesday.

“This restriction is to prevent crowding of people to avoid possible spread of the virus. All malls, cinema theatres, gyms, clubs and bars have been ordered to close down till March 31. However, this bar was kept open and guests were being supplied liquor and snacks, putting their health in danger,” Commissioner of Police (Madurai City) S. Davidson Devasirvatham said.

The police seized 56 Indian-Made Foreign Liquor bottles and arrested Ibrahim for obstructing the police from discharging their duty under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code and for refusing to comply with the government’s order under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005.

Meanwhile, a video clipping of ‘Corona virus spreading to 47 persons’ in Rajakkoor, sent by M. Selvam (40) of Manachanallur in Tiruchi, went viral on social media. The police said the man who was operating harvester machinery attempted to create panic among the people by saying people affected with COVID-19 were being provided accommodation and given treatment at an apartment constructed by Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board under Othakadai police station limits.

“We have booked him under Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act, for creating a false alarm on a disaster with a view to creating panic,” Superintendent of Police N. Manivannan said.

300,2020/03/18,Dip in passenger ratio as apprehension rises,"With the closure of schools and colleges across the State and fear of coronavirus gripping residents, there has been a significant dip in the occupancy ratio in buses operated by Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation in Madurai.

There has been at least a 30% decline in occupancy ratio of city buses, according to officials.

On Tuesday, a considerable number of students vacated college hostels and boarded mofussil buses to neighbouring districts. However, the occupancy ratio is expected to decline further n the coming days.

Most of the city buses are plying with vacant seats, says a TNSTC time keeper. “Buses going towards Tirumangalam are usually crowded. However, only 50% of seats were filled on Tuesday.”

The occupancy ratio of buses plying towards Alanganallur, Vadipatti, Kuruvithurai, Chekkanoorani and Kariapatti has reduced by around 30%, he adds.

S. Mani, who runs a shop near Periyar bus stand, points to increasing awareness among residents of COVID- 19, which is why they may wish to steer clear of public transport. “Also, some businesses are insisting that their employees travel in their own vehicle or use private transport. This can also be a reason for fall in number of passengers,” he says.

When it comes to mofussil buses, a large number of students vacating college hostels boarded buses going to nearby districts including Tiruchi, Tirunelveli, Ramanathapuram and Chennai. “Barring the college students, the number of passengers has shrunk over the past few days. Also, at M.G.R. bus stand in Mattuthavani, only buses proceeding towards Paramakudi boasted of full capacity,” says Murugan, Assistant Engineer, M.G.R. Bus Stand.

According to a senior official, a decision has been to reduce around 50 buses plying through main routes from Wednesday. “Once the passenger ratio increases, we will increase the deployment.”

R. Divya, a final-year university student who reached Madurai on Tuesday, says she is apprehensive over whether precautionary measures have been implemented. “We have no option other than to take the bus,” she feels

TNSTC officials, however, have started spraying disinfectants inside and other parts of each and every bus, points out Mr. Murugan.

“The exercise is carried out at the respective depots. Also, we have instructed bus drivers and conductors to wash their hands regularly,” the official adds.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/z4f0p3/article31094084.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA18-BUSCOVID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/dip-in-passenger-ratio-as-apprehension-rises/article31094083.ece
301,2020/03/18,Decline in number of devotees to prominent shrines in temple city,"Officials issue strict instructions to staff, priests and devotees; visitors from north India continue to arrive in bus loads

With guidelines set by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department to ensure restricted entry into temples due to COVID-19, officials say there has been a drop in the number of visitors at major temples in Madurai.

Officials at Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple say that despite fair warnings sounded out to travellers, there is a minimum of 10,000 devotees visiting the temple. However, there have been a few or no international visitors.

On Tuesday, the streets around the temple, which usually brim with tourists, only had a few people milling around.

C. Ramarathinam, a bangle salesman inside the temple, points out that March is usually a lean period as students appear for board examinations and, hence, families restrict travel during the time. “The spread of newsreports about COVID-19, however, is reducing the number of visitors even further. Only a few north Indian tourists continue to visit the temple,” he says.

Joint Commissioner of the temple N. Natarajan says an elaborate meeting was held on Tuesday with officials from the Department of Public Health, who are calling for a minimum of two feet distance between devotees waiting in queue. “We have explicitly stated that priests must avoid any form of touch while providing tulsi and viboothi. Staff, too, must regularly wash their hands,” he lists out.

Besides, disinfectants have been sprayed at the shoe stand, mobile phone deposit area, frisking points and all entrances of the massive temple complex.

However, those posted at vulnerable spots, particularly police officials at the frisking point and those manning the shoe stands, do not wear any masks. Police personnel frisking too do not wear gloves.

At Subramaniaswamy Temple in Tirupparankundram, there has been a significant drop in the number of devotees, says Munusu Senthil, a local resident, whose family has been associated with the shrine for many years. “There are announcements asking devotees to leave as soon as they finish darshan,” he says.

However, the temple has not made any stipulation on the distance to be maintgained between devotees.

At Alagar Koil, display boards have been kept informing devotees about the viral outbreak, according to Deputy Commissioner (in-charge) T. Anitha. “We have also asked the priests to gently communicate to devotees on giving or taking any offerings,” she says.

303,2020/03/18,"TNCCI flays hike in excise duty on petrol, diesel","The Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TNCCI) on Tuesday described the Central government’s decision to hike excise duty on petrol and diesel despite the steep fall in international crude oil prices as ‘distressing’.

In a joint statement, TNCCI President N. Jegatheesan and Secretary J. Selvam said everyone expected a reduction in fuel prices by at least by ₹10 per litre.

“Instead, the Central government has chosen to increase the crude oil price by ₹3 per litre. It is calculated that the Centre government will procure an additional revenue of ₹39,000 crore by this price escalation,” they added.

It was ironic that whenever crude oil prices increased in international markets, petrol and diesel prices within India were hiked pro rata. However, when the prices came down, the resultant benefits did not percolate to the people, they said.

“From November 2014 and November 2016, the Central government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel prices nine times. It is worth noting that whenever the crude oil prices fell during that period, the Central government devoured the benefit through taxes instead of passing it on to the people,” the TNCCI fuctionaries said.

The Central government needs to ensure that prices are reduced within 15 days after calibration to ensure that it provided space for revival of the Indian economy.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/tncci-flays-hike-in-excise-duty-on-petrol-diesel/article31094039.ece
304,2020/03/18,"Growing pedal power, shrinking safe spaces","The number of recreational cycling enthusiasts is up in the city, but there is no plan or policy to ensure their safety

There is a need to create infrastructure for non-motorised transport, particularly cycles, in Madurai, to promote eco-friendly and cheap means of travel within the city, say residents and enthusiasts.

Despite the rise in the number of recreational cycling enthusiasts here, there is no plan or policy in place to ensure safe passage for cyclists. Other major cities in the country, including Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and Mysore, have created pathways and public bike sharing systems to popularise cycling. Cyclists call for a review of the current system and seek respect on city roads.

Predicaments

On weekends, it is common to see flocks of cyclists in colourful clothes pedalling through the highways near Madurai. Most ride on the four-way route to Rameswaram and to picturesque villages such as Kilakuyilkudi, Alanganallur and Alagarkoil to avoid congestion on city roads. They start as early as 4 a.m. and 5 a.m.

C. Senthil, founder, Madurai Peddlers Club, says members of his group often ride 15-20 km from the city on highways to cycle without hindrance. In the last year, the club has seen a large influx of young and old residents looking to improve their fitness and moving towards sustainable means of transport, he says.

People working in multinational companies too have begun cycling to work too. However, the lack of a cycle track within the city leaves them jostling with two-wheelers and auto drivers who barely provide space for them.

K. Kutti Muthukumar, who began the City Cycling Club in Madurai, says in jest that cyclists are often subject to the choicest of abuses. “Despite riding predominantly on highways, we end up having to use at least 12 km of city roads. They are not in proper condition. People also misjudge the speed in which we ride our bikes, so we end up having to be extra cautious.”

In order to promote riding, his club is hosting a ‘Safe City Riding’ workshop on Saturday at Kilakuyilkudi to teach riders how to navigate through the city. “A basic infrastructure that is lacking in the city is a dedicated space to park our cycles. In European countries, they have such facilities near malls, railway stations and bus stands. If it is created, more people will be willing to take their cycles out for their work everyday and shopping,” he contends.

G. K. Phiramoth, a 14-year-old who rides to school, says the poor quality of road impacts his bicycle and leads to the need for more maintenance too.

In order to promote alternative means of travel, a Corporation official calls for the creation of a non-motorised transport policy for the city.

Systematic changes

“There is very little space for the creation of separate bicycle pathways as they will require a minimum of two metres. Major roads in the city have only around six metres of width. We lack proper four-lane ways, which have a width of 15 metres,” he says.

To ensure change, a survey of all available roads in Madurai and the number of cycle-users must be created as there is no such document yet. Wide roads whose shoulders are mud and dirt tracks can be effectively converted into bicycle pathways by laying concrete or bitumen as well.

“On a trial basis, we can create a bicycle path on all major one-way streets including South Marret Street. We can also help the cyclists ride through the city near Teppakulam by making the area traffic-free for a couple of hours during the day. There are many walkers on the stretch,” he says.

Urban planner and architect R. M. Valliappan says cities like Delhi and Chennai have been able to effectively implement the creation of cycle paths only because they have tree-lined roads. “If we create a comfortable setting for residents to ride their bikes, create a bike exchange programme near major bus stands where people do not have to even own cycles and ensure proper implementation of policy-level changes, we can surely have more riders on the streets.”

K. R. Baviithran, a cycling enthusiast, says promoting cycle as a fitness activity will also ensure more number of cycle riders. “While clubs are independently promoting cycling, the State too should contribute by raising awareness of the benefits of cycling in the long run.”

S. Mrinalini, a student of Class 12 who rides a bike provided by the State government to school, says she would like a sheltered cycle parking facility.

“Most of us cannot afford two-wheelers and are dependent on cycle or public transport. When we grow up, our aspiration is to buy a two-wheeler and not stick to riding bikes as it is easier for commuting. I am conscious of the impact on the environment but if we are provided better connectivity through public transport and good bikes, I would not mind riding it for a lifetime,” the student argues.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/5pbz4x/article31096577.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CyclingJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/growing-pedal-power-shrinking-safe-spaces/article31094020.ece

The close contacts of a Kasaragod resident, who travelled by the Dubai-Mangaluru Air India Express flight and has tested positive for COVID-19, have been jointly traced by the surveillance teams from Dakshina Kannada and Kasaragod (Kerala) districts and have been home quarantined, said Health and Family Welfare Minister B. Sriramulu here on Tuesday.

The Kasaragod resident arrived at the Mangaluru International Airport on March 14 and had tested negative for COVID-19 during the screening at the airport. Later, he left by a private vehicle to Kasaragod where he was under home quarantine. He tested positive for COVID-19 on Monday evening.

Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner Sindhu B. Rupesh said they worked in coordination with Kasaragod surveillance team in tracing all the passengers in the flight and also those in the vehicle the passenger travelled to Kasaragod. They are being home quarantined for 14 days as per the standard operating procedure.

Earlier, during the review of the preparedness of the district to combat COVID-19, Mr. Sriramulu said the Chief Minister has approved setting up a virology laboratory at the Government Wenlock Hospital. The government has approved setting up such laboratories in Government Medical Colleges in 17 districts.

“As Mangaluru is close to Kasaragod and gets good number of patients from other parts of Karnataka, we will have a laboratory here shortly,” Mr. Sriramulu said.

The hospital representatives said laboratory will be a reality in two weeks from now.

Presently the throat swab samples from Dakshina Kannada are being sent for testing to the Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory in Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences. Four other authorised laboratories are at the Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute, National Institute of Virology Field Unit in Bengaluru, Mysuru Medical College and Research Institute, and Shivamogga Institute of Medical Sciences.

308,2020/03/18,COVID-19 | Temple ‘sevas’ across Dakshina Kannada cancelled,"This is precautionary measure taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19

Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner Sindhu B. Rupesh issued an order on Tuesday cancelling all temple ‘sevas’ in the district with immediate effect as a precautionary measure taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Devotees are allowed to have only darshan and not allowed to stay in the temples, till further orders, she said.

Dakshina Kannada has some well-known temples which attract a huge number of devotees especially during the summer. Some of them are Kukke Subrahmanya Temple, Kateel Durgaparameshwari Temple, Dharmasthala Manjunatha Temple, and Mangaluru Mangaladevi Temple.

With the Deputy Commissioner’s order, the ‘sarpa samskara’ and ‘ashlesha bali’ sevas in Kukke Subrahmanya Temple stand cancelled.

The order on cancelling the temple ‘sevas’ has been issued as a step to discourage devotees from visiting the temples in huge numbers.

The order said that only the temple staff should participate in the annual ‘jatras’ (fairs) and the participation of other people in general has been restricted. People should not enter temples, churches, and mosques in groups, she said.

According to the order, no summer camps, seminars and conferences should be organised now. It said that the entry of people to beaches has been restricted and marriages should be organised simply by ensuring that they are not crowded.

The order said that those managing the hostels and paying guest accommodations should advise the students to return to their homes in case if the educational institutes in which they are studying had declared a holiday. In case the students wanted to remain there, they should be convinced on maintaining individual cleanliness in view of COVID-19.

The hostels and paying guest accommodations should maintain cleanliness on their premises. If they failed to adhere to the guidelines issued, action would be initiated against such authorities, the order said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/vobe1n/article31093490.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGKUKKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/dc-cancels-temple-sevas-across-dakshina-kannada/article31096173.ece
309,2020/03/18,"Coronavirus: RBI to inject ₹10,000 crore liquidity into market on Friday","The bank has decided to conduct open market operations on March 20, 2020.

The Reserve Bank will inject liquidity of ₹10,000 crore through open market operations on Friday to maintain financial stability in the system in the wake of coronavirus outbreak in the country.

“With the heightening of COVID-19 pandemic risks, certain financial market segments have been experiencing a tightening of financial conditions as reflected in the hardening of yields and widening of spreads.

“It is important to ensure that all market segments remain liquid and stable, and function normally,” RBI said in a release on Wednesday.

Accordingly, the Reserve Bank has decided to conduct open market operations on March 20, 2020 (Friday) in the form of purchase of an aggregate amount of ₹10,000 crore of government securities through a multi-security auction using the multiple price method, it said.

It will purchase securities with coupon rate of 8.20% (maturity February 15, 2022); 7.37% (April 16, 2023); 7.32% (January 28, 2024) and 7.72% (May 25, 2025).

RBI said there is no notified amount against any of these securities within the aggregate ceiling of ₹10,000 crore set for the operation.

The result of the auction will be announced on the same day and payment to successful participants will be made during banking hours on March 23, 2020 (Monday).

Successful participants should ensure availability of requisite amount of securities in their SGL accounts by 12 noon on March 23, 2020 (Monday), it added.

Watch: COVID-19: Masks and sanitisers are now essential commodities

Earlier on Monday, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the regulator has “enough policy tools and stands ready to take any measures” needed to help the economy tide over the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

In two liquidity enhancing measures, Mr. Das announced another round of $ 2 billion dollar-rupee swap on March 23, and in another measure he said the RBI will continue to conduct the long-term repo operations (LTROs) of up to ₹1 lakh crore as and when the market needs it.

On March 16, the RBI conducted the first dollar-swap for $ 2 billion under which the central bank buys rupee from the market by selling the dollars.

On the LTROs, it has already conducted four rounds worth ₹1 lakh crore operations since February 14, after announcing it at the February 6 policy review.

310,2020/03/18,Coronavirus | Moody’s downgrades outlook for shipping to negative due to COVID-19 pandemic,"The EBITDA of shipping companies globally could decline by 25-30%, the rating agency said

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and deteriorating global economic outlook, ratings agency Moody’s has changed its forecast for the shipping industry to negative for the next 12-18 months from stable.

“We have changed our outlook for the global shipping industry to negative from stable. This outlook reflects our expectations for the fundamental business conditions in the industry over the next 12 to 18 months,” the agency said in a statement.

According to Moody’s, the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of shipping companies will decline in 2020 amid sharply reduced demand for shipping services in the wake of the coronavirus.

“This is because of the expected impact of the outbreak on Chinese manufacturing output and demand for coal and iron ore in China, especially during the first half of 2020, as well as related economic disruption. As a result, we have changed the outlook for the global shipping industry to negative from stable,” it said.

Moody’s expects the EBITDA of rated shipping companies to decline by around 6-10% in 2020 compared with EBITDA growth of almost 40% in 2019.

The EBITDA of shipping companies globally could decline by 25-30%, similar to levels last seen in 2016 when Hanjin Shipping Co went bankrupt in one of the largest recent failures in the sector, it said.

The agency had maintained a stable outlook for the global shipping industry since May 2017.

“We expect the supply-demand balance to tilt toward oversupply for the container shipping and dry bulk segments, especially in the first half of this year. The situation is more positive for tankers at the moment given the recent sharp drop in oil prices. We had previously expected demand and supply growth to be largely balanced across these three key shipping segments in 2020,” Moody’s said.

It further noted that the revised supply and demand forecasts reflects its expectations for the conditions in the specific industry sectors taking into account historical industry trends as well as the likely effect of the coronavirus.

The agency had recently revised down its 2020 baseline growth forecasts for all G-20 economies because it expected the coronavirus to hurt economic growth in many countries through first half of 2020 and to hamper trade.

Even if it has maintained a negative outlook for container segment, the recent drop in oil prices is a positive sign as it will help offset fuel costs, especially in light of the IMO 2020 low sulphur fuel regulations that came into effect in January, Moody’s said.

According to the agency, some container liners have indicated that the activity in China is picking up, which is a positive, but it is also mindful of the potential for reduced commercial activity in Europe and North America as these regions battle the coronavirus.

“Although there are a number of large deliveries of new vessels anticipated in 2020, we would expect many of them to be postponed. Also, the outlook for the dry bulk segment has changed to negative from stable. China is the largest importer of dry bulk commodities and the sharp reduction of Chinese demand sent the Baltic Dry Index (BDI), a key benchmark for dry bulk shipping, toward historical lows,” it said.

Moody’s, however, noted that it would consider revising the outlook to stable if both the oversupply of vessels declines materially such that shipping supply growth does not exceed demand growth by more than 2% and year-over-year EBITDA growth appears likely to be between -5 and +10%.

“The industry outlook does not represent a sum of upgrades, downgrades or ratings under review, or an average of the rating outlooks of issuers in the industry, but rather our assessment of the main direction of business fundamentals within the overall industry,” it added.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/4ua4d8/article31099163.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHENNAIPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/coronavirus-moodys-downgrades-outlook-for-shipping-to-negative-due-to-covid-19-pandemic/article31099164.ece

313,2020/03/18,We need more policewomen,"Increasing the number of women recruits alone will not be enough; institutional changes are as important

At least since 2009, when the Home Ministry set 33% as the target for women’s representation in the police, increasing women’s recruitment in the police force has been the goal of the Central and State governments. Yet, India persists with a male-dominated police force. In 2019, women comprised less than 10% of police personnel. Only seven States (Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Sikkim) had more than 10% policewomen. In fact, there has been only a 5% increase in the number of policewomen in a decade (3.65% in 2009 to 8.98% in 2019).

Reservation has been the primary tool to increase women’s representation. Yet, no government has developed an action plan with clear timelines to meet the quota within a specified time period. Thus, it is not surprising that the annual change in the share of women in the police force from 2012 to 2016 was found to be less than 1% across States, according to the India Justice Report, 2019. At this rate, most States will take over 50 years to achieve the 33% target.

Selective implementation

While States adopt the reservation policy, they are very selective about its implementation. Very few States apply reservation for women at all the entry points (constable, sub-inspector, and deputy superintendent of police levels) or to all posts at each level. Some States (Kerala and Karnataka) have reservation for women only at the constable rank. Some (Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu) extend it to the constable and sub-inspector ranks. But here too there are restrictions: reservation is limited to specific cadre posts within each rank.

This has resulted in huge disparity in the representation of women across ranks. There are far fewer women at the gazetted ranks at the State level (assistant sub-inspector to deputy superintendent of police) than those at the constabulary level. This means that women are most prominent in the most junior ranks. While this is not a negative in itself, in the absence of institutional support, women remain in large numbers at the bottom of the ladder without moving up.

Restricting women’s quotas to entry levels or select posts not only shrinks the potential pool of women recruits in a given year but also reduces the proportion of women likely to get promoted to leadership and supervisory positions. As a consequence, there are not enough women personnel to perform exclusive functions when gender-based crimes are reported. For instance, in 2013, the Home Ministry said that at least three women sub-inspectors should be available in a police station as investigating officers. Tamil Nadu, which has the highest percentage of women personnel (17.46%), requires 6,057 women sub-inspectors to meet this standard across its 2,019 police stations. At present, it has barely one-fourth of that requirement.

Also Read A model policy for women in the police

Also worrying are signs that States with relatively high proportions of policewomen appear to hit a plateau. The figure for policewomen in Maharashtra and Himachal Pradesh has stayed at around 12% for the past four years. Some places like Chandigarh have even recorded a decline.

Challenges

It is time to look beyond numbers to institutional barriers that hinder women’s growth within the service. Frequent inter-district transfers and disallowing postings in home districts for specified periods of time coupled with poor childcare support systems and lack of adequate facilities and infrastructure present distinct difficulties for women. Taken together, these and other barriers limit the avenues for women’s promotion. Sexual harassment at the workplace that policewomen suffer is not adequately acknowledged. There is even less recognition of the impact that the policing sub-culture, with its association with “masculinity” and coercive force, has on the participation of women. No wonder it is common to hear the police being described as policemen — as if women in the police don’t exist at all.

The underlying assumption seems to be that an increase in numbers will automatically make the organisational culture more egalitarian. This is far from the truth. Women are typecast — for example, they are asked to deal with crimes against women, while they are kept outside the mainstream of varied experiences. As a result, new recruits will become increasingly ghettoised in the absence of a framework to guide their career path. Increasing the number of recruits alone will not be enough; institutional changes embedded in principles of diversity, inclusion and equality of opportunities are as important. Otherwise, discrimination and exclusion will continue to persist even as the numbers of women increase.

314,2020/03/18,Revisiting scientific temper,"In the wake of COVID-19, Indians have made some progress towards inculcating a scientific temper

An unexpected outcome of COVID-19 is the growing awareness of how disease is transmitted and what might be done to prevent this. Virtually every TV channel has insisted on washing hands with soap or alcohol-based sanitizer, sneezing into the crook of one’s elbow or coughing into a handkerchief, besides keeping a safe distance from one another. These precautions presuppose an elementary understanding that COVID-19 spreads through the inhalation of droplets released by the infected person’s cough or sneeze and by contact with infected surfaces. The existence of bacteria and viruses that invade our bodies and cause the infection is also part of this presupposition. In short, this indicates a tacit acceptance of elements of the empirical-causal world view. It was heartening to see even babas and yogis concede that if symptoms include respiratory disorder and high fever, then contacting doctors trained in evidence-based medical systems is necessary. Baba Ramdev even admitted on TV that no evidence exists that by drinking cow urine, one could cure COVID-19, even though, he claimed, it could help in preventing it.

Towards fact-based reasoning

It does not follow from this that our society has imbibed this outlook on the world, for many astrologers were seen claiming that SARS-CoV-2 was caused by the conjunction of Rahu and Ketu. Some swamis are convinced that the cure lies in propitiating the virus by performing rituals, accompanied by a cocktail of cow urine, dung and ghee. Even so, it is heartening that when push comes to shove, many Indians might be more willing to rely on evidence-based reasoning than on ineffective, false speculations or brazen misinformation. When what is at stake is life itself, people choose whatever they find is effective. Should we not assume that they do so because at least some of them are convinced that performing rituals is unlikely to produce the desired outcome, but regular washing of hands might? That the Rahu-Ketu story is less plausible than the virus-infection story? This switch from speculative stories involving malignant spirits to stories involving non-subjective, material, observable entities occurs when people themselves experience what works and what does not.

Two generations or so earlier, curative pill-popping became part of the wider public culture. Although its misuse, dangers and excesses are well-documented, it can’t be denied that careful intake of pills, under expert supervision, and in correct dosage, can help cure infectious disease. With our rather enlightened response to COVID-19, we appear to have reached a similar stage in the public culture of disease prevention. Equally important is scrupulous data gathering. Indian TV channels continually gave figures on how many people are infected by SARS-CoV-2; the countries where the incidence of disease was high; what percentage was cured and what percentage died; of those who succumbed, how many already suffered from other fatal ailments; and whether or not a correlation exists between age, propensity to infection and fatality. There is greater public awareness about the role of data in disease management and prevention. These are small steps towards the wider acceptance of evidence-based reasoning, a tiny victory for the empirical-causal explanatory story of the world. Since these are crucial ingredients of the scientific outlook, one can even say that we have made some progress towards inculcating a scientific temper.

Observing, classifying, recognising patterns of regularity, and identifying causes are all integral features of science. Yet, not all of us do science. Nor do we need to. What has become increasingly vital for our survival today is that everyone grasps the broad features and uses of science, that we imbibe scientific temper. Science is important because science works; scientific temper, because in its absence, the benefits of science won’t reach everyone.

The role of science in life

Bringing a rather outdated term ‘scientific temper’ back into circulation might raise some hackles, however. How can modern science be valourised after an awareness of the devastation it has caused? Nuclear destruction, industrial pollution, climate change and a technologically induced sedentary lifestyle are all undeniable facts. But science continues to play a limited but critical role in human life. In one sense, it always has. This is to do with our inescapable interaction with the natural world and our need to harness its powers. Pre-language science in which knowledge embodied in skills, neither consciously nor symbolically available but generated in practical interaction with the world, has been around for two million years. And scientifically oriented stories, with an explicit, language-dependent understanding of nature, developed some 40,000-50,000 years ago when, to explain, predict and control nature, we began telling each other how and why things happen. An idea then took hold that performing a particular ritual to appease spirits delivers us from disease and death and could provide all the goods we need (magic, astrology, shamanism.) Our pre-modern stories attempted many things, including to explain, predict and control. Modern science is a radically improved version of this limited aspect of earlier stories. Besides, it has originated from and built upon them. Scientists readily acknowledge that myths, legends and stories continue to be the source of current scientific insights. In this sense, a science independent of myth and religion is woefully inadequate for living. The other big limitation of modern science is that it plays virtually no role in mutual or inter-cultural understanding or in our indispensable ethical projects of self-exploration, self-understanding or self-realisation. That role in providing collective and individual self-knowledge and ethical guidance is played by the humanities, interpretative social science and religions.

With these qualifications, we must readily acknowledge that scientific temper is useful in certain contexts and necessary for specific purposes. If so, what are the other preconditions for building it? First, a disposition to not accept any opinion or claim at face value, or to reject in haste anything that conflicts with one’s own settled views. For instance, to not immediately accept when told that eating a clove of garlic will reduce high BP, or that the rate of economic growth in India is 7%. A healthy scepticism towards these figures is crucial. Moreover, no claim or data can be accepted merely because it is supplied by those in majority, political power, or religious authority. Evidence-based claims are the enemy of prejudice and dogma. Second, good science recognises that truth is always elusive, that all human endeavour, including scientific enquiry, is imperfect, corrigible, in constant need of critical scrutiny and revision. Third, in principle, science is anti-authoritarian. No matter how hierarchical in practice scientific institutions are, or how powerful its leaders, the fact remains that if a research assistant comes up with a result that challenges established scientific claims, then it must be addressed, examined and if confirmed, displace the view held by established authority. So, if scientific temper is important, what kind of public culture is needed to advance it? Who must be responsible to take it forward? And how can we nudge people into evidence-based reasoning not from self-interest alone but from commitment to the common good?

315,2020/03/18,For a floor test first: On Madhya Pradesh crisis,"The BJP might have been morally deviant, but Kamal Nath must prove his majority quickly

Propriety and law require the Kamal Nath-led Congress government in Madhya Pradesh to prove its majority on the floor of the legislature at the earliest. Delaying tactics by Mr. Nath with more than a little help from the Speaker, who has adjourned the Assembly until March 26, go against democratic principles. Equally, Governor Lalji Tandon’s position that the government will be presumed to have lost the majority unless it takes a floor test immediately is untenable. The situation in the State raises other questions of morality and legality also, as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) innovates questionable routes to power that it did not win in the election. The Congress had won a narrow victory in the State in 2018, after a 15-year gap. The resignation of 22 party MLAs has pushed its government into a crisis. These MLAs had won against BJP candidates. Their resignations, and the defection of Jyotiraditya Scindia from the Congress to the BJP, can be explained only as a high form of perfidy and shameless personal greed. That said, it is curious that the Speaker accepted the resignations of six MLAs while keeping the other 16 pending. The Speaker is expected to be non partisan. That he has found a rather ingenious excuse, the pandemic, makes the scene a bit complicated, but not defensible.

The BJP, the Congress and the rebel MLAs have all approached the Supreme Court which has taken up the matter with urgency. The BJP is replaying the script that it has perfected in other States, most notably in Karnataka last year to unseat the Congress-JD(S) government. The Court ruling during the Karnataka crisis was that a time-frame for deciding on resignations by MLAs could not be forced on the Speaker. The Court also ruled that MLAs could not be forced to attend the Assembly session by being issued a whip by the party they belonged to, weakening the lynchpin of the Anti-Defection law. The Congress has alleged that the 16 MLAs are under duress and in detention by the BJP. While the judiciary will force some solution to end the current impasse, the larger question facing democracy is that of trust and transparency. Assemblies are elected for a five-year term, and the Anti-Defection law was brought to raise the threshold and stop the dismantling of a popular mandate through opportunistic manoeuvres, as it is unfolding in Madhya Pradesh. Engineered resignations of lawmakers have become a new tool for sabotaging mandates and camouflaging defections. When the top court adjudicates on the Madhya Pradesh petitions, this larger point must be taken into consideration. The situation demands new guidelines by the Court to deal with the now-familiar malaise, beyond setting a reasonably quick deadline for a floor test.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/for-a-floor-test-first-the-hindu-editorial-on-madhya-pradesh-political-crisis/article31093406.ece
316,2020/03/18,Epicentre shifts: On coronavirus spread,"Global efforts to counter the virus have been uneven, with Europe and the U.S. faltering

With 1,08,394 cases reported from outside mainland China as on March 17, there are more people infected with the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in other parts of the world than in mainland China (81,058). Also, as on March 17, the number of deaths (4,279) in the rest of the world is more than in mainland China (3,226). On Monday, there was just one new laboratory-confirmed case and 12 deaths reported in Wuhan; outside Wuhan, no new case has been reported from Hubei province for 12 consecutive days. Even as Iran recorded 16,169 cases and 988 deaths so far, it is in Europe that the virus seems to be galloping. Besides four countries reporting a very high number of cases, all other European countries have recorded at least one case so far, thus shifting the pandemic’s epicentre from China to Europe. Here, Italy and Spain have been the most affected, with 27,980 and 11,309 cases, respectively. On March 16, with 3,590 new cases, Italy reported the biggest jump in case load in a single day while deaths in Spain nearly doubled to 288. Germany (8,084) and France (6,664) have been the other two countries badly affected too. With 2,158 deaths, Italy has reported the highest mortality from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outside China.

There are big lessons that India and the rest of the world can learn from Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea on containing the spread. Taiwan began airport screening even before China reported its first case of human-to-human transmission on January 20. Together with closing its borders by January-end, it raised awareness about the virus and the disease, and ways to minimise risk through handwashing and the use of face masks. Taiwan essentially cut the transmission chain even before the virus could gain a foothold in the country. Following the World Health Organization’s guidelines to a tee, Singapore went after all suspect cases by testing all influenza-like and pneumonia cases and aggressively tracing contacts. Like Taiwan and Hong Kong, Singapore too instituted travel restrictions by early February. Not only did it make testing and treatment free for all its residents, it paid $100 a day to self-employed people to ensure none violated quarantine. Besides closing most of the border crossings with China and contact tracing, Hong Kong had a 14-day quarantine in place from February 5 onwards and containment measures — shutting down schools and asking people to work from home — in place by the end of January. South Korea’s massive community-level screening, contact tracing and quarantining after the outbreaks in two churches helped in containment. Contrast this with how the U.S. floundered for weeks on several fronts, including the use of flawed testing kits. A lesson from the pandemic is how containing an outbreak is dependent on quick public-health responses.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/epicentre-shifts-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-coronavirus-spread-outside-china/article31093409.ece
317,2020/03/18,PRR project delayed amidst stalemate with farmers,"This, after the Supreme Court orders the BDA to redo Environment Impact Assessment

The Supreme Court has ordered the Bengaluru Development Authority to redo the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) and get fresh clearances for Peripheral Ring Road (PRR) project on Tuesday. This has effectively delayed the project’s execution by a year and a half. This delay amidst a stalemate with farmers over the compensation package for land acquisition has once again raised doubts over the project itself.

Senior Urban Development Department officials said they were not going to give up on the project but pursue it with renewed vigour and ensure its implementation, as it was critical infrastructure for the city. Though the government did not mention the project in the budget this year, chief secretary T. M. Vijay Bhaskar has been holding a weekly review meeting of the project. The government has also released ₹1,000 crore to BDA for PRR, but the apex court order has thrown a spanner in the works.

There are serious questions raised about the ecological viability of the project. The earlier environment clearance was challenged on the grounds that BDA had suppressed critical information about the project. The National Green Tribunal scrapped the clearance and asked BDA to redo the EIA which the Authority challenged in the apex court but lost.

There are four issues suppressed by BDA during the last EIA: PRR cuts across the eco sensitive Tippagondanahalli watershed and Jarakbande Kaval Reserve Forest. The road intersects with the Petronet gas pipeline at 17 locations and that the project will lead to over 16,000 trees being cut, said Leo Saldanha, Environment Support Group (ESG).

While BDA had claimed only 200-500 trees would be cut, an RTI reply by the Forest Department claimed over 16,000 trees will have to be cut, activists point out. “The BDA has to prove that the project is ecologically viable now. The Supreme Court orders clearly indicates that short circuiting environmental clearances wont work,” he said.

The EIA study will likely take 18 months, sources said. As the apex court has set aside the earlier EIA and EC, Vijaykumar Gogi, member secretary, State Environment Impact Assessment Authority – Karnataka, said the authority will follow all Ministry of Environment of Forests norms and vet the data submitted by BDA for credibility.

“Data needs to be collected during two seasons other than the rainy season. Later the Authority is expected to give its decision in 150 days. The time this process will take depends on BDA,” he said.

Meanwhile, negotiations with landowning farmers over compensation package has entered a stalemate. “BDA has been offering to compensate farmers based on an outdated guidance value. After waiting for nearly a decade and a half with their lands essentially locked, the farmers deserve a compensation at today's market price, a rightful demand we are making,” said Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, president, Karnataka Rajya Raita Sangha.

He said a further delay will only cost the farmers. “We were supposed to meet the chief minister over the issue. But the meeting has been put off due to the ongoing Covid 19 pandemic crisis,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/zaaqp5/article31105125.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGPRR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/prr-project-delayed-amidst-stalemate-with-farmers/article31101887.ece

319,2020/03/18,Police launch #arrestcorona campaign,"Amazon’s Alexa to answer questions on campaign

A constable’s song on COVID-19 urging people not to panic has gone viral after city police commissioner Bhaskar Rao used it as a part of the city police’s campaign against the virus. Constable Moulali Boragi, attached to City Armed Reserve (south), who wrote the song approached Mr. Rao with a video recording of him singing it.

When the police chief heard it, he was so impressed that he asked the DCP (Command Centre) to upload the song online as part of the awareness campaign. The song was a hit with users online.

“This is part of the awareness campaign under the banner #arrestcorona which is being launched from Thursday,” said Isha Pant, DCP, Command Centre. “The word ‘arrest’ was taken from the police vocabulary to mean ‘Stop’.”

As part of the campaign, the police will also share positive stories of people whose lives have been affected by COVID-19 so that their experiences and courage will inspire others.

“The city police have tied up with Amazon, so that people can ask the voice-enabled virtual assistant, Alexa, questions and seek information on the campaign,” she added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/police-launch-arrestcorona-campaign/article31101156.ece
320,2020/03/18,COVID-19 | Shutdown hits daily wage workers hard,"Govt. urged to issue order asking employers to grant them paid leave

For Narendra V. (name changed on request), a daily wage worker who was employed at a fast food chain in a mall, surviving in Bengaluru has become increasingly difficult with each passing day.

The government’s decision to extend the shutdown on malls, theatres, etc. till March 31 to contain the spread of COVID-19 has him worried, and his savings are running out. “This month’s end looks gloomy as I won’t be paid for at least 15 days. And what if it’s extended further?” he said.

Daily wage workers like Narendra are feeling the impact of the pandemic on the already bleak job market. Many daily wage workers said it was only once the restrictions were imposed by the government which had shut down malls, theatres, etc. that jobs started drying out so quickly.

Vijaya Bhaskar D.A., general secretary, All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), who has been urging the government to issue an order to all the employers and institutions to provide daily wage workers with paid leave, said the onus to protect them is with the authorities.

“Though the shutdown is in the larger interest of the society, governments — both the Centre and State — should also think about daily wage workers too. If they do not work, they do not earn,” said Mr. Bhaskar.

Domestic workers told to stay at home

Domestic workers, too, are worried as several households have asked them not to report to work till at least the end of the month. However, not all families are willing to pay them their salaries. One housekeeper said she would be happy to get at least half her salary so that she can run her own house.

On the other hand, housekeeping staff and domestic workers, especially in technology parks along Outer Ring Road. find themselves in a Catch-22 situation of sorts. “Due to the fear of disease, we are made to clean frequently and extensively unlike before. For instance, now we have to clean lifts and stairs and banisters each and every time we are called in by companies,”said Iman Nargis, who works for a contractor that provides housekeeping services to offices in ORR.

However, since many companies have asked employees to work from home and offices are closed for the most part, they don’t have to report to work every day. For people like Nargis who are paid by the contract, this has already affected her income.

“Some of the offices here used to see people from other countries coming in regularly. So we are worried that we are more exposed. On the one hand, we work in fear. On the other hand, we don;’t have any work on some days and we do not get paid.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-shutdown-hits-daily-wage-workers-hard/article31100126.ece
321,2020/03/18,COVID-19 | 3 doctors of Institute of Nephro-Urology in Bengaluru under home quarantine,"Three doctors from the State-run Institute of Nephro-Urology on Victoria Hospital campus have been home quarantined since Tuesday as one of the doctors is related to the 20-year-old woman who tested positive for COVID-19 on Monday. Those under home quarantine include the institute director Keshavamurthy R.

Dr Keshavamurthy told The Hindu on Wednesday that the doctor, said to be related to the positive patient, accompanied her for COVID-19 tests on Sunday and attended a meeting at the institute on Monday.

“He was there with her when her samples were collected on Sunday. But he did not inform us about that before the meeting on Monday. Her reports came on Monday and after that we came to know that he had accompanied her. All those were in close contact with the doctor have been quarantined,” he said. The hospital caters to renal patients and those who are immuno compromised.

Allying fears, the doctor said he had not entered the wards and other patient areas in the hospital. “I was busy doing paper work in my cabin for most part of the day on Monday. My close contact with two other doctors was only in the meeting and that too for a short while. Moreover, I do not have any symptoms and my samples have tested negative,” he told The Hindu.

Meanwhile, post-graduate medical students and junior doctors, who are deployed in various teaching hospitals said they have been asked to avoid touching patients to examine them. “We have been asked by our seniors to avoid examining the patients and take their history orally. Also, doctors are avoiding all minor surgeries in cases where they can be delayed,” said a PG student from Bengaluru Medical College and Research Institute.

322,2020/03/18,Coronavirus | Air is cleaner with COVID-19 lockdown,"KSPCB figures between Saturday and Monday show weekday had lower pollution levels than weekend

Many private firms have asked employees to work from home, schools and colleges have suspended classes, and and malls and pubs are closed. This partial lockdown in a usually bustling city to contain the spread of COVID-19 appears to have had one positive impact — lower levels of air pollution.

Data collated by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) between Saturday and Monday showed that ironically, the weekday had lower pollution levels than the weekend.

According to the Air Quality Index (AQI) compiled by the KSPCB, six out of seven monitoring stations posted ‘satisfactory’ index values, as well as lower pollution levels on Monday, when pollution levels usually see a spike.

For example, the AQI at the Silk Board monitoring station went from 76 on Saturday, to 70 on Sunday and 66 on Monday. Silk Board is notorious for its traffic snarls.

The AQI at NIMHANS was 76, 91 and 67 on Saturday, Sunday and Monday respectively. The other stations that recorded a downward trend in air pollution were the Veterinary College Hebbal, Basaveshwaranagara, Jayanagar 5th block and Mysuru Road.

KSPCB officials said the three-day data is a window to the impact that vehicular emissions have on air. “Usually, we see that air pollution goes up on Mondays when people are back to work or to school and college. Now that many of these establishments are closed, and the IT industry and others have asked their employees have been asked to work from home, vehicular emissions have reduced and this is having a direct impact on the pollution levels,” said an official.

City Railway Station

On the other hand, the City Railway Station station saw no impact of the closure of establishments and reduction in traffic. On the contrary, the busy junction saw the AQI go up from 86 to 102 to 124. This was the only station that recorded ‘moderate’ levels.

According to the AQI, index value between 0 and 50 is deemed good with minimal impact on health, 51 to 100 is satisfactory with health implications being minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people, 101 to 200 is considered moderate, and the possible health impact likely to cause breathing discomfort to people with lung diseases and discomfort to people with heart disease, as well as affect children and older adults.

AQI of 201 to 300 is considered poor (may cause breathing discomfort to people on prolonged exposure and discomfort to people with heart disease), 301 to 400 very poor (may cause respiratory illness to people on prolonged exposure. Effect may be more pronounced in people with lung and heart diseases), and more than 401 is categorised as severe (may cause respiratory effects even to healthy people and serious health effect to people with lung/ heart diseases).",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/pisvs9/article31096802.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGMarchclean-aircol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/coronavirus-air-is-cleaner-with-covid-19-lockdown/article31096804.ece

A 67-year-old woman from Bengaluru tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday, taking the number of cases in Karnataka to 11. Health Department officials said the woman had returned to Bengaluru from Dubai via Goa on March 9.

She has a medical history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) but has been in strict home quarantine since coming to Bangalore. “On March 16, she was admitted to a designated isolation hospital,” read a bulletin released by the Health and Family Welfare Department.

Officials said 21 high-risk contacts had been identified including five family members and were under strict home quarantine. “So far, no close contacts have shown symptoms.”

Patient No. 9 is the family doctor of the deceased Kalaburagi man. The Department also released details of patients 9 and 10 who tested positive late on Monday night. The patient no. 9 is a 63-year-old man who was the family doctor treating the 76-year-old man from Kalaburagi who died and later tested positive for the virus.

The patient has been admitted to an isolation facility in Kalaburagi and is stable. Fifty primary contacts have been traced including seven family members. All are asymptomatic and are under strict home quarantine. The tenth patient is a woman, 20, from Bengaluru who returned from the U.K. on March 14.

326,2020/03/18,Bird flu cases add to the woes of poultry rearers,"COVID-19, which is falsely linked to the consumption of chicken, and three positive cases of influenza A(H5N1) (bird flu) in fowl in Mysuru and Harihar in Davanagere district have already impacted poultry farmers. The Karnataka Poultry Rearers’ Development Association said that ever since COVID-19 were reported, the price of chicken has come down drastically as there are hardly any takers for it.

G.C. Baiyya Reddy, honorary president of the association, said, “We have incurred a huge financial loss. Across the country, farmers depending on poultry and other related industries are suffering losses of ₹160 crore in all every day. We are holding meetings with officials concerned and elected representatives seeking compensation.” He said that more than 2.5 crore farmers in the country rely on poultry businesses.

On reports of bird flu in Mysuru and Harihara, Mr. Reddy said the respective district administrations had taken all the measures to contain it. Bengaluru Urban Deputy Commissioner G.N. Shivamurthy told The Hindu that he had instructed officials in the city to be on alert. “In our jurisdiction, we have not received any reports of bird flu.

329,2020/03/18,Domestic passengers to be screened for Covid-19 at Chennai airport,"This will be a massive exercise as nearly 20,000 - 21,000 passengers travel in the domestic sector, say officials

Within a day or two, Airports Authority of India (AAI) will start screening domestic passengers, who arrive at Chennai airport from across the country, to check for COVID-19.

This will be a massive exercise because Chennai airport has more domestic passengers than international travelers.

Sources said that the move comes in the wake of the State government recommending the AAI to screen domestic passengers too a few days ago.

“Now, we will request the State government for manpower and other necessary facilities. For now, we have begun making arrangements in the domestic terminal already and creating the infrastructure required for it. As soon as we receive staff to take up the screening, the exercise will start in a day or two,” a source said.

For almost a month now, the passenger traffic has plummeted drastically at Chennai airport, not just in the international sector but also in the domestic sector.

Chennai airport usually has more number of domestic passengers than international. For instance, while there are about 3,000-3,500 international passengers, the domestic accounts for nearly 20,000-21,000 passengers. Sources said that it would be a challenging exercise because of the sheer volume of passenger traffic in the domestic sector.

“But we will organise everything in such a way that no one faces any inconvenience. Whatever we have done in the international terminal, we will do it in the domestic terminal too. We will ensure that it is a smooth process and ensure passengers don’t have to wait for too long to finish their screening,” an official said.

Meanwhile, the cancellation of international flights has been continuing at Chennai airport. On Wednesday too, flights that were to depart to Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Frankfurt and Colombo and the ones from Dubai, Muscat, Kuala Lumpur and Colombo were cancelled. So far, over 180 flights have been cancelled at Chennai airport in this month and more such cancellations in the international sector may occur, officials said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/domestic-passengers-to-be-screened-for-covid-19-at-chennai-airport/article31099744.ece
330,2020/03/18,Chennai graffiti artist Vijz brings Tamil pride to city’s walls,"One of Chennai’s oldest graffiti artists Vijz develops different fonts in Tamil script while painting freestyle

On the walls near the cab pick up point at Palladium, the Tamil word ‘Thaazhmai’ (which translates to ‘humble’) is painted in bright bold blue and orange. “All artists think they have these invisible crowns,” says its painter Vijayaraj, cheekily. “We are constantly comparing our works, trying to be better than the others. So I wanted to remind ourselves that we should all be humble in what we are doing. Only then can we learn something new each day.”

Across the city, under flyovers, in restaurants, offices and malls, you can find Vijayaraj, aka Vijz’s works. He also recently participated in St+Art India’s graffiti jam, where around seven artists from across India got together to paint the walls of a compound at Kannagi Nagar. On a 12-foot high wall is Vijz’s work: the word ‘Chosen’ is in monochromatic tones.

One of Chennai’s oldest graffiti artists, Vijz is most famous for his Tamil lettering. He is the founder of the city’s five-member Tamil Graffiti Crew.

“Tamil is a beautiful script to write. The sharp lines, angles, curves… you can experiment with all of these,” says Vijz. In one of his works under a bridge in Erode, Thiruvalluvar and Bharati’s faces are painted next to a farmer and his bull. In the centre is written ‘Enna thavam naan seithen tamizha naalai pirapatharku’ (What penance did I do to be born a Tamilian!). Tamil pride is a recurring theme in Vijz’s works.

The artist has developed different fonts in Tamil script, painting even the alphabets, and common words in Tamil. “These are not things you can sit and develop at home. They come out when you are painting freestyle,” he says. The skill of an artist, he believes shows only when he/she is painting freestyle. “It shows how much he has practised and how confident he is. Every time I freestyle, I can come up with a different font.”

Though he paints in Tamil, for eyes not familiar with his work, the lettering can sometimes be too complicated to read. “When you are painting graffiti, you have to make it complex, for it to look stylish and personalised,” he admits. Which is why the use of monochrome can be helpful, he explains. “It shows the structure of the letters more clearly and you can understand the pattern and foundation of the letter. If I am too complex with my lettering, I will reduce the variety of colours to make it easier to read.”

Vijz has been taking his art form to others who also want to learn Tamil lettering. Many of his graffiti crew members are also part of his dance crew, All for One. So this community is like a milieu of people who appreciate the hip hop lifestyle.

And yet, he does not believe in the ‘rebel’ side of graffiti — that it needs to be a covert action done without permission. “You need to ask yourself what is graffiti to you? What are you trying to say? Is it just about your skills, or do you want to convey something to the world? You can’t just go around spray painting your own name everywhere,” he says.

For Vijz, it is about sharing those words that have influenced and transformed him. “Artists can’t speak through words, so we speak through our works.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/gbhhk2/article31099114.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPTamilGraffitiCrew5jpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-graffiti-artist-vijz-brings-tamil-pride-to-citys-walls/article31099116.ece

Countering rumours in the city about markets and grocery stores shutting down and allaying residents’ anxieties, the Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash clarified in a statement on Tuesday that all markets and small trade establishments would continue to function normally.

Rumours on social media and message sharing platforms claimed that the Corporation had ordered the closure of all vegetable and fruit markets including Koyambedu, Mylapore and Mambalam till March 31 as part of COVID -19 precautionary measures. The message further advised people to stock up on groceries and vegetables.

Several residents who received these messages were quite worried. “I thought it was true and rushed to the nearest supermarket. However the staff there told me that it was a fake message,” said K. Hari, a resident of Adambakkam.

In his statement, Mr. Prakash clarified that except establishments such as malls and theatres etc., other facilities like fruit and vegetable markets and meat and fish markets will remain open and all small grocery stores, small trade establishments and supermarkets will remain open .

“The aim is to prevent the spread of virus and not affecting the common man’s life.

332,2020/03/18,COVID-19: Fuel outlets see drop in sales,"With fewer vehicles on the road, there has been a 15-20% drop in sales, outlets in Chennai said

Fuel pumps in and around the city are witnessing a fall of around 15-20 % in sales due to the reduction in the number of vehicles on the roads following the stringent measures being implemented against the spread of COVID-19.

D. Vijayakumar, who runs an outlet at Injambakkam, said that they were getting two vehicles every five minutes. “It started yesterday morning after the schools and colleges closed and many offices decided to give employees the option of work from home. Vehicles of educational institutions alone constitute around 10% of our sales. Even the number of two-wheelers has come down,” he said.

This is the same case with retail outlets on highways too, which are usually high-volume outlets.

Meanwhile, outlets have also begun to ask employees to wear masks and gloves, hand sanitise and wash hands frequently due to the high risk nature of the business. “I bought them only yesterday since they became available only now. We are beginning the safety measures today,. One employee in every shift will be cleaning door knobs, taps and places of frequent contact with disinfectant regularly,” said a fuel outlet owner in Tiruvallur district.

This also follows directives from oil companies asking retail fuel outlets to minimise cash and card transaction and switch over to ewallets to reduce human interface.

“Specific instructions have been provided for each kind of employee. Cashiers have to be more careful since they handle cash. The gloves and masks used by the customer attendants have to be disposed off with care everyday. And oil companies will not conduct any promotional activities or functions in our outlets during the period,” said a dealer.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/lgbsa9/article31097848.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18MARTH-FUEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/covid-19-fuel-outlets-see-drop-in-sales/article31097849.ece
333,2020/03/18,Chennai-based space tech start-up Agnikul has raised ₹23.4 crore,"Agnikul, operating out of the National Centre for Combustion Research at IIT Madras, is developing a satellite launch vehicle for payload capacity of up to 100 kg

Chennai-based space tech start-up Agnikul has raised ₹23.4 crore in a pre-series A round led by pi Ventures, with participation from Hari Kumar (LionRock Capital), Artha Ventures, LetsVenture, Globevestor, CIIE and existing investor Speciale Invest. Agnikul plans to use these funds for ground testing, fabrication and team expansion.

Srinath Ravichandran, co-founder and CEO of Agnikul, said, “We started with the dream of bringing space within everyone’s reach. We are doing this by building nimble, reliable and modular rockets that can put small satellites in space on-demand. This round of investment will help us get much closer to orbit.”

Manish Singhal, Founding Partner, pi Ventures, added that Agnikul can be a great example of world-class innovation coming from India. Pi ventures is a deep tech-focused early-stage venture fund with investments in Applied Artificial Intelligence, IoT and Blockchain.

Agnikul, operating out of the National Centre for Combustion Research at IIT Madras, is developing a satellite launch vehicle for payload capacity of up to 100 kg. The vehicle is configurable and can support payload range of 30-100 kg without impacting the economics. Since the engine is fully 3-D printed, the manufacturing complexity associated with traditional rocket engines is moved to the design in their case, making it an easier and cheaper fabrication process that will be able to deliver launch vehicles within a few weeks, pretty much on demand.

Agnikul is the only company in the world to design a rocket engine which can be printed in a single piece using 3-D printing technology.

According to reports, space industry across the globe has grown significantly into a $350 billion market with many private players entering the sector. It is predicted that in 2022, 2500 plus small satellites will be launched compared to less than 500 today.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pfmn4i/article31097820.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18MARTH-Spacejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-based-space-tech-start-up-agnikul-has-raised-234-crore/article31097822.ece

The Kandhili police arrested Rahul, 25, from Periyagaram, on Monday for abetting his wife’s suicide.

343,2020/03/18,HC notifies elaborate preventive measures in courts across T.N.,"Only fresh cases of admission, urgent matter to be heard for the next 3 weeks

The Madras High Court on Tuesday notified elaborate measures to be followed in all court campuses across the State to avoid congestion and mass gathering to prevent spread of COVID-19.

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi issued a series of directives which stated that only fresh cases for admission and urgent matters shall be heard by courts for the next three weeks and that the cases on the final hearing list shall remain suspended.

To reduce footfall on court premises, it had been decided not to issue gate pass to litigants and other visitors unless there was a judicial direction compelling them to be present in the court.

The Bar Associations have been requested to avoid functions.

“All canteens and food stalls are advised to close down completely for a period of three weeks subject to further review,” a circular issued by the Registry read, adding that stationery stalls and photostat facilities shall be available only between 10.30 am and 12.30 pm.

“The entry of outside vendors shall completely remain banned till further orders. All lawyers, litigants, clerks and other visitors are requested to leave finally by 5 pm to facilitate sanitisation and cleaning of the High Court premises,” the circular read.

The mediation centres, Lok Adalat as well as arbitration proceedings shall remain suspended for three weeks and all entrants into the court campus shall be subjected to thermal checks. All of them shall also be provided with sanitising material commensurate to their consumption.

Personal staff of judges, including personal assistants, jamadars and personal security officers, would be subjected to screening on a daily basis and such facilities shall also be provided at the residence of the judges. Court staff shall also work on two shifts to avoid crowding.

The High Court museum shall remain closed for the next three weeks and law clerks of judges shall be given exemption from attending work, the circular. A separate but identical circular was issued with respect to functioning of subordinate courts too.

344,2020/03/18,Kamal Haasan exempted from appearing at accident site,"Police could summon him elsewhere if needed, says High Court

The Madras High Court on Tuesday exempted actor-politician Kamal Haasan from being present at EVP Film City at Chembarambakkam on Wednesday to reconstruct the scene of a crane accident at the spot during the shooting for the movie Indian-2, which led to the death of three crew members on February 19.

Justice G.K. Ilanthiraiyan granted the exemption after being convinced with the submissions of senior counsel Satish Parasaran and advocate Vijayan Subramanian that the actor’s presence was not required at the spot. He, however, granted liberty to the police to issue summons to the actor if they wanted to inquire him elsewhere.

The order was passed despite stiff opposition by Additional Public Prosecutor M. Mohamed Riyaz who said the police had summoned totally 24 eyewitnesses, including the film director Shankar to the film city on Wednesday for reconstruction of the scene of occurrence and that no exemption could be granted to the actor alone.

Stating that investigation conducted so far revealed that the crane, with a maximum capacity of 900 kg, had been overloaded to the extent of 2,800 kg, the APP said it was essential to reconstruct the scene of occurrence to know the nitty-gritty of the incident. “Just because he is a hero, he cannot distance himself from the process of investigation,” he said.

However, Mr. Parasaran said the actor was 65 years old and he himself was a victim of a traumatic experience of having lost three of the crew members. Stating that it was an accident and not a case of murder, he said every eyewitness need not be summoned to the place of occurrence. He also accused the police of harassing the actor due to a political motive.

Denying the allegation, the APP said, “If the actor was in his residence at Eldams Road in Chennai when the accident took place on February 19 and still we insist on his presence for reconstruction of the scene of occurrence, he can claim it to be harassment. How can he claim so when he had admitted to be just a few metres away from the crane crash site?”

In his petition, the actor said it was Lyca Productions which approached him for acting in Indian-2. “The petitioner is only a hero of the film and not in any way associated with the production… There is no precedence of a hero being summoned ever as a witness in any case of accident during the shoot,” the petition read.

345,2020/03/18,Metro work causes shop collapse,"‘Owner will be compensated’

Metro Rail’s underground work caused a huge sinkhole that resulted in the collapse of a shop in Tondiarpet on Tuesday. However, no one was injured.

The underground construction work is being executed across north Chennai for building phase I extension project that links Washermenpet with Wimco Nagar.

Around 6.30 a.m, all of a sudden the shop nearby collapsed.

According to Chennai Metro Rail Limited officials, excavation and preparatory works for casting of base slab was being carried out.

Because of the work, a water pipeline underneath was fractured owing to differential settlement of soil strata around the pipeline.

Water pipeline

“Since it was a pressurised line supplying water to Tondiarpet area, water immediately rushed into the site bringing in soil eroded by the flow. As a result of erosion, there was a loss of soil in the vicinity of the pipe leading to surface subsidence. One of the old tea shops located near the area got damaged,” CMRL said in a statement.

Subsequently, the area was barricaded and the sinkhole was filled in with concrete. The pipeline that had ruptured has been fixed and the CMRL has been monitoring the soil displacement in this location.

“The CMRL has approached the CMWSSB for temporary closure of the pipeline till it is rectified,” the statement added.

The shop owner will be compensated for the damage caused and the CMRL will reconstruct the building, the officials said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mn1ipo/article31094508.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THBUILDINGCOLLAPSED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/metro-work-causes-shop-collapse/article31094509.ece
346,2020/03/18,Metrowater to install first solar plant at Chembarambakkam,"Bids invited through e-procurement portal for the first time

Chennai Metrowater is likely to get its first solar energy plant, constructed on the premises of Chembarambakkam water treatment plant, by mid-May. Aiming to reduce power expenditure, the water agency has called for expression of interest from bidders through e-procurement portal for the first time.

The electricity bill comes to nearly 30%-40% of Metrowater’s total expenditure. In a bid to make use of renewable energy and decrease its power expenses, the water agency has tied up with the National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE). The organisation would provide technical support and help execute the project in vacant sites of Metrowater.

Officials said solar energy was chosen as an option to generate electricity for the operation of drinking water treatment and distribution facilities across the city. Of the total power requirement of 100 megawatt to operate water facilities, nearly 25 megawatt is proposed to be generated through solar plants.

Bids have been called through NIWE for installation, operation and maintenance of the one megawatt solar plant at the top of the underground tank in the Chembarambakkam facility. It has a capacity to treat about 530 million litres of water drawn from the lake daily.

“For the first time, we have called for bids on the e-procurement portal for better transparency and cost-effective process. Two government agencies have shown interest in the project so far,” said an official. The capacity of the plant would be increased in the next phase and expanded to other facilities.

The solar plant would be maintained by a private or another public firm and Metrowater plans to purchase power at ₹4.50 per unit. At present, the water agency buys power at ₹6.50 per unit from Tangedco.

With two more energy-intensive desalination plants coming up along East Coast Road in Nemmeli and Perur, the water agency is studying the possibility of electricity generation through a combination of solar and wind energy. There are also plans to invest in open access power purchase, which allows users to buy electricity from other private generators at a nominal rate. Metrowater is in the process of obtaining clearance from Tangedco to purchase power for operation of other water facilities, officials said.

It may be recalled that Metrowater had already started bio-gas generation in its sewage treatment plants a decade ago and has so far saved nearly ₹64 crore towards power expenditure.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/metrowater-to-install-first-solar-plant-at-chembarambakkam/article31094405.ece

348,2020/03/18,Testing low in some countries: WHO expert,"“In some countries, the testing for COVID-19 is low, and we may be getting a false sense of what is happening,” said Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist, World Health Organisation.

Speaking on “Global Situation of COVID-19 and Research and Development Response” through a video-conference, during an international update on COVID-19 on Tuesday, she said that some countries had taken such great action that they were able to control.

Ms. Swaminathan cited examples of how Singapore and Hong Kong were able to control, and how South Korea had tested people for COVID-19.

Talking about the known factors of COVID-19, she said, “There are some people who have very high viral load in the upper respiratory tract, and we also know that the virus can transmit from person to person before they become sick....We also know that more than 80% of the infections are mild and may not have a lot of symptoms.”

On how COVID-19 impacted children, she said, “The younger the person, the fewer the symptoms. Children seem to be infected but do not show much symptoms. They are not getting sick which is a good thing. They are not presenting to the hospital but they may be the transmitters in the community.”

“What we now know is that children can get infected. There have been studies done in China within families to see whether there is transmission through children, and yes, there is. But children are not falling ill and are not showing symptoms, and that is unusual. They are protected for some reason but could spread the infection. That is why it is important to look at the impact of school closures,” she said.

349,2020/03/18,What does COVID-19 mean for kidneys?,"Senior nephrologist Rajan Ravichandran on ill-effects

First of all, the disease itself can damage the kidneys. Secondly, the spread and isolation in dialysis units will be a problem. Thirdly, dialysis and transplant patients may succumb to it more easily.

What does the data from Wuhan show so far? The main causes of death for patients infected with COVID-19 are pneumonia and respiratory failure. Early reports from Wuhan showed only up to 9% kidney involvement in these patients. But a subsequent report covering 59 patients showed that 34% had a protein leak in urine on admission, which increased to 63% later. The kidney function was reduced in 27% of the patients and in two-thirds of those who died. Among the 710 hospitalised patients, 44% had a protein leak and 26% microscopic blood leak in urine.

The CT scan showed dense kidneys in those who died. The reason for this was the direct involvement of the kidneys with the virus and also the inflammatory toxins (cytokines) released in sick patients.

One interesting finding was that among the patients who were taking certain BP drugs like ARB and ACE inhibitors, the death rate was higher. The treatment of patients with kidney failure is not different from that of any other patient in ICCU, including dialysis or CRRT.

There are no reports on patients who are not on dialysis. There are 7,184 patients in 61 centres in Wuhan city. Only seven deaths have been reported, with 37 out of a total of 230 patients having been affected, besides four staff members. Reports from other centres are not available. In the affected patients, the disease seems to be milder. Dialysis centres are likely to spread the infection due to close spacing between patients and frequent visits by patients.

Both the Chinese Society of Nephrology and the Taiwanese Society of Nephrology have issued guidelines for dialysis units, including education and training of staff and patients, collection of travel data, isolation of suspected cases, use of cap mask, gowns and sanitisers, hand washing, disposal of waste, sterilisation of machines, increasing the distance between patients and cleaning and disinfection of units. It would be very difficult to follow these guidelines in India due to the total non-uniformity of dialysis units and the reuse of dialysers in many centres. Universal precautions should be followed in dialysis centres, irrespective of epidemics.

Transplant patients

There are no reports of COVID-19 in transplantation patients.

Though we expect kidney transplantation to have special concerns, immunosuppression late after transplantation may result in less severe manifestations of the disease. Obviously, these patients are required to follow the same precautions — hand washing, fewer visits to hospitals and avoidance of travel.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pcf9z2/article31094361.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18RAJANKVSJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/what-does-covid-19-mean-for-kidneys/article31094365.ece

Peramaippu president A.M. Vikramaraja said that if such establishments were closed, there would be a shortage of essential goods that could also lead to a law and order situation. People might even break the shutters to get commodities. Farmers would be affected if fruit and vegetable shops were closed, since they produce perishable goods. It would also lead to a loss of revenue to the government, he said.

Entry of people to major shops in commercial areas such as T.Nagar, George Town, Purasawalkam and Velachery will be regulated to prevent the spread of COVID-19, as part of the disinfection plan.

Speaking to mediapersons on Tuesday, Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani said that local body officials had been instructed to explore the option of issuing notices to big shops such as textiles showrooms that failed to cooperate.

“Residents have been requested to stay indoors. A meeting of residents’ associations and traders’ ‘bodies will be organised on Wednesday to create awareness on the disinfection plan,” said Mr. Velumani.

Textile showrooms in areas such as Ranganathan Street, T.Nagar are expected to get notice from Chennai Corporation officials to prevent crowding.

Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash said that all parks would be kept closed. “We will conduct 100% screening. Disinfection plan for 55 bus stands in the city is ready. Personnel will be deployed. We have instructed all banks to regularly disinfect all 3,800 ATMs in the city,” said Mr. Prakash.

Residents have been requested to lodge complaints to the Corporation helpline 1913 if they find that the disinfection initiative was not carried out properly.

Residents have been requested to report cases of COVID-19 to 011-23978046 or 104 or 044-29510400 or 044-29510500 or 9444340496 or 8754448477.

Residents can also call the Communicable Diseases Hospital 044-25912686/87/88. Officials said the Marina beach would not be closed. But the beach will be used to create awareness among residents on COVID-19.

“We may close the Marina beach if a large number of people start visiting the area, thereby increasing the risk,” said an official of the Corporation.

352,2020/03/18,Coronavirus | Preventive measures in place in prisons across T.N.,"Prisoners screened; temporary quarantine units created

The Prison Department has brought in a series of measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among its personnel and inmates in the State.

Prisoners are “properly” screened at the time of admission. Those who have sore throat, cough, fever or cold are lodged separately and immediately referred to a government hospital. Medical screening is done for all prisoners.

Separate temporary quarantine units have been set up to lodge prisoners who develop symptoms. Soap is being provided to all prisoners and they are being told to wash their hands, at frequent intervals, particularly before eating. This is supervised by duty warders. Prisoners who return after court production and hospital treatment are properly screened at the main gates.

Director General of Police and Inspector General of Prisons Sunil Kumar Singh told The Hindu, “At Central prisons, we have established a system of keeping prisoners in quarantine wards for 14 days. So any new prisoner who comes to a Central prison is separated from others for 14 days. On arrival, he is medically examined by doctors who are already available there. Four symptoms — sore throat, cough, fever and cold — have been added into our format. So any prisoner with symptoms will be separated and sent to the quarantine ward or to a government hospital.” Mr. Singh also sent a circular to all superintendents of Central prisons/ special prisons for women and the Borstal School in Pudukkottai.

Activities cancelled

All visit-education and NGO activities are suspended for a month, except those for yoga and meditation. On the first Sunday of every month, ‘good conduct’ prisoners are allowed to meet their family. Such practice will not be allowed for a month. Face masks will be given to those sent for ‘out-gang work’. Personnel on duty will be provided masks. Video-conferencing facilities will be utilised for producing prisoners before courts. Prisoners, after availing emergency/ordinary leaves, are screened thoroughly at the time of admission.

Advocates will be allowed inside only after washing their hands.

Twenty-four persons are under observation for symptoms of COVID-19 in isolation wards of government medical college hospitals, and a total of 2,635 persons are under home quarantine in the State, as per a bulletin issued by the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine.

Officials said that they had quarantined persons arriving from seven highly-affected countries.

Till date, 140 nasal and throat swabs and blood samples have been lifted from persons for testing. Except one sample that tested positive last week and another sample that is under process, the remaining samples returned negative for COVID-19.

As on date, a total of 1,84,861 passengers have been screened at the airports in Chennai, Tiruchi, Madurai and Coimbatore.

Health officials said that they were quarantining passengers arriving from seven affected countries — South Korea, China, Iran, Italy, Germany, France and Spain. Eighteen persons, who were quarantined at the Institute of Public Health, Poonamallee, on Monday, were discharged as they did not show symptoms for COVID-19. As of now, 40 persons were quarantined at the facility.

354,2020/03/18,"A revival of multilateralism, steered by India","A leadership role by India in mobilising world collaboration would be in keeping with its traditional activism globally

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought out in sharp relief the compelling reality that has been staring us in the face for the past several years. This reality has two aspects. One, that most challenges confronting the world and likely to confront it in the future, are cross-national in character. They respect no national boundaries and are not amenable to national solutions. Two, these challenges are cross-domain in nature, with strong feedback loops. A disruption in one domain often cascades into parallel disruptions in other domains.

Thus the use of chemical fertilizers and toxic pesticides may promote food security but have injurious health effects, undermining health security. Whether at the domestic or the international level, these inter-domain linkages need to be understood and inform policy interventions. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reflect this awareness.

Also Read From virtual conferencing to real leadership

Rise of nationalism

The intersection of cross-national and cross-domain challenges demand multilateral approaches. They require empowered international institutions of governance. Underlying these must be a spirit of internationalism and solidarity, a sense of belonging to a common humanity. But over the past decade and more, the world has been moving in the reverse direction. There has been an upsurge in narrow nationalism, an assertion of parochial interests over pursuit of shared interests and a fostering of competition among states rather than embracing collaboration. COVID-19 has brought these deepening contradictions into very sharp relief. This is a global challenge which recognises no political boundaries. It is intimately linked to the whole pattern of large-scale and high-density food production and distribution. It is a health crisis but is also spawning an economic crisis through disrupting global value chains and creating a simultaneous demand shock. It is a classic cross-national and cross-domain challenge.

The direction now

But interventions to deal with the COVID-19 crisis are so far almost entirely at the national level, relying on quarantine and social distancing. There is virtually no coordination at the international level. We are also seeing a blame game erupt between China and the United States which does not augur well for international cooperation and leadership. While this is the present state of play, the long-term impact could follow alternative pathways. One, the more hopeful outcome would be for countries to finally realise that there is no option but to move away from nationalistic urges and embrace the logic of international cooperation through revived and strengthened multilateral institutions and processes.

The other more depressing consequence may be that nationalist trends become more intense, countries begin to build walls around themselves and even existing multilateralism is further weakened. Institutions such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization which are already marginalised may become increasingly irrelevant. There could be a return to autarkic economic and trade policies and an even deeper and more pervasive anti-globalisation sentiment. Unless there is a conscious effort to stem this through a reaffirmation of multilateralism, we are looking at a very depressing decade ahead. This is when the world needs leadership and statesmanship, both in short supply. This is in contrast to the U.S.-led response to the global financial and economic crisis of 2008 when the G-20 summit was born and a coordinated response prevented catastrophic damage to the global economy. Is there a role here for India which is a key G-20 country, the world’s fifth largest economy and with a long tradition of international activism and promotion of rule-based multilateralism?

In this context, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks at the recent The Economic Times Global Business Summit are to be welcomed. While speaking of the COVID-19 crisis, he said, “Like today, the world is facing a huge challenge in the form of Corona Virus. Financial institutions have also considered it a big challenge for the financial world. Today, we all have to face this challenge together. We have to be victorious with the power of our resolution of ‘Collaborate to Create’.”

He went on to observe that while the world today is “inter-connected, inter-related and also interdependent”, it has “not been able to come on a single platform or frame a Global Agenda, a global goal of how to overcome world poverty, how to end terrorism, how to handle Climate Change issues.”

Mr. Modi lauded his government’s policy of seeking friendship with all countries as contrasted from the earlier policy of non-alignment. He seemed to suggest that non-alignment was a defensive policy which advocated “equal distance from every country”. Now, he claimed, India was still “neutral” — presumably meaning non-alignment — “but not on the basis of distance but on the basis of friendship”.

He cited India’s friendship with Iran and Saudi Arabia, and with the U.S. as well as Russia. Elaborating on this, he added, “There was a time when people were neutral by creating equal distance, but we are now neutral by creating equal friendship. Today we are being friends and trying to walk together. This is the very essence of India’s foreign policy and the economic policy of India today.”

India’s foreign policy

Mr. Modi may wish to distinguish his foreign policy from that of his predecessors, but what he describes as its “essence” is hardly distinguishable from the basic principles of Indian foreign policy since Nehru. India’s non-alignment was anything but defensive. The international peace-keeping contribution that the Prime Minister referred to has its origins in Nehru’s sense of international responsibility.

India has always professed its desire to have friendly relations with all countries but has been equally firm in safeguarding its interests when these are threatened. India’s non-alignment did not prevent it from forging strong and mutually beneficial partnerships with major countries. The India-Soviet partnership from 1960-1990 is an example just as the current strategic partnership with the U.S. is. The foreign policy of his predecessors had been rooted in India’s civilisational sense, its evolving place in the international system and its own changing capabilities. Their seminal contributions should be acknowledged and built upon rather than proclaim a significant departure. The Prime Minister’s plea for global collaboration to deal with a densely inter-connected world is in line with India’s traditional foreign policy. A leadership role in mobilising global collaboration, more specifically in fighting COVID-19 would be in keeping with India’s traditional activism on the international stage. The Prime Minister has shown commendable initiative in convening leaders of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation nations for a regional collaborative effort on COVID-19. This should be followed by an international initiative, either through the G-20 or through the U.N.

Pandemic as opportunity

The Prime Minister made no reference to the role of the U.N., the premier multilateral institution, as a global platform for collaborative initiatives. There may have been irritation over remarks by the UN Secretary General on India’s domestic affairs and the activism displayed by the UN Commissioner for Human Rights on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act controversy. This should not influence India’s long-standing commitment to the U.N. as the only truly inclusive global platform enjoying international legitimacy despite its failings. If one has to look for a “single platform” where a Global Voice could be created, as the Prime Minister suggested, surely a reformed and strengthened U.N. should be on India’s agenda.

The COVID-19 pandemic presents India with an opportunity to revive multilateralism, become a strong and credible champion of internationalism and assume a leadership role in a world that is adrift. The inspiration for this should come from reaffirming the well springs of India’s foreign policy since its Independence rather than seeking to break free.

355,2020/03/18,Coming to terms with biometrics in policing,"Modern technology has dangers, but there should be hope that care and sophistication would transform investigation

Ever since the police became a formal organisation nearly 150 years ago, there is global consensus that the police charter ought not to be restricted to a mere maintenance of peace in public places. It should focus equally on crime prevention and detection. Speaking of police handling of crime, the traditional argument of criminologists is that while preventing a crime is arduous and usually beyond human capacity (because of the dimensions and complexities of modern society), solving a crime is relatively easy.

Police history has shown up fault lines in law enforcement strategy in discharging the twin tasks. It is in the area of crime detection that the police in most nations have lost public confidence. Even police forces which have huge manpower and can afford to buy the latest technology have not exactly distinguished themselves in their efforts to boost success rates in solving crime — it is now between 30% and 40%. Except in sensational cases which have attracted public and media attention, the Indian police have also been guilty of underperformance.

Also Read For a humane and autonomous police

Crime using knives continue to worry London’s Metropolitan Police, while the frequency of gun violence is high in U.S. cities. All this despite robust and aggressive policing. While cases of grave sexual assault as in the Nirbhaya case have damaged the police’s reputation as far as ensuring the safety of Indian women is concerned, . even allowing for substantial non-reporting of assaults on women, I believe there is a degree of enhanced sense of security among Indian women, attributable to some extent to greater police sensitivity and also to increased precautions being taken by women.

The two sides

However, there is a dismaying paradox here. Citizens no doubt demand newer crime control measures which will keep them safe. At the same time they resent productive and smarter police innovations in the field because of perceived danger to individual rights and privacy. Surprisingly, the campaign against police experiments has been spearheaded by some women activist groups. Their stand is that the end cannot and should not justify the means used by state agencies. This explains the sharp adverse responses, albeit only by a few groups, to a counter-crime facial recognition technology. This is the technology that seeks to make inroads into the underworld’s ability to be elusive and their machinations in order to escape detection by the police radar.

Taking into account how criminals merge with the community to escape identification, the police in several countries have sought the help of expert security agencies to scan faces seen in public spaces. This is with a view, whenever necessary, to run them against available databases of faces used in crime fighting.

The resistance especially in the United States and the United Kingdom, against facial recognition software, has been baffling. Its modest use in India explains the lack of public discourse on the pros and cons of facial identification software.

Gauging the opposition

Opposition to facial recognition technology has come mainly from two groups. The first are those who believe that the software discriminates against minorities and ethnic groups, especially blacks and other non-whites. The suggestion is that there is a disproportionate number of black and non-white faces captured by this software if one considers their large numbers in a community. This charge applies mainly to the police in the U.S. It mirrors the movement until recently in New York City against the use of ‘stop and frisk’ practice to combat crime. Several studies conducted in reaction to sharp protests by African-American groups revealed that more black and brown people were stopped and frisked than was warranted. The same charge of bias has now been brought against face recognition technology. This is, however, not comprehensible because the cameras are meant to take pictures at random rather than of specific segments of the population. The police in such cases are on a roving mission hunting for faces that have already come to adverse notice.

Next are rights activists who focus on privacy violation. Criticism is mainly on the ground that technology, despite the tall claim of infallibility by those producing it, has many a time been found guilty of errors. Therefore, harassment of innocent citizens is not uncommon.

Perhaps the stoutest defender of facial recognition technology is Cressida Dick, Metropolitan Police Commissioner. Addressing the Royal United Services Institute recently, she dismissed the charge that the practice of capturing faces — “policing without consent” — harms individuals, either physically or in terms of reputation. She pointed out how the moment there is no match of a face with existing records, it is deleted. She commented on how citizens have no qualms in handing over their data to private companies, especially while unlocking phones using one’s fingerprint. She added that data, even when there are matches with the existing Met database, are deleted within 31 days of capture if there is no requirement for further investigation. The Commissioner also referred to the solving of at least eight crimes in recent months with the help of facial recognition. There is no reason to believe that this is a specious claim.

U.S. study

In contrast to this one has the study of 2019 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NISDT) in the U.S. which found that many of the current facial recognition algorithms were likely to misidentify members of some groups 100 times more frequently than they do of the other groups. In its study, the NISDT took up 189 algorithms from 99 organisations and its findings raise doubts about the wisdom of employing facial recognition software indiscriminately. The study surmised that error rates could perhaps be brought down by using a diverse set of training data. Whether the misidentification is due to bias built into the software is not clear. However the danger of misidentification cannot be brushed aside.

Also Read Facial recognition is an invasive and inefficient tool

The point that critics of facial recognition technology who raise privacy concerns should remember is that our faces are already online in a number of places. Increased use of CCTV cameras in a number of public places is in a sense a threat to anonymity. When this is the reality, how can we object to the police scanning us for the laudable objective of solving a case under investigation?

In the ultimate analysis, any modern technology is fraught with hidden dangers. There is no claim of infallibility either by the software maker or by the person selling it or who advocates its deployment. Grave errors from its use are however few and far between. Just as DNA testing establishes either the guilt or the innocence of a person arraigned for crime, facial recognition performs an equally vital role in criminal justice administration.

356,2020/03/18,"Letters to the Editor — March 18, 2020","Gogoi for Rajya Sabha

The nomination of the former Chief Justice of India, Ranjan Gogoi, to the Rajya Sabha, brings under the spotlight the issue of judicial integrity and the doctrine of separation of the judiciary from the executive. What is more unfortunate is the defence of citing past political appointments of judges such as Justice Ranganath Mishra and Justice Baharul Islam. Nothing can be more damaging for our democracy than people’s diminishing faith in the judicial system. Impartiality and an aloofness have been its hallmarks and should not be diluted. Justice Gogoi has overseen a number of path-changing judgments and it would not be right for him to move into politics. .

Abhishek Singh Tomar,

Bhind, Madhya Pradesh

The development only reinforces the perception that the judiciary’s independence is eroding and the line between the constitutional separation of powers between the judiciary and executive is blurring. The government’s actions of praising the judiciary of late make one suspicious. Is India’s judiciary destroying its own independency, impartiality and integrity at the hands of the executive and in danger of losing the trust of millions?

D. Sethuraman,

Chennai

It is true that in the past, Chief Justices have accepted high public office after retirement but what is unique and unfortunate in the Gogoi case is that he has been offered a Rajya Sabha membership by the ruling party. This assumes relevance because it is he, as a Chief Justice of India, who presided over the Bench that gave the Ayodhya verdict, a case of far-reaching consequence to the ruling party. Immediately, after his retirement, he was given Z-plus security and other benefits which have not been conferred to any other retiring CJI. This has cast a shadow on the institution.

In contrast is Justice H.R. Khanna who wrote the sole dissenting judgment in the habeas corpus case during the Emergency and which cost him the office of CJI. He walked away to lead the life of a judicial monk. His portrait is in the Court’s hall — an example to emulate.

N.G.R. Prasad,

D. Nagasaila,

It is disappointing that Justice Gogoi has been nominated within no time after his retirement. This does raise doubts about the impartial conduct of the judiciary. People cannot be blamed if they begin to wonder about his conduct while serving in the judiciary.

Waiting for a cure

The very word COVID-19 strikes an invidious and incalculable terror along with anguish as the pandemic continues its march. Despite efforts, there does not seem to be much headway in slowing the spread.

One hopes that the wringing of our hands in utter despair ends and that medicine is able to provide the breakthrough. For nations, this is the time for cooperation.

Will he?

The depiction by cartoonist Surendra, of actor Rajinikanth on a treadmill with a placard reading ‘Coming soon!’ (OpEd page, Cartoonscape, March 17) is a subtle message that he will not enter politics just as the treadmill only rotates where it is. While his die-hard fans still ‘believe’ he is the right person to make a difference perhaps the ‘Coming soon!’ placard is more a foretelling of his forthcoming film than about his political plunge.

357,2020/03/18,Bhima-Koregaon probe: Pawar to appear before panel on April 4,"Commission to submit investigation report on April 8

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief spokesperson and Minority Affairs Minister Nawab Malik on Wednesday said party president Sharad Pawar will appear before the Bhima-Koregaon Commission of Inquiry in Mumbai on April 4 after the Parliament session ends.

Mr. Malik said, “The commission had asked Mr. Pawar for a convenient date for appearing before it. Accordingly, he will appear before the panel on April 4 as the Parliament session would be over by then.” The sittings of the panel have been shifted from Pune to Mumbai in view of the rise in novel coronavirus cases in Pune.

“We have been maintaining from day one that the violence was pre-planned. Mr. Pawar will put forth his stand before the commission,” Mr. Malik said.

The NCP chief had filed an affidavit before the panel headed by former Bombay High Court Chief Justice J.N. Patel on October 8, 2018.

Last month, Sagar Shinde, a member of Vivek Vichar Manch, had filed an application before the commission seeking to serve a summons on Mr. Pawar over certain statements made by him in the media on the January 2018 violence in Bhima-Koregaon.

In his plea, the applicant had cited a press conference Mr. Pawar had held on February 18. As per his application, at the press meet, Mr. Pawar alleged that right-wing activists Milind Ekbote and Sambhaji Bhide had created a charged atmosphere in Bhima-Koregaon.

“In the same press conference, Mr. Pawar also alleged that the role played by the Pune city police commissioner is doubtful and must be investigated. These statements are within the purview of the terms of reference of this commission and therefore they are relevant,” Mr. Shinde said.

In his affidavit, Mr. Pawar had stated that it was unfortunate that the former State government led by Bharatiya Janata Party and the law enforcement authorities had failed to protect the interests of commoners residing in Bhima-Koregaon.

“I would not be in a position to factually point out the chronology of the said events as that would be the domain of the existing law and order machinery,” he had said, adding that he would not be in a position to specifically make allegations against any particular organisation.

Mr. Pawar had mentioned the active role of right-wing forces behind the violence at Bhima-Koregaon cannot be ruled out. “However, concrete evidence in this regard can be gathered only by law enforcement agencies of the State government,” he had said in the affidavit.

Last month, the Maha Vikas Aghadi government gave the commission a final extension till April 8 to submit its investigation report.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/nuwo3b/article31102338.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BMSHARADPAWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bhima-koregaon-probe-pawar-to-appear-before-panel-on-april-4/article31102339.ece
358,2020/03/18,Dip in poultry sales: State warns rumour-mongers of stern action,"No threat of contracting COVID-19 from consuming poultry products: Minister

Animal Husbandry Minister Sunil Kedar on Wednesday said the State government is constantly monitoring people who spread disinformation on social media that consumption of poultry products increases the chances of contracting the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

Mr. Kedar clarified that there is no threat of contracting COVID-19 from eating chicken or other poultry products and strict action will be taken against individuals who spread such fake messages on social media platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter.

“These claims are unscientific and baseless. Farmers involved in poultry production are severely affected because of rumours that the coronavirus spreads through poultry,” he said.

A man in Andhra Pradesh and another person from Uttar Pradesh have been arrested for spreading false information related to COVID-19, Mr. Kedar said, adding that authorities are cracking down on rumour-mongers and they will be dealt with sternly.

Prices of poultry products have crashed following misinformation on social media that eating chicken or other meat can spread COVID-19.

Earlier this month, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) had asserted that there is no scientific evidence to show that the coronavirus spreads through eating chicken, mutton and seafood.

On Tuesday, Shiv Sena MPs met Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to discuss the crisis in the poultry sector amid the novel coronavirus crisis. According to Lok Sabha MP Arvind Sawant, they discussed the reduction in demand for poultry products. They also requested the Centre to provide immediate financial assistance to poultry farmers in the State.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/m8cehl/article31102144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BMNirmala-Sitharaman,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/dip-in-poultry-sales-state-warns-rumour-mongers-of-stern-action/article31102145.ece
359,2020/03/18,Four with ‘quarantine’ stamp deboarded from train at Palghar,"They were going to Surat by Garib Rath from Mumbai

Four passengers, travelling from Mumbai to Surat were deboarded from a Delhi-bound train at Palghar after they were found with a “home quarantine” stamp on their hands. The four had arrived from Germany and had been recommended to be under home quarantine.

The incident occurred on board the Garib Rath train from Bandra to New Delhi, when co-passengers raised an alarm and the Train Ticket Examiners (TTE) noticed their stamps.

“The four belonged to one family and had come from Germany. They were on their way to Surat when our TTEs displayed presence of mind and saw their stamps. They were deboarded at Palghar and handed over to the district authorities,” Divisional Railway Manager, Mumbai Division, WR, GVL Satyakumar, said. He added that the coach G4, in which the four passengers were travelling, was disinfected at Surat.

Railway officials said the four had been tested at SevenHills Hospital and did not show any symptoms of being infected with novel coronavirus. Kailash Shinde, District Collector of Palghar, said they were again checked by district health officers at Palghar. “They showed no signs or symptoms. We asked them to be in quarantine at our facility but they wanted to go home. We told them they could not use public transport, can only take a private vehicle and travel non-stop,” he said. Of the four, three were going to Surat and one to Bhavnagar. They have shared their credentials with the respective district collectors.

Mr. Shinde said there were no clear directives on how people under home quarantine should travel to their homes. “I will be writing to the government for some clarity on this, as many who land in Mumbai have homes elsewhere,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/y75jbr/article31098657.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/seal,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/family-of-four-with-quarantine-seal-de-boarded-from-delhi-train/article31098450.ece

Archbishop of Bombay Cardinal Oswald Gracias has exempted all faithful in the Archdiocese of Bombay the obligation to attend Sunday Mass till March 31 in the wake of social distancing measures to help contain the spread of COVID-19.

Cardinal Gracias, in an official communication on Tuesday, also urged all those sick or having a weakened medical condition not to come to church for Mass. In addition, anyone with fever or cough or over the age of 60 and vulnerable to contracting coronavirus has been urged to stay away from Mass.

In his statement, the Archbishop of Bombay said that since the period of Lent was on, the faithful should, particularly on Sundays, pray together at the family rosary, make the way of the cross or have a meditative reading of the Bible for 15 minutes.

Cardinal Gracias also informed that he was asking the Liturgical Commission to prepare a liturgy of the word which parishioners can use at home. He also urged that for all those convenient, he would be offering Sunday Mass that would be streamed on the Eucharist on YouTube.

361,2020/03/18,"Former constable kills son over domestic dispute, held","61-year-old was irked by victim’s drinking habits, debts

The police on Tuesday arrested a 61-year-old retired constable for allegedly murdering his son in their Powai residence over a domestic dispute late on Monday.

According to the Powai police, the accused, Gulab Galande, is a former constable who took voluntary retirement after 15 years of service and then worked in the security department of a private construction firm till 2017. Officials said his relationship with his elder son, Harish (40), was severely strained due to the latter’s compulsive alcoholism and its effects on his family life. Harish was posted as a constable with the Government Railway Police in Andheri.

“Harish and Mr. Galande would have frequent arguments over the former spending all his earnings on his addiction and his neglect of his family. Harish had been married for over 12 years and had two sons but continued to come home at odd hours after drinking heavily. He had also accumulated a debt of ₹25 lakh, which Mr. Galande had managed to pay off at great personal cost,” an officer with the Powai police said.

The officer said on the night of the incident, Harish came home drunk with a bottle of liquor in his hands and this led to an argument between the father and son. The Galandes stayed in a ground-plus-one structure in Ganesh Nagar and Harish’s brother was on the first floor, where the argument broke out, while his wife and sons were on the ground floor.

In the heat of the argument, Harish sprang at his father with the liquor bottle raised in the air. Mr. Galande allegedly seized a sickle that was lying nearby and hit him on the head with it, cleaving his skull in the process. Harish was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was declared dead before admission while some of the Galandes’ neighbours informed the Powai police about the incident.

“Mr. Galande was still in the house when our team got there and surrendered without resistance. He was arrested and charged with murder under the Indian Penal Code,” Assistant Commissioner of Police (Saki Naka division) Milind Khetle said, adding that the accused has been remanded in police custody till March 21.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/former-constable-kills-son-over-domestic-dispute-held/article31094798.ece
362,2020/03/18,"Jio files cheating, defamation case against unidentified people","Fraudsters approached residents with various offers

An official at Reliance Jio has registered a case at Rabale MIDC police station against unidentified fraudsters who created fake lookalike websites of the company and cheated people.

Deputy manager of security loss and prevention Sudheer Nair, in his complaint registered on Saturday, said the only two official websites belonging to their company are www.jio.com and ww.ril.com.

The company learnt about the cheating when people started approaching them demanding the services for which they had paid. The fake websites were suspected to have been created in January 2018 as the people who approached the company were cheated between then and March 2020.

The accused had approached the victims through emails, phone calls, social media, messages and WhatsApp. They offered to get Jio towers erected on the terrace of people promising a deposit of ₹25 lakh and a rental of ₹25,000 each month for which they asked them to pay some amount as deposit. A few were promised jobs with Reliance Jio, others were promised optic fibre internet connections while some more people were cheated on the promise of winning the Jio KBC lottery. The victims were asked to pay anything between ₹500 and ₹50,000 for each of the offers.

“There is a lot of technical investigation involved in the case. We will have to look into each of the email IDs, mobile numbers and domains of the fake websites,” senior police inspector Nitin Gite from Rabale MIDC police station said.

He said close to 300 people have contacted the company, but it has corroborated the data of 50 people who were cheated of ₹9.44 lakh and given it to the police. “They are corroborating the remaining data,” he said.

The accused have been booked on charges of cheating and defamation under the Indian Penal Code and provisions of Information Technology Act.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/jio-files-cheating-defamation-case-against-unidentified-people/article31094791.ece
363,2020/03/18,Kalyan resident who joined ISIS granted bail,"NIA court stays order till March 27 after agency moves plea

A special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on Tuesday granted bail to Islamic State (ISIS) recruit Areeb Majeed, a Kalyan resident who was arrested in November 2014 for having travelled to Iraq and then Syria to join the global terrorist outfit.

The court, however, stayed its own order till March 27 after NIA moved a plea stating that it wanted to challenge the bail granted to Mr. Majeed before the Bombay High Court. Mr. Majeed is the only ISIS recruit to have returned to India.

He and three other people — Fahad Shaikh, Shaheem Tanki and Aman Tandel — had left India for Iraq under the guise of pilgrimage in May 2014 and joined the ISIS. All of them later went to Syria, where the other three are believed to have been killed, while Mr. Majeed came back to India via Turkey in November 2014.

Earlier, he had moved a bail plea before the HC after it was rejected by the special NIA court. Mr. Majeed had pleaded that he has been in custody for over five years. The HC had then directed him to approach the NIA court again, and the court was asked to consider the plea afresh.

The NIA in its chargesheet against Mr. Majeed had claimed that he had participated in several attacks perpetrated by ISIS, and had sustained bullet injuries on two occasions, and was seriously injured in a bombing following which he had decided to return to India.

The agency claimed that Mr. Majeed wanted to sneak back into the country and had approached the Indian Embassy in Turkey on November 24, claiming that he had lost his passport and wanted to go back to India. It also claimed that Mr. Majeed was influenced by the terrorist group and its activities in the later half of 2013, and came in touch with Shaikh, who operated a twitter handle by the name @magnetgas which he used to propagate the ISIS ideology. Mr. Majeed then came in touch with Tanki and Tandel and they planned to join ISIS and went to Iraq by booking a pilgrimage package for ₹2,37,500.

The NIA claimed that the accused had gotten in touch with Rehman Daulati, an Afghan national, who had introduced them to an Iraqi national named Abu Fatima, who helped Mr. Majeed and others join ISIS. Mr. Majeed was taken to an ISIS camp at Jhazira, and was given a new name and was known as Abu Ali Al Hindi.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/nuatnt/article31094784.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BM-Areeb,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kalyan-resident-who-joined-isis-granted-bail/article31094785.ece
364,2020/03/18,"COVID-19: Better to die here than in detention centres, say Mumbai Bagh protesters","‘All precautions are being followed, we have made sanitisation mandatory ... will not leave’

As the situation due to spread of the dreaded COVID-19 pandemic continues to be fluid, women protesters at Mumbai Bagh said they would comply with all safety precautions, but won’t call off their protest, which has now entered its 51st day.

Despite thinner crowds, the older women are firm on remaining at the site and continuing their protest until the Assembly listens and passes a resolution against the CAA, NRC, and NPR in the State.

Mariam, a regular protester who also manages activities at Mumbai Bagh, said “We are following all the necessary precautions here. We have made sanitisation mandatory. All of us offer prayers five times a day and we have to wash our hands before that as well. People are being provided with masks, women’s faces are ordinarily also covered by burqa and we are requesting people with any sign of illness to not come to the protests, specially young children and elderly women,” she said.

A visit to the spot on Tuesday showed that efforts have also been taken to space out the women. A disinfectant was being sprayed, and a team of paramedics, made up of protesters who are also practising doctors, is routinely briefing the crowd on sanitisation and the importance of maintaining cleanliness. “If anyone reports a fever or signs of sickness, they can go and get themselves checked,” Dr. Vasika Seliya, a nearby resident and member of the medical teams, said.

Dr. Seliya also shared how as a doctor and protester, she sensed the anxiety and restlessness building in the crowds, specially since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. Keeping their mental health in mind, the protesters have started different activities to channelise the energy in the form of creative expressive arts, such as poster making for children, conducting team-building workshops for young girls, and knitting for women to keep them occupied.

“If we have to go, the coronavirus can find us even at home. We are not so scared. If not here, we will anyway be put in detention centres to die,” was a common feeling among the elderly women, whose resolve to not leave Mumbai Bagh has only gained strength, a protest coordinator said.

Aimed at being a headless, all-women collaborative protest movement, Mumbai Bagh has had its issues with some male members claiming to be organisers. To address this, the women have now formed a core committee of about 25 women, who ensure the protesters are consulted with, informed about changes and coordinate all activities at the site.

After a delegation of about 30 protesters and activists met the Nagpada Police on Monday, including Additional Commissioner of Police Veeresh Prabhu, Deputy Commissioner of Police Dr. Vinay Tripathi and Assistant Commissioner of Police Vinay Gadgil, the protesters have been more careful in ensuring that there is no mass gathering and that the number of people at the protest site reduces.

“We are looking at online protests as well, through groups on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. We can approach and mobilise people online, conduct conference calls, and make sure there are fewer people sitting at the site while maintaining distance from each other, as a symbol of our protest,” said Ali Bhojani, who attended the meeting.

Ms. Mariam said the government and people probably thought this would stop soon and protesters would want to go back home. “We want the attention of the police and the State. They have been promising us that CAA will not be implemented here, but there has been no resolution passed on it yet. That is what we want, and if they agree, Mumbai Bagh will be emptied in one hour,” she said with others agreeing in unison.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/9p13by/article31094759.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BMMUMBAIBAGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/covid-19-better-to-die-here-than-in-detention-centres-say-mumbai-bagh-protesters/article31094760.ece
365,2020/03/18,"BMC ramps up facilities at Kasturba Hospital, injects life into Seven Hills","More beds added; electric connections, toilets repaired; private housekeeping agency roped in; patients have option to choose ‘five-star’ meals

With the fear of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) gripping the city, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has turned around two of its hospitals: improving facilities at Kasturba Hospital and bringing Seven Hills Hospital to life. While the hospitals have now become the centres of all activity related to the virus, the BMC is receiving bouquets as well as brickbats for the facilities being provided there.

When the first tests on suspected patients started being conducted in Mumbai at the beginning of this month, the civic body was ill-equipped to handle the crisis. As on Tuesday, 498 patients have been admitted to Kasturba Hospital. Initially, Kasturba only had about 28 beds in its isolation facility. The figure was later increased by another 30 and now the total number of beds is 100.

A civic officer, who did not wish to be named, said, “Kasturba usually sees fewer patients but with the hospital becoming the epicentre of Mumbai’s battle against coronavirus, Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi improved it overnight. More beds were added in the isolation centre; toilets were cleaned; fans, tubelights, and TV sets were repaired; and plumbing, sewage and power supply connections were checked.”

Besides, the BMC has roped in a private housekeeping agency to conduct cleaning inside the hospital, and also given the patients the option to have their meals from a ‘five-star’ restaurant. The civic body has procured 32 TV sets for patients in isolation wards. Wi-Fi has been extended to the patients as well.

Meanwhile, the once near-defunct Seven Hills Hospital in Marol has now become the city’s largest quarantine facility. It had been almost entirely shut down over non-payment of dues to staffers, a pending legal battle, and a tiff between its management and the BMC. Within two days, the hospital was turned into a quarantine facility with a capacity to accommodate 400 patients.

“We had to repair the wards, electric and plumbing connections, and toilets. Lifts had to be made functional. It was all put together in two days. In emergencies, you pull in all resources like vendors and contractors. Then every corner of the hospital had to be disinfected. On Monday, 240 people, who were supposed to go in for home quarantine, erroneously came to our hospital. We gave them all consultation and asked them to go home,” said IAS officer Ashutosh Salil, who is working as a special coordinator for Seven Hills.

Mr. Salil said so far, there are around 30 ‘B’ category patients quarantined at Seven Hills. “Besides, we are building an isolation centre that will work as an alternative to Kasturba; it will be ready in less than a week. Some private hospitals like Kokilaben Hospital and Jaslok Hospital have been providing support to the BMC.”

Mr. Pardeshi and Health Minister Rajesh Tope are monitoring both these hospitals closely.

However, the BMC has been receiving bouquets and brickbats for its arrangements at these hospitals. One Twitter user Ankit Gupta had posted pictures of the poor state of Kasturba, which went viral. Following that, the hospital underwent several repairs. Another Twitter user @AbiraDhar shared her positive experience of being quarantined at Kasturba on Tuesday.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ktabxt/article31094754.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BMSeven-Hills,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bmc-ramps-up-facilities-at-kasturba-injects-life-into-seven-hills/article31094742.ece

The Maharashtra government has asked JJ Hospital, BJ Medical College in Pune, and Nagpur Medical College to conduct an epidemiological study of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and submit a report. It claims that every government medical college in the State is now equipped with an isolation ward and ventilators.

Dr. Sanjay Mukherjee, secretary, Medical Education and Drugs, said, “JJ Hospital, BJ Medical College, and Nagpur Medical College will study the numbers, the spread of the disease in India, and what is a good way to tackle the virus.”

An officer from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s epidemiology cell called this a good move as the study will help trace the pattern of the virus’s arrival and spread in the country, which can be used for further research.

Mr. Mukherjee listed a number of measures being planned by the State. “In three weeks, we will have new labs in five cities with a capacity to handle 100 tests per day. We have got approval for the labs from the Centre. We have also sought three more labs at Grant Medical College, BJ Medical College, and Haffkine Institute with a capacity of 100 each, totalling 1,100 samples per day (including 200 by Kasturba Hospital and 100 by KEM Hospital).”

Mr. Mukherjee also said all medical college hospitals in the State already have an isolation ward. “There is a diagnostic team of microbiologist, pulmologist, intensivist, and infectious diseases expert to guide the treatment. We are fully prepared to handle this.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/m7josg/article31094736.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BM--FAMILY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/coronavirus-maharashtra-government-orders-epidemiological-study/article31094717.ece
367,2020/03/18,Coronavirus | Mumbai man is Maharashtra’s first COVID-19 casualty,"One critical at Kasturba Hospital; with two more testing positive, number of confirmed cases touches 41

A 64-year-old Mumbai resident became the first casualty of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Maharashtra on Tuesday, taking the death toll in India to three. Doctors said the senior citizen who had a travel history to Dubai developed bilateral pneumonia and cardiac complications, which led to his death.

The victim had returned to Mumbai on March 5 and had got admitted to PD Hinduja Hospital on March 8 under his cardiologist for a discomfort related to his existing heart condition. He also suffered from hypertension. He tested positive for COVID-19 on March 12 and was shifted to Kasturba Hospital’s isolation facility the next day.

At Kasturba, he was put on non-invasive ventilator support and his condition was said to be critical because of his co-morbid conditions. Just as feared, the coronavirus caused pneumonia in both his lungs.

A Goregaon Film City worker walks past a closed ticket booking window for visitors on Tuesday.

“He was improving till Monday but his condition suddenly deteriorated,” civic health officer Dr. Daksha Shah said. On Monday, the patient's repeat test had come negative.

According to civic health officials, the patient had high blood pressure, pneumonia, inflammation of heart muscles, and increased heart rate.

The senior citizen’s wife and son, who have also tested positive, could not attend his last rites. Civic officials had advised relatives and friends to not gather for condolences.

The body was taken to the electric crematorium at Shivaji Park where the final procedures were carried out by three crematorium staff members who were equipped with masks, goggles, and gloves.

Meanwhile, civic health officials said the condition of a positive patient admitted to Kasturba is critical. “The patient is on ventilator,” Dr. Shah said.

A 49-year-old man from Mumbai and a 26-year-old man from Pimpri Chinchwad, both with a travel history to the U.S., tested positive on Tuesday, taking the total number of confirmed cases in the State to 41.

368,2020/03/18,GoAir suspends international operations,"Airline introduces temporary leave without pay programme for employees

In the wake of cancellations and visa restrictions to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, low-cost carrier GoAir on Tuesday announced a temporary suspension of all its international flights from March 17 to April 15.

The airline has also decided to implement a short-term rotational ‘leave without pay’ programme to counter the temporary reduction in capacity. In a statement, GoAir said the aviation industry has been one of the most affected sectors as governments have issued travel advisories with far-reaching effects. Special events have been postponed or called off, customers have curtailed their travel plans and businesses have restricted movement of employees.

A GoAir spokesperson said, “Knowing that this will put financial burden on affected employees and having studied what companies have done in other countries to help guide our plans, this decision was not taken lightly.” GoAir has daily fights to Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Muscat, Bangkok, Phuket and Male from Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Kannur.

GoAir said it has enhanced its cleaning procedures in the interest of the health and safety of customers and employees. “There is nothing more important than this. We have also tried to put our customers at ease by offering them a waiver on change fees so that they can be confident about booking their travel today while maintaining full flexibility in the future. Despite going over and above to implement these safeguards, the sharp decline in air travel that we are currently experiencing is unprecedented,” the spokesperson said.

Plea to Centre

GoAir said airlines in India have petitioned the Central government for immediate support as most other governments in the world have already provided to their affected airlines.

The GoAir statement said, “We have also taken many immediate measures to make our business more efficient. Measures will help us create an even stronger airline in the long run. GoAir remains on track to receive 12 to 15 aircraft each year through the end of 2025 in support of our planned growth. We also reaffirm our focus and commitment to punctuality, reliability and the highest level of customer experience.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/1ycsba/article31094572.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BMGOAIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/goair-suspends-international-operations/article31094573.ece

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation on Tuesday ordered the closure of spas, clubs, discotheques, Sanjay Gandhi National Park, and amusement parks, apart from banning mass congregations. It has also asked private and public sector companies to encourage their employees to work from home.

Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi has, under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, been empowered to take decisions for the city till the Act is in place.

On Monday, the commissioner had issued an order prohibiting vehicular movement around isolation/quarantine centres, and all non-essential service providing offices to function at only 50% capacity, among other things. He amended that to order closure of other establishments on Tuesday.

While non-essential private and public companies have been asked to work at 50% of usual staff capacity, the essential establishments, which are exempted, now include sectors like electricity, petroleum, oil, energy, media, and ports. Spitting will also incur an instant fine of ₹1,000. “Private sector and public sector companies to encourage all their staff to work from home,” the order said. There was some confusion initially on Tuesday with media reports claiming that government offices would be shut for a week. However, the Chief Minister later denied such a move.

Meanwhile, the Mumbai Police have instructed all establishments with live music on their premises to stay shut till March 31. The order, which was issued on Tuesday, and which comes into effect immediately, was addressed to all senior police inspectors in charge of police stations in Mumbai. It states that establishments with live orchestra or disc jockey (DJ) facility, dance bars, pubs, discotheques and live bands at any event would not be allowed till the end of the month.

“As the capable licensing authority, Sr PIs are instructed to ensure that such establishments do not operate till March 31 and take necessary action at their level immediately,” states the circular, signed by Deputy Commissioner of Police (Headquarters I) N. Ambika.

With the shutting down of schools, colleges and public places, the city’s autorickshaws and cab drivers experienced a major slack in business over the last few days.

“Since beaches have shut, public travelling to such places has reduced by almost 50%. Even the shutting down of malls, theatres and schools has affected us a lot,” Prakash Yadav, an autorickshaw driver from Vile Parle said. Autorickshaw drivers in Bandra had a similar story, with fewer people coming out of their homes. “Even over the weekend, not many people visited bandstand or Linking Road market out of fear of the virus,” Asraf Sheikh said. The drivers said their average wait time had increased from 15 to 20 minutes to an hour over the past week.

With several offices planning to ask their employees to work from home, drivers at key commercial districts like Lower Parel, Bandra Kurla Complex and Link Road in Andheri feel that their income would drop further. “Our daily earning has decreased by about 25% due to the fear instilled in the public,” Ganesh Tiwari, who drives a taxi in Lower Parel, said. Another driver, Rajendra Singh echoed his sentiment: “We will also have to shut down our business and sit at home if more people don’t turn up in the coming days.” Shabbier Sheikh, an autorickshaw driver in Bandra (East) said there had been a drop of around 30% in business.

Drivers on app-based cab aggregators have also reported a steep decline in business with many saying they have had to wait nearly 45 minutes before getting a customer. Jagjivan Gautam, who drives an Uber, said he and many other drivers had started wearing masks. “Since we frequently take airport pick-ups, there is a sense of mistrust among customers and hence I have been wearing a mask for the last week,” he said.

Both taxi and auto drivers were also anxious about the possibility of the suburban network shutting down, which would prove a death knell to their businesses.

Mr. Kakde said on March 16 itself nearly 9,262 trips were cancelled, amounting to a loss of ₹1.28 crore.

Maharashtra has the highest number people testing positive for the novel coronavirus in the country at 41, with Mumbai and Pune accounting for the highest number of cases. The MSRTC has cancelled several of its premium Shivneri buses from Mumbai, Thane and Aurangabad to Pune. On March 16, nearly 70 Shivneri services along 12 routes connecting Pune to the other cities were cancelled.

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday appealed to people to avoid unnecessary travel by trains and buses. He said a decision to suspend public transport would be taken if after reviewing the situation at regular intervals.

The State Cabinet discussed the spread of the novel coronavirus with the total number of positive cases in the State rising to 41 — 28 men and 12 women.

Mr. Thackeray said, “We have not decided to shut down government offices but are exploring the possibility of working with 50% workforce. Non-essential departments have been asked to limit their strength as much as possible.”

He said avoiding crowded places is one of the most effective ways to tackle the crisis. “We cannot close down public transport like trains and buses. But we appeal to the public to travel only when absolutely necessary. We are constantly reviewing the situation and if needed we will not hesitate to take harsh decisions,” he said.

Mr. Thackeray appealed to the heads of religious sects to try and avoid gatherings and close places of worship. He said, “We have yet not received permission from the Central government to carry out tests in private laboratories.

379,2020/03/18,"Now, don masks made in prison","Produced by inmates of 9 Central jails they will hit markets soon

To fulfil the growing demand for masks to counter the spread of the novel coronavirus, prisoners in the State’s nine Central jails are producing the protective covering. The masks are now being worn by prison authorities and will soon be available in the market.

Countering shortage

Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said the State is facing a shortage of masks and the idea of producing them with the help of inmates struck him. He said, “We discussed whether it can be implemented in Maharashtra. After checking the feasibility, we decided to implement it in all Central jails and the response is overwhelming.”

He said the prison authorities responded to the idea positively. “Not only are the prison authorities using the masks but we will also be supplying them to various distributors. The proceeds from the sale will be deposited in the accounts of the inmates who made them,” said Mr. Deshmukh.

The nine Central jails in the State are located in Taloja, Mumbai, and Thane (South region); Yerawada (Pune) and Kolhapur (West); Nagpur and Amravati (East); and Aurangabad and Nashik Road (Central region).

Police personnel wear masks made by prisoners.

Mr. Deshmukh on Tuesday also held a meeting with senior officials from the Home Department. “All new prisoners will be screened thoroughly for the novel coronavirus and if needed they will be kept in isolation. Apart from them, all prisoners will be screened. Jails with inmates more than their capacity will be shifted to other prisons if required,” said the Minister.

The State government on Tuesday urged top corporate and industry leaders to protect the interests of contract labourers and daily wage workers amid the economic turbulence caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope directed representatives of top corporate firms to provide advance payments to daily wagers while allowing them to stay at home if work from home is not possible. Mr. Tope said, “We held healthy discussions with two dozen industry leaders on social distancing and working from home. We have requested them for total or partial closure wherever needed and conduct virtual meetings with staff.”

The meeting was attended by the heads of companies such as Sony, Reliance Industries, Citibank, Reliance Jio, Cipla, Aditya Birla, HSBC-India, Deutsche Bank-India, Welspun, Lupin, Larsen & Toubro, ICICI Bank, Accenture, Deloitte, GSK Pharma, and Janssen India.

Government sources said many companies agreed to hold virtual meetings and work at 50% staff strength. An official said, “Several of them did not accept the idea of making an advance payment to daily wagers who work on an hourly basis. The corporate leaders also discussed possibilities of a total lockdown in the future.”

Arvind Goel, CII Maharashtra chairman and MD and CEO of Tata Autocomp, backed the government’s directive to companies providing non-essential services to function at 50% capacity and private and public sector companies to allow their staff to work from home. “CII will encourage all its members to adopt these practices and will play a key role in containing the COVID-19 outbreak in the city,” he said.

Mr. Tope also agreed to help pharmaceutical companies with finding a long-term cure to counter deadly viruses.

The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has poured cold water on ‘haldi kumkum’, sports and various other events that political parties have planned in the run-up to the municipal elections.

Municipal Commissioner Annasaheb Misal said at a press briefing on Tuesday that in the wake of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, permissions to all political events had been cancelled and anyone found organising a political gathering would be booked.

“Everything pertaining to the municipal elections, including various applications, hearing pertaining to nominations and objections, have been stalled, until further notice,” Mr. Misal said.

Mr. Misal also said NMMT buses and bus stops are being sanitised three times a day. “As of now, we have not cancelled any trips but if needed, we could cancel a few. Over the past few days, there has been a dip in passengers by 25%,” Mr. Misal said.

At least 52 Navi Mumbai residents are home-quaratined, he said. “Our COVID-19 cell makes calls to those home-quarantined, three times a day to verify if they have any symptoms. Periodically, they are given counselling as well. We have identified a building of the NMMC in Vashi, which can be used for quarantining suspected cases. The building has currently 30 beds and its capacity can be increased to 150.”

382,2020/03/18,"Coronavirus | Amid virus fear, railways cancel long-distance trains","Suspended trains had less than 20% occupancy; reduction will help improve operational efficiency, stem spread of infection: officials

Due to poor occupancy and as a preventive measure against the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the Central Railway (CR) and the Western Railway (WR) have both cancelled several key long-distance passenger trains.

Senior railway officials said they had cancelled trains which had occupancy under 20%. They said in some trains the occupancy had dropped to single digits making it unviable for any kind of operations.

Since the first positive cases of COVID-19 emerged, the railways have seen a surge in ticket cancellations across all trains. “We felt we could remove a few trains where alternatives were present, which would improve our operational efficiencies and help stem the spread of the virus,” an official said. He explained that by pulling certain trains out of the system, they would better deploy their resources to ensure trains are well-maintained.

The trains have been cancelled until March 31 and officials said they will be reviewing the situation around March 25 before taking a decision on the future course of action. The CR has cancelled 23 trains, including the Mumbai-Pune Deccan Express, Mumbai-Nagpur Nandigram Express, LTT-Manmad Express, Mumbai-Pune Pragati Express, Howrah-Mumbai Duranto Express and its only Rajdhani Express.

The WR, meanwhile, has cancelled 10 trains, including three Duronto trains: Mumbai Central-Indore Duronto Express, Mumbai Central-Jaipur Duronto Express and the Mumbai Central-New Delhi Duronto Express

New platform ticket rates

In a bid to ensure that fewer people come to railway stations, both CR and WR have hiked the cost of the platform tickets from ₹10 across stations within their jurisdiction. CR hiked the cost to ₹50 at 174 stations across all five divisions: Mumbai, Pune, Bhusaval, Nagpur and Solapur.

Platform ticket [prices at 26 stations of WR’s Mumbai division was increased to ₹50, which included key stations like Surat, Bandra Terminus, Borivali, Mumbai Central, Vapi, Dadar, Valsad, Andheri, Boisar, Palghar and Vasai. A WR spokesperson said there will be no change in the rate of platform tickets at the remaining stations and other divisions had also similarly increased the rate as a precautionary measure for crowd management.

Decreasing passengers

In the aftermath of the State government issuing guidelines to organisations and companies to limit the number of people stepping out for work, local trains saw a visible dip in the number of commuters during peak hours on Tuesday.

Railway officials said while absolute figures would only be available on Wednesday, they estimated a 20 to 25% dip in passengers. They said with the increase in the number of people testing positive for the virus, trains have witnessed a visible drop of around 10% in daily ridership.

“The bulk of the drop is seen in the general class of local trains. We expect that the ridership to go down further with more companies asking its employees to work from home,” a senior official said.

According to data, CR’s suburban section witnessed approximately 11% drop in passenger traffic between March 1 and 15, compared to the same period last year. WR saw a total drop of around 9% during the same period, with tickets purchased at the ticket window accounting for a 14% drop.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ekwqgx/article31094348.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BMINTERCITYEXPRESS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/amid-virus-fear-railways-cancel-long-distance-trains/article31094349.ece

384,2020/03/18,"Sport and Shelley, an eternal golden braid","Thanks to the coronavirus, many of us are thinking of what we do, why we do it, and what it all means.

It must have come as a shock to many that the most powerful entity in sport is not television, not the sponsor, not the player or official but a virus too small to be seen under an ordinary microscope. The first virus in biology was discovered well after the death of the poet Shelley, or Ozymandias — his poem about hubris — might have turned out differently.

Thanks to the coronavirus, many of us are thinking of what we do, why we do it, and what it all means. It is an alternative to thinking of death and pandemics and what-might-have beens.

Most profound activity

Sport is a pointless activity and in that lies its allure. It is also one of the most profound activities we can engage in. Is scoring a goal at Wembley more important than discovering a mathematical formula? That is the wrong way to put it.

Sport is not utilitarian — it does not lead to something else, it does not stand for something else. It is not a distraction from life, but life itself — lived at a different angle. Sports are their own means and ends, the goals artificial, the need real.

In a wonderful essay titled Why cricket?, Mike Marqusee said, “We watch sports precisely for all those things that lie beyond the functional.”

Sportsmen, unaware, live by the credo of the mathematician G.H. Hardy who said: “I have never done anything ‘useful’. No discovery of mine has made, or is likely to make, directly or indirectly, for good or ill, the least difference to the world…” Replace “discovery of mine” with “century of mine” or “outswinger of mine” and that would still be right.

Yet, there is about the perfect cover drive something that makes us feel good about ourselves, just as there is in mathematics a beauty beyond mere efficiency.

We need cricket not because it tells us about life or holds up a mirror to society, (it might, but that’s incidental), but for its own sake. As sports events around the world are cancelled, we realise afresh how necessary sport is.

A couple of days ago, someone tweeted a tiny bit of the action from India’s Test against West Indies in 1974-75, Bengaluru’s first-ever. It was the first Test I saw every ball of. As a schoolboy, I sat high in the stands and had to strain my neck to see some of the action. Two greats made their debut along with me — Gordon Greenidge and Viv Richards. The great fielder Eknath Solkar took what he considered his finest catch.

Skipper Clive Lloyd made a brutal century, Alvin Kallicharan a gentle, pleasing one. While Lloyd dropped the medium-pacers into the stands, Kallicharan dropped dead at his feet the spinners Prasanna and Chandrasekhar. On a turning track this was skill of the highest order.

What I also remembered when I saw the tweet was what I was thinking at that age, what I felt about school, the books I was reading, the friends I had in the neighbourhood. It was like Proust’s madeleine, unlocking memories one hadn’t visited in years. It was comforting to know they were still there, nearly half a century later.

Not all of us need sport to remind us of ourselves. Whatever is a passion will have the same effect — music, movies, books, theatre, politics. Sport is not a distraction but intricately woven into the tapestry of our lives. When the soccer manager Bill Shankly said, “Football is not a matter of life and death, it’s more important than that,” he was exaggerating, but also making a point.

At the other end of the scale is Noam Chomsky who dismissed sport as “an area which has no meaning and probably thrives because it has no meaning, as a displacement from the serious problems one cannot influence.”

There is near-religious fervour

The search for meaning in sport is a doomed exercise because sport, as played, is meaningless. But that does not make it insignificant or without value. In fact, what coats cricket (or soccer or tennis or basketball) with significance is the shared experience, the near-religious fervour with which fans approach it. Marx might just as easily have said that sport is the opium of the people and given opium a positive spin.

But that’s the demand side of sport, so to say. On the supply side is the unfolding narrative that is unpredictable, aesthetic, contains short-lived successes and failures, and in its range and scope allows both performer and spectator to discover aspects of herself that lead to greater self-knowledge.

Sport, unlike art or music or literature, can take the shape of whatever emotion we pour into it — and this makes the competition special and different from other, more consequential endeavours, like wars or oil pricing.

And that is why we love it so much. The cancellations are a reminder, like the spread of the coronavirus itself, that we are insufficiently grateful for what we have and that our egos don’t amount to much — something Shelley told us two centuries ago.",columns,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/rq6fqx/article31092972.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-CliveLloyd,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/suresh-menon-column-sport-and-shelley-an-eternal-golden-braid/article31092955.ece
385,2020/03/18,How the environment became the unexpected beneficiary of Coronavirus,"To match the changing expectations of social distancing, the tourism industry is now leaving a considerably smaller carbon footprint

Over the last month, the aviation industry’s carbon emissions seem to be dropping but not for the reasons you think: because what activism on climate change could not do, the Coronavirus outbreak has, unintentionally... not to say the world requires a pandemic to be proactive about the environment.

While it may be cumbersome to push the industry to adopt green methods, regional or intra-continental airlines are taking the extra step to kick off a revolution. More than 10 million travellers using Skyscanner selected the lowest-CO2-emission flight option over the last 12 months, according to the 2019 ‘Sustainable Travel Report’ by Booking.com. Last year, Portuguese airline Hi Fly operated the first single-use plastic-free flights, saving 200 pounds of plastic per flight. The company’s CEO Paulo Mirpuri says they want to be carbon neutral by 2021. “Travellers understand that the $1 to $1.50 hike in ticket fares is a small price to pay for the massive contribution to green behaviour in the travel industry,” he adds.

Key word According to Google Trends, the term ‘eco-friendly travel’ was searched at an average of just over 100 times a day in 2019, globally. India was one of the major epicentres for this search.

With the restrictions imposed on travel, over the past week, major airlines have issued statements about huge dips in demand. On March 17, Qantas announced that international and domestic travel have been cut by 90% and 60% respectively until end of May. Virgin Australia, additionally, is predicting a 7.7% first-half cut. According to Clean Energy Regulator, these two airlines combined accounted for seven million tonnes of CO2 in 2018-19.

Earlier this month, Flightradar24 announced that there was a 4.3% dip in flights taken in February, shortly after the first few cases were reported. An interactive line graph on their website reveals that from March 11 till March 15, the number of flights taken dropped by 27,820.

Plus, in a March 17 op-ed for The Conversation, Glen Peters from the Centre for International Climate and Environment Research, Oslo, hypothesises that the airline industry — which covers 2.6% of the global CO2 emissions — is in freefall. “It may take months, if not years, for people to return to air travel, given that Coronavirus may linger for several months.”

That said, there are blue skies aplenty in China and in northern Italy. According to China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the average number of ‘good quality air days’ increased 21.5% in February, compared to the same period last year. The European Space Agency (ESA) observed a particularly marked decline in emissions of nitrogen dioxide, a noxious gas emitted by power plants, cars, planes and factories, over the Po Valley region in northern Italy. “Although there could be slight variations in the data due to cloud cover and changing weather, we are very confident that the reduction in emissions that we can see coincides with the lockdown in Italy, causing less traffic and industrial activities,” says Claus Zehner, who manages the agency’s Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite mission, in a statement.

Existing green ventures

While cancelled flight routes and social distancing are the talk of the travel industry, more dialogue around carbon neutral tourism has circulated. Carbon neutral tourism involves any form of tourism actively taking out as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as is being put in. From airline carriers to the individual traveller, such measures can include the reduction of energy consumption and emissions-producing activities, improving energy efficiency, technological innovation in low carbon and consumption of renewable electricity. A wise move, considering the global energy-related CO2 emission level (according to International Energy Agency) was a record 33.3 billion tonnes in 2019.

Enter electric vehicles: a small player in the big picture of ‘responsible tourism’ but a favourite in ecotourism for the cost-effective appeal it holds for investors and the comfort it offers travellers. These have been a favourite since 2014 for guests at the Chobe Game Lodge, Botswana. Guests can wander along the Chobe river that borders Namibia and Botswana in electric safari boats. According to a report by Responsible Travel — the Brighton-based online travel firm customising environment-friendly travel plans — Chobe Game Lodge estimates that the electric boats have saved over 25,000 kilograms of CO2 emissions and nearly 10,000 litres of diesel since its launch. Plus, its solar safari boats have saved a further 12,749 kilograms of CO2 emissions.

The electric safari vehicle at Asilia Adventures’ Ol Pejeta Bush Camp in northern Kenya

Carbon neutral since 2009, East Africa-based Asilia Adventures claims to have offset a total of 1,505 tonnes of carbon waste. The company also has an electric safari option which kicked off at the Ol Pejeta Bush Camp in Kenya last October. Its electric car has no manual gear-box, meaning there are no jerky gear changes and no vibrations from the engine, making photography and videography smoother as the car is more stable. “A typical combustion engine runs at roughly 20-30% of its total efficiency, while electric vehicles run at 94-96% efficiency, providing a significant improvement in the performance of the vehicle itself. The lifespan of an electric vehicle is also more than that of a regular vehicle; the battery packs can easily travel more than 2,00,000 kilometres in their lifetime,” says Britta Foulis, content marketing manager at Asilia Adventures, on its website.

The travel-hungry are also awaiting the opening of the world’s first energy-positive hotel in 2022. Situated on a fjord beneath the Svartisen Glacier in northern Norway, the Svart Hotel claims to use 85% less energy than contemporary hotels in its market range. The conception, development and execution of this futuristic ring hotel is the result of combined efforts of real estate company MIRIS AS, design firm Snøhetta and energy company Powerhouse.

This year truly challenges the notion of the responsible traveller, whether one chooses to not travel at all or to take heed of the planet-conscious movements — and not leave it up to a viral outbreak to off-set everyone’s carbon guilt.",travel,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/ee41yp/article31099135.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY19-QANTAS,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/how-coronavirus-covid2019-is-lowering-tourism-industry-carbon-emissions/article31099136.ece
386,2020/03/18,"Fooya! app, now in Indian schools, inculcates healthy diets among children","The Fooya! game, in which you can be a superhero fighting junk food, is now partnering with Indian schools to be included as part of their curriculum

A 10-year-old is out to save the world from an evil scientist, who has made it his mission to develop machines that shoot processed food out like a laser. Every time she feels tired, she powers up with water (same, girl!) and traditional, local foods.

Since earlier this year, this is the Fooya! universe in which students from schools in Chennai, Mumbai and Delhi have been spending time. The VR game, which can be played in smartphones without headsets as well, has been designed by California-based life science company FriendsLearn, for children between the ages of five and 13.

This year, it is partnering with schools in India to inculcate the idea of a healthy diet lifestyle from a young age. The idea of the game is to fight against advertising of processed junk food which later in life could lead to diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases. And it is all done through neurocognitive training.

“Before they have even begun to speak, children are being introduced to advertisements,” says founder Bhargav Sri Prakash. “They are made to develop this warm fuzzy association with sugar, cereals and colas. They become associated with celebration, and processed food is called a ‘happy meal.’ Habits get formed early in life, so the seeds of life long diet risks develop in childhood.”

What Fooya! attempts to do is remove these associations by drawing children into a universe where packaged and processed food is the enemy — robots are inspired by vending and soda machines. To make it immersive, the game is in VR, and allows children to develop their character’s personality, right from the looks to the skills.

“We don’t outrightly tell the children what is good or bad. They come to their own realisation by experiencing what their characters are going through,” explains Bhargav. Depending on what they eat, their characters’ abilities, shapes, skills and health parameters like vision and speed change. “So they experience the consequence of their choice. It is all about staying in balance, in the fit zone.”

Digital vaccines In the future, medicine will not be in the form of a pill. Instead, technology will act as preventive medicine, claims Bhargav. “We are shaping a subcategory called digital vaccines. Your regular vaccines are generally used to fight infectious diseases. Through this we can prevent lifestyle diseases using neuroscience.” Even the fight against Coronavirus, he says, is a question of inducing positive behaviours such as practising good hygiene and washing hands regularly.

Bhargav has worked with university partners Carnegie Mellon, Johns Hopkins and Stanford to publish research, and conducts randomised trials on the link between neuropsychology and resulting food behavior-habit formation in children. For the engineering graduate, the journey into children’s health has been extremely personal.

“I started this company in 2011. This project became an obsession after becoming a parent in 2009 and realising how much advertising influences children’s habits and preferences,” he says. Formerly in tech, and then working in a hedge fund, he left a career in finance for this company.

The Research and Development centre for this app is here in the city in Taramani, and he is now bringing his technology to Indian schools.

“Once a school commits to becoming a health partner, it gets access to our content (the game) at a discounted price. The game is grade specific, it is equivalent to getting class-appropriate textbooks,” he says.

388,2020/03/18,MP demands 25 % quota for local students in Pondicherry University,"Member of Parliament V. Vaithilingam said students in the Union Territory were dependent on the university

Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha) V. Vaithilingam has requested the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development to extend 25% reservation to local students for all courses in Pondicherry University.

Raising the issue during zero hour on Tuesday, the Minister said that when the University was established in 1985, the institute offered 25 % reservation in 8 courses. Subsequently, the quota was extended to 21 courses.

Currently the University has 15 schools, 51 departments and 158 post graduation and research programmes. Since 2013, students are not getting reservation in new courses. Local students have to compete in the all-India quota for admission, he said.

Stressing the need for reservation in all courses, Mr Vaithilingam said students in the UT was dependent on the lone University for all courses.

389,2020/03/18,COVID-19: Tourism in Puducherry takes a hit,"The industry is facing a huge fall in revenue due to mass cancellations of bookings by tourists and travel agents, experts said

With a surge in the number of cases of COVID-19 in India, the immediate impact has been on the tourism sector, the Union Territory’s main growth engine as occupancy at hotels and resorts has dropped drastically over the last two weeks. Most of the hotels in the city have a meagre 5 to 10% occupancy as against 90% in February.

According to Prosper Anand, treasurer, Pondicherry Hotel Owners Association, “The hospitality industry is bleeding in Puducherry. People are not coming to restaurants in the wake of the COVID-19 scare. The arrival of domestic tourists and foreigners especially, has taken a hit. Though we are not denying rooms to foreigners, the footfalls have been very low. While liquor outlets have been closed in neighbouring Tamil Nadu till April 1, there is no clarity as far as Puducherry is concerned.”

The industry faces a big fall in revenue due to mass cancellation of bookings by tourists and travel agents. A few online travel aggregators have also written to hotels asking them to offer full refunds for travellers even if cancellations are made only one day before the reservations.

And it’s not only the foreign tourists who are cancelling their bookings. “A large number of domestic tourists from Karnataka and other States have also cancelled their bookings. Business has been very dull and is expected to go down further. We don’t know where the money is going to come from to meet salaries of staff, loans and other requirements,” Mr. Anand said.

According to a hotelier, “Business is generally dull during March. Initially, the cancellation rate was slow, but it picked up after the first week and we have zero occupancy now. Representatives from the hotel industry will meet Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy seeking some exemptions for the sector to tide over the current crisis,” he said.

The virus scare has also impacted allied industries including housekeeping and the food industry in Puducherry.

According to G. Kumar, proprietor of N.K. Foods and Beverages, a major player in the frozen food segment, “The supply of frozen food (vegetarian and non-vegetarian) has dropped by over 70 % since the last weekend. The demand for frozen foods in restaurants doubles during the weekends when compared with other days.

The body of a polytechnic student who went missing after he left his house on March 4, was exhumed from a secluded place near the Uppanar backwaters on Tuesday. The police have arrested two of his friends in connection with the murder and launched a search for five others.

The arrested have been identified as K. Vijay, 21, and Prabha alias Prabhakaran, 27, of Karaikadu in Cuddalore.

According to the police, Jaiwin Joseph, 18, a polytechnic college student hailing from Sivanandhapuram in Cuddalore, went missing after he had gone to meet his friends on March 4. When he failed to return home at night, his mother Pratheepa lodged a complaint with the Cuddalore New Town police.

Call records

The police examined the call records of Jeswin and picked up two of his friends for interrogation.

Preliminary investigations by the police revealed that Vijay and Prabhakaran and another group from Neyveli had an altercation with each other following a dispute over relationship with a girl.

Jeswin had circulated a video on the mobile application TikTok.

Vijay and Prabhakaran planned to eliminate Jeswin and called him over phone to the Uppanar backwaters. The trio consumed liquor and then the two of them murdered Jeswin by slitting his throat. They buried the body in a secluded place near the backwaters and fled.

The body was exhumed and sent for post-mortem to the Cuddalore Government General Hospital.

The fourth-semester examination was on when he arrived at the college. He waited until the examination was over and met students individually as they exited the hall.

Vigilance

Mr. Khan inquired how they performed and reminded them that society could combat COVID-19 outbreak only by vigilance and not panic or alarm. He asked the students not to allow fear of the infection upset their academic schedule.

Later, Mr. Khan told newspersons that anxious calls from parents on Monday night had prompted him to make an impromptu call at the examination centre.

Several had demanded that the Governor, as Chancellor, cancel the examination, given the virus threat. However, the college and university authorities assured him that they had taken due precaution.

The invigilators had laid out the desk and benches in the examination hall with sufficient space in between. They had also provided hand sanitisers.

Message

Mr. Khan said he wanted to send a message to the student community that it was safe to write examinations with due caution. He hoped his appearance at the college served the purpose.

394,2020/03/18,"After SCTIMST visit, Minister opts for quarantine","‘V. Muraleedharan didn’t come into contact with any suspected cases’

The Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST), where patient care activities have been reduced to only high priority and emergency surgeries for the next two weeks after several senior doctors and paramedical staff went on self-quarantine following COVID-19 exposure, was put on the defensive again on Tuesday with Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Parliamentary Affairs V. Muraleedharan opting for self-quarantine.

The institution had come to the verge of a shutdown after 76 hospital employees, including 43 doctors, had to go into self-quarantine after they were inadvertently exposed to COVID-19 from a doctor colleague who had tested positive for the disease.

Mr. Muraleedharan, who had attended a meeting at SCTIMST on March 14, decided to go into quarantine on his own volition on Tuesday. His office reportedly sought a clarification from the SCTIMST as to why he had not been informed about the developments at the institute.

The SCTIMST, in a clarification, said that the said doctor who had tested positive, had been on home quarantine since March 12.

It said that Mr. Muraleedharan had not visited the hospital wing and that none of the officials who participated in the meeting, including the Director, had any contact with the said doctors in recent times. The Deputy Director, who had been abroad, had completed his quarantine period by the time the Union Minister visited the SCTIMST, it said.

Contact tracing

On Tuesday, the district administration drew up a list of 124 persons, including 27 persons who had travelled on the same flight with the said doctor from Doha to Thiruvananthapuram on March 2, who are considered “high risk.” Efforts were on to prepare a route map and trace all persons the doctor might have come into contact with.

The SCTIMST said all elective procedures and patient admissions had been stopped till the mandatory quarantine period was over.

It has introduced stringent measures for crowd control.

The infection control cell in the hospital wing sanitised the entire building on Monday and Tuesday.

A helpline has been set up at the SCTIMST to give information regarding COVID-19 to patients, employees and students. Awareness classes on COVID-19 were conducted for all employees and all instructions on the hygiene and social distancing guidelines required to reduce virus transmission were disseminated.

The official statement said that the affected doctor was earlier exempted from home quarantine requirement as his travel history or clinical status did not warrant it. Travel advisory issued by the Centre had included Spain in the list of nations to be looked out for only on March 11. Since March 12 the doctor had been on home quarantine, it said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/6kcy9j/article31098931.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THPTISREECHITHRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/sctimst/article31094104.ece
395,2020/03/18,Cautious optimism among residents,"Decks cleared to acquire land for service lane along 14.5 km-long stretch of Tiruchi-Thanjavur Highway

Cautious optimism prevails among residents over Collector S.Sivarasu’s announcement that work on acquiring land for laying service lanes along the 14.5 km-long stretch of Tiruchi-Thanjavur Highway would begin soon.

On Tuesday, Mr.Sivarasu issued a press release to say that land acquirement would “begin soon consequent to the issue of a government order on March 16 by the Highways Department.”

As it comes after a recent protest staged by the Federation for Retrieval of Tiruchi-Palpannai-Thuvakudi Service Roads, an organisation of residents’ associations fighting for the cause of laying service lanes along the city stretch of the Thanjavur Highway, the statement has come as some relief to the residents.

The issue has been agitating the minds of residents ever since the Tiruchi-Thanjavur section of National Highway 67 was widened into a four-lane by the National Highways Authority of India in 2009-10. The federation had recently called for a series of agitations as despite a High Court order, work on acquiring land for the project did not commence. Four months have gone by since the court order was issued and there was lack of progress in land acquisition, the federation complained.

The court had accepted the opinion of the Chief Engineer, Construction and Maintenance, State Highways Department, that the width of service lanes can be 45 metres on normal stretches, 60 metres at five locations where vehicular underpass or foot overbridges are to be constructed and 50 metres on 10 other locations where bus bays are to be built. Pointing to a court observation expressing hope that the project would be completed within six months, the federation said the authorities took more than three months even to appoint a new Special District Revenue Officer (Land Acquisition) for the project.

According to S.Subramaniyan, one of the organisers of the federation, officials had told him that the G.O. provides for appointment of 11 staff members to the office of the Special DRO (Land Acquisition). Given the past experience of delays and dithering despite several assurances, the federation is not ready to rejoice. “We welcome the G.O. to the extent that it provides for required manpower to carry out the land acquisition process. We hope the authorities will follow up on it and issue the 3D notification for land acquisition expeditiously,” he said.

“We are anxiously awaiting the completion of the land acquisition. Only upon the issue of 3D notification, there will be some relief,” observed S.Sakthivel, another organiser of the federation.

After organising a protest near the Collector’s Office on March 9, the federation had announced that it would intensify its struggle if the land acquisition process did not begin within 15 days. As of now, the federation prefers to wait and watch and keep their options of continuing their agitation open if the process slackened again.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/cautious-optimism-among-residents/article31101602.ece

Members of the Tamil Nadu Towheed Jamath staged a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act, the National Population Register and the National Registry of Citizens here on Wednesday.

Over 5000 people including members from other Islamic organisations, women and children gathered on Pudukottai Road near the Central Prison here to demand withdrawal of CAA, NPR and NRC. The road was cordoned off for all vehicles which were diverted along Race Course Road through K.K. Nagar.

K. Gulam Thasthakeer, district president, said the State government should pass a resolution in the Assembly against the CAA, NPR and NRC like Rajasthan, Kerala and other state governments. There are illiterate people in several parts of the State who will not be in a position to show any document during census. They could be thrown into detention camps.

Tight security arrangements were made. The protesters were not arrested as they dispersed quietly. Protests were held across 36 places in the State, according to TNTJ office-bearers.

Thanjavur

Similar demonstrations were held at Kumbakonam and Pattukottai in Thanjavur district. Some people assembled at Bakthapuri Street at Kumbakonam and near Head Post Office at Pattukottai where they raised slogans in support of their demands. The police asked them to leave after staging a demonstration.

A similar demonstration was held on South Street in Tiruvarur. A section of people assembled near Revenue Divisional Office on South Street in Tiruvarur and urged the Centre and State governments to look into their demand.

Many members of the TNTJ staged a demonstration at Chinnappa Park in Pudukottai.

Hundreds of men, women and children staged a protest in front of district jail in Nagapattinam. They felt that Muslims would become refugees and assailed the State government for supporting the passage of CAA in Parliament.

397,2020/03/18,‘Extend time to file IT and GST returns’,"Claiming that business has been hit very hard due to the impact of steps taken by the governments to contain COVID-19, Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangankalin Peramaippu has urged the Centre and State governments to extend the deadline to file Income Tax and Goods and Sales Tax (GST) returns.

Its president A.M. Vikkiramaraja told reporters here on Wednesday that many large and small scale trade and business establishments across the State had downed shutters on the instructions of the State government to contain the spread of COVID-19.

Business had plummeted in almost all parts of the State including Chennai as large sections of people preferred to remain indoors. Most of the traders were feeling the heat and sustaining revenue loss, he said.

While welcoming the preventive measures, he said the situation could worsen in the days to come following a series of preventive measures taken by the governments. Shopping malls, cinema halls, tourist and picnic places and temples had been kept out of bounds of the public. It would have a severe bearing on the business and revenue of traders.

In some places, officials were forcing even small businesses to close. The government should come out with a clear order on this aspect, he demanded.

He said it was important for the Centre to extend the deadline for filing income tax returns. It should avoid levying penalty for the defaulters. Apart from avoiding penalty proceedings for defaulters, the Centre should extend the last date for filing GST returns. Additional time should be given for traders to go on appeals.

He said the Centre should impress upon nationalised and private banks to defer collection of instalments on loan availed by traders and businessmen. Water tax and electricity charges should be collected at minimum levels for the next six months, he demanded.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/extend-time-to-file-it-and-gst-returns/article31101276.ece
398,2020/03/18,HAPP coming up with new project,"The Heavy Alloy Penetrator Project (HAPP), a defence establishment here, is poised to start a new FSAPDS (Fin Stabilised Armour Piercing Discarding Sabot) ammunition hardware project code-named ‘mango.’

The infrastructure for the new project is being created on the premises of HAPP that has so far manufactured ammunition hardware 120mm FSAPDS for Arjun tank among other products. Currently, the 125mm FSAPDS meant for firing with Depth of Penetration of 515 to 550 mm through T-72A and T-90S Bhishma tank barrels is undergoing trials. The product was developed through in-house Research and Development activities, Yadvendra Somra, General Manager, HAPP, told media persons on the sidelines of the photo exhibition conducted on Wednesday as part of Ordnance Factories' Day celebration.

As for the FSAPDS ‘mango’ project, the new ammunition hardware with additional lethal features will be manufactured from the next financial year, Mr. Somra said.

A new indent has been placed by the Indian Navy for manufacture of 800 units of RGB (Rocket Guided Bomb) 60 anti-submarine rockets per year. The RGB 60 with extended range was also developed in-house in collaboration with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) laboratory at Pune. The production will commence in four months, Mr. Somra said.

The exhibition, organised as a low-key affair in view of the COVID 19 scare, was designed to encourage students to pursue career in armed forces, Additional General Manager S.A.N. Murthy said. The exhibition served as an opportunity for people in the surroundings to know about the products manufactured in the establishment, Mr. Murthy said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/happ-coming-up-with-new-project/article31101187.ece
399,2020/03/18,Timely start of Plus Two valuation work ‘uncertain’,"School teachers handling higher secondary classes have their fingers crossed as they are staring at uncertainty of valuation work starting any time soon. Plus Two examinations are coming to an end on March 24 and valuation was earlier planned for commencement from the start of April.

However, the COVID 19 scare could put the start of the valuation work in jeopardy, according to a section of teachers. Last year, the Plus Two results could be published on April 19. This time around, a delay would be inevitable, the teachers say.

Since there is no scope for ‘work from home’ arrangement for valuation duty, teachers fear about the adequacy of hygiene aspects at the valuation centres.

There is no official information as yet on the date of start of valuation work, a senior official of school education department said.

Till two years back, the valuation work for language papers, for which the examination would be conducted first, used to take place alongside conduct of examination for other papers.

Since the manpower shortage was felt for conduct of other examinations, the practice was dispensed with from last year and the system of starting valuation work after completion of all papers was put in place. Also, since two examinations have been merged into a single paper for language, the time taken for valuation of the paper has come down obviating the need for the department to initiate valuation work for language papers early on.

Though students have been asked to remain at home till March 31, teachers continue to attend schools to carry out academic and non-academic work, and make preparations for the next year.

“The teachers have been sensitised to their responsibilities for maintaining the precautions,” Chief Educational Officer S. Shanthi said.

The students who spend time at home have been motivated to spread awareness about prevention of COVID 19 in their neighbourhood. They have been particularly instructed not to go on visits elsewhere for the duration of holidays, the CEO said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/timely-start-of-plus-two-valuation-work-uncertain/article31101037.ece
400,2020/03/18,"Taxi services hit, food delivery increases","Taxi services, including online aggregators across the city, have been hit due to the COVID-19 scare but food delivery persons report an increase in business.

Business for cabs has slowly declined over the last week following the coronavirus outbreak and the State government’s advisory requesting individuals to avoid non-essential travel, say taxi drivers.

Taxis are in demand for a wide variety of reasons in Tiruchi but most of them involve tourists, says a cab driver.

‘The number of locals taking cabs to a temple or to a shop, for example, is significantly low here when compared to bigger cities. More than half of our users are tourists. With the number of travellers falling rapidly and some companies offering work from home, we have lost many customers, he said.

Mohammed Afsal, a representative of Tiruchi Call Taxi, said there was at least 20 % of drop in their business within a week. This is an ideal time when tourists visit the city, go to Srirangam to visit Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple and other places. But, as people have been asked not to travel, we have lost many bookings. Some drivers are apprehensive about repaying autorickshaw loans if the situation persists, he said.

With closure of schools and colleges and many preferring work-from-home option, orders for food delivery have increased. ‘I deliver about eight to 10 orders around lunch time on a normal day. The number of orders has increased with young people especially college students ordering regularly. Online food delivery applications too offer discounts,’ R. Sampath, a delivery person, said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/h49lh2/article31105237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY19PARK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/taxi-services-hit-food-delivery-increases/article31100837.ece
401,2020/03/18,Screening and awareness camps set up at eight entry points in delta districts,"Staff check body temperature of passengers travelling in public transport vehicles or in own vehicles

The Health Department has opened COVID-19 screening and awareness camps at eight important entry points to the district from Tiruchi, Ariyalur, Cuddalore, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and Pudukottai districts.

Staff posted at these camps have been provided with ‘fever guns’ to check body temperature of passengers travelling in public transport vehicles and in own vehicles. Drivers and others travelling in goods carriers were also subjected to the test. If any person was found to have a temperature over and above 38.5 degree Celsius, they were asked to provide their personal and journey details which were recorded. If they declare that they were suffering from cough and mild irritation in throat they were asked to provide treatment and place of treatment particulars.

On the first day of this camp on Thanjavur-Tiruchi Highway at Pudupatti on Wednesday, details of a person from Dindigul who was proceeding to Thanjavur to call on his relatives’ family was collected as his body temperature was over 40 degree Celsius.

Private, tourist and goods carriers with registration numbers other than Thanjavur and Tiruchi districts were subjected to a thorough check at the Pudupatti camp. Police and Regional Transport Office staff were roped in to assist the Health Department staff in carrying out this exercise aimed at checking transmission of COVID-19 virus from visitors as already 122 persons in Thanjavur district and those passing through Thanjavur district were suspected to have contracted the virus, according to official sources.

After supervising the activities at the camp, Collector M.Govinda Rao enquired with the staff whether any fresh case was reported. A 20-year-old male from a nearby village, who had returned to his hamlet from Bengaluru, where he had been employed, approached the camp stating that he was suffering from cough and throat irritation for the past few days. When the staff inquired whether he had taken any treatment for the ailment, he said he had approached the Primary Health Care centre near his village. After collecting his personal details and contact number, the camp staff advised him to take medicines provided to him at the PHC.

Later, Mr.Govinda Rao said the virus infection was not reported in Thanjavur district. However, passengers travelling by road and long-distance commuters alighting from trains in railway junctions or stations in Thanjavur district were being screened.

Tiruvarur

A COVID-19 virus testing centre has been set up at Government Medical College Hospital, Tiruvarur, according to the Collector T.Anand.

Disclosing this to reporters at Viswanathapuram village panchayat in Koradacherry Block on Wednesday, he said persons of this region who have returned from foreign countries were subjected to screening at the GMC hospital. Even if they tested negative, they were brought under surveillance for the next 14 days.

Mr.Anand said the HR and CE Department officials have been directed to ensure that festivals and other events in temples were conducted in such a manner that congregation of devotees in large numbers was avoided.

The district has been divided into 21 zones and officials in the grade of Deputy Collector have been posted to conduct field-level inspections on daily basis and submit reports with respect to the implementation of COVID-19 virus prevention exercise.

404,2020/03/18,Coronavirus | African Nations Championship postponed,"The tournament was scheduled for April 4-25 in Cameroon

Africa’s second biggest international soccer tournament was suspended Tuesday because of the coronavirus pandemic as the game on the continent neared total shutdown.

The Confederation of African Football said the African Nations Championship scheduled for April 4-25 in Cameroon was postponed indefinitely. The tournament features national teams made up of players who play in their home leagues.

Africa’s top tournament, the African Cup of Nations, is due to be played early next year, also in Cameroon.

Two rounds of qualifying games for the Cup of Nations have already been postponed, as have this month’s African qualifiers for the women’s under-20 World Cup and next month’s qualifiers for the women’s African Cup of Nations.

Cameroon was still willing to host the African Nations Championship, CAF said, but the measures taken by other African governments to restrict travel made it difficult to go ahead.

Morocco and Rwanda had already withdrawn from the tournament.

CAF said the African Nations Championship would take place “as soon as conditions permit.”

405,2020/03/18,Several AP schools ignore govt. order,"Parents are worried over poor sanitation and unhygienic conditions

Even as the Centre has declared coronavirus as a ‘notified disaster’ and directed all the departments, institutions and the public to take precautionary measures to prevent the outbreak of the virus, many educational institutions are not following the directive.

Unhygienic conditions are seen in many schools and colleges and stinking smell emanates from toilets. In some institutions, there are no sufficient toilets and there is no facility to wash hands.

The School Education Department has issued a circular to all the managements to take measures to prevent the spread of the virus. Commissioner of School Education V. China Veerabhadrudu has directed the managements of institutions to create awareness among students on prevention of coronavirus and other communicable diseases.

“There are no boards and wall posters to alert students on the steps to be taken to avoid coronavirus in schools and colleges. Managements are running classes in congested rooms for nursery and primary classes violating the advice of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on the dreaded virus,” said Andhra Pradesh Higher Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission (APHER&MC) member V. Narayana Reddy, who inspected a few schools.

“While the entire world is worried over the pandemic spread over 150 countries, including India, educational institutions are least bothered over the measures to contain the virus in AP. The managements are running classes just to collect fee,” says a parent, B. Veerendra.

Mr. Veerabhadrudu has instructed the institutions to follow the guidelines issued by the government such as frequent hand wash, advice to students on use of handkerchief while sneezing or coughing and cover the mouth with a mask or handkerchief and maintain some distance from others while speaking.

The circular has been forwarded through the Regional Joint Directors (RJDs), District Educational Officers (DEOs), Deputy DEOs, Mandal Educational Officers (MEOs) and other officials concerned to all the government and private schools, the School Education Department personnel have told The Hindu.

About 66,000 schools, including 45,723 government schools, are functioning in Andhra Pradesh, and over 50 lakh students are studying in both government and private schools.

“Though there is a scare of COVID-19 across the globe and being aired for over a month through media, the managements of educational institutions are so negligent over the virus. There is no training and awareness for teachers and students and there is a chance of spreading the virus for children,” says a child rights activist.

Students’ complaint

Students of a corporate school allege that toilets and dining halls were not cleaned for the last two days. They have appealed to the education officials to conduct surprise checks and ensure that the guidelines of the governments are implemented strictly in all schools to prevent the outbreak of the virus.

“Many parents are enquiring about declaration of holidays due to coronavirus scare. From March 16, half day schools began, but many parents are not sending their wards to schools. Owing to lack of awareness, students are attending classes without wearing masks,” says a private school teacher. The APHER&MC member has appealed to the government to act against school managements which violate guidelines of the government.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/ogwhc8/article31097215.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18-VJ-SUMMER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/several-schools-ignore-govt-order/article31097216.ece

The ‘Sahasranamarchana’ was suspended for the time being. During the ‘Mahanivedana’, devotees purchasing ₹100 ticket will be stopped at ‘Dhwaja stambham’ and those coming for free darshan at old Uttaradwaram. For VIP devotees, instead of ‘antaralaya puja,’ darshan will be arranged.

Executive Officer M. Venkateswara Rao instructed the staff to wear masks and sanitise the dining hall, queue lines and tonsuring hall at regular intervals.

The devastham appealed to devotees in general and children below 12 years and those above 60 years to postpone their offerings (mokku). Devotees may watch any important festival or celebration live rather than directly viewing.

410,2020/03/18,Jaaved Jaaferi: He’s different,"Versatile actor-dancer Jaaved Jaaferi gets candid about his different creative interests and why he sees humour even in dark times

Jaaved Jaaferi walks in with his trademark swagger and greets us with folded hands and says ‘namaste’ as we catch up with him at the coffee shop in Radison Blu, Banjara Hills. “I was in Hyderabad a few months back at Ramoji Film City shooting for Sooryavanshi; It was a long schedule.Idhar ke log bahut maze ke hote hain; The best humour is found in Hyderabad followed by Bhopal. I have always felt there is an undercurrent of pathos to their comedy. People hide their pain and poverty through humour,” observes Jaaved.

Dwelling on this ability to laugh even during the dark times, he comments on the current scenario. “Although negative things are happening around the world, I speak for my country when things have become one-sided. I don’t like that a lot of hate has grown because of that. This kind of feeling was prevalent in some people after partition; It has come up now and is not the India I grew up in.”

A section of the audience | Photo Credit: G_RAMAKRISHNA

He shares that he grew up in Bandra andhis best friends were a Sikh, Christian and Sindhi. His father, renowned comedian Jagdeep used to live in Datia in Madhya Pradesh while his two brothers lived in Karachi. During partition, he witnessed massacres and started his life on a footpath in Mumbai. “He never spoke about the painful past instead told us stories of what he got from the wonderful people like Bimal Roy, Guru Dutt, Mehboob Khan, Shantaram and K Asif. He gave us this attitude and we pass it to our children.”

Creative stints

Jaaved has worn different hats with his creative stints for 35 years. An actor, dancer, anchor, reality show judge, singer, dubbing artist and even a director. He did his first commercial in 1980 for a t-shirt-brand with ad filmmaker Prahlad Kakkar. This year, the duo celebrate 40 years of friendship with their latest campaign #BimaHaiZaroori. The friends have done 200 ad films including their best ‘It’s different’ for Maggie hot chilli sauce. In fact, Javed has endorsed the brand for 30 years with Pankaj Kapoor, Manoj Pahwa and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. Calling Prahlad Kakkar, a mad genius, he says, “We got this great working relationship and he became a friend after my first ad. We did many shows together and now Prahlad is focussing more on his diving school in Andamans; Since I am also an advanced scuba diver, I sometimes go there.”

Jaaved entered showbiz during the final year in college when he got a call to act in Subhash Ghai’s Meri Jung. Since then it has been a roller coaster ride. “I love entertaining, (It was genetic), dancing and worked on it on my own.” The versatile actor is also known for bringing India’s first dance reality show Boogie Woogie with his brother Naved and Ravi Bahl. Considering himself lucky to have done the show, he says the show kept the child in him alive. “It was one-of-its kind-show in India and came from our heart. Our love for dance, children and creativity brought us all together. Even in the worst of situations, these budding dancers were smiling and enjoying the moment.”

Sharing the story behind his love for Urdu, he says he would not study the language as a child as he went to a convent school but picked it up later as he started reading the Koran, (“The Arabic alphabet are similar and much harder to pronounce.) “My parents and grandmother spoke Urdu very well and we used to speak Hindustani (a mix of Urdu and Hindi where the ratio of Urdu is higher). Words often used are in Urdu such as Pyaar, Duniya, Zamaana and Mohabbat.”

Jaaved dabbled in politics too for a brief stint. “It was a knee jerk reaction. I didn’t want to be a politician but I liked what they (AAP) were standing for. We put our own money behind the campaign. I was not thick-skinned so opted out of it.” He is vocal on social media on issues that disturb him. “I do talk on things which pain me. You tend to get apprehensive seeing the hatred that’s there within the system. We have to fight it and take drastic measures to flush it out of the system.”

Besides Sooryavanshi and Coolie no.1, he looks forward to Karan Johar’s Takht where he plays a prominent role and Maska on Netflix. Also coming up is a untitled movie on four 50+plus friends featuring him, Sanjay Dutt, Madhavan and Sunil Shetty and their bonding.Finally, he recites a sher — ‘Kya hai aapke jawaani ka raaz?

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the apex body for bio-medical research, has said that India will not participate in the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) clinical trials for coronavirus (COVID-19) as of now because the country has a very small sample size.

State Helpline numbers for COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

“There is no forward movement on this as we cannot contribute favourably. The numbers that we can offer WHO is extremely limited as India is still witnessing local transmission. Of course, there is nothing stopping us from joining the trial later on, if the country does witness a rise in COVID-19 numbers,” said Dr. R. Gangakhedkar, head, Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases-I (ECD-I).

He added, “The countries participating currently — in the five-arm clinical trial looking at drugs, treatment approach, vaccine etc., — have a larger scope than India. We can always enrol later.”

According to the WHO, so far, no vaccine against COVID-19 has completed clinical trials, and a vaccine is not likely to be available over the next 18 months.

Meanwhile, the Department of Pharmaceuticals has issued a “warning” to manufacturers and importers of surgical and protective masks, and gloves and hand sanitisers, directing them to immediately furnish information on stocks of personal protection equipment.

“Non-compliance of the order would attract penal provision of the DPCO [Drugs (Prices Control) Order], 2013 and the Essential Commodities Act, 1995 which may lead to search and seizure and even prosecution for defaulting companies. All manufactures/importers are hereby directed to submit the requisite details in prescribed format failing which National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) would be constrained to take appropriate action,” the direction noted.

Prevent hoarding

The Central government had declared face masks and hand sanitisers as essential commodities for the next 100 days as it stepped up efforts to boost supply and prevent hoarding of these items in its fight to check the spread of the coronavirus. The Centre has also invoked the Disaster Management Act to ensure price regulation and availability of surgical and protective masks, hand sanitisers and gloves.

“The decision is aimed to empower the government and States and Union Territories to regulate production, quality and distribution of masks and hand sanitisers for their smooth sale and availability. It also empowers to carry out operations against speculators and those involved in over-pricing and black-marketing,” the government had noted.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/9o9tqd/article31100277.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18IN-VIRUS2,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/india-does-not-have-the-numbers-to-participate-in-who-clinical-trial-says-icmr/article31099703.ece
412,2020/03/18,Coronavirus | Union Health Ministry recommends anti-HIV drugs,"This combination of drugs was given for the first time to an elderly Italian couple currently undergoing treatment for COVID-19 at the SMS hospital in Jaipur.

The Union Health Ministry has recommended use of anti-HIV drug combinations Lopinavir and Ritonavir on a case-to-case basis depending upon the severity of the condition of a person having coronavirus infection.

In its revised guidelines on the ‘Clinical Management of COVID-19’ issued on Tuesday, the Ministry recommended Lopinavir-Ritonavir for high-risk groups patients aged above 60, suffering from diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease and are immuno-compromised.

According to a Health Ministry official, a committee of experts comprising doctors from AIIMS, experts from National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and WHO among others revisited the treatment guidelines and recommended supportive treatment in patients suffering from coronavirus infection.

The Ministry also recommended Lopinavir-Ritonavir for symptomatic patients having hypoxia, hypotension, new onset organ dysfunction (one or more), increase in creatinine by 50% from baseline and any other organ dysfunction among others.

There is no current evidence from randomised controlled trial to recommend any specific treatment for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. No specific anti-virals are recommended for treatment of those suffering from respiratory ailment due to lack of adequate evidence from medical literature.

“The use of Lopinavir-Ritonavir in PEP regimens for HIV (4 weeks) is also associated with significant adverse events which many a times leads to discontinuation of therapy.

“In light of the above, Lopinavir-Ritonavir should only be used with proper informed expressed consent on a case to case basis for severe cases, within the mentioned framework along with supportive treatment as per need,” the guidelines stated.

This combination of drugs was given for the first time to an elderly Italian couple currently undergoing treatment for COVID-19 at the SMS hospital in Jaipur.

Lopinavir-Ritonavir is used widely for controlling HIV infection.

The guidelines issued by the Health Ministry also state that COVID-19 patients may present with mild, moderate, or severe illness — the latter includes severe pneumonia, ARDS, sepsis and septic shock.

Early recognition of suspected patients allows for timely initiation of infection, prevention and control.

“Early identification of those with severe manifestations allows for immediate optimised supportive care treatments and safe, rapid admission (or referral) to intensive care unit according to national protocols.

“For those with mild illness, hospitalisation may not be required unless there is concern for rapid deterioration. All patients discharged for home should be instructed to return to hospital if they develop any worsening of illness,” the guidelines stated.

The guidelines advise the treating doctors to closely monitor patients with severe acute respiratory infection for signs of clinical deterioration, such as rapidly progressive respiratory failure and sepsis, and apply supportive care interventions immediately.

“Application of timely, effective, and safe supportive therapies is the cornerstone of therapy for patients that develop severe manifestations of COVID-19,” it said.

“Understand the patient’s co-morbid condition to tailor the management of critical illness and appreciate the prognosis. During intensive care management of severe acute respiratory infection, determine which chronic therapies should be continued and which therapies should be stopped temporarily.

“Communicate pro-actively with patients and families and provide support and prognostic information. Understand the patient’s values and preferences regarding life-sustaining interventions,” the guidelines stated.
