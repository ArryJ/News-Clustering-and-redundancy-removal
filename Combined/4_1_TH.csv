0,2020/04/01,"Staying on top of things, the Gopi way","Teams up with fitness expert Vervatwala to keep trainees of his academy in shape

P. Gopi Chand, India’s chief National coach, has worked hard to contribute to the badminton world.

Even as most of the athletes are struggling to find ways to stay fit during the current lockdown, Gopi is on top of his game, using the Zoom App to ensure that the majority of trainees of the Gopi Academy are linked to and participate in the live, video fitness sessions.

“We have to think of ways to stay fit, which is a pre-requisite to being back on the badminton court. So, I thought the best way is to ensure that most of trainees have some physical conditioning to be game-fit once the lockdown is lifted,” Gopi said in an exclusive chat with The Hindu on Wednesday.

“These sessions are conducted twice a day via the Zoom app, which facilitates [fitness expert] Dinaz Vervatwala to demonstrate and monitor how the players are doing the exercises.

“It is a mix of traditional and scientific methods — the exercises include breathing, meditation, 15 minutes of skipping, [variations of the] Surya Namaskar, and alternate toe-touches. Besides this, I am also keen to see them stay in touch with the sport by opting for shadow and wall practice,” he said.

Virtual sessions

These innovative ‘circuit work-out’ sessions online are not just confined to those in and around Hyderabad, but also to those who have left the Academy to be at their respective homes in Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata.

While Vervatwala regularly appeals to the players to be honest to themselves in doing the exercises, Gopi focuses on the shadow practice of smashes or returns — of five sets each for 40 seconds each, followed by 20-30 seconds of rest, and a second set with emphasis on parallel strokes.

Will there be a critical review? “I will definitely check the fitness levels of most of them once they are back in the Academy and take remedial measures, if necessary,” said Gopi.

Many like B. Sai Praneeth welcome this. “It is wonderful to have these sessions, as something is always better than doing nothing,” he said.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/q581y7/article31230304.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02GOPI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/staying-on-top-of-things-the-gopi-way/article31230305.ece
1,2020/04/01,I am confident of the car: Daruvala,"Red Bull junior driver hopes to be ready when season begins

India’s Jehan Daruvala took a decisive step in his career progression to Formula One after signing as a Red Bull junior driver ahead of his F2 debut this year.

Red Bull, which has two teams in F1 — Red Bull Racing and Alpha Tauri — has one of the best junior programmes in F1 with the likes of Sebastian Vettel, Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen coming through it.

Ahead of the season, Daruvala drove the F2 car in the pre-season testing held at Bahrain early in March, and topped the timesheets in two of the six sessions — the only driver to do so multiple times.

Family time

However, with the season in limbo, the Indian is back home in Mumbai, spending some quality time with his family; something he doesn’t get to do often, as he has been based out of the UK since his karting days.

Speaking to The Hindu about his impressive testing performance, Daruvala said, “It was my first time in the F2 car and I felt good. I was coming back from knee surgery, and so the first day was about trying to get back into the groove.

“I adapted well to the car and felt quite comfortable rightaway.

“While it is difficult to know where we stand based on just one-lap pace, we were quite fast on the long runs. I am quietly confident that we have a good car,” added Daruvala.

Despite the break, he is leaving no stone unturned to be in shape and is ready if and when the season starts.

“I am just going to train as I usually do. I also have a new simulator that I have set up at home, though there are some connectivity issues. I hope I can fix them once the lockdown ends.”

New simulator

The simulator is a very important tool for drivers to be fully prepared before going into a race weekend.

With the current situation not expected to ease until June or July in the continent, F2 faces a tough road ahead.

When asked if there are concerns that the season could be massively curtailed or even cancelled, he said, “It is unfortunate not to be racing and we have no idea what is going to happen.

“So, I just hope to be as prepared as possible when it starts.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/a3ypth/article31230252.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02Jeha,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/i-am-confident-of-the-car-daruvala/article31230253.ece
2,2020/04/01,It’s a ‘welcome break’ for tired Prannoy,"Says skipping All England was the right decision.

For H.S. Prannoy, the COVID-19-enforced break has been a blessing in disguise.

The 27-year-old former World No. 8 Prannoy said he was using the layoff to rest his tired body and rediscover his lost mojo.

“The month-long break is the biggest I have got in my professional career. I have never stayed at home for more than a week in the last seven years and I am enjoying every minute of it. In a way, it is a welcome break and good for me to recharge my batteries and come back refreshed for the new season,” he said.

Prannoy, who skipped the All England Open badminton championship, said it was a right decision in the prevailing circumstances and said he was worried about the slump in his ranking due to the snapping of the international schedule. [The BWF has since freezed the rankings as of March 17].

“The tournament was taking place at a time when the disease was spreading rapidly in England and I thought it was risky,” he said.

Inconsistent

Prannoy, whose form has taken a dip in the last one and a half years (from eight to 28), said he was using the break to reflect on what went wrong with his game. “I must confess that I am not anywhere as consistent now as I was two years ago. A lot of things have contributed to it. I was not happy with the way I was training, as I struggled with the methods of the new coach at the academy. I wasn’t getting any match practice and there wasn’t any time to reflect on my game as I was playing non-stop. Now that I have got a break, I can rework my game.”

Despite the break, Prannoy is following the workout plan prescribed by his trainer at the Gopi Chand Academy. “Every other day, there is a video conference with the trainer and I follow the schedule given to me,” he said.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/wuixu6/article31230229.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02PRANNOY1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/its-a-welcome-break-for-tired-prannoy/article31228635.ece
3,2020/04/01,"BWF freezes rankings, says positions as on March 17 to be basis for entry, seedings in future events","The BWF had suspended all tournaments post the All England Championships until April 12 due to coronavirus pandemic

The Badminton World Federation (BWF) on Tuesday decided to freeze the world rankings, saying standings as on March 17 will be the basis for entry and seedings when it restarts the international calender that has been thrown haywire owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.

There was a clamour for freezing the world rankings with Indian shuttlers Saina Nehwal, B. Sai Praneeth, Parupalli Kashyap and H.S. Prannoy leading the way in expressing their concerns.

“The Badminton World Federation (BWF) can announce it will freeze World Rankings and World Junior Rankings until further notice. The freezing of rankings will be backdated to Week 12, which is the week following the last international tournament that was played — the YONEX All England Open 2020,” BWF said in a release.

“The ranking lists issued on 17 March, 2020 will serve as a basis for entry and seeding into the next international tournaments — although it is difficult to say at this stage when this may be.”

Shuttlers in the singles competition have to be inside top-16 of world rankings to qualify for the Olympics. The cut-off for doubles is also top-16.

The BWF had suspended all tournaments post the All England Championships until April 12 due to the pandemic.

These tournaments include big-ticket events like India Open (Super 500), Malaysia Open (Super 750) and Singapore Open (Super 500), apart from the three Continental Confederation championships.

BWF said due to the current scenario the next set of tournaments will also be suspended.

“Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the badminton community has experienced an unprecedented suspension to international tournaments from mid-march 2020 to the end of April 2020.

“At present, it is difficult to predict when the next international tournament will take place with further tournaments also expected to be suspended in May and June.”

The world body said it will take time to decide on the process of unfreezing the world rankings as it will depend on how the international calender looks once things improve.

“BWF will provide more information in due course regarding the process as to how the rankings will eventually be ‘unfrozen’ following the commencement of the international circuit,” BWF said.

“However, it is difficult to outline the exact procedure until we have an exact overview of what the international calendar will look like once play resumes and suspended tournaments have been rescheduled.

“We are seeking to define a solution to unfreeze the rankings in a staggered way to avoid any extreme drop off of points from previous tournaments causing an extreme impact on the ranking structure.”

Many international stars, including Saina and Kashyap, had suggested that the qualification period for the Tokyo Olympics be extended in light of tournaments getting cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak.

The governing body said it will start reviewing the Olympic qualification system but a decision will take several weeks.

“Following yesterday’s announcement to reschedule the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games from July 23 to August 8 2021, BWF will now also initiate a review process to confirm any impact on the Olympic qualification system,” BWF said.

“Please note that the consequences of freezing the World Rankings will not apply to the Olympic qualification system.

“This review process is expected to take several weeks upon which BWF will make a further announcement once all circumstances have been carefully considered.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/trzm5x/article31039741.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHUTTLE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/bwf-freezes-rankings-says-positions-as-on-march-17-to-be-basis-for-entry-seedings-in-future-events/article31222457.ece

Wimbledon was canceled on Wednesday because of the coronavirus pandemic, the first time since World War II that the oldest Grand Slam tennis tournament won’t be played.

The All England Club announced after an emergency meeting that the event it refers to simply as The Championships is being scrapped for 2020. Wimbledon was scheduled to be played on the club’s grass courts on the outskirts of London from June 29 to July 12.

Instead, the next edition of the tournament will be June 28 to July 11, 2021.

The tournament was first held in 1877 and has been contested every year since, with the exception of two stretches- from 1915-18 because of World War I, and from 1940-45 because of World War II.

Retired tennis player Patrick McEnroe has recovered from a mild case of coronavirus, he announced on social media on Tuesday.

McEnroe, younger brother of seven-times Grand Slam champion John, said he had been tested after experiencing “some minor symptoms” about 10 or 11 days ago.

“My tests just came back positive,” the 53-year-old said on Twitter. “That's the bad news. The good news is I feel fine. My symptoms have passed. I feel 100%.

“I'm an example of someone that has been able to fight through it and I'm doing absolutely fine.”

McEnroe, 53, lives in the metropolitan New York City area, one of the hardest hit cities for the virus in the United States.

He reached a career high ranking of 28 before retiring in 1998, and was later a U.S. Davis Cup captain.

6,2020/04/01,"Today’s cache | Digital Payments, Zoom app and more","Today's cache is your daily download of the top 5 updates from the world of technology.

While many global businesses are scratching their heads on how to plan their operations in a post-COVID-19 world, two digital payment firms are using the crisis to build a new payment ecosystem in your car. And in another part of the world, in Africa, some tech start-ups are helping their continent tide over the coronavirus outbreak.

Closer to home, did you know that the Zoom app is sharing user data with Facebook?

IBM is giving free access to a range of IT tools to its clients to help them during the COVID-19 crisis. And finally, some tools to help you manage projects.

Digital payment firms are building in-car payment ecosystems

In-car payments is a fragmented market. It lacks a single interoperable system. Currently, different solution providers offer diverse options for making payment.

Many drivers connect their smartphones to cars using Android Auto or Apple CarPlay in the absence of built-in communication interface.

Visa and Mastercard are using this absence to build ecosystems that will link merchants and drivers to make and receive in-car payment. This is part of their Internet of Things strategy, according to a report byPaymentsSource.

The duo aims to stitch disparate systems together for car makers, payment infrastructure providers and other fintech firms to offer in-car commerce.

The digital payments firms see the COVID-19 situation nudging more people towards using private or personal vehicles.

They view this push as an opportunity to develop in-car payments technology that can allow drivers to pay for fuel or food without handling cash or coming in contact with any potentially infected area.

Mastercard is working with GM, Honda, IBM, Amazon and other merchants and tech start ups to create car commerce platforms.

""Our role is to ensure that in-car payments are safe and simple for consumers, merchants and card companies,"" Mastercard’s senior vice president for digital future, products and innovation Femi Odunuga said.

""We’re still in a nascent stage for car commerce. The technology is there, and initiatives are progressing, but adoption is tempered by the fact that you need vehicles to operate the requisite software, merchants to sell on these platforms, and consumers to transact.”

Visa, on the other hand, sees strong potential in cloud-based IoT payments and authentication via biometrics

“Visa’s approach relies on its Visa Ready tokenization platform integrating with e-wallets such as Apple Pay to tokenize connected car payments and prevent consumers’ cards from being exposed,” said Bisi Boyle, Visa’s vice president of IoT.

How is Africa’s tech ecosystem responding to COVID-19 crisis

Africa was relatively untouched by the coronavirus until early March. Now, that has changed.

“About 10 days ago we had 5 countries affected, now we’ve got 30,” WHO Regional Director Dr. Matshidiso Moeti said at a press conference on March 19. “It’s has been an extremely rapid…evolution.”

As on Tuesday, COVID-19 cases in the Sub-Saharan Africa jumped to 3671 from 463 on March 18.

To stem the spread of coronavirus, start-ups in Africa are shifting a large volume of their transaction to digital payment, Techcrunch reported. They see physical cash as a conduit for the virus to spread.

Kenya has turned to mobile-money as a public-health tool, and the country’s largest telecom provider Safaricom implemented a fee-waiver on M-Pesa, a mobile-money product to reduce physical contact in exchange of currency notes.

In Lagos, a mobile payments company Paga adjusted fees to allow merchants to accept payments from Paga’s customers for free, according to a company statement.

CcHub, Africa’s largest innovation incubator based in Lagos and Nairobi, posted an open application on its website to provide funding blocks to companies working on COVID-19 related projects. The funding range from $5,000 to $100,000.

Zindi, a Cape Town-based crowd-solving start-up, opened a challenge to its 12,000 registered engineers on its platform to create models to predict global spread of COVID-19 in the next three months.

Did you know that Zoom app is sharing your data with Facebook?

In the past few weeks, Zoom app has become a household name, and is the go-to videoconferencing platform to connect with friends and family to beat the lockdown blues.

Based on the recent analysis by Motherboard, the app’s iOS version sends some analytics data to Facebook. The videoconferencing platform does this even if the user does not have a Facebook account.

While this kind of data sharing is not uncommon for apps that use Facebook’s software development kits (SDK), Zoom has not made its users aware of this transmission mechanism.

Many apps use Facebook’s SDK to implement features into their apps easily.

When you open a Zoom app, it connects to Facebook’s Graph API, which is the main gateway for developers to get data in and out of Facebook.

Through this pathway, Facebook receives data from the user on the time they used the app, location and the device. It also gets the information on the user’s unique advertiser identifier. This is used to send targeted advertisements to the user.

Facebook requires that its developers be transparent to their users about the data their apps collects and sends to Facebook.

Zoom responded to Motherboard’s query in a statement confirming the data collection practice.

""Zoom takes its users’ privacy extremely seriously. We originally implemented the ‘Login with Facebook’ feature using the Facebook SDK in order to provide our users with another convenient way to access our platform. However, we were recently made aware that the Facebook SDK was collecting unnecessary device data,"" the statement read, and described the data being collected as the same sorts of information that Motherboard identified.

IBM offers an array of tools to support companies during COVID-19 pandemic

As many firms are forced to change the way they operate globally due to the COVID-19 outbreak, IBM is making some of its IT tools available for free to its existing customers.

“We're hearing and seeing firsthand from clients who are now grappling with the reality that most, if not all, of their workforces are conducting business from home,” Akilesh Duvvur, vice president Public Cloud said in a statement.

IBM is providing free offering to its clients across cloud-enabled AI, data, security, integration and video through its public cloud.

The nine cloud products and services available for use by IBM customers include IBM Cloud, Aspera file sharing and team collaboration, IBM Security, IBM Video Streaming and IBM Enterprise Video Streaming, IBM Sterling supply chain tools, IBM Blueworks Live remote collaboration tools, IBM Cloud Event Management, remote learning resources, and IBM Garage.

These tools are free of charge for 90 days.

“As the work environment evolves in these difficult times, we'll continue to evaluate ways we can ease the burdens our clients are facing so they can focus on driving their businesses forward,” he added.

7,2020/04/01,Trump says ready to help end Saudi-Russian oil price war,"Riyadh said it would raise exports further after talks failed

U.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday he was ready to help resolve an escalating oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia that has helped push crude benchmarks to 17-year lows.

The threat of a global recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic had already hammered prices when Riyadh said last month it would raise exports after a production-cut agreement among top producers flopped in early March.

Also read | Indian refiners hit by lockdowns, oil price war, and a faltering global petro-order

On Monday, Saudi Arabia said it would increase exports further to a record 10.6 million barrels per day from May, deepening a global supply glut as crude recorded its biggest monthly and quarterly price plunges in history.

Trump said he had spoken with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman by phone with the aim of halting the slide.

“The two countries are discussing it. And I am joining at the appropriate time, if need be,” Trump said.

Saudi Arabia had been exporting around 7.0 million barrels per day under an output reduction agreement among a 24-member producer alliance known as OPEC+, which included Russia.

OPEC+ failed to reach an agreement on further production cuts to shore up sagging prices as the coronavirus battered the global economy last month.

Editorial | Oil’s rout: on fall in prices

Analysts say Riyadh is engaged in a deliberate long-term strategy to capture greater market share by pressuring its high-cost rivals.

“Saudi policy will not just drive more expensive forms of oil production out of the market; it will also make it harder for renewable energy to compete with fossil fuels,” said Bernard Haykel, a Saudi expert at Princeton University.

The price war has also hit shale oil producers in the U.S., with Trump telling Tuesday’s press conference that the production dispute threatened “thousands and thousands” of jobs.

In a letter last week to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a group of U.S. senators accused Saudi Arabia and Russia of waging “economic warfare against the United States”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ct2x53/article31231395.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Trump,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-says-ready-to-help-end-saudi-russian-oil-price-war/article31231396.ece
8,2020/04/01,Iran warns U.S. after it deploys ‘Patriot’ to Iraq,"The U.S. deployment runs “counter to the official position of the Iraqi government, parliament and people: Iran Foreign Ministry

Iran warned the U.S. on Wednesday that it was leading the Middle East to disaster in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic after it deployed Patriot air defence missiles to Iraq.

Washington had been in talks with Baghdad about the proposed deployment since January but it was not immediately clear whether it had secured its approval or not.

Iran, which wields huge influence in its western neighbour, said that it had not.

The U.S. deployment runs “counter to the official position of the Iraqi government, parliament and people,” a foreign ministry statement said.

It called for a halt to “warmongering during the coronavirus outbreak” and warned that U.S. military activities in the region could lead it to “instability and disaster”.

Iran is in the throes of one of the world’s deadliest coronavirus outbreaks with more than 3,000 fatalities. The U.S. death toll has meanwhile surpassed Iran’s, topping 4,000.

U.S. forces should “respect the wishes of the Iraqi people and government and leave the country,” the Iranian Foreign Ministry added.

The Patriot is Washington’s principal anti-missile defense system.

Its deployment to Iraq comes after a spate of rocket and other attacks on bases and other facilities used by U.S. personnel that Washington has blamed on Tehran-backed Shiite militias or Tehran itself.

One of the Patriot batteries was delivered to the Ain al-Asad in western Iraq last week and is now being assembled, a U.S. defence official and an Iraqi military source said.

Ain al-Asad was hit by a retaliatory Iranian missile strike in January after Washington killed Tehran’s foreign operations chief Major General Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike just outside Baghdad airport.

A second battery was deployed to a base in Arbil, capital of Iraq’s autonomous Kurdish region.

Two more are still in Kuwait, where Washington has rear bases for its operations in Iraq, the U.S. official said.

Iraqi leaders have resisted U.S. deployment of the advanced weapons system for fear that it would anger Iran and further ratchet up tensions between its main allies.

On Monday, Iraq’s caretaker Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi warned against any “offensive military action without the approval of the Iraqi government.” He did not specifically mention the Patriot deployment.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/83pni4/article31231192.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PATRIOTFILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iran-warns-us-after-it-deploys-patriot-to-iraq/article31231193.ece
9,2020/04/01,Coronavirus | Brazil confirms first case among indigenous people in the Amazon,"Health experts warn that the spreading virus could be lethal for Brazil’s 850,000 indigenous people, who have been decimated for centuries by diseases brought by Europeans, from smallpox and malaria to the flu.

An indigenous woman in a village deep in the Amazon rainforest has contracted the novel coronavirus, the first case reported among Brazil’s more than 300 tribes, the Health Ministry’s indigenous health service Sesait said on Wednesday.

The 19-year-old woman from the Kokama tribe tested positive for the virus in the district of Santo Antonio do Iśŕ, located near the border with Colombia some 880 km (550 miles) up the Amazon river from the State capital Manaus. “Unfortunately, we have an indigenous person with the virus,” said a Sesait spokeswoman by telephone.

The patient, whose name was not made public, is a medical worker who had travelled upriver to several villages, including the town of Tabatinga, and returned home with fever, a sore throat and chest pains, the O Globo newspaper reported.

Four cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the same district, including a Brazilian doctor who tested positive last week, raising fears that the epidemic could spread to remote and vulnerable indigenous communities with devastating effect.

The doctor, whose name was not made public, had returned from vacation in southern Brazil to work with the Tikunas, one of the largest tribes in the Amazon with more than 30,000 people who live in the upper Amazon near the borders with Colombia and Peru.

Health experts warn that the spreading virus could be lethal for Brazil’s 850,000 indigenous people, who have been decimated for centuries by diseases brought by Europeans, from smallpox and malaria to the flu.

Health experts say the indigenous peoples’ way of life in communal hamlets under large thatched structures increases the risk of contagion if any single member contracts the virus, which causes the sometimes fatal respiratory disease COVID-19.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/177bsi/article31231183.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16YTFORESTAMAZON1jpg-APR01,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-brazil-confirms-first-case-among-indigenous-people-in-the-amazon/article31230427.ece
10,2020/04/01,Italy urgently seeks safe exit from punishing lockdown,"Nearly 12,500 people have died of the virus so far according to official data

Italy’s coronavirus epidemic may be slowing, but critics warn the government is falling seriously behind on strategies to lift the punishing nationwide lockdown and reboot the economy.

Nearly 12,500 people have died of the virus so far according to official data.

Despite a slowdown in new death and infection rates the government has extended an economically crippling lockdown until “at least” mid-April over fears of a second wind.

But poverty and unemployment numbers are already skyrocketing. Analysts have warned the eurozone’s third-largest economy will suffer its worst recession in decades, contracting six percent in 2020 should the lockdown last through to May.

“It’s horrible to have to choose between putting the economy in a corner or exposing many people to the risk of dying,” U.S. expert Paul Romer told Italy’s Fatto Quotidiano daily Wednesday.

The government needs “a credible plan to revoke the shutdown very soon, while guaranteeing the safety of workers even if the virus is still present,” said the co-winner of the 2018 Nobel Prize for Economics.

Italy’s business lobby Confindustria said Tuesday each additional week beyond the end of May could see the economy shrink by an additional 0.75 percentage points — billions of euros a week.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told opposition leaders Wednesday: “We must plan a return to normality, and it must be done gradually and must allow everyone, eventually, to return to work safely.” But he has yet to publish a blueprint.

Finance Minister Roberto Gualtieri said the recession forecasts were “realistic”, but warned against jumping the gun on easing the lockdown, saying “the more rigorous and efficient we are in combatting the epidemic, the sooner we can restart”.

His department was planning economic support measures worth some 500 billion euros, he said in an interview.

According to official figures, just over 100,000 people have been infected in Italy since the epidemic began, but experts say there could be anywhere between 700,000 and six million cases — up to 10 per cent of the population.

That could mean large numbers of people have already had the virus without suffering symptoms and could return to work.

As morgues overflowed and fear reigned, opposition parties largely curbed criticism of the government. But with good news on the infection rate, ex-prime minister Matteo Renzi has broken ranks to insist mass testing be done to end the lockdown.

“We’ll have to live with COVID-19 for months, maybe years. Those who tell you otherwise are lying. We cannot stay locked indoors for years, we must find a way to get out safely and work within the rules,” he said.

Mr. Romer called for “a policy of intelligent isolation, which means people are tested repeatedly, once every two weeks”.

Those who test negative can work; those who don’t, remain in isolation.

“You need to test on a large scale... for at least two years. And be ready to find through tests those who have (since) become contagious, because the virus will come in (to Italy) from other parts of the world,” he said.

“In past wars, countries mobilised production to produce new equipment. They have to do that again. Each country in Europe is rich enough and developed enough to do it.”

Italy has blood tests capable of quickly identifying who has the virus and who has the antibodies, but they are still in a trial phase, according to Guido Marinoni, head of the doctors’ union in hard-hit Bergamo in the country’s north.

Such tests would provide important data on “the population’s temporary immunity to the virus”, he said.

But according to Italian virologist Roberto Burioni, the tests only reveal antibodies some 14 days after infection. “We don’t know yet what extent of defence those antibodies provide,” he said.

Once the epidemic slows, the few people still infected “can kick-start a fresh upswing and we’d be back where we started”, Mr. Marinoni warned.

Nor will seeing fewer seriously ill coronavirus patients ease the pressure on hospitals immediately.

Free beds will go those unable to get one before. More people have been dying at home or in care homes than in hospital, Mr. noni said.

“We can only take a breath as long as the entire country is closed, because otherwise cases will emerge again,” he said.

“The worry is that just that when everything goes well, the mistakes made at the start of the epidemic are repeated.” The virus epicentre is Italy’s wealthy north, while the poorer south has been relatively spared.

Should the virus return and flare in the south, the fear is that hospitals weakened from years of painful cuts and corruption could be overwhelmed.

Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, told AFP a longer lockdown now would do less damage to the economy than relapses down the line.

“The equation is fairly simple,” he said. “Italy needs to reduce the spread of the virus to a speed the health system can cope with, and that does not appear to be the case yet”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bd7drm/article31229646.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUSITALY-ROBOTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/italy-urgently-seeks-safe-exit-from-punishing-lockdown/article31229647.ece

Britain reported 563 daily coronavirus deaths on Wednesday, the first time the national toll has exceeded 500, bringing the total fatalities to 2,352, according to official figures.

“As of 5 p.m. (1600 GMT) on 31 March, of those hospitalised in the U.K. who tested positive for coronavirus, 2,352 have sadly died,” the health ministry said on its official Twitter page.

Some 29,474 people have now tested positive, an increase of 4,324 over the previous day, it added.

Britain locked down last week in an attempt to combat the virus, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who himself has tested positive, warned that it would “get worse before it gets better”.

The virus has also hit the royal family, with Prince Charles only coming out of isolation on Tuesday after displaying mild symptoms of the disease.

14,2020/04/01,"U.K. extends work visas for Indian, foreign doctors amid coronavirus outbreak","The one-year extension will apply to around 2,800 migrant doctors, nurses and paramedics employed by the NHS whose visa is due to expire before October 1

In a relief to foreign doctors, including from India, whose visas were set to expire in October this year, the UK government has extended the deadline by one year amid the country’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

The UK government on Tuesday confirmed that foreign doctors, including from India, whose visas are set to expire before October this year will get an automatic extension for one year as they battle the coronavirus pandemic for the country’s National Health Service (NHS).

The extension, announced by U.K. Home Secretary Priti Patel, will apply to around 2,800 migrant doctors, nurses and paramedics employed by the NHS whose visa is due to expire before October 1.

“Doctors, nurses and paramedics from all over the world are playing a leading role in the NHS’ efforts to tackle coronavirus and save lives. We owe them a great deal of gratitude for all that they do,” said Ms. Patel.

“I don’t want them distracted by the visa process. That is why I have automatically extended their visas - free of charge - for a further year, the Indian-origin minister said.

The free of charge extension will also apply to their family members, demonstrating how valued overseas NHS staff are to the U.K., the Home Office said.

Student nurses and doctors

To get more doctors and nurses on the frontline, the restriction on the amount of hours student nurses and doctors can work in the NHS has also been lifted.

On top of these changes, pre-registered overseas nurses who are currently required to sit their first skills test within three months and to pass the test within eight months, will now have this deadline extended to the end of the year. This will give overseas nurses more time to pass their exams, whilst they spend the immediate term working on the frontline.

Trainee doctors and nurses will also not be limited by the number of hours they can work in the NHS during term time, the Home Office said.

The extension to NHS visas will not only be fee-free and automatic but also exempt from the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS).

The annual IHS, which was recently further hiked, has been branded as “unfair” by Indian doctors because they already pay their taxes.

“We believe that this surcharge is discriminatory and unfair, as the overseas workers are already paying their due share of National Insurance contributions, superannuation and income tax,” the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO) said in its letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson just last week.

“We request you to remove the health surcharge with immediate effect. The NHS has been in a workforce crisis for several years, but now with the COVID-19 epidemic, there has never been a worse time for an overstrained service, and we require all the help we can get to meet the challenges, read the letter, signed by BAPIO President Ramesh Mehta, chair Dr J.S. Bamrah and Secretary Professor Parag Singhal.

The latest move could be seen as a sign that the UK government may be having a rethink on the surcharge, hiked from £400 to £624 per year and aimed at boosting NHS funds, being imposed on medics working for the health service.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uk-extends-work-visas-for-indian-foreign-doctors-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/article31225008.ece
15,2020/04/01,COVID-19 | Saudi Hajj Minister urges pilgrims to delay plans,"A senior Saudi official urged more than 1 million Muslims intending to perform the hajj to delay making plans this year in comments suggesting the pilgrimage could be cancelled due to the new COVID-19 pandemic.

In February, the kingdom took the extraordinary decision to close off the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to foreigners over the virus, a step which wasn’t taken even during the 1918 flu epidemic that killed tens of millions worldwide.

Restrictions have tightened in the kingdom as it grapples with over 1,500 confirmed cases of the new virus. The kingdom has reported 10 deaths so far. The Middle East has more than 71,000 confirmed cases of the virus, most of those in Iran, and over 3,300 deaths.

""The kingdom of Saudi Arabia is prepared to secure the safety of all Muslims and nationals,” Saudi Hajj and Umrah Minister Muhammad Saleh bin Taher Banten told state television. “That’s why we have requested from all Muslims around the world to hold onto signing any agreements (with tour operators) until we have a clear vision.”

Saudi Arabia has barred people from entering or exiting three major cities, including Mecca and Medina, and imposed a nighttime curfew across the country. Like other countries around the world and in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has suspended all inbound and outbound commercial flights.

Each year, up to 2 million Muslims perform the hajj, a physically demanding and often costly pilgrimage that draws the faithful from around the world. The hajj, required of all able-bodied Muslims to perform once in their lifetime, is seen as a chance to wipe clean past sins and bring about greater humility and unity among Muslims.

Mr. Banten also said the kingdom was already providing care for 1,200 pilgrims stuck in the holy city due to global travel restrictions. A number of them are being quarantined in hotels in Mecca, he said.

Ivanka Trump, who is a senior advisor to her father and U.S. President Donald Trump, described as “wonderful” the video of a yoga asan tweeted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to encourage people to stay fit during the lockdown imposed in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Prime Minister Modi on Tuesday shared the video and said the yoga asan helped relieve stress.

“Whenever I get time, I practice Yoga Nidra once or twice a week. It furthers overall well-being, relaxes the mind, reduces stress and anxiety. You will find many videos of Yoga Nidra on the net. I’m sharing a video each in English and Hindi,” he tweeted.

“This is wonderful! Thank you @narendramod! #TogetherApart,” Ms. Ivanka said on Tuesday as she retweeted Modi’s post.

Ms. Ivanka accompanied her father and U.S. President Donald Trump during his maiden visit to India in February. Mr. Trump was accompanied by First Lady Melania, daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner and the top brass of his administration.

Yoga fast spreading in western world

Yoga has been spreading fast in the US for the last several years, but its pace accelerated after the declaration of International Yoga Day by the United Nations in 2015 and Prime Minister Modi taking a proactive step in its awareness.

According to some estimate, some 36 million Americans practise yoga.

“Yoga helps to harmonise the mind and body. Even in our separateness, PM @narendramodi guides on being together, being aware through yoga. @IvankaTrump #TogetherApart,” India’s Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu said in a tweet.

In the wake of current coronavirus crisis, wherein more than 250 million Americans are forced to stay home, yoga is increasingly being used by the people.

The Indian Embassy in the US, on Monday started a daily online yoga class. The emphasis of these classes are on using the yoga postures and breathing exercises to strengthen immune system, the embassy said in a tweet. The classes are streamed through the embassy’s Facebook page.

Philip Anderson, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who expanded the world’s understanding of magnetism and superconductivity, has died at 96.

Anderson died Sunday at the Princeton Windrows retirement community in Princeton, New Jersey, his daughter said. No cause was reported.

Bogdan Andrei Bernevig, a Princeton professor of physics, said in a statement that Anderson will be known as the man who started solid state physics as a field.

Bernevig described Anderson as complex and said that “I was always in awe of his intellect. He was working on theories for regular days well into his 90s.”

Anderson graduated from Harvard in 1949 and then worked for Bell Telephone Laboratories until he began teaching at Princeton and the University of Cambridge.

During his career in academia, Anderson advised another Nobel Prize winner, F. Duncan Haldane, who won the 2016 prize in physics. Anderson inspired another winner, Brian Josephson, who won the 1973 Nobel Prize and took a class taught by Anderson at Cambridge.

19,2020/04/01,Prominent virologist Gita Ramjee dies from coronavirus,"In 2018, Ramjee was presented with the Outstanding Female Scientist Award in Lisbon by the European Development Clinical Trials Partnerships for her lifetime commitment to finding new HIV prevention methods

World-renowned virologist Gita Ramjee has become the first Indian-origin South African to have died after contracting the novel coronavirus that has killed five people in the country.

Ramjee, a stellar vaccine scientist and an HIV prevention research leader, had returned from London a week ago but reportedly showed no symptoms of COVID-19.

Ramjee, aged nearly 50 years, was the Clinical Trials Unit Principal Investigator and Unit Director of the HIV Prevention Research Unit of the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC) offices in Durban.

“We are deeply saddened to inform you of the tragic passing of Prof Gita Ramjee in hospital today,” said a statement issued by SAMRC President and CEO Glenda Gray. “Prof Ramjee died of COVID-19 related complications,” Gray added.

In 2018, Ramjee was presented with the Outstanding Female Scientist Award in Lisbon by the European Development Clinical Trials Partnerships (EDCTP) for her lifetime commitment to finding new HIV prevention methods, which are conducive to the lifestyles, circumstances and perceived risk factors that South African women are faced with.

“This award is an acknowledgement of the unwavering determination by a global community to forever change the trajectory of the HIV/AIDS epidemic,” she had said at the time.

Ramjee was married to pharmacist Pravin Ramjee, a South African of Indian descent.

Her funeral arrangements have not been announced. Attendance at funerals in South Africa is highly restricted and requires permits as the country is going through a 21-day nationwide lockdown announced last week by President Cyril Ramaphosa.

Five South Africans have died from COVID-19 since Sunday, the third day of the lockdown. Over 13,50 cases have been reported in the country so far. The South African government on Tuesday announced that it will double to 10,000 the teams going door-to-door to test people for COVID-19, mainly in the overcrowded Black townships created during the apartheid era.

On Sunday evening, in a national broadcast, Ramaphosa cautioned thousands of South Africans who have not been taking the lockdown seriously.

20,2020/04/01,"COVID-19 worst crisis since World War II, says U.N. chief","Mr. Antonio Guterres made these remarks at the launch of a report on the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic on Tuesday.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that the world faces the most challenging crisis since World War II, confronting a pandemic threatening people in every country, one that will bring a recession “that probably has no parallel in the recent past.”

There is also a risk that the combination of the disease and its economic impact will contribute to “enhanced instability, enhanced unrest, and enhanced conflict,” the U.N. chief said at the launch of a report on the socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19-on Tuesday.

Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

Mr. Guterres called for a much stronger and more effective global response to the coronavirus pandemic and to the social and economic devastation that COVID-19 is causing.

He stressed that this will only be possible if everybody comes together and if we forget political games and understand that it is humankind that is at stake. “We are facing a global health crisis unlike any in the 75-year history of the United Nations — one that is killing people, spreading human suffering, and upending people’s lives, the report said.

“But this is much more than a health crisis. It is a human crisis. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is attacking societies at their core.

Watch | Coronavirus: Can masks protect you?

The Secretary-General told reporters: The magnitude of the response must match the scale of the crisis — large-scale, coordinated and comprehensive, with country and international responses being guided by the World Health Organization.

He stressed that we are still very far from where we need to be to effectively fight the COVID-19 worldwide and to be able to tackle the negative impacts on the global economy and the global societies. First, he said, many countries are not respecting WHO guidelines, with each tending to go its own way in dealing with the pandemic.

Data | In numbers: The COVID-19 pandemic

“Let us remember that we are only as strong as the weakest health system in our interconnected world, he said. It is essential that developed countries immediately assist those less developed to bolster their health systems and their response capacity to stop transmission.

Secondly, he said, while USD 5 trillion has been mobilised, most of that money was by the developed world — including USD 2 trillion in the United States — to support their own economies from the consequences of the pandemic.

‘Global package for developing nations’

We are far from having a global package to help the developing world to create the conditions both to suppress the disease and to address the dramatic consequences in their populations, in the people that lost their jobs, the small companies that are operating and risk to disappear, those that live with the informal economy that now have no chance to survive, he said.

Massive support to the developing world is still required. The report also cites International Labor Organization estimates for 2020 that between 5 million and 25 million jobs will be lost, with a corresponding loss of between USD 860 million and USD 3.4 trillion in labor income. It also cited an estimate by the U.N. trade and development organization UNCTAD of a 30-40 percent downward pressure” on global foreign direct investment flows this year.

Mr. Guterres announced the establishment of a COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund to support efforts in low- and middle-income countries, with the aim of swiftly enabling governments to tackle the crisis and promote recovery.

He expressed hope that there will be a positive response from the international community to help vulnerable people including the tens of millions of refugees and internally displaced people, those in the slums of big cities in the global south, and poor people in middle-income countries who are more numerous than in the least developed countries.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9h8r24/article31223644.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDANTONIOGUTERRES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-worst-crisis-since-world-war-ii-says-un-chief/article31223646.ece

Deaths from the coronavirus spiked in Europe on Tuesday with Spain, France and Britain reporting their highest daily tolls to date, as field hospitals shot up across New York, the epicentre of the U.S. outbreak bracing for dark times ahead.

With more than 40,000 killed by the disease barrelling around the globe, the United States, already home to the largest number of confirmed infections, hit a bleak milestone as its national death toll surpassed China’s. In a matter of months, the virus has infected nearly 850,000 people in a crisis hammering the global economy and transforming the daily existence of some 3.6 billion people who have been told to stay home under lockdowns.

Deaths shot up again across Europe. While there are hopeful signs that the spread of infections is slowing in hardest-hit Italy and Spain, more than 800 died overnight in both countries. France recorded a one-day record of 499 dead while Britain reported 381 coronavirus deaths. With hospitals direly overstretched, lockdowns have been extended despite their crushing economic impact.

In Belgium, a 12-year-old girl died in another worrying case of a youth succumbing to the disease. Meanwhile, the United States saw its death toll top 3,600, roaring past China’s official tally of 3,309, according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker. France joined it with a surge to 3,525 deaths, an official toll that includes only those who died in hospital and not those who perished at home or in seniors’ homes.

‘We need help now’

The inundation of patients has sent health facilities around the world into overdrive. Field hospitals are popping up in event spaces while distressed medical staff make grim decisions about how to distribute limited protective gear, beds and life-saving respirators.

In scenes previously unimaginable in peacetime, around a dozen white tents were erected to serve as a field hospital in New York’s Central Park. “You see movies like Contagion and you think it’s so far from the truth, it will never happen. So to see it actually happening here is very surreal,” 57-year-old passerby Joanne Dunbar told AFP.

While many companies and schools around the globe have shifted to teleworking and teaching over video platforms, huge swaths of the world’s workforce cannot perform their jobs online and are now lacking pay and face a deeply uncertain future. Food banks in New York City have seen a surge of newcomers struggling to feed their families.

“It is my first time,” Lina Alba, who lost her job as a cleaner in a Manhattan hotel that closed two weeks ago, said from a food distribution centre. Millions of Americans are awaiting cash injections from a $2 trillion rescue package. “We need the help now. This is crazy,” said Ms. Alba, a 40-year-old single mother of five.

Three quarters of Americans are now under some form of lockdown. Louisiana has emerged as a critical hotspot, with Governor John Bel Edwards warning the State was on track to exceed its ventilator capacity as early as Saturday. “We have yet to see any evidence that we are beginning to flatten the curve,” Mr. Edwards said.

Off the Florida coast, a coronavirus-stricken cruise ship and its sister vessel are pleading for somewhere to dock, possibly at Fort Lauderdale, after four passengers died on board.

Virus breeds divisions

The staggering economic and political upheaval spurred by the virus is opening new fronts for cooperation and conflict. In virtual talks Tuesday, Finance Ministers and Central Bankers from the world’s 20 major economies pledged to address the debt burden of low-income countries and deliver aid to emerging markets. Last week G20 leaders said they were injecting $5 trillion into the global economy to head off a feared deep recession.

In the European Union, however, battle lines have been drawn over the terms of a rescue plan to finance the expected severe economic fallout. Worst-hit Italy and Spain are leading a group pushing for a shared debt instrument — dubbed “coronabonds”. But talk of common debt is a red line for Germany and other northern countries long opposed to such a measure, threatening to divide the bloc in the midst of a health catastrophe.

European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen warned governments not to use emergency measures as a pretext for power grabs. Her call followed concerns about a new law giving Hungary’s nationalist leader Viktor Orban sweeping authority to rule by decree until his government deems the emergency over. Activists worldwide have voiced fears that autocrats will overreach and hold on to their new powers even after the crisis abates.

‘Nothing to eat’

The economic pain of lockdowns is especially acute in the developing world. In Tunisia several hundred protested a week-old lockdown that has disproportionately impacted the poor. “Nevermind coronavirus, we’re going to die anyway! Let us work!” shouted one protester in the demonstration on the outskirts of the capital Tunis.

Africa’s biggest city Lagos entered its first full day of a two-week shutdown — containment will be especially tough in the megacity's packed slums, where many rely on daily wages to survive. “There is no money for the citizens,” engineer Ogun Nubi Victor, 60. “People are just sitting at home, with nothing to eat,” he said.

24,2020/04/01,Coronavirus | France reports record 499 deaths in 24 hours,"The number of confirmed cases also rose steeply by 7,578 to 52,128, however, many others have gone unregistered because of a lack of testing equipment.

France on Tuesday reported its highest daily number of deaths from COVID-19 since the coronavirus epidemic began, saying 499 more people had died in hospital to bring the toll to 3,523.

There are now 22,757 people hospitalised in France with the disease, with 5,565 of them in intensive care, health official Jerome Salomon told reporters in his daily update. The French death toll includes only those who died in hospital and not those who died at home or in old people’s homes.

The number of confirmed cases also rose steeply by 7,578 to 52,128. Many cases, however, go unregistered because of a lack of testing equipment.

“This situation is completely unprecedented in the history of French medicine,” said Mr. Salomon. France has been in lockdown since March 17 in a bid to slow the spread of the epidemic and officials have repeatedly warned it will take time for the measures to bear fruit.

Mr. Salomon said hospitals in eastern France — one of the hubs of the outbreak — were under “great tension” and in Paris and its wider surroundings the situation was also “difficult”.

As a result, France has been moving some patients to other regions or even abroad to neighbouring countries. Mr. Salomon said 288 patients had been transferred to regions under less pressure so far and this number would increase in the days to come. He confirmed that on Wednesday a specially equipped train would transfer 36 patients from Paris to Brittany.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/w4iiet/article31222617.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001Q97P3jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-france-reports-record-499-deaths-in-24-hours/article31222616.ece
25,2020/04/01,Coronavirus | Ethiopia defers landmark August vote due to pandemic,"No new timeline was given for the general elections, which Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed — last year’s Nobel Peace Prize laureate — hopes will give him a mandate for sweeping political and economic reforms.

Ethiopia’s Election Commission announced Tuesday that general elections due in August would be delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic, in a setback for the country’s fragile democratic transition.

No new timeline was given for the vote, which Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed — last year’s Nobel Peace Prize laureate — hopes will give him a mandate for sweeping political and economic reforms. “Because of issues related to the coronavirus, the board has decided it can’t conduct the election as planned...so it has decided to void that calendar and suspend all activities,” the poll body said in a statement

It said a new date would be given “when the pandemic is over”. Ethiopia has recorded 26 cases of COVID-19 and federal and regional officials have introduced a range of measures intended to curb its spread, including banning large gatherings and restricting travel. These measures would have prevented the timely completion of activities like voter registration and the recruitment and training of observers, the election board said.

Mr. Abiy was appointed Prime Minister in 2018 after several years of anti-government protests. He rose through the ranks of the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) ruling coalition, which dominated Parliament and allowed only one competitive election after it took power in the early 1990s, which was in 2005. The EPRDF and its allies won all 547 seats in Parliament in 2015.

However, the coalition no longer exists following Mr. Abiy’s decision to transform it into a single political group, the Ethiopian Prosperity Party.

Path forward uncertain

Well before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, opposition parties and analysts had voiced concern that the election board’s preparations were behind schedule. The scheduled date of August 29 had also been a point of contention because it falls at the height of the rainy season.

Yet election officials had previously said they could not delay the vote because the constitutional mandates of lawmakers expire in October. It was not immediately clear how officials intended to address that problem should the coronavirus pandemic push elections into late 2020 or even 2021. Mr. Abiy’s rule has been marred by widespread ethnic violence, and critics accuse him of cracking down on political opponents and other dissenters.

Grim security conditions in parts of the country like Wollega, where the military is conducting counterinsurgency operations against a rebel group, have called into question how the government could possibly hold voting there. The delay could potentially give the government space to address major obstacles to a peaceful and credible vote, said William Davison, Ethiopia analyst for the International Crisis Group, a conflict-prevention organisation.

“Although the circumstances are deeply worrying, the delay does offer an opportunity to reset Ethiopia's troubled transition,” he said. “A start would be the ruling party discussing with opponents critical topics such as the conditions for a fair election, transitional justice and reconciliation, and the federation's major political faultlines,” Mr. Davison added.

Jawar Mohammed, a leading opposition politician, told AFP he was not surprised by the delay but said the opposition would need to be consulted on next steps. “We knew it was coming,” he said. “But the new timetable cannot be done by the ruling party alone,” Mr. Mohammed added.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/7wqxaq/article31222614.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001PY9UBjpgjfkg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-ethiopia-defers-landmark-august-vote-due-to-pandemic/article31222612.ece
26,2020/04/01,Homeschooling is being discussed seriously as schools have closed due to the Covid-19 lockdown,"The lessons of homeschooled children go on unaffected even as the Covid-19 lockdown goes on and schools try ways and means to teach students remotely

“Homeschooling is not an easy option but it is definitely thinking out of the box,” says Kochi- based Cristelle Hart Singh who along with her husband Ravi Singh homeschooled their sons, 10-year-old Ishaan and eight-year-old Tej, based on child-led learning. “The child learns what he/she wants to learn as opposed to teaching them what we want them to learn,” she adds.

With the imposition of lockdown across the world to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, normal life has been thrown out of gear, affecting school-going children and their schedules. While virtual classrooms and online classes are back in focus, another non-traditional method — Home Schooling — is being discussed vigorously, especially when homes have become learning centres.

Mumbai-based Sharmila Govande says, “Homeschooling is based on a philosophy or approach that believes that children are natural learners and love to explore their curiosity, interests and passion. They have the ability to self direct their learning.” Sharmila is mother to three unschooling children and active in the homeschooling / unschooling circles in Mumbai and in organising events for “our tribe”.

Growing environment

There is a a growing environment — especially in cities like Bengaluru, Pune and Mumbai — in which children stay at home and are either taught a curriculum by the parents/a tutor, or learn as they grow, watching their parents and joining them in household chores and activities, depending on each family’s interpretation of non-formal education.

The oldest homeschoolers, Sharmila says, she knows of in India are in their 30s, “so it possibly began here three to four decades ago. No one has ever done a count, but I think there are roughly around 10,000 families across India.”

Looking at its history in India many British families homeschooled their children, pre-1947 often bringing tutors from England. Many expats continued doing the same after Independence and some Indian families were inspired by the system. “In fact pre-independence days, we have examples of Dr Anandibai Gopalrao Joshi (first Indian female physician), Savitri Bai Phule (first Indian female teacher) who were home educated. Of course there are many more examples,” says Sharmila.

“I am not saying home schooling is for everyone. But this is how we choose to raise our children now,” says Jaimie Chandrasekhar who along with her husband, musician DJ Sekhar, and her mother-in-law decided to home school her seven-year-old daughter Kaamaakhya. “The three adults in the family decided on homeschooling.”

Jaimie had quit her job as a education counsellor while in the eighth month of pregnancy and had prepared to raise her first born “differently”. “We took conscious decisions and home schooling is one of those,” she says. Kaamaakhya was not sent to a play school but when she was four she wanted to join a school. “We put her in one but, in six months, we found that she was not as expressive as before. Kaamaakhya is fiercely independent and highly expressive,” says Jaimie adding that the family does not believe in concept of “punishment for being naughty”. “Raising a child, teaching, learning is not a power game between children and adults, parent and child.”

Jaimie’s mother-in-law was a teacher who also conducted home tuitions alongside her work. She never felt that a formal schooling was required for successful adulthood.

Education as democratic

For Rustum Usman, COO, Spia Tech India Pvt Ltd, who develops products for Industrial IOT (Internet Of Things), “education is a democratic thing. We don’t compel the children to learn anything.” Rustum chose to homeschool his four children — Eisa Usman, Moosa Usman, Aaisha Usman and Fathima Usman — because of his “negative experiences” at early school and has now begun putting out videos on homeschooling, explaining what it requires, its benefits and its flip side.

A dyslexic, he had issues memorising multiplication tables and with spellings in school but “by the time I came to class 7, I had devised my own method of multiplication. I had become smarter in Math from self-learning,” says Rustum. In one video, he draws up a checklist of seven points required for homeschooling.

Seven point checklist Rustum’s seven-point checklist on home schooling:

i) One parent should work from home.

ii) Parent should be focused, motivated and committed.

iii) Peer group interaction should be organised either through meetings in parks or play dates.

iv) The home or area should be spacious.

v) There should be a good relationship between parent and child.

vi) Homeschooling for a single child is not advisable and has its own challenges.

vii) Homeschooling is inexpensive in comparison to private schools but expensive when compared to government-aided schools.

Rustum and his wife, Mariyam Vidhu Vijayan, follow the IGCSE syllabus as a basic curriculum for their children between three and eight years and some of their extra curricular activities are birding, programming and cooking.

His household follows “ a philosophy of software development,” where a schedule is charted and followed by each individual to suit their day. “If my son is curious about a math problem, he comes to me and I find a suitable time to help him learn,” says Rustum who has devised his own method of assessment. He has also tied up with alternative education schools like Bhoomi in Kochi for “non-academics” and used to take his children to the park for meeting with peer groups. His videos deal from teaching kitchen skills to saying ‘yes’ and doing away with ‘saying No’ culture.

Following the child’s interests

Anand Bachchan, who set up Bhoomi, an alternative learning outfit, says that there are several reasons why families opt for home schools. Available educational options can be a disappointment, or families may not want children to face competition, religious choices or even distances. “Many families select a curriculum and teach children at home, which is the traditional method,” he explains, “but there is unschooling or de schooling where no curriculum is followed. The idea is that you are at home with the family and do things as a family — travel, cook, clean and learn along the way.

His personal idea of education is “to follow what interests the child”. At Bhoomi, the children follow “the Bhoomi rhythm” or flow of the day, something akin to a timetable. Children have fixed time for free play, song and dance, fruit time and an activity.

Currently the oldest child at Bhoomi is a 13-year-old and the learning environment is built on the contributions of parents and children at Bhoomi. “As we go on, the family decides about a child, if he or she wants to venture into formal schooling or pursue a syllabus from outside.”

Sharmila points out that many homeschoolers “have opted for mainstream higher education and have gone on to pursue degrees from colleges and universities. I understand that they do very well in whatever field they choose to study. I believe the main reason is because the choice is theirs and hence give their fullest to that experience.” She points out that the National Institute of Open schooling (NIOS) is considered at par with the CBSE curriculum and that there is also the option of giving Cambridge exams (IGCSE) as private candidates.

The obvious questions parents opting for homeschooling face is of a successful career for the child.

Sharmila says that stories abound of homeschoolers striking out careers in fields like graphic design, filmmaking, restauranting, software and app development, starting media projects and youtube channels. “many are artists, photographers and writers.”

Cristelle says that her son Ishaan, who dabbles with his father in carpentry, wishes to be an inventor and a chef. “ He learns Math that way, the boys are already talking about their careers.”

Open schools to choose from

Recently the Bhoomi parents organised a Zoom meet for the children during the lockdown. The parents believe that, for higher education, the children can choose from Open Schools where exams can be taken when the student is ready. “There’s no competition and no stress but some children need classroom authority,” admits Cristelle.

Safe space Enhanced safety measures when the child is at home.

Parents have to be more vigilant about domestic violence, child sexual abuse and Internet safety, with children being at home during a lockdown.

In homeschool communities, parents take turns to host children in their homes and teach them a certain skill. “Such communities are doing very well. Most cities have their local groups and events. We also have used social media effectively and hence have many WhatsApp and FB groups to ensure constant communication and sharing,” says Sharmila.

Meanwhile, during the lockdown, while the conventional school goers are coming to terms with the new normal, home schoolers are wondering what the commotion of is all about.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/4c0ht7/article31228695.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimphomeschooling2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/the-lessons-of-homeschooled-children-go-on-unaffected-even-as-the-covid-19-lockdown-goes-on-and-schools-try-ways-and-means-to-teach-students-remotely/article31228290.ece
27,2020/04/01,COVID-19: Couples live-stream intimate weddings under lockdown,"As we battle the novel Coronavirus crisis, couples the world over have been stripping down their big fat weddings to the bare essentials: a commitment to stay together through thick and thin

As Sweatha Varthamanan and Aswin Ravi tied the knot along with over 20 of their closest friends and family in Chennai, nearly as many phones and recording devices were propped in front of their faces. They were live streaming the wedding to the other 200 guests who could not make it, because of the all-India lockdown to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

“It was surreal. Every girl dreams of her wedding, but this was nothing I had ever imagined. All empty chairs, and 15 smartphones in front of us, like we’re some celebrities,” laughs Sweatha, who married Aswin on March 26, the day after India went under lockdown. They cancelled every other ceremony — mehendi to reception, except for the rites.

As we battle the novel Coronavirus crisis, couples all over the world have been stripping down their big fat weddings to the bare essentials: a commitment to stay together through thick and thin. No grand decorations, just declarations of love.

A dream destination wedding in Las Vegas was what Autumn Conner had in mind. After all, the Phoenix (Arizona, USA) resident had waited over six months for her now husband Santosh Roychowdhury to fly in from India. “His visa took that long to clear. My side of the family was supposed to fly in from all over the country,” says Autumn, over a VoIP call from her hometown.

But then on March 14, two days prior to her wedding, Autumn had to call off her plans as the US started to bear the brunt of COVID-19. With social distancing and lockdown protocols kicking in across the country, the couple opted to play it safe, and decided to get married in a private ceremony that was attended by a little over 10 people.

In order to slow down the spread of the coronavirus, the German government has considerably restricted public life and asked the citizens to stay at home.

“It was strange. Funny too. We just smiled looking at each other,” says Autumn, as she shares pictures of the couple wearing masks and exchanging their wedding kiss. “We wore masks to remind people that it is important to take this pandemic seriously, in the US and around the world,” says Santosh, adding, “but love can overcome anything... even a pandemic.”

Similar reports have been coming in from Lithuania, Indonesia, Spain, Argentina, Italy and others. In a video that went viral on Twitter, a couple got married on the streets of New York, as their friend who performed the ceremony from a balcony, read out an excerpt from the very apt Love in the Time of Cholera, by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

Difficult choices

Behind the cutesy pictures of masked kisses however, is a rolling stone of shifting plans, guests dropping out, vendors bargaining, and the accompanying stress.

“Forget social distancing, Aswin and I distanced ourselves from each other two days before the wedding,” says Sweatha, adding that their texts would only be “Good Morning”, “Good Night”, and “Did you eat?”

“Both of us were tense and we wanted to avoid arguments about the planning. When the situation is out of our control, it is better to be silent and calm,” she says.

Weddings were one of the exemptions to the lockdown, under certain conditions. According to a Tamil Nadu Government Order, “marriages already fixed on or before March 16, in marriage halls alone can be conducted, subject to a maximum number of 30 guests.”

And so, a detailed police permission has to be sought by the marriage hall, and by the couples getting married, citing the guests in attendance.

Pranesh Padmanabhan, founder of Studio 31, who covered Sweatha and Aswin’s wedding, explains how his team of photographers were picked up from their homes and dropped at the venue. “Our car was stopped six times for checking permissions,” he says. “After our photographers came back home, they self-quarantined for a week and took temperatures every few hours.”

“Fortunately, the caterer for our wedding agreed to serve to a smaller guest list. Only, instead of cooking at the venue, he brought food from his kitchen to the hall,” says Sweatha. In another wedding that Studio 31 covered in mid-March, the couple had to arrange for food parcels for the 28 guests in attendance, from the nearest Saravana Bhavan after the caterer cancelled.

“The coming three months are known as the wedding season in India. We normally would have about 140 bookings during this period, but 90 % of them dropped out. Now we have about 20, and even they are unsure,” he says. Pranesh has made an effort to document these surreal times through his photographs: Corporation workers hosing down the venue with disinfectants, guests dining a metre apart from each other.

The silver lining

The Government has instructed marriage halls to “return the advance paid by the public for all cancelled bookings.” However, some like Pushpa Sridhar claim they are still in the dark about refunds: instead, they are being asked by vendors to set another date.

“It is very disappointing for both families. Airlines have asked our guests to switch the booking to a later date within the next six months. Which means our relatives are asking us if we have set a date yet, but we can’t do that until there is some sense of normalcy!” says Pushpa, mother of the groom.

On the other hand, Arjun (name changed on request) used the lockdown as the opportunity to have the intimate eco-friendly wedding he and his wife had always pictured. “My wife’s family had wanted a grander wedding, and we debated postponing it. But we went ahead with an intimate affair, because in the end, that is what she and I had wanted.”

Arjun proudly recalls how his was one of those few weddings where everybody present was involved in what was happening, rather than having personal conversations. He too had live streamed the ceremony for around 300-400 people, much like Sweatha and Aswin.

Thankful for the relaxed affair, Aswin says, “If you think about the ones closest to you, that you want around you, they wouldn’t be more than 30, anyway.”

28,2020/04/01,Coronavirus outbreak: Keralites employed in China return to work,"As life in China slowly gets back on track after the COVID-19 outbreak, employees from around the world are returning to their offices. MetroPlus speaks to three people on what it's like to get back to their lives in Xiamen

Riyad Muhammedali, Binoy AK and Appu VK, colleagues at Base FX, a visual effects and animation company in Xiamen City in Fujian province of China, had big plans for the week-long holiday, which was to start on January 25, the first day of the Chinese New Year. However, instead, life turned topsy-turvy as COVID-19 brought the country to a standstill. Their focus moved to finding ways to keep their families safe. Riyad opted to stay in China, while Binoy and Appu took the earliest flights back home.

Now as China limps back to normal, Binoy and Appu have returned and are back at work. Sharing their experiences over the phone with MetroPlus, the trio say that people continue to take precautions, like using masks, hand sanitisers and avoiding physical proximity. Also, temperature is taken in office buildings, apartment or shops. Almost all companies have reopened. Public transport is fully operational, including the metro. And shops are doing brisk business.

When my friends and colleagues decided to leave for their respective countries, my logic was that home was the safest place at that moment. I didn’t want to risk the health of my wife and two children, especially of our seven-month-old daughter by travelling.

Even though Xiamen, an island, is over 1,000 kilometres away from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, cases were reported here as well. I was worried when there was an exponential rise in the number of positive cases and deaths across China. But, everything was in place for the lockdown. We live in a housing society, or community as we call it. It is a huge area with a total of 10 gates, with four buildings of 32 floors inside each gate. There are four flats in each floor.

The first thing our community did was to issue passes to every adult to prevent the entry of any outsider, thus ensuring a local lockdown. We got regular updates and guidelines on the community app. Entire residential area was disinfected; they placed a plastic coating on the lift buttons and it was changed on hourly basis. Health workers took our temperature daily. Grocery was delivered via the app of the supermarket and kept at separate trays meant for each household, with the security personnel of buildings. For four weeks I stepped out of my apartment only to collect these goods.

We went by the rules and had trust in the governmental machinery after having worked here for the last three years. Our office opened three weeks ago. Positive cases are still being reported, but Wuhan hasn’t had a single case over the last one week. My wife hasn’t stepped out of our apartment yet because the fear is still there.

Online classes have started for our son who is in class one. Although cinemas and certain shopping malls haven't opened yet, life is back on track. Many restaurants were functioning during the time of the lockdown as well, but people preferred to stay at home and order things online.

I have been working in Xiamen for nearly two years now, there are eight of us from Kerala. While four of us have returned, the rest are in India because of the lockdown. Even though things are under control here now I am worried about my wife and eight-month-old daughter in Kerala as the number of positive cases are on the rise in the State.

When I reached here on March 13, I had to be on 14-day quarantine because there was a spike in the number of positive cases, presumably because people had started returning to China from their respective home countries. First I was asked to be under home quarantine, but was later directed to move to a hotel to finish the quarantine period. A taxi was arranged by people in our community itself to shift to the hotel. My temperature was monitored on a daily basis and two swab tests were also done during this period.

I left China and flew to Kerala on January 26 with my wife, Anu, and our eight-month-old daughter, Eva. Eva had a bout of fever two weeks prior to our journey. We have to arrange for an interpreter at any hospital in China since we don’t know the language: I knew treatment would be difficult if she fell ill again during the viral outbreak. But travelling had its problems as there was a possibility of getting infected while in transit. It was impossible to make my daughter wear a mask, although I had arranged for a mini-mask. Nevertheless, I decided to take the risk and took the flight to India.

We felt Kerala was safe because there were no COVID-19 cases in the state then. When we landed in Kochi, we went through a health check-up since we were coming from China. Once I reached home, I had no idea about the 28-day home quarantine, but officials of the Kerala State health department guided me. I was constantly in touch with my Chinese friends and decided to return to China once there was a decrease in the number of cases here.

I was in Kerala from January 29 to March 11 with my family. And they were not happy about my decision to return to China. I had travelled back via Malaysia and it took more than three hours to clear the immigration here. Now I have finished my 14-day quarantine in China as well, first at my apartment and later in a hotel. It was ensured that I didn’t step out of the hotel room. If I went out it was not possible to use the room key to get in again!

While I worked from my apartment, it was difficult from the hotel room because of poor internet connectivity. I didn’t work while in Kerala because the company provided work from home facilities only for those who stayed back in China.

Now I am going to office, something I have been looking forward to for so many days. Our team is working on a new project. I have worked as an animator in Sony's upcoming animation movie Wish Dragon. Things are looking bright. It is nice to see families in the park with their kids during the weekend, though they are wearing masks.

I would have stayed in China itself but for the frantic calls from my family. I wasn’t scared because I had enough food and other essential commodities at home. I also had trust in the measures being taken by the government and didn’t want to contract any infection by travelling.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/f5bbb7/article31226492.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03TVMCHINA,https://www.thehindu.com/society/coronavirus-outbreak-keralites-employed-in-china-return-to-work/article31226496.ece

“It is thengaai saadam and thattapayiru poriyal for lunch today,” says Maheshwaran NS over the phone. A food truck has just left carrying lunch packets for over 100 people who are on duty on the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border. “The health department staff, the police, and the army are all camped at the border to screen COVID-19 cases to prevent entry into Tamil Nadu. They check vehicles entering the state and also conduct medical check-ups. They are on duty 24/7 to safeguard us.”

Maheshwaran is the founder and president of Namma Navakkarai, an NGO located at Navakkarai village in Walayar (20 km from the city) on the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border. The group that has 10 active volunteers recently revived the Oorani Lake in Mavuthampathi Panchayat that supports farming in the village.

The Namma Navakkarai team volunteered at the camp that was set up to tackle COVID-19 and learnt that the food for the people on duty there arrived late and was insufficient. They decided to make breakfast, lunch, and dinner for camp members at Walayar and Velanthavalam. They identified a centralised kitchen at Walayar, sought out a head cook and started. “ Our Mavuthampathi Panchayat supported us with provisions. As for vegetables, villagers in the border areas generously offered us regular supplies of tomatoes, onions, brinjal, drumstick, and lady’s finger from their farms. They turned up with baskets full of vegetables every day. It was heartening,” says Maheswaran.

Packed with nutrition

Their day starts at the crack of dawn as they go about making breakfast. “We stick to a standard menu of idli, pongal, khichdi, or upma and ensure that we deliver by 8.00 am. Then, we prepare lunch that often includes tomato rice and brinjal poriyal or sambar rice with broad beans poriyal... This way, the personnel can have a bowl of vegetables every day. Dinner is rotis and a mixed vegetable gravy. We are a small team. We wear masks and maintain hygiene at the kitchen. We wash our hands regularly with sanitisers.”

Maheshwaran says contributions have been pouring in from people. “Someone dropped by and donated 100 kg of atta. Another person supplies five litres of milk every day. Now, we make tea, twice a day. When we wind up it is well past 10.00 pm. But, we want to continue as long a the camp does.

30,2020/04/01,"Maruti, Hyundai sales skid","Tata Motors, M&M too hit by nationwide lockdown

Already reeling under a prolonged slowdown and the transition to BS-VI fuel norms, auto sector saw its woes being compounded by the 21-day nationwide lockdown. Manufacturers witnessed a decline in sales in the range of 44%-90% in their domestic wholesales in March 2020.

The country’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki posted a 47.4% decline in passenger vehicles (PVs) in the domestic market to 76,240 units, compared with the more than 1.45 lakh units sold in March 2019. The company, however, said that sales during March 2020 were not comparable with that in March 2019 “due to the suspension of operations with effect from March 22, 2020, in line with national policy.”

Exports during the month also fell 55% to 4,712 units as against 10,463 units in March 2019. For the full year (2019-20), the company’s domestic vehicles sales fell 18.1% to 14.36 lakh units from the previous year.

Hyundai Motor India too saw a 40.6% decline in sales to 26,300 units in March in the domestic market.

Similarly, Mahindra and Mahindra sold 3,384 PVs in March 2020 in the domestic market, a decline of 88% from 27,646 units in the year-ago month. For fiscal year 2019-20, domestic PV sales fell 27% to 1.86 lakh.

Veejay Ram Nakra, CEO, Automotive Division, M&M Ltd. said, “Our performance in March has been muted on account of the impact of the current lockdown related to Covid-19 and the disruption in our BS-VI ramp-up plan. The latter was planned between February and March but was affected due to the challenges of parts supply from global and local suppliers. We have been able to clear our BS-IV inventory, but for fewer than 100 vehicles. However, there are many vehicles that are sold, but not yet registered because of the closure of RTOs.”

Relatively new entrant Kia Motors sold 8,583 units in the retail market in March 2020.

Naveen Soni, Senior VP, Sales and Service, Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM), said, “... last month has been very challenging for us, both in sales as well as production,” adding the pandemic has financially impacted all its dealerships across India. TKM reported a 55% decline in sales to 7023 vehicles in March in the domestic market. It added that March was the last month of production for the Etios series as well as the Corolla Altis.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/maruti-hyundai-sales-skid/article31230987.ece

33,2020/04/01,SBI eases settlement deadline by 3 months,"Concession follows 21-day lockdown

State Bank of India (SBI) has decided to extend the timeline for payment of settlement amount by three months due to the 21-day lockdown.

“SBI has come forward to extend the timeline for payment of settlement amount by three months. Now, customers, on-boarded under settlement scheme SBI OTS 2019 / Rin Samadhan 19-20/General compromise can meet payment obligation by June 30, 2020,” SBI said.

Under the One Time Settlement (OTS) 2019 scheme, the extension will be available only to those customers where the first two instalments of 5% / 15% and 20% / 25% have been received within the stipulated 30 and 60 days, respectively.

The balance OTS amount can be paid by June 30, it said, while adding it would not charge any interest on the amount for this extended period. Under the Rin Samadhan scheme, the timeline for receipt of acceptance of OTS proposal along with upfront payment from borrowers has been extended up to June 30, from the current March 31 and up to September 30 for recovery of the entire OTS amount.

“This will provide an extended opportunity to borrowers who are unable to visit branches owing to the lockdown,” SBI said.

Also, payment obligations for borrowers with outstanding as on March 01, 2020 under ‘General Compromise’ category has been extended by three months, without charging any interest for the additional period. On working capital loans, C.S. Setty, MD, SBI, said because firms have to pay interest on such loans at the end of the moratorium period, banks are evaluating the option of requesting the RBI for some relief in terms of asset classification. This is because these companies may not be in a position to repay immediately after the moratorium is lifted.

The RBI had allowed banks in respect of working capital facilities sanctioned in the form of cash credit or over draft to borrowers facing stress and said lenders may recalculate the ‘drawing power’ by reducing the margins or by reassessing the working capital cycle.

“This relief shall be available in respect of all such changes effected up to May 31, 2020 and shall be contingent on the lending institutions satisfying themselves that the same is necessitated on account of the economic fallout from COVID-19. Further, accounts provided relief under these instructions shall be subject to subsequent supervisory review with regard to their justifiability on account of the economic fallout from COVID-19,” the RBI had said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sbi-eases-settlement-deadline-by-3-months/article31230287.ece
34,2020/04/01,Sugar movement resumes,"No shortage of the essential commodity, assures ISMA

Movement of sugar, which was disrupted initially when the countrywide lockdown was implemented as a precaution against COVID-19, has resumed.

Dispatches have picked up in the last four or five days, according to the Indian Sugar Mills’ Association (ISMA).

The “ISMA has assured the government that there is enough sugar with the sugar mills, and therefore, there will not be any problem of availability of this essential food item for consumers,” the association said in a press statement on Wednesday.

As of March 31, 2020, 457 sugar mills, which started crushing this season — from October 2019 to September 2020 — have so far produced 232.74 lakh tonnes of sugar. This is nearly 64 lakh tonnes less than what was produced during the same period last year.

As many as 186 mills continued production, mainly in north India. The mills are taking efforts to ensure that wherever there is availability of sugarcane, it is procured and crushed so that farmers do not incur losses. During the first few days of the lockdown, there were also concerns about availability of inputs such as lime and sulphur.

The lime quarries and kilns in Rajasthan were closed down. This was taken up with the Rajasthan government and there is smooth availability of all inputs now, the ISMA said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/efhv3w/article31230275.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THBUSUGAR,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sugar-movement-resumes/article31230276.ece
35,2020/04/01,"SBI, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank activate moratorium","State Bank of India to reverse March EMI if already paid

State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender and private sector lenders ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank have started activating the loan repayment moratorium option for customers.

The moratorium was announced by the Reserve Bank of India last week in view of the financial stress faced by borrowers following the lockdown declared on account of the COVID-19 pandemic.

SBI customers who want to avail themselves of the moratorium, are required to send an email to avail the option. The email address will depend on the circle from where the customer has taken the loan. The email addresses of all the circles have been mentioned in the SBI website.“No action is required. They may continue to pay in usual course,” SBI said of customers who do not wish to avail the moratorium option.

SBI has also clarified that if a customer has already paid the EMI for March, then the amount will be reversed if the customer sends in a request. “Interest shall continue to accrue on the outstanding portion of the term loan during the moratorium period,” SBI said.

Commenting on impact in case of home loans if the EMI is deferred, SBI said that for a loan of ₹30 lakh with a remaining maturity of 15 years, the net additional interest would be about ₹2.34 lakh, which is equal to eight EMIs.

“For a loan of ₹6 lakh with a remaining maturity of 54 months, the additional interest payable would be ₹19,000 approximately. equal to additional 1.5 EMIs,” SBI said on the impact in the case of auto loans.

Both ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank have also activated the options in their websites to avail moratorium. Customers have to fill in a simple form giving loan account numbers and other details to avail themselves of the moratorium.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/7ey9gj/article31230273.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THBUSBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sbi-hdfc-bank-icici-bank-activate-moratorium/article31230274.ece
36,2020/04/01,March GST revenue drops below ₹1 lakh cr.,"COVID-19 impact to be seen from Apr.

Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections for March 2020 stood at ₹97,597 crore, dropping below the ₹1 lakh-crore mark after four months.

Gross GST revenue for the month was 8% lower than that of March 2019, according to Finance Ministry data released on Wednesday.

For the full financial year 2019-20, gross GST collections grew 4% in comparison to the previous year.

As the March revenue collections are based on the business conducted in February, these figures do not take into account the full impact of COVID-19 and the consequent shutdown of many business sectors in India. Analysts warn that next month’s revenues are likely to dip much further.

Although GST revenue from domestic transactions dropped 4% in comparison with March 2019, there was a 23% fall in the tax collected on import of goods. “Global trade was affected by COVID-19 in February itself, so we could be seeing the result of that,” said Sachin Menon, national head, indrect taxes, KPMG in India.

There has also been a sharp 7% decline in the filing of February GSTR-3B returns, with only 76.5 lakh returns being filed till March 31 in comparison with the more than 83 lakh filed in the previous two months. “It seems that many businesses may not have been able to pay GST because of the liquidity issues being faced after the lockdown,” said Pratik Jain, partner and indirect tax leader at PwC India.

The situation is likely to worsen. “With most businesses being non-operational for a considerable period in March and the relaxation of delayed payments allowed, collections in the coming quarter would see quite a fall,” said Abhishek Jain, tax partner at Ernst and Young. Small businesses have been allowed a three-month deferment of GST payments due to the COVID-19 situation, and there is a wider industry demand for a moratorium on payments and reduction in rates.

“At this stage, it is necessary for businesses to conserve cash in order to enable resumption of operations once the lockdown ends. Any deferral of the GST payment timelines by a few months would significantly assist them in this process,” said M.S. Mani, partner, Deloitte India.

Of the total collections, central GST stood at ₹19,183 crore, State GST atwas ₹25,601 crore and integrated GST atwas ₹44,508 crore. Cess stood at ₹8,306 crore. The government had settled ₹19,718 crore to CGST and ₹14,915 crore to SGST from IGST as regular settlement. In addition, the Centre also apportioned unsettled balance IGST of ₹6,000 crore on an ad-hoc basis in a 50:50 ratio between the Centre and States.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/vpuerb/article31230663.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1PNG,https://www.thehindu.com/business/march-gst-revenue-drops-below-1-lakh-cr/article31230254.ece

In terms of angel investments, the State saw eight deals in the first three months of 2020 when compared to four deals during the same period last year

“The COVID-19 related lockdown and related stock market mayhem has brought new PE-VC investment activity to a virtual standstill towards the end of the quarter,” noted Arun Natarajan, founder, Venture Intelligence. “Until there is better clarity on the still unfolding health crisis, most investors are likely to focus their energies on existing portfolio companies and be very selective in making new investments,” he added.

44,2020/04/01,What is the real estate industry doing to help their migrant labour workforce?,"What developers are doing to help the migrant workers who dominate the industry

Our newsfeeds are flooded with videos and articles about migrant workers walking over a 100 km a day to reach their respective hometowns. The suspension of trains and buses and the sealing of State borders has left several thousands stranded across the country. Which industries do these labourers mainly service?

Real estate is the third largest sector after agriculture and manufacturing to use migrant labour. Says Prashant Thakur, Director & Head – Research, Anarock Property Consultants: “Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and Tamil Nadu account for more than half of the country’s total construction employment.” As per the National Skill Development Council, the workforce employed by the construction and real estate sector is expected to grow to 76 million by 2022.

In the light of the lockdown, it is time to ask what industry bodies and developers are doing for their workers. “Due to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 crisis, developers have been caught off guard and are unprepared to deal with the situation. However, many branded developers and major players are stepping forward with plans and policies to deal with this unforeseen situation,” says Thakur.

Keeping a check

Niranjan Hiranandani, National President of the National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO), says, “All industry bodies have communicated to their members the seriousness of the pandemic’s challenges and promised to assist migrant labourers as they are the most vulnerable.” But, in the given scenario, he adds, “we need to factor in that workers opting to move away from the sites to return to their villages is adding to the issue”.

Arun Mn, Founder and Managing Director, Casagrand, explains that on-site accommodation and a daily food allowance is being provided to all the migrant labourers he employs. “Basic sanitation facilities and wash areas have also been provided. We have arranged isolation rooms in each camp in case a need arises,” he says. Migrant workers make up 80% of his total worker strength of 4,700. “50% of these workers are from Bihar, followed by Odisha (18%), West Bengal (15%), Uttar Pradesh (8%), Madhya Pradesh (6%), Jharkhand (2%) and Andhra Pradesh (1%).”

Official guidelines (BOCW Act and Govt.) 1. Collection of full labour / staff details and educating them about Covid-19, and taking necessary precautions

Official directives

On March 23, the Directorate of Industrial Safety and Health sent out a circular instructing employers of Building and Other Construction Works (BOCW) establishments to comply with the provisions of the BOCW Act 1996 and the Inter-State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Condition of Service) Act of 1979. The Act states that food, medical care and suitable accommodation, with separate space for cooking, bathing, washing and lavatory facilities are to be provided on-site or at a designated space nearby.

It also states that when more than 250 workers are employed and when more than 100 inter-State migrant workers are employed, canteen facilities must be provided. The rules also say that the contractor must ensure suitable and adequate medical facilities and preventive measures against epidemics and virus infections: ‘The entire cost on treatment, hospital charges and the travel expenses from hospital to resident shall be borne by the contractor’.

According to S. Sridharan, chairman of the Tamil Nadu chapter, the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI) has sent directives to its builder members. They are required to provide workers with food and other essentials. “This is a tough time for the industry, and we have seen to it that all members are complying with the directives. Food and provisions are being supplied to labourers on-site and to those in camps. We have also intervened with contractors to ensure the supplies reach them,” he says.

Cess funds

The Cess Act requires the construction industry to pay 1% of the total cost of their project towards the welfare of the labourers.

“It is difficult to say how many have followed this directive but, on the ground, several developers are trying to do their bit,” says Thakur of Anarock. “Builders across cities are providing grains, pulses, vegetables, drinking water and milk. In many cases, building sites and camps housing workers are being fumigated and sanitised.”

On-ground

According to Chitty Babu, Chairman and CEO of Akshaya, the 679 workers he employs have been sent to 10 labour colonies in Chennai and one in Trichy. “We have been sensitising them on the issue and taking precautionary measures on-site as well. Accommodation, food, access to toilets and drinking water is being provided. We have ambulance and medical facilities as well.”

Other builders say they are taking similar measures. If that is the case, what explains the mass exodus of labourers across States? “The lapses have happened in a few parts of the country and need to be dealt with severely,” said one industry source.",real estate,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dni623/article31226952.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/COVIDLOCKDOWN1,https://www.thehindu.com/real-estate/what-builders-are-doing-to-help-migrant-workers-during-the-covid-crisis/article31226959.ece
45,2020/04/01,Coronavirus | India welcomes foreign contributions to PM-CARES,"Individuals and organisations can pitch in.

India welcomes foreign contributions to the PM-CARES fund to fight the threat posed by the novel coronavirus, a source said here on Wednesday.

The official highlighted the shortage of ventilators and personal protective equipment for medical professionals, which needs to be addressed urgently.

“The pandemic is unprecedented. In view of this, India has taken a decision to accept foreign contributions to the PM-CARES fund,” said a source, elaborating on India’s plans to deal with the crisis.

The PM-CARES fund, a public charitable trust, was set up in response to the emerging requirement for resources to defeat the infection. “Contributions to the trust can be made by individuals and organisations, both in India and abroad,” said the source familiar with India’s plans to deal with the crisis.

The official described the shortage of ventilators and personal protective equipment as “acute”, which prompted Indian diplomatic teams to look for reliable supplies from different parts of the world. “We are working with our ambassadors to deal with the huge shortage of ventilators and other equipment,” the official said. The issue of shortage also featured at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s video discussion with 130 Indian envoys on March 30.

The official pointed out that a bulk of the equipment and relief materials are flowing in through independent organisations as special contributions, while the government is purchasing the items that are in short supply in the Indian health care sector.

The issue of the short supply of essential items made the headlines after nurses and doctors sent video messages to Mr. Modi, urging for lifesaving devices. However, at the last weekend, Serbia purchased medical items from India, prompting a debate. The official, however, clarified that the supplies to the Serbian government did not include the prohibited items.

Along with the other countries of the SAARC region, India has set up the SAARC-COVID-19 Emergency Fund for helping the front-line health workers with the personal protective equipment. Mr. Modi took up similar issues and urged for a global approach at a videoconference with G20 leaders.

The official indicated that India would be open to having the issue discussed at the United Nations Security Council. “However, it is a matter to be taken up by the members of the Security Council,” he said.

As the situation is still uncertain, the Board has not announced fresh dates for the rescheduled examinations. Instead, it promised to give students, schools and all stakeholders at least 10 days notice as and when it is in a position to hold the examinations again.

The examination schedule was disrupted when the Board took the precautionary measure of halting examinations from March 19, even before the lockdown was announced.

Two subjects

At that point, Class 10 students had almost completed their exams, with only two subjects — Information and Communication Technology, and Computer Applications — remaining. Both of those exams will not be held now, and the Board said it would provide alternative instructions for assessing those students.

There are difficulties in accessing some parts of the country due to large distances involved, suspension of public transport services and inter-provincial lock down,” the MEA report, which was reproduced in the Supreme Court order, said.

250 have tested positive

The report was submitted before a Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud in response to a writ petition filed by relatives of pilgrims stranded at Qom in Iran. The relatives had asked the court to direct the government to look after the pilgrims’ welfare and evacuate them in the wake of Corona virus spread.

Opinion | Beyond social distancing to fight COVID-19

But the government, represented by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, submitted that 250 pilgrims in Qom have tested positive for COVID-19 and, in some cases, relatives accompanying them, though Corona negative, have opted to stay back to take care of them.

“The status report [of the MEA] indicates that the Union Government will, in due course, facilitate their safe repatriation to India, consistent with its overall approach to prevent, control and contain the spread of COVID-19 within India,” the 10-page court order said.

Senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, for the relatives who hail from Leh, however, submitted that many of the pilgrims in Qom may now be asymptomatic and would be in a position to return. He suggested that the Union Government may consider arranging a special flight for the return of the 250 pilgrims, but they may be quarantined on returning home.

Court satisfied

However, the court expressed satisfaction with the government’s assurance that the welfare and safety of the stranded pilgrims in Qom would be taken care of by the Embassy there.

“We expect that the issue of repatriation of these pilgrims will be actively considered by the Union Government at the appropriate stages in terms of the assurance provided in the status report. The proactive steps taken by the Indian Embassy in Iran under the auspices of the Ministry of External Affairs need to be commended,” the Supreme Court recorded.

But at times he begins to wonder if the Lord, who is free from partiality, is also overtly favourable to the devas. He raises this doubt to Suka after listening to the Vritrasura episode, said Sri B. Sundarkumar in a discourse. Vritra is a ferocious asura but is also a devotee of the Lord. Then why did the Lord not protect him against Indra who defeated him? Suka points out that the Lord transcends all gunas and is free from all passions and partialities commonly found in jivatmas. But He assumes the power of Yogamaya by which He is manifest as the two opposing forces. He is reflected in the attributes of Prakriti like the sun reflected in water and fire in fuel. But He is the master of the gunas. By His Sankalpa He can create into existence everything through the instruments of Prakriti and Purusha.

He also gives them His manifestation called Time. When Time favours satva, He allies with the satva dominated devas and destroys their enemies, the asuras. Then Suka recalls the strange incident of Sisupala’s salvation that everyone present at the Rajasuya Yaga conducted by Yudhishtira witnessed with wonder and amazement. Was not this Sisupala a sworn enemy of Krishna? To understand the rationale of this, one has to go back to their previous lives, their actions, behaviour, etc. Jaya and Vijaya who were in the exclusive and exalted service of the Lord at Vaikunta as gatekeepers had to be born on earth as asuras for three births before they could attain the Lord.

Each individual is repeatedly born in many spheres being driven by the force of karma and in this way involvement in samsara continues as a chain reaction. He has to face the consequences of karma in every birth until salvation.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/free-from-partiality/article31230196.ece
59,2020/04/01,Coronavirus | Delhi to pay ₹1 crore ex-gratia to kin of front-line personnel,"After an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that if anybody loses their life while serving any COVID-19 patient, be it sanitation workers, doctors, nurses or any other staff, temporary or permanent, from government or private sector, their next of kin would be given ₹1 crore as a mark of respect for their service.

Mr. Kejriwal announced the honorary compensation while holding a video conference with Delhi government’s medical staff on COVID-19 duty. He said the scheme, which had been created for the families of soldiers from the national capital who were martyred, had now been extended to include medical staff who were on the front line fighting the virus and putting their lives at risk in order to save others.

“Your contribution is no less than a soldier’s... if any healthcare personnel, including government or private doctor, nurse and sanitation worker, dies while serving coronavirus patients, the government will give ₹1 crore for their families,” he said.

The CM thanked the medical staff on behalf of the people of Delhi and people from across India for the service they were providing in helping to fight the virus. “Doctors, nurses, paramedic staff and cleaning staff, and all those involved in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, I want to thank all of you for serving the people in these times of distress. I do not think a disease, a pandemic of this stature, has ever hit mankind. The most developed nations of the world, like the U.S.A., the U.K., Italy, Spain, and Germany, have been struggling with COVID-19. Despite having the most developed healthcare... these nations are not able to cope up with the pandemic,” Mr. Kejriwal observed.

The CM assured the medical staff that if there was anything they needed to help them do their job better, the government would do its best to provide it. “I want to assure the doctors that the government is with you. We will provide all the required monetary assistance and resources to you. We are also procuring food from the five-star hotels for all the staff, and we have arranged a stay for the doctors in the five-star hotel. I am personally pursuing the supply of sufficient PPE for the doctors. I am in touch with suppliers, manufacturers. I have also requested industrialists to donate PPEs for the doctors, instead of the donation in the CM’s relief fund,” Mr. Kejriwal added.

60,2020/04/01,Coronavirus | Baby out of quarantine in Srinagar,"Seven-month-old boy among 236 released after compulsory 14-day stay

In a glimmer of hope, more than 230 locals, including a seven-month-old baby, were discharged from administrative quarantine centres in Kashmir on Wednesday after two weeks of compulsory isolation. Meanwhile, seven more people tested positive for COVID-19, taking the total figure to 62 in J&K.

Travelling with his wife and two children, Mudasir Ahmad Bhat, a resident of Sundoo village in Kulgam, said he was frightened when he heard the announcement made on March 19 as their flight landed at the Srinagar airport.

“It was after eight months me and my family were returning home from Leh. It took us time to absorb the announcement made about our quarantine. I was not carrying enough clothes and blankets. I was worried about my seven-month-old son Zaid Mudasir and seven-year-old daughter. Thankfully, we had a comfortable stay. Our seven-month-old son became everyone’s favourite on our discharge day on Wednesday for being the youngest quarantined person,” Mr. Bhat told The Hindu.

“We ensured that the baby, for being the youngest in quarantine, is well fed and attended on time. ,” said Mir Manzoor, executive magistrate at Srinagar’s Silver Star Hotel, where 56 people travelling from Leh were quarantined since March 19. “ We have advised all these discharged families to spend two more weeks in home quarantine so that the chain is broken further. None of the quarantined persons have tested positive during their stay,” added Mr. Manzoor.

Meanwhile, an official said 236 people had been shifted from the administrative quarantine centres after successfully completing their 14-day period. An official said none of them showed any symptoms of COVID-19 during their stay. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines, many people who are infected by the virus that causes COVID-19 show symptoms within two weeks and need to be put in isolation.

“These locals were kept in well-equipped hotels and government accommodations. They had come from COVID-19 affected parts of the country and overseas,” said additional deputy commissioner, Srinagar, M. Haneef Balkhi. “Today, special buses were provided to them to reach their districts,” he added.

Another batch of 370 people will complete their quarantine on Thursday.

Seven test positive

Meanwhile, seven more patients tested positive for COVID-19, taking the total number of cases to 62.

“Of 62 cases in J&K, 58 are active cases,” said Rohit Kansal, Principal Secretary (Planning). “While 58 of the active cases have been reported in Kashmir division, 10 are in Jammu. Around 17,041 people are under active surveillance,” he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6bhzlv/article31230143.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01THLTKASHMIRYOUNGESTPATIENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/baby-out-of-quarantine-in-srinagar/article31230144.ece
61,2020/04/01,Coronavirus | States warned against lockdown exemptions,"Centre says it violates lockdown

Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla on Wednesday wrote another letter to the States cautioning that “some States are allowing exceptions beyond what has been allowed under lockdown measures by the MHA [Ministry of Home Affairs].”

Mr. Bhalla said the exceptions amounts to violation of the lockdown measures under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and might defeat the overall objective of containing the spread of COVID-19.

On March 24, when the 21-day lockdown was announced, the Ministry issued a slew of guidelines to be followed by the States for “containment of COVID-19 epidemic”, and asked all “enforcing authorities to note that these strict restrictions fundamentally relate to movement of people, but not to that of essential goods.”

Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy contributed a month’s salary to the Prime Minister-CARE fund that has been set up to collect money to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.

Mr. Reddy also allocated ₹1 crore from his MPLAD fund to the PM-CARE account.

Portal to verify facts

Mr. Bhalla wrote another letter to States based on observations made by the Supreme Court while hearing a petition on relief measures for migrants who were seen walking to their home States from place of their work in different parts of the country amidst the ongoing lockdown. He said the Centre is creating a web portal where “people can verify facts and unverified news promptly”. He asked the States/UTs to create similar mechanism and send action taken report to MHA as next date of hearing in Supreme Courtis April 7. The web portal comes in the wake of a Supreme Court directive on March 31 that migration of labourers was triggered by panic created by fake news that lockdown will continue for more than three months.

62,2020/04/01,"Coronavirus | Lockdown’s impact can be gauged only after two weeks, say experts","As incubation period is 14 days, the cases emerging now are older and they have to be discounted.

The impact of the lockdown could be gauged only after two weeks, government as well as independent experts suggest.

On the evening of March 24, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide 21-day lockdown to arrest “community transmission” of the coronavirus. Between March 24 and April 1, the number of COVID-19 positive cases has more than doubled — from 606 on March 25 to 1,637 on April 1. This, however, was slower — about half the rate of growth from the week before when only 151 cases were confirmed on March 18.

Coronavirus | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

The growth in positive cases in India is slower than many countries that are dealing with the worst of the pandemic. On March 8, the United States recorded 541 cases in two days, and the figure nearly doubled to 994 cases. In the last week, however, it has increased 75%.

Indonesia, which as on March 31 had 1,528 cases — and therefore roughly in the league of India — is also following a similar growth rate. It had 686 cases on March 24 or a little less than half the cases from today. Though it has laws restricting movement, there is no lockdown.

Government experts as well as independent researchers concur that it is early to estimate the impact of the lockdown on slowing down the spread of the virus. “The incubation period of the virus is 14 days. Therefore, the cases we are seeing are older cases (from before March 24). So only once these old cases are discounted can we judge the impact of the lockdown. Whatever models and statisticians say, nobody can really predict the outcome of the epidemic,” Raman Gangakhedkar, ICMR’s chief scientist and spokesperson for COVID-19 communication, said at a press briefing.

Coronavirus | India sees a sharp spike in infections

Sujatha Rao, formerly Secretary of the Health Ministry, tweeted on Tuesday: “Impact of lock down can only be known after 5th April. Today’s infections are of the situation two weeks ago.” However both of these reflect the extreme outer limit of the incubation period — defined as the time taken to contract the virus and an infected person manifesting symptoms. The World Health Organization says incubation is commonly of 5 days, with 1-14 days being the range.

Coronavirus India lockdown Day 8 updates | Helpline numbers

Giridhar Babu, an epidemiologist and physician associated with the Public Health Foundation of India, said it would take a minimum of three weeks and a lockdown would be useful only with heightened testing, particularly to catch those who might be carrying the virus but were not yet manifesting symptoms. “Lockdown alone, without an increase in finding the new cases either through syndromic approach or increased rate of testing, is not enough to break the chain. Also reviewing of the States with silent areas [where very few cases are reported] is important as is contact-tracing of all those people who might have got the infection,” he said in an email.

63,2020/04/01,SC adjourns plea seeking declaration of financial emergency due to coronavirus lockdown,"Apex court said the petition would be taken up for hearing after the court resumes its normal functioning

The Supreme Court on Wednesday adjourned a petition for issuing directions to the government to declare national financial emergency under Article 360 in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

A Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao said the petition would be taken up for hearing after the court resumes its normal functioning. As of now, limited Benches are hearing extremely urgent cases through videoconferencing.

The petition filed by the think-tank, Centre for Accountability and Systemic Change (CASC), represented by advocate Virag Gupta, said the declaration was necessary to prevent any arbitrary action by the authorities.

“Almost all the fundamental rights such as freedom of movement, most rights under Article 21 and various other fundamental rights have been practically suspended during this lockdown. The general public is not having access to the newspapers, which is happening for the first time after Independence. The closure of courts affects the right to get justice. It is submitted that this requires the imposition of emergency as per the Constitution, and not an order under the Disaster Management Act, 2005,” the petition said.

The petition stated that this was the biggest emergency in independent India and it must be addressed as per constitutional provisions through unified command between Central and State governments.

65,2020/04/01,Mass nesting of Olive Ridley turtles draws to a close at Rushikulya,"The Forest Department has commenced measures to protect the eggs from predators, and human intervention

Although sporadic nesting still continues, mass nesting of Olive Ridley turtles has ended at the Rushikulya rookery on the Odisha coast.

Berhampur Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Amlan Nayak said 3,23,063 mother Olive Ridley turtles nested this year at the major nesting site. The mass nesting process began in the wee hours of March 21 and continued till the night of March 28.

The total number of turtles nesting at the Rushikulya rookery coast this year will be higher than the enumerated mass nesting number. The sporadic nesting that occurred before the start of the mass nesting process, and the nesting that is continuing after it, are not included in the numbers under mass nesting, said the DFO.

Day-time nesting

This year, Olive Ridley turtles displayed the unusual phenomenon of day-time nesting at the Rushikulya rookery on March 21. This was last seen at the beach in 2013.

Most Olive Ridley turtles near this coast have already begun their return journey, which can be several hundreds of kilometres long. Tracking in the past has shown that some of the turtles arrive for nesting at Rushikulya from far away places such as the coast of Sri Lanka.

A small number of turtles are still to be seen near the Rushikulya rookery. They may opt for sporadic nesting over the next few days.

Mother Olive Ridleys lay eggs in nests dug up in the beach sand. Each nest on average contains around 100 eggs. The eggs hatch in about 45 days. The incubation period gets lengthened by a few days if the temperature of the sand is lowered by climatic changes such as rain.

Keeping watch

The Forest Department has commenced measures to protect the eggs from predators, and human intervention. Metal net fencing has been set up over 5 km from Gokharkuda to Bateswar, and the area that has been divided into 50 segments for regular watching.

Eggs collected from Olive Ridley nests outside the mass nesting region are being safely incubated in six artificial hatcheries established at Rushikulya, said Mr. Nayak.

No one other than pre-identified local volunteers and forest officials is allowed on the beach, as the fragile eggs can break if stepped upon. The ongoing lockdown has eased the work for forest officials in this regard. Nevertheless, along with the help of the local police, a strict watch is being kept at places like Bateswar, Gokharkuda and Purunabnadh, from where humans are known to enter the mass nesting beach.

Mass nesting has occurred at the Rushikulya rookery after a gap of one year. In 2019, mass nesting did not take place on this coast. But in 2018, the unusual phenomenon of double mass nesting was observed between February and April, with the total nesting figures rising over 4,73,000 then.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mass-nesting-of-olive-ridley-turtles-draws-to-a-close-at-rushikulya/article31229886.ece

The Supreme Court on Wednesday did not intervene in a plea for bail filed by Augusta Westland VVIP chopper scam accused Christian Michel James.

The accused had said he was vulnerable to COVID-19 infection while in custody as an undertrial.

A Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud asked Michel to first present his bail plea before the Delhi High Court. The accused had cited the recent order passed by the Supreme Court to de-congest crowded prisons in a bid to stop infection from spreading within and from prisons.

“The agedness and a pre-existing ill state of health will make the applicant’s (Michel) body more susceptible to the infection than any other ordinary prisoner with a normal health condition,” Michel argued in his plea.

Michel, an alleged middleman arrested in 2018, had earlier moved the Delhi High Court seeking interim bail citing the risk of infection from inside Tihar Jail. He had then moved the apex court seeking the same relief saying that the High Court had been unable to accord hearing on his interim bail plea.

The regular bail plea of Michel, who is in judicial custody since January 5, 2019, is also pending before the High Court.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to urgently hear a petition filed by activists Harsh Mander and Anjali Bhardwaj that the declaration of the 21-day national lockdown without prior information “precipitated an unprecedented humanitarian crisis” for migrant workers, resulting in their mass exodus to their home towns.

The petition said the lockdown caused widespread panic across the country and led to job loss for millions of migrant workers. It was mentioned by advocate Prashant Bhushan before a Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao, which agreed to take up the plea when the court assembles next.

Also read | Pay advance wages to workers registered under MGNREGA, Sonia tells govt.

The petition wants the Centre and States to jointly and severally ensure payment of wages/ minimum wages to migrant workers within a week, whether employed by other establishments, contractors or self-employed, as they are unable to work and earn wages, during the period of the lockdown. It also sought a direction from the court to Central and State governments to immediately activate the National and State Advisory Committees of experts in the field of disaster management and public health to prepare national and State disaster management plans for dealing with COVID-19.

“The order, for which no prior intimation was given, created a panic across the country and led to the instantaneous loss of jobs and wages of millions of migrant workers employed in establishments across India or self-employed as street vendors, rickshaw pullers, domestic house helps, petty job workers, etc. This led to the large scale exodus of these migrant workers to their home towns,” the petition said.

“The lockdown has precipitated an unprecedented humanitarian crisis especially among the class of migrant workers and it is the government, both Central and State, that have to take adequate measures in accordance with National and State plans drawn out under the Disaster Management Act, 2005,” the petition said.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

The petition has been filed even as the Centre maintains that fake information about the lockdown created the panic.

The petition said the declaration spread panic to such an extent that “migrant workers crowded in large numbers of many thousands at bus terminals, railway stations, inter-State borders, etc to find their way home, potentially exposing them to the virus and escalating, in fact, the risk of the spread of this virus”.

Mr. Mander and Ms. Bhardwaj criticised the Ministry of Home Affairs communication that employers should continue to pay the wages to their workers. They said the communication does not take into account the harsh realities that establishments which employ migrant workers are mostly small themselves and can ill-afford to pay their wages during a lockdown.

Two Left parties slammed the BJP for allegedly propagating the narrative of “criminalisation and “communalisation” of the Tablighi Jamaat gathering in Nizammuddin, which has emerged as the hotspot of COVID-19.

CPI general secretary D. Raja said, “There is an attempt to make even the fight against Coronavirus into a Hindu-Muslim issue. It began with re-telecast of Ramayana and Mahabharata and now singling out one community for the spread of the virus. A health calamity of gigantic proportions should not be reduced into a communal issue.”

Mr. Raja urged the government to increase the testing facilities and making it far less restrictive to assess the actual spread of the virus. “This is a humanitarian disaster and not a time to rake up religion in it,” he said.

The CPI(ML) said the government was trying to divert people’s attention from its by drawing the Hindu-Muslim binary. “It is clear that the Central government had the power and responsibility to screen foreign visitors into the country for the virus, and also to issue clear advisories prohibiting large gatherings. It failed to do so,” it said in a statement here.

Till mid-March, the Centre was denying that COVID-19 represented a health emergency and accusing the Opposition politicians raising concern over the virus of “panicmongering.” Instead of regulating crowds, the BJP was busy promoting the visit of U.S. President Donald Trump and warnings by Opposition leaders in early February were ignored, the party alleged.

India is looking at South Korea, Germany and China for procurement of cutting-edge technology and adopting best practices being followed by them in successfully containing the spread of coronavirus amid looming risk of the country entering the community infection stage of the pandemic.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

Indian missions in these three countries have been tasked to immediately identifying possible areas of cooperation and engage with relevant authorities for procurement of medical equipment and technology.

The move comes as India saw rapid increase in number of positive coronavirus cases in the last few days.

The need for looking at best practices, innovations, scientific breakthroughs and medical equipment to fight the pandemic was highlighted extensively by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a video conference he held with heads of 130 Indian missions on Monday.

Government officials said India is specifically looking at South Korea’s approach of widespread testing and significant use of digital tracking of suspected cases to contain the pandemic.

The South Korean model of ‘trace, test and treat strategy’ has received global recognition. Unlike majority of the countries dealing with the pandemic, South Korea has not resorted to any lockdown and allowed business and economic activities to go on as usual.

As China managed to flatten the curve of new infections after reporting over 80,000 cases and 3,300 deaths, India is also looking at China along with a very few other countries to procure medical equipment and technology to cater to expanding demand of medical infrastructure across the country.

“We have to prepare for the future requirement. That is why we are scouting global markets for best available technology and medical equipment,” said an official.

The Indian embassy in Beijing has been tasked to coordinate with relevant authorities in China for procurement of medical equipment.

On multiple occasions, China said that it was ready to extend possible assistance to India in dealing with the pandemic.

Officials said India is in touch with a number of suppliers in China for immediate procurement of 10,000 ventilators.

India has recorded over 1,600 positive cases of coronavirus and at least 38 deaths so far. Globally, the virus has infected more than 850,000 people and claimed around 42,000 lives.

Officials said India is also examining Germany’s efforts to check the pandemic. The leading European nation has asked several of its car manufacturers to produce ventilators and other medical equipment to deal with rising cases of the infection.

The Indian envoy in Washington is coordinating with the Trump administration for cooperation in laboratory tests for the virus infection, sources said.

External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke over phone to discuss a coordinated effort by India and the U.S. to respond to the pandemic.

Earlier on March 14, the two top diplomats discussed ways in which India and the U.S. could cooperate to address this global challenge.

400 Indians stranded in Nepal

Meanwhile, around 400 Indian nationals, who gathered from different parts of Nepal to return to India, have been stranded in Birgunj area in Parsa due to the closure of the India-Nepal border.

According to Parsa’s Superintendent of Police (SP) Ganga Panta, the huge mass of Indian citizens heading towards India via border in Parsa have been kept in an education faculty building.

It was around mid-January that Dr. Anushri Mukhopadhyay, a Goa-based ENT (ear, nose and throat) surgeon, who had taken up a teaching assignment at a Chinese university only months earlier, returned home on a scheduled break.

By then, COVID-19 cases had begun to be reported from China but it was still not thought of as a pandemic. Soon, humankind was to find itself in the grip of an unprecedented health crisis and today, parts of the world, including India, are under a lockdown. But one thing continues as normal: Dr. Mukhopadhyay’s classes in China.

A host of apps

She is conducting her classes not in China, of course, but from the confines of her home in Goa - via a host of apps. “The college reopened on February 24 as scheduled and I was on the first lecture at 9 a.m. Beijing Time, which was 6.30 a.m. IST,” Dr. Mukhopadhyay, who teaches at the International Medical School at Chengdu city in the Sichuan province of China, told The Hindu.

“After a few days of unhindered lectures on the app Rain Classroom, I was forced to shift to another app called Zoom because traffic [on the former] seemed heavy and my signal in Goa was unstable too, at times. But Rain Classroom has features like roll calls and setting MCQ (multiple choice questions), which makes the experience worth the effort,” she said.

Access anytime

“All the apps are synced with WeChat. The lessons get published automatically on it for future retrieval. Students who cannot attend a class can also access them later - that’s the best part. I am also using an electronic board to write and draw diagrams, which fills the absence of a blackboard quite conveniently,” said Dr. Mukhopadhyay, who teaches regional anatomy, genetics, medical ethics, radio-imaging and biostatistics at the university.

She teaches two batches of students, one with 38 students and another with 68. They are drawn from various countries across the world, including India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Indonesia, Nigeria, Guyana and South African.

“Overall the situation is making me tech-savvy too. I recently purchased a Nikon Z50 to make video lectures. I miss cadaveric dissection though!” she said.

A virtual future

And so, the show goes on - the teacher teaches and the students learn - even as panic grips many pockets in the world. It is quite likely that many universities are doing the same, and who knows? Going ahead, this may just become the norm, with technology wiping out geographical distances and time zones.

“Classroom teaching is still the gold standard. But as Tao philosophy says, when winds of change blow, some people build walls and others build windmills. I can say with conviction that future learning and teaching is going to be virtual,” said Dr. Mukhopadhyay.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fytvmj/article31227559.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHENGDUKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/for-this-indian-doctor-classes-in-china-go-on-as-usual/article31227560.ece

77,2020/04/01,"Pay advance wages to workers registered under MGNREGA, Sonia tells govt.","Party slams cut in interest rates on small savings and the Public Provident Fund

Congress president Sonia Gandhi wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday to consider paying advance wages to workers who are registered under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA).

Ms. Gandhi’s letter to Mr. Modi, third since the announcement of the lockdown, came a day before the Congress Working Committee (CWC) would have its first ever video-conference meet to discuss the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Stating that the MGNREGA has been a critical lifeline for the rural poor during economic distress, Ms. Gandhi said, “Devoid of an alternative source of income, an increasingly large number of the rural poor are expected to demand work under MGNREGA.

“However, social distancing norms have rendered all work unfeasible during the lockdown. Furthermore, even after the works commence, the MGNREGA workers have to wait for more than a month to receive wages. Given the urgency of providing income support to the rural poor, due to lost wages, the government may consider immediate advance payment of wages for 21 days to registered and active MGNREGA workers.”

The Congress president suggested that the advance wages can be adjusted against the work to be done after the MGNREGA sites are opened up for regular work.

The party slammed the government for reducing the interest rates on small savings and the Public Provident Fund (PPF) amid fear of income loss because of the pandemic.

In a series of tweets, former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said it may be technically correct but the timing is wrong.

“In times of acute distress and uncertainty about income, people depend on the interest income on their savings,” Mr. Chidambaram said, demanding a roll back.

The government must reconsider immediately and restore old rates until June 30. I know that sometimes government acts on stupid advice, but I am amazed how stupid this advice was!” he said.

At the official online briefing, spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill said the decision is a warrant of loss to approximately 30 crore depositos.

The Congress on Wednesday termed the cut in interest rates on small savings as a heartless and shameful act, and demanded its immediate rollback.

Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill said the reduction in interest rates on small savings is irrational, illogical and ill-timed as it has come at a time when the people are already facing hardship due to the lockdown and the economic recession.

The 21-day lockdown was imposed in the country from March 25 to check the spread of the novel coronavirus.

He also demanded that the government waive interest on EMIs for the three-month period from March to June, saying the moratorium in EMIs is merely hogwash and a postponing exercise.

The Congress leader also demanded that the government comes out with a second tranche of economic relief packages to help small and medium enterprises, and the poor and common people from the economic downturn the country is facing.

“The BJP government’s decision to cut interest rates on small saving schemes is a heartless and shameful act that will hit the common people, especially the farmers, middle class and the poor who are already suffering due to the downturn in the economy,” Mr. Shergill told reporters at a press conference held through video conferencing.

“The decision to reduce interest rates on small savings is ill-timed, illogical and irrational,” he said, adding that it will snatch the incomes of 90 crore people in the country.

Mr. Shergill said the government will earn an additional ₹26,000 crore through this reduction in interest rates and said it should not act like “Sherlock to extract a pound of flesh from the people”.

Tablighi Jamaat, a global evangelical Muslim organisation conducted a meeting in Malaysia in February 2020, when travel restrictions due to the outbreak of COVID-19 were not in place in India. A March 3 New York Times report stated that this meeting had become the “largest viral vector in Southeast Asia”.

“More than 620 people connected to the four-day conclave have tested positive in Malaysia, prompting the country to seal its borders until the end of the month. Most of the 73 coronavirus cases in Brunei are tied to the gathering, as are 10 cases in Thailand. At least three coronavirus deaths have been linked to the event,” stated the report.

The same organisation which held a gathering in Delhi’s Nizamuddin markaz (centre) now sees a number of its members test positive for the viral disease. Preachers and people from Malaysia and Indonesia are said to have been at Nizamuddin for this congregation. This led to the area being sealed by the Delhi authorities. The event in Delhi was from March 10-13. The Union Health Ministry on March 13 said that coronavirus is not an emergency and people need not panic. The WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.

After a 36-hour-long operation, 2,631 members were evacuated from the Delhi centre and shifted to hospitals for quarantine.

10 people who took part in the prayer meeting have died from the disease, with Telangana alone identifying six such deaths. In Delhi alone, 24 people who were at the event have tested positive. Multiple States are now tracking down those who attended the gathering to quarantine them and later test them for coronavirus.

In Karnataka, 78 people belonging to Tablighi Jamaat have been quarantined, and efforts are on to find around 300 people who went to Delhi. Three persons in Puducherry have been isolated.

On the Telangana-Maharashtra border, authorities have stopped 32 passengers returning from the event in a lorry. This group had reportedly visited Ajmer in Rajasthan after attending the meeting. The Telangana police have launched a massive exercise to track down returnees from Nizamuddin. 70 people in Rayalaseema have been quarantined, while 40 have been sent to isolation wards in Visakhapatnam.

In Pune, already a COVID-19 hotspot, 182 persons have been identified as having been to the conclave in Nizamuddin.

At least 25 persons from Kerala had attended the four-day meeting, of which 10 have returned to Kerala and been quarantined by the State government.

Health authorities in Tamil Nadu are tracking down around 1,500 people who were at the Delhi conference. 57 of those who have been tracked down so far have tested positive.

The first COVID-19 death in Jammu & Kashmir was of a man who attended the congregation. This person, a Srinagar-based businessman who attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Nizamuddin travelled by air, train and road to Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and back to Jammu and Kashmir before he died of COVID-19, raising fears he may have infected many others along the way. 80% of the cases in Jammu & Kashmir are linked to this person, while 50% of cases in Telangana are linked to the meeting in the Markaz.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal called the gathering at the centre “an irresponsible act”. Meanwhile, AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan asked Delhi Police why it did not take any action to evacuate people trapped in the centre even though he had informed them on March 23.

85,2020/04/01,"Government jobs to be reserved for domiciles of J&K, says Centre","Anyone who has resided for a period of 15 years in the UT of J&K or has studied for a period of seven years and appeared in Class 10th /12th examination will be deemed to be domicile

The Union government has issued a notification defining “domiciles” in the new Union Territory (UT) of Jammu and Kashmir for protecting jobs in the Group D category and entry-level non-gazetted posts for the domiciles.

On August 6 last, the Centre revoked J&K's special status under Article 370 and Article 35A of the Constitution and bifurcated it into J&K and Ladakh UTs.

The Tuesday notification of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) makes changes to the Public Safety Act (PSA) by removing a clause that prohibited J&K residents booked under the Act to be lodged in jails outside.

No pension benefits to ex-CMs

The notification scraps all pension benefits such as car, driver, accommodation, phones, electricity, medical facilities and rent-free accommodation to former J&K Chief Ministers.

The order says the domiciles will be eligible “for the purposes of appointment to any post carrying a pay scale of not more than Level 4.” The Level 4 post comprises positions such as gardeners, barbers, office peons and waterman and the highest rank in the category is that of a junior assistant.

A senior government official said the reservation for domiciles would not apply to Group A and Group B posts, and like other UTs, recruitment would be done by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). “This is according to the norms in other UTs and States. Recruitment by the UPSC expands the search for talent across the country.”

Vacancies in posts

According to the MHA’s reply to a parliamentary panel on February 18, there are over 84,000 vacancies in J&K, of which 22,078 pertain to Class IV employees, 54,375 to non-gazetted and 7,552 at the Gazetted level.

The order defines a domicile as one “who has resided for a period of 15 years in the UT of J&K or has studied for a period of seven years and appeared in Class 10th /12th examination in an educational institution located in the UT of J&K or who is registered as a migrant by the Relief and Rehabilitation Commissioner (Migrants).’’

The two revoked constitutional provisions -Article 370 and Article 35A, let the legislature decide the “permanent residents”, prohibiting a non-J&K resident from buying property there and ensuring job reservation for its residents.

On Tuesday, the MHA issued the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Adaptation of State Laws) Order, 2020, through which it amended 109 laws and repealed 29 laws of the erstwhile State and inserted “domicile” clause in the Jammu and Kashmir Civil Services (Decentralisation and Recruitment Act, 2010). The order was issued at 11.07 p.m.

Under the 2010 Act, the clause for “permanent resident of the State” has been substituted by “Domicile” of the UT. The Act pertained to employment in the civil services comprising “district, divisional and State” cadre posts. Only permanent residents of J&K were eligible to apply for the gazetted and non-gazetted posts. The amendment allows non-domiciles also to apply to these posts.

“Children of Central Govt. officials, All India Services, PSUs, autonomous body of Centre, Public Sector Banks, officials of statutory bodies, Central Universities, recognised research institutes of Centre who have served in J&K for a total period of 10 years” will be domiciles.

The domicile status applies to “children of such residents of J&K who reside outside J&K in connection with their employment or business or other professional or vocational reasons but their parents should fulfil any of the conditions provided”.

Another official said, “All posts that are up to the rank of junior assistant and below are open only to domiciles, the entire non-gazetted services has been reserved. Only few positions such as police sub-inspectors are directly recruited at a higher level than junior assistants.”

The Jammu and Kashmir State Legislature Members' Pension Act,1984, has been amended by the MHA. It fixes the pension for former legislators, councillors at Rs 75,000 a month.

Changes to PSA

The MHA order has also made amendments to the PSA, 1978. It changes the criteria for appointing the PSA advisory board on the recommendation of a search committee headed by the Chief Secretary instead of the Chief Justice of the J&K High Court. It also bars sitting High Court judges to be made part of the board without the Chief justice's consultation.

The advisory board has a crucial role to play in release of detenus under the PSA. The order also scraps a clause that dealt with the power to regulate place and conditions of detention.

There are 12 States, including Himachal Pradesh, where provisions of special status under Article 371 apply. The provisions pertain to regulation of ownership and transfer of land in order to conserve the limited resources available for development and to ensure that the State preserves its unique identity. After J&K was made a UT, several groups in Jammu expressed concern over losing special status and apprehended losing land and jobs to outsiders.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6uj3as/article31224163.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDJKSECRETARIAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-jobs-to-be-reserved-only-for-domiciles-of-jk-says-centre/article31224164.ece

All occupants of the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters, at the centre of an extensive net of the novel coronavirus transmission, were evacuated by early Wednesday, even as the authorities scrambled to identify and quarantine visitors who had returned home to various parts of the country.

At least 29 more occupants tested positive on Wednesday, taking the total in Delhi alone to 53.

As many as 110 people who returned to Tamil Nadu from the Tablighi meeting held in mid-March tested positive. Of around 310 delegates from Kerala, only 60 have returned to the State, and are under quarantine.

The missionary sect’s followers travel extensively, and efforts are on to trace the rest. At least 500 participants from Haryana are in quarantine.

Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba held a videoconference with the Chief Secretaries of all the States.

“Most of them are testing positive. We have so far got only about 15 negative cases. If you put 2,000 people in a closed building, everyone is bound to have it,” a Delhi government official told The Hindu. The official said they were coordinating with other States and evacuating people from different mosques in the city. “People who have visited the centre are present in other masjids. We have visited at least 15 such mosques in the city,” said the official.

2,346 evacuated

The Delhi police Special Branch and the Delhi government shifted 275 foreign nationals to quarantine from various mosques and places in and around the national capital. They were associated with Tablighi Jamaat.

A total of 2,346 people were evacuated from the Markaz (centre), which serves as the international headquarters of the sect, at Nizamuddin, and 536 of them were sent to hospitals and 1,810 were sent to quarantine facilities, the Delhi government said in a statement in the evening.

The evacuation was completed around 4 a.m. on Wednesday, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said. “The operation lasted for three-and-a-half days, and extensively in the last 36 hours.” He said the Delhi government prepared a list of the people evacuated, along with their phone numbers, and the police were looking into it. “The cyber cell will investigate the numbers and look into who all they met and where are the rest of them. And where are the people who met them,” he said.

The asymptomatic people, who have been moved to the quarantine facilities, are not being tested immediately, but will closely be monitored, officials said. Mr. Sisodia requested all visitors to the centre in March to report to the authorities. “If you do not come forward or if you are ill and are hiding it, action will be taken against you,” he said.

The Delhi police said Maulana Saad, the head of the centre, remained untraceable. He has been charged with defying restrictions on gatherings. Thousands had gathered at the centre and dispersed between March 13 and March 24 when the nationwide lockdown came into force. Those who remained at the centre could not leave as all transport facilities came to a halt.

A senior police officer said personnel from the local police station had visited the building on March 23 and earlier to communicate the restriction on gathering of over 50 people. “We have got to know from the media that there is an FIR. But we haven’t got a copy of the FIR. We are ready to cooperate with the police if they summon us or if they come to us,” Fuzail Ahmad Ayyubi, advocate for the centre, said. “The authorities have sanitized the Markaz and closed it. We have offered it to be used as a quarantine facility, but it is up to them,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ascir6/article31229201.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI01-04-2020000061A,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tablighi-jamaat-members-evacuated-from-nizamuddin-centre/article31223897.ece

Authorities in the southern States scrambled on Tuesday to identify the large number of people who had attended a congregation at the Markaz Nizamuddin, international headquarters of Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi, and their contacts throughout their journeys.

Coronavirus | Nizamuddin centre COVID-19 cases spark a controversy

Tamil Nadu appeared to have the largest number of delegates to the event, followed by Telangana, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.

Tamil Nadu’s Health Secretary Beela Rajesh said a total of 1,500 persons had attended the conference in Delhi. Of this, 1,131 had returned to Tamil Nadu. Health officials managed to trace and quarantine 515 of them. Tracing all those who travelled to Nizamuddin to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 was being pursued in high gear. Over half the total COVID-19 positive cases in Tamil Nadu were directly or indirectly linked to the travellers.

Health officials said that the clustering of cases was unexpected and had turned the trajectory of COVID-19 in the State, which otherwise reported positive cases mainly among those who had travelled abroad and their contacts.

500 from A.P.

In Andhra Pradesh, officials launched all-out efforts to trace the Tablighi Jamaat members. More than 500 individuals from almost all districts of Andhra Pradesh travelled to Nizamuddin for the prayers held from March 15 to 17, travelling mostly by AP Express and GT Express between March 10 and March 20. Police were trying find out whether the members used any other mode of transport.

‘No need to panic’

Kerala also braced itself for possible spread of COVID-19 after a large group returned from the Delhi event. At least 300 delegates were from Kerala. Officials said there was cause for concern but no panic, and among the first batch who left on March 5, at least 80 reached Kerala. A random check revealed none of them were positive for the virus, and most had passed the incubation period unaffected. However, the situation could change with extensive testing.

Among the 300 attendees, an estimated 150 from the State had left the centre for other regions for religious work, and the government was ascertaining their status. Some had stayed on in New Delhi during the curfew.

The State government is also concerned that scores of people from Salem, Madurai and Erode had stayed at the Tablighi seminary along with those from Kerala. An official said the delegates had sheltered in mosques in different parts of the country during their journey back, and they were trying to identify the spots.

Isolation centres

About 78 members from Karnataka belonging to the Tablighi Jamaat were quarantined in government isolation centres and would be tested for COVID-19, said Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education). Mr. Akhtar said the department did not have specific information if all the 78 members belong to the Jamaat.

“An Order had been issued to shift all of them to government quarantine centres. They had been home quarantined three days ago. The person from Sira, who succumbed to the infection, is one of them,” he said.

Over 1,000 in Telangana

In Telangana, 1,030 persons from 29 districts were identified as ‘returnees’ from the Markaz prayers. On Tuesday, officials of erstwhile Adilabad district were on their toes preparing a list of those who had attended. The administrations in Adilabad, Kumram Bheem Asifabad, Mancherial and Nirmal districts intended to put them in mandatory isolation at home or at special centres.

Many devotees had gone to the national capital on their own from rural places and do not figure in the records. Over 50 people were identified as having participated from Adilabad district, but only 12 were in Jamaat records.

Authorities in Nirmal district located over 50 Jamaat returnees and they were placed in isolation wards in a polytechnic college. Some 80 people had made the visit.

Nizamabad Collector C. Narayana Reddy said that 39 persons who returned from Delhi along with the retired employee who was found COVID-19 positive were quarantined. Besides, 55 others who came in contact with them were also shifted to isolation wards. None except a retired employee had symptoms, he said.

In Medak, Sangareddy and Siddipet districts, 46 persons travelled to the congregation.

Sangareddy Collector M. Hanumantha Rao and Additional Collector Veera Reddy and other senior officials visited the hospital asked officials to post a police force there.

The Retailers Association of India (RAI) has flagged its concerns to Chief Ministers about the police in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat beating up employees and delivery staff of retailers on their way to duty during the lockdown due to COVID-19.

“RAI praises States for allowing essential daily goods and pharmacy retailers to remain open so that citizens are not deprived of daily need items. All retailers are committed to selling and delivering essentials in a safe manner,” RAI said in a statement.

“However, in some unfortunate incidents in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Gujarat the local police are beating employees and delivery staff of such retailers, and taking them to chowkis for doing their duty. These employees are risking their lives for serving citizens,” it added.

“RAI has put forward a request to the Chief Ministers and the DGPs of these States to intervene in this situation so that essential goods are accessible,” it further said.

RAI has requested all the State governments to allow all food and grocery stores within malls or outside, air-conditioned or not air-conditioned, small or large stores and online or offline to stay open during the lockdown period.

“Most of the State governments have agreed with RAI’s view that shutting of stores selling essential daily need items will cause gross inconvenience to citizens and may set off panic buying of daily need items, thereby creating a shortage for the needy,” it said.

RAI has also requested that home deliveries be allowed to prevent people from stepping out of their homes, thereby preventing the spreading of the infection.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/police-beating-up-retail-staff-during-curfew-in-some-states/article31157725.ece

Three of the persons who contracted COVID-19 hail from Islampet in Ongole. The fourth person who tested positive hails from Chimakurthy town and had also attended the religious congregation in Delhi, Prakasam District Health and Medical Officer Dr. S.Appala Naidu said while overseeing implementation of the cluster containment strategy.

Taking a dim view of the Tablighi Jamaat meeting in Nizamuddin, which is said to be responsible for a large number of cases across the country, State Energy Minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy requested all those who attended the congregation to voluntarily undergo screening in the interest of their families and friends.

Door delivery of groceries and other essentials by local stores enabled by the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation has found many takers in the past five days since its launch.

Since March 27, 2,969 orders were placed by 43 stores in various locations of the city, said VMC chief V. Prasanna Venkatesh.

To promote door delivery services, Mr. Venkatesh conducted a meeting with the representatives of grocery stores and hypermarkets at Tummalapalli Kalakshetram here on Wednesday.

Mr. Venkatesh said that the time has come to further promote door delivery of essentials in order to strictly comply with the social distancing measures.

“The State government has launched a mobile application and website called apecs.app through which people can place orders. For orders worth less than ₹500, a delivery charge of ₹25 can be charged. For orders above ₹500, there will be no delivery fee,” Mr. Venkatesh said.

He asked traders not to ignore phone calls from the public citing staff shortage, and instead recruit additional workers to ensure door delivery services are not interrupted. He also assured them that they will be given VMC’s full support.

“The cooperation of grocery stores is essential for the lockdown to succeed and ensure the containment of coronavirus. The application is available on the website and will be operational from April 5,” he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/essentials-delivered-to-3000-homes-says-vmc/article31230935.ece
97,2020/04/01,CPI(M) comes to rescue of Malda workers in Anantapur,"More than 360 daily wage earners from Malda in Bengal, who were working in the horticulture farms of Anantapur district, are now stuck in six places in the eastern parts of the district where bananas are grown in large quantities.

With the sudden imposition of lockdown due to COVID-19, these people did not have a chance to go back to their hometown.

Communist Party of India(Marxist) has come to the rescue of these farm labourers, who are skilled workers in cutting and processing bananas at the farms and processing units in Muchukota, Putluru, Kadavakallu, Narpala, Rayalacheruvu and Tadipatri Rural mandal villages.

CPI(M) district secretary V. Rambhupal, who received a message from the Bengal party unit in Malda about the travails of the workers, distributed rice, groceries, and other items among them.

Meanwhile, the former MP J.C. Diwakar Reddy and his brother J.C.

99,2020/04/01,Coronavirus is beyond grasp of these residents,"While some believe it’s a skin disease, others call it a female ghost

Even as the COVID-19 scare grips the entire world, the virus is beyond grasp of the residents of about a dozen hamlets at the forested areas and hillocks in Bangarupalem mandal bordering the forests of Tamil Nadu.

Though the COVID-19 concern has been largely felt all over Chittoor district for a month, this deadly virus started jolting the people of these remote hamlets only with the Janata Curfew on March 22, immediately followed by 21-day lockdown. The lockdown did not make much difference in their lifestyle. They only found missing of even the bare transportation facilities to reach the Chittoor-Bengaluru NH.

A dozen hamlets, including Bandladoddi, Kolavaru, Vepanapalle, Pulimadugu, Veluthuru Chenu, Jayanti and Palar, are virtually cut off from the NH. As the elderly find it almost impossible to understand what COVID -19 is, the youngsters, mostly illiterate and migrant workers, largely think that it’s a skin disease like leprosy that could finally lead to a morbid end. The prime source of their livelihood is working in fields crisscrossing the inter-State borders. Their biggest relief is to watch a movie once in a while.

The sudden lockdown continues to confuse the people of these villages. The perplexing doubts in their minds are: What’s the connection between this “skin decease” and stoppage of share-autos and motorbikes from entering the NH? Why should we shut up ourselves in houses, that too day and night? In a gap of one week, some families at Srinivasa Puram and Palar hamlets heard about death among their relatives’ families in TN.

Weird practices

The elderly give a new entity to the virus. For them it could be a female evil spirit, attacking them in sleep and entering the houses from holes in rooftops, or while moving alone (ironically to discourage the social distancing norm). Many women have already started weird practices like throwing cut lemon pieces smeared with kumkum on four directions of their dwelling, followed by placing neem leaves on thresholds.

Rajamma (72) of Bandladoddi hamlet said the virus was nothing but a female spirit from a foreign country (China), in search of the robust unmarried young men of villages. “If we don’t listen to her, she will attack us with deadly fevers and cough. No need of 21-day treatment, but we can deal the spirit with just three days with power-packed lemon pieces,” she said.

Anjamma (70) of Vepanapalle hamlet to some extent comes closer to truth. “The Aada dheyyam (female ghost) is afraid of soap. We heard that it will enter our body through hands like electric shock. If we apply soap to hands, it will enter through eyes and nostrils. That’s why we have to cover our faces,” she said.

In spite of this, the Rural Organisation for Poverty Eradication Services (ROPES) in association with Chennai-based Children Believe had finished a three-day long awareness campaign in 150 habitations of about 40 panchayats in Bangarupalem mandal, with prime focus on these forested villages. Campaign programme officer P. Sree Latha said:

“We tried our best to educate them about the coronavirus. Besides distributing soap boxes and masks to the households, we have also demonstrated the things such as washing hands, social distancing and staying indoors.”",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/o6zaws/article31230796.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02VJCHITTOORVILAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/coronavirus-is-beyond-grasp-of-these-residents/article31230797.ece

The COVID-19 outbreak cases connected to the Tablighi Jamaat meeting in New Delhi increased the total positive cases in the State to 111 on Wednesday, causing panic in at least eight districts where multiple cases were reported in a single day.

At least 70 of the 87 cases reported before 7 pm are of the persons who had attended the meeting in Nizamuddin in the national capital and their close contacts, while 16 are of foreign returnees and their close contacts and one is of a person who had come from Rajasthan, according to the Health Department bulletin. After 7 pm, 24 new cases were reported and the travel history of these persons was being tracked, officials said.

During the past 24 hours as of Wednesday evening, over 470 samples, all of Delhi returnees and their contacts from eight districts were tested and 43 tested positive.

The authorities found out that about 1,085 persons from the State attended the event and more than 1,050 of them have been traced, quarantined and samples taken for testing.

CM’s plea

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy at a press meet said 21 Delhi returnees are to be traced and appealed to them to come forward by utilising the 104 helpline and protect the lives of themselves as well as their families. He said results of samples of the remaining Delhi returnees were awaited.

Before 7 pm on Wednesday, 812 samples of Delhi returnees (543) and their contacts (269) and 358 samples of foreign returnees (218) and their contacts (140), besides 143 samples of persons who showed COVID-19 symptoms were tested.

103,2020/04/01,Inmates of Kadapa prison ‘unmask’ their talent,"They showcase their skill by stitching 25,000 face masks so far

At a time when the entire country is scurrying for a protective gear in the testing times of COVID-19, Kadapa Central Prison has come up with a major intervention in meeting the demand for face masks.

The inmates of the prison have so far stitched 25,000 masks, apart from having an order on hand for a whopping 40,000 pieces to be distributed among government hospitals, departments and public sector undertakings alone. Though masks are produced in Nellore, Rajahmundry, and Visakhapatnam central prisons too, Kadapa stands ahead in numbers, thanks to its skill and preparedness. Much before the Janata Curfew was clamped, the jail authorities sensed the likely spurt in demand for masks in the forthcoming days and started acting upon the idea.

12 tailoring units

The jail is already equipped with twelve tailoring units to stitch uniform for police and trainees, while District Collector Ch. Hari Kiran offered 17 more from one of his training wings under the rural development.

The inmates are regularly trained in life skills. It was only recently that the current batch completed a course in electrical, plumbing, and tailoring course, which obviously came in handy for them. “What initially started with production of around 1,000 masks per day has improved to touch 2,500 pieces today. Kadapa is among India’s top central prisons manufacturing the highest number of nose masks,” Deputy Inspector-General of Prisons (Kadapa) M. Varaprasad has told The Hindu.

According to the cost sheet, the unit price works out to ₹7 a piece, which is cheaper than the ones available in the open market. With Shriya Texport, a Hindupur-based textile plant, offering to donate 2,500 metres of cloth, which is sufficient to make 45,000 reusable masks, the buoyed jail authorities have deployed more inmates into service. The quality of the cloth used is in compliance with the rules stipulated by District Medical and Health Department.

“We have orders for 40,000 masks from the Public Health Department, DM&HO, Rajiv Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Kadapa and the other Rayalaseema districts. Despite the pressure, we are currently not accepting orders from social and charitable organisations seeking bulk procurement for distribution to the masses,” Dr. Varaprasad adds.

“Every prisoner is given a sewing machine, while there will be a semi-skilled helper for three to four units. The entire job is split into smaller tasks like side-stitching, elastic, tags and distributed among the skilled prisoners,” explains jailor A. Naresh Kumar.

As the cloth came free of cost, the masks can now be supplied to the departments at a much cheaper price -- around ₹2 or ₹3 a piece.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ss9ld3/article31230598.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28-VJ-MASKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/inmates-of-kadapa-prison-unmask-their-talent/article31230599.ece
104,2020/04/01,DD likely to telecast lessons for social welfare students,"‘Aim is to reach out to at least Class 10 pupils; each session will last 45 minutes’

To tide over the lockdown crisis that forced schools to shut down and send children to the safety of their homes, the Andhra Pradesh Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society (APSWREIS) plans to rope in Doordarshan (DD) Kendra, Vijayawada, to telecast classroom lessons to its students in dedicated slots in the morning and evening hours.

“We want to reach out to at least our Class 10 students through the State-owned television channel to impart classes and help them prepare well for their examinations,” V. Ramulu, society Secretary, told The Hindu.

Mr. Ramulu says, “Responding favourably to my proposal, the government and the DD have agreed, in principle, and if all goes well, the telecast will start in a couple of days. The society runs 189 schools across the 13 districts of the State with a 1.07 lakh student strength. Of them, over 13,000 students are from Class 10.

“We are identifying teachers who have the facility to shoot videos using i-Phones and other electronic gadgets,” says Mr. Ramulu.

The videos of the teachers explaining the lessons will be shot at their homes and sent online to Mr. Ramulu, who will edit them before forwarding them to the government television channel for telecast.

Interactive mode

Each telecast session will last for 45 minutes and will be followed by an interactive session, wherein the students can get their doubts cleared through a phone-in facility. The society, for now, intends to focus on training students in main subjects such as mathematics, science and English.

The initial plan of reaching out to the students using WhatsApp platform has to be dropped as 50% of the students do not have access to it.

“We have zeroed in on DD as almost 90% of the children even in remote villages have access to television,” Mr. Ramulu says. “This is the only way to connect the students to their teachers in this hour of crisis,” he adds.

Students going to the social welfare schools mostly come from rural background, and the new arrangement will enable them to learn their lessons sitting in the confines of their homes.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/dd-likely-to-telecast-lessons-for-social-welfare-students/article31230596.ece

106,2020/04/01,"One dead, four hospitalised after consuming sanitiser chemical","Victims got tempted as liquor shops were closed due to lockdown

A youth died and four others were hospitalised after they reportedly consumed a sanitiser chemical as liquor shops were closed owing to the lockdown in the State.

The deceased has been identified as D. Naveen Murthy Raju (20). Four others were admitted to various private hospitals and their condition is stated to be critical.

According to Eluru Range DIG K.V. Mohan Rao, one of the victim P. Veeresh, a native of Velpur village in the district managed to get half litre of Isopropyl alcohol (a disinfectant used as solvent in some wiper fluids) while unloading the chemical in a company located at Pydiparru village.

Later, he called up his friends — Naveen, T. Durga Rao, V. Shyam Sundar and A. Venkatesh — of the neighbouring villages. They got tempted to the liquor odour of Isopropyl and reportedly consumed the chemical near Kavalipuram Cheruvu, on Monday.

Condition serious

Kovvur Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) K. Rajeswar Reddy said Naveen fell sick on the same night. He was rushed to a private hospital where he was declared brought dead.

“Other victims were also admitted to hospital and their condition is stated to be serious. A couple of the youth lost their vision. During investigation, it is revealed that the company procured Isoprophy alcohol for preparing sanitisers during the lockdown period in wake of COVID-19,” the DSP told The Hindu.

“The victims were addicted to alcohol. A case has been registered,” the DIG said.

Prohibition and Excise West Godavari Deputy Commissioner P. Anasuya and other officials visited the hospital. Police recorded the statements of the victims and the case is under investigation, Mr. Rajeswar Reddy said.

Cautioned

Director (Enforcement) Vineet Brijlal said some persons who were addicted to alcohol were consuming some chemicals and sanitisers due to closure of liquor shops during the lockdown period, and their family members were requested to keep a vigil on alcohol addicts.

“Stern action will be taken against the shops which sell chemicals and solvents unauthorisedly. Persons having information on illegal sale of chemicals may alert the Excise police over Phone Nos.18004254868, 9491030853 or 0866-2843131,” Mr. Brijlal said on Wednesday.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/one-dead-four-hospitalised-after-consuming-sanitiser-chemical/article31230556.ece

“We depend on begging. As there is no public movement due to lockdown, we are suffering from hunger. Thanks to the donors and the police who gave us rice, dal and oil,” said a woman, Kathi Nagamani.

“Many families in Yanadula Colony are struggling with poverty and finding it difficult to meet both ends. For the last ten days, there has been no proper food. Children, pregnant woman and the elderly in the families are the worst hit,” said another Yanadi woman Bhavani.

When the donors visited the colony near here on Wednesday, children and women followed the vehicles expecting some succour from them and queued up in the streets. While senior citizens in Yanadi families were seen peeping through the doors and eagerly waiting for food.

“About 250 families are staying in Yanadula Colony, located at Mustakanpeta in the town. On seeing the pathetic situation in their families, police have decided to do some help for them and Additional Superintendent of Police Moka Sathi Babu has adopted the colony,” said Krishna district Superintendent of Police M. Ravindranath Babu.

Health problems

“Men and children in the families will do rag-picking. Children are seen anaemic and suffering from various health problems due to unhygienic conditions and poverty. They don’t even have proper clothes to wear,” said Mr. Sathi Babu.

On Wednesday, the Vijayawada Chamber of Commerce, Automobile Association and the police distributed ration to the Yanadi families in the colony.

110,2020/04/01,Spike in COVID-19 cases sparks tension in Chittoor,"All five cases are linked to the Jamaat meeting at Nizamuddin

A sudden spurt of five positive cases in Chittoor district on Tuesday sent a wave of panic across the district, with residents too scared to venture out of their homes even during the relaxation period in the morning.

All of the five new cases in the district are directly linked to a Tablighi Jamaat meeting in Hazrat Nizamuddin area of New Delhi recently. News reports of the five confirmed cases led to panic in Palamaner police sub-division with three cases, followed by one in Srikalahasti and one in Yerpedu.

Srikalahasti had already recorded its first COVID-19 case a few days ago — a young returnee from London.

Despite a relaxation in the lockdown from 6 a.m. till 11 a.m., the alarming rise in number of cases forced people to stay indoors at Palamaner and Gangavaram mandals. The impact of the scare was also felt in surrounding mandals upto V. Kota, Punganur and Madanapalle.

According to medical officials, by Wednesday morning, it was found that as many as 187 persons from Chittoor district had attended the Jamaat meeting in Delhi. Of these, 79 persons were put under quarantine, while most of them rushed to hospitals voluntarily. Surveillance has been mounted on all those who returned from Delhi. “All the five cases that have surfaced freshly are those who have returned from the Jamaat,” District Medical and Health Officer M. Penchalaiah confirmed. The COVID-19 Task Force officials said that rapid action is underway to create a quarantine facility for around 2,000 cases at Tirupati, Madanapalle, Palamaner and Puttur, for which educational institutions would also be roped in.

The specially-created market facilities at various municipalities of Madanapalle, Nagari, Puttur, Palamaner and Chittoor wore a deserted look on Wednesday. In view of the desolate situation at the public places, the markings made outside shops to ensure social distancing seemed unnecessary.

This unexpected scenario at public places, and at the border checkposts and vital junctions in various towns, helped the police personnel heave a sigh of relief. “The present situation with six COVID-19 positive cases has clearly made the public avoid moving out unless absolutely required,” said M. Rajasekhar, Circle Inspector (Nagari rural), overseeing the checkposts on the inter-State border with Tamil Nadu on the Nagari-Kancheepuram road.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hdtjuu/article31230479.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02-VJ-CHITTOORDESERTED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/spike-in-covid-19-cases-sparks-tension-in-chittoor/article31230480.ece
111,2020/04/01,Curfew like situation witnessed in W.Godavari villages,"13 test positive; no case had been reported from the district till Tuesday

A curfew-like situation was witnessed in many villages in West Godavari district as 13 persons tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday. Police restricted movement of people in all towns and villages.

Officials collected samples of the people from different places of which 13 tested positive. No case was reported from the district till Tuesday.

Police, along with the grama volunteers and Medical and Health department officials visited the houses of people suspected to have contracted the virus and shifted them to quarantine facilities. More than 40 members of Tablighi Jamaat of the district attended Ijtema (annual congregation) at Markaz and attended for prayers at Hazrat Nizamuddin from March 12 to 18.

Incubation stage

“People from Eluru, Bhimavaram, Akiveedu, Undi, Chintalapudi, Penugonda and other places attended Ijtema. We are trying to find out the details of those who attended the prayers,” said an officer.

Eluru Range DIG K.V. Mohan Rao said all those who tested positive were aged below 45 years, and no symptoms of fever and cold were seen, as the disease was in incubation stage in the patients.

Locals arranged barricades at the entry points of the streets, where the patients were quarantined in the villages.

Civic workers were seen sanitising the roads and the effected villages with disinfectants. They made announcements through public addressing systems appealing to the people not to venture out.

Alarming

“The situation is alarming in our village. Nobody is coming out of their houses since yesterday after rumours spread that the virus spread in Undi and it is officially confirmed today.

Expressing concern over the spurt in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the last 48 hours, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Wednesday said the government was doing its best to trace those who returned from the religious congregation at Nizamuddin and test each one of them and their contacts lest the risk of the spread of coronavirus should increase.

Of the 87 individuals tested positive so far, about 70 have contracted the virus at the massive gathering at Nizamuddin, which was attended by 1,085 persons from Andhra Pradesh, he said, pointing out that 585 of them turned out to be COVID negative and the test results of the remaining are awaited.

‘No need to panic’

“There is nothing stigmatic about COVID, which is like any fever or flu, hence those feeling sick should get themselves diagnosed to know if they are afflicted with the virus and take necessary treatment before the infection passes to healthy individuals,” he said in a televised address to people.

While saying that, the CM cautioned the elderly and sick people against taking the their vulnerability to COVID lightly as it posed a greater danger to them than others. But, no person, even if he or she was sick, should panic, he suggested.

He sought to infuse courage in the people, saying that the disease was completely curable provided treatment was taken in time and other measures followed.

The CM said 81% of the confirmed cases were successfully treated at home and that self-isolation for 14 days was an effective way to confront the disease. Only up to 5 % of the infected persons were under intensive care.

He thanked the people’s representatives, government officers and employees etc. for consenting to the deferment of salaries and remunerations, which was necessitated by the drastic fall in revenues on the one hand and the tremendous financial burden imposed by COVID containment efforts on the other.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/about-70-positive-cases-traced-to-nizamuddin/article31229444.ece

Bengaluru Urban and Mysuru feature among the top 25 COVID-19 hotspots in the country, while Chickballapur is fast emerging as one over the last 14 days. Besides, Bengaluru is also among the top seven cities with a high case load as on March 30.

These were some observations made by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in its “COVID-19 Status Health Report” on Wednesday.

Pankaj Kumar Pandey, Karnataka’s Commissioner for Health and Family Welfare, said Bengaluru is among the top seven cities in the country with the highest number of confirmed cases. According to the report, Karnataka is among the 10 States that contributes to more than 80% of India’s total COVID-19 cases. Maharashtra, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Telangana, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and Punjab are the other States.

While there are multiple emerging hotspots in Karnataka with a high number of confirmed cases, where immediate containment is needed, Bengaluru is among the top seven cities in the country where more than 30 cases each have been reported. As of Wednesday, Bengaluru had 48 confirmed cases. While eight have been discharged from designated hospitals in Bengaluru, the city witnessed one death so far. According to the report, Bengaluru Urban saw 23 cases in the last 14 days alone.

Best practices

On a brighter note, the Ministry recognised Karnataka for adopting best practices. Among the nine States, whose best practices have been mentioned in the report, Karnataka’s direction to those under home quarantine to send 14 selfies to the government per day, one every hour from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., using the Quarantine Watch app has been recognised. The State Health Department had announced two days ago that defaulters were liable to be shifted to a mass quarantine centre.

The report also makes mention of Victoria Hospital “being developed” as a dedicated COVID-19 facility with 1,200 isolation beds, 15 ICU beds, and 20 ventilators.

Aggressive testing

V. Ravi, senior professor and Head of Neuro-Virology at NIMHANS, said Karnataka’s case load is high because the State has been testing aggressively. “Of the total 42,000 tests conducted in the country, more than 10% have been done in Karnataka,” he said.

“Also, Bengaluru has had the highest influx of foreign passengers and it is because of this Karnataka is one of the early States where cases were reported. Efficient contact tracing is helping identifying more cases,” he said.

125,2020/04/01,"COVID-19 brings bitter times for pepper, coffee planters in Kodagu","Amid the lockdown and the departure of the migrant labour force to their hometowns, pepper harvest and post-harvest processing of coffee have taken a hit in Kodagu.

Between 90% and 95% of coffee has been harvested subsequent to the lockdown curbs across the district, and the harvest of pepper, an inter-crop in coffee plantations, was to begin this month. Pepper is usually harvested between March and May, and estates in Kodagu largely depend on migrant workers for the task.

A majority of workers at these estates are primarily from north Karnataka and from neighbouring districts, including Periyapatna and Hunsur taluks in Mysuru. Local workers are also sourced for the job as the harvest area is large.

In view of the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown, many workers have returned to their home districts, barring a few who have been working in the plantations for many years and reside in the estates themselves.

Coffee is cultivated on more than 1.05 lakh hectares in Kodagu. The industry has been in a state of crisis for the past two years as floods and landslips damaged crop and estates, besides affecting the overall productivity. The prices crashed, dashing the hopes of growers. The government had announced relief for the sector post-floods, but the woes of planters have not stopped yet.

After cases of COVID-19 were first reported in Kerala early this year, the Kodagu district administration issued directives to planters not to source workers from Kerala as a precaution.

“The coffee harvest is almost done. Pepper harvest may get delayed following the lockdown and shortage of workers. We are facing a shortage of 50-60% of migrant workers as a large number of them have returned to their native districts. We don’t know what will be the scenario after the lockdown ends, as we have to wait for the restoration of transportation and for the workers to return, as the resident workers cannot handle the large cultivated area,” said C.K. Belliappa, secretary, Coorg Planters’ Association.

The lockdown will also delay the post-harvest processing and handling of coffee. “The post-harvest activities used to go on till the month of June, provided the interventions started after the harvest. We are in a wait and watch mode now,” he said.

‘Precautions taken’

According to the CPA, the migrant workers who haven’t returned to their home towns despite the scare are safe in their homes in the estates. “The planters have provided them all the essentials and have taken precautions for their safety. There is no need for them to step out,” he said.

The rain fury last year destroyed plantations, and incessant rainfall resulted in extensive berry-dropping in coffee plantations. The district administration had estimated damage to 1,02,034 hectares of coffee estates. The crop loss was pegged at ₹51.85 crore. This excludes the loss suffered in the 2018 deluge.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kh231t/article31230605.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGPEPPER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-brings-bitter-times-for-pepper-coffee-planters-in-kodagu/article31230606.ece

Speaking to presspersons after taking over the rooms, Hubballi Urban Taluk Tahsildar Shashidhar Madyal said that the 50 rooms taken over by the administration would be first cleaned up and all the basic amenities required for converting them into quarantine centre would be provided. “Subsequently, all those home quarantined would be shifted to the lodge by the teams comprising officials from the Health and Police departments,” he said.

Municipal Corporation’s Health Officer Prabhu Biradar said that the decision had been taken by the district administration to keep in observation those who had been home quarantined. “Shifting them to the lodge will help the administration keep a close watch on their health condition. This will also help in restricting the movement of home quarantined persons who have been found violating the restrictions. A total of 350 persons have completed the home quarantine period in the district so far. Others who are yet to complete the period will be shifted to the lodge,” he said.

Dr. Biradar said that a team of qualified doctors and paramedical staff will be monitoring the quarantined persons and after keeping regular check of their health condition, the blood samples and throat swabs of those with symptoms of COVID-19 would be sent for tests.

These are questions all healthcare professionals are grappling with. To help create awareness and to ensure that the correct protocol is followed, the State government launched a YouTube channel — COVID-19 Training Task Force — on March 26.

The channel has around 1.46 lakh followers, including doctors, nurses, ASHAs and gram panchayat members. Over the next two days, the government plans to reach out to 60,000 people who are part of the village-level task force via the channel. Topics that will be addressed include social distancing and rules to follow during quarantine.

P.C. Jaffer, who is in charge of capacity building for COVID-19, said that a resource person conducts a live session and those attending the training online can post questions in the comments. “The trainees can also look up the videos online if they want to refer to a particular topic in case of any doubts,” he said. The duration of the videos ranges from three minutes to an hour. Some videos have close to 6,000 views so far.

Through specific videos, the channel is set to train 100 teams that include medical professionals handling primary contacts and 1,300 teams handling secondary contacts in Bengaluru.

128,2020/04/01,Launch e-commerce platforms to link farmers with consumers: expert,"As farmers are struggling to take their produce to markets or directly sell them to consumers amid the lockdown, an agricultural extension expert has suggested measures to tide over the crisis, including launching e-commerce platforms involving farm universities and district-level Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs).

K. Narayana Gowda, former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru, said farm universities and district KVKs can launch online initiatives to directly link farmers with consumers. “All the districts have Krishi Vigyan Kendras, which will have agricultural experts. They should be immediately involved by the government in launching such marketing initiatives so that farmers can find a solution within their districts,” he told The Hindu. Furthermore, farmers should also be allowed to directly sell to consumers at the panchayat, hobli, taluk and district levels, he said, calling for dedicating playgrounds and school grounds for this.

He said enabling direct sale of produce to consumers may help farmers to get remunerative prices in this time of crisis. He also suggested that the government get more grounds in Bengaluru to facilitate direct sale of produce by farmers.

Expressing concern about farmers dumping their produce, he said such a scenario was a warning to the State as it was an indication that there could be severe shortage of vegetables and fruits in the coming months. “If such incidents increase, then more farmers will opt out of cultivating vegetables and fruits. This is bound to create a shortage, leading to rise in prices,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/launch-e-commerce-platforms-to-link-farmers-with-consumers-expert/article31230081.ece
129,2020/04/01,COVID-19 cases soar in Mysuru as five test positive,"Cases from pharmaceutical company in Nanjangud alone touch 17; total number of cases in the district stands at 19, the second highest after Bengaluru

The number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise in Mysuru district with five more persons testing positive on Wednesday.

Of the five new cases, two are employees of the Nanjangud-based pharmaceutical company and three cases are the primary contacts of Patient Number 52, the pharma company employee who was the first to get the contagion.

With the five new cases, the total number of cases linked to the employees and their contacts has touched 17. The cases in Mysuru district in total stand at 19.

Patient number 103, a 37-year-old male and a resident of Nanjangud town, and patient number 104, who is a 27-year-old male and a resident of Nanjangud, are employees of the company who tested positive on Wednesday. However, a 33-year-old male, who is patient number 105, hails from Bengaluru and the primary contact of P-103.

Patient number 109 is a 63-year-old man who is the primary contact of P-52 and patient number 110 is the wife of P-52, who works in the quality assurance section of the company. All five confirmed cases had been isolated in the designated hospital in Mysuru.

Minister in-charge of Mysuru district V. Somanna, accompanied by Deputy Commissioner Abhiram G. Sankar and Superintendent of Police C.B. Ryshyanth, inspected the pharmaceutical company premises in Nanjangud and steps taken to contain the spread.

Tahsildar Mahesh said as many as 1,458 employees of the company had been placed in quarantine. Among them, 761 were from Nanjangud alone and the rest from Mysuru and other taluks. Some employees had been placed in government facility quarantine in hotels at Mysuru and Nanjangud, making all necessary arrangements, he added.

Mr. Ryshyanth said the police were keeping a close watch on those placed in home quarantine and they shall ensure none of them step out of their homes. There was no need for the public to panic, he added.

Later, in a press conference in the evening, Mr. Somanna said Nanjangud had been categorised in “red zone” by the Centre because of the growing number of cases linked to the company.

‘No community transmission’

The Deputy Commissioner clarified again that there was no “community transmission” with regard to the Nanjangud pharma company cases since the infected had been the primary contacts (colleagues and family members) of the first patient and others infected subsequently.

On the resistance from locals for keeping the employees in government facility quarantine set up in hotels and lodges instead of hospitals, Mr. Sankar said the contagion does not spread through air and the locals need not panic over the measures taken by the district administration. “Those in quarantine do not step out of their rooms as all facilities had been given to them. Do not resist the steps taken by us,” he said.

The DC said vegetables and other essentials can be transported to Kerala and Tamil Nadu through other routes such as Suttur and Gundlupet since entry and exit at Nanjangud had been blocked with the town declared as a containment area. No vehicles are allowed barring essentials supplied to the town.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-cases-soar-in-mysuru-as-five-test-positive/article31229933.ece
130,2020/04/01,"COVID-19 impact: In despair, farmers destroy crops in Karnataka","Supply-chain distortion of farm produce owing to the lockdown over COVID-19 has hurt both farmers and consumers. There have been reports from across the State of farmers, in despair, destroying their own crop.

Yogesh, a farmer who grew muskmelon in Sira, Tumakuru, said that with no labour for harvesting and no transportation facilities to take it to the market, his produce was left to rot in the field. “I gave all my fruits for free to whoever came to my farm. I spent another ₹10,000 to clear the land and throw away all the rotten fruits into a tank nearby,” he said.

Thimmanna B.G., a farmer who grew tomatoes at Hiriyur in Chitradurga, dumped 15 tonnes of his produce on a dry tank bed as he could not transport it to the market. “I invested ₹25 lakh, taking a loan of ₹17 lakh, only to throw my produce into a tank,” he said. He demanded that the government provide compensation to farmers.

In Belagavi, Azad Desai, a cabbage farmer from M. Mallapur village, let cattle graze on his one-acre cabbage crop that was ready for harvest, while, another farmer in the district ploughed through his cabbage field. At Shanivarasante in Kodagu, a farmer threw a truckload of chillies on to the street, while, over the last one week, several tomato growers dumped their harvest on the streets at the markets after it fetched only a pittance and there were no buyers in Kolar, Mandya and Tumakuru districts.

In Shikaripur, represented in the Assembly by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, and Sorab taluks of Shivamogga district, muskmelon and watermelon are rotting away in the fields. Prabhu Kumar C.B., a farmer from Shikaripur who has grown muskmelon of the Kohinoor variety on his two-acre plot, said, “Cracks have developed on the fruits owing to excess temperature. They are rotting in the field.”

Rangappa, a watermelon farmer from Sorab, said the owners of fruit mandis in Mumbai and Bengaluru had approached him in the second week of March to purchase his produce, but there are no takers now.

Labour shortage

Yet another problem is the severe labour crunch in villages. “Labourers and drivers are scared and are not coming to work. Moreover, watermelons and muskmelons are harvested by specialised labourers who come from outside; they have also stopped work,” said Srinivas, a farmer from Srinivaspura in Kolar.

There is palpable anger against the government and elected representatives over what is being called an “ill-planned lockdown” and the government not coming to the rescue of farmers. In a video clip doing the rounds, a worried farmer from Belagavi, Bhima Nayak, has made an appeal to the government. “We don’t want the government’s free LPG and rice. What I and other farmers like me need is a market for the produce that we have grown on our fields.”

Farmers’ leaders said the crisis has put the spotlight on the lack of adequate cold storage infrastructure in the State. “Farmers are dumping their produce because of the absence of cold storage facilities at most APMC yards. There is no security for farm produce in the country,” said the Mysuru-based farm activist Vasanthkumar Mysoremath.

Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, president of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, came down heavily on both the Union and State governments for “shedding crocodile tears” for farmers. “It is commendable that the governments are ensuring workers are paid despite being given off. But farmers are suffering huge losses for no fault of theirs. The government must ensure minimum support price for all crops, failing which it must provide compensation to farmers,” he said.

134,2020/04/01,MCC begins geo-mapping essential stores in Mysuru,"The challenges presented to daily life from the lockdown enforced to keep COVID-19 at bay has led the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) to begin geo-mapping of shops selling essential items including groceries, vegetables and fruits and dairy products, and medical stores, which can later be developed into virtual storefronts.

Though the present exercise is only aimed at helping people locate on the MCC’s app – My Clean City – the nearest grocery, vegetable or medical store open during the lockdown, MCC Commissioner Gurudatta Hegde said itwill help the citizens even after the lockdown period ends.

The Revenue Inspectors of MCC have begun physically geo-tagging each essential store in their respective localities by taking photographs and uploading the details including the telephone numbers. The essential stores are being categorised under Grocery Shops, Milk Booth, Pharmacy, Vegetable Stall, Fruit Stall, Hospitals, Petrol Bunks, and Super Markets categories on the My Clean City app.

Geo-mapping facilitates the authorities to also assess the supply side of essential commodities in each area of the city under the present circumstances. “We will know in which area the supplies are less. Or in which area the shops are not open. In such places, we can deploy pushcarts with essential supplies or make alternative arrangements like press into service a mobile store”, Mr. Hegde said.

Virtual storefront

A private initiative is underway to geo-map not only thousands of stores in Mysuru, but millions more across the country on cityonnet.com, an omni-channel marketplace, which seeks to provide a virtual storefront to its users.

The Mysuru-based founder of Cityonnet.com Satheesh Ramanna told The Hindu that it already had more than 300 grocery stores in the city under its Grocery and Staples category.

The stores listed in its website not only show the products available with them, but also the prices they are charging. Though the option of making purchases online and having them delivered to the doorstep of the user is still not available, Mr. Ramanna said users can contact the store and confirm if it can deliver.

The website, which is working on geo-mapping 4,500 stores in Mysuru, is also engaged in covering the stores across 650 cities in the country. “We are just out of stealth mode and in a Go to the Market state. We have provided a virtual storefront to more than a million stores and we are in the process of getting them activated”, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mcc-begins-geo-mapping-essential-stores-in-mysuru/article31229394.ece

On humanitarian basis, the Vijayapura district administration reportedly arranged for the transport of 2,400 workers from Rajasthan to safely reach their native places.

The workers, who were employed in different fields, wanted to go back to their native places but the lockdown had prevented their return.

Although Deputy Commissioner of Vijayapura district Y.S. Patil has neither confirmed nor denied making the arrangement, an officer attached to another government agency confirmed this. Speaking to The Hindu on condition of anonymity, he said the labourers were sent to Rajasthan in around 60 KSRTC buses along with six nodal officers.

The official clarified that the transportation was done after taking required permission from both State governments. The drivers took two days to reach the Rajasthan border. On return, the buses were sanitised, the official informed.

138,2020/04/01,Free milk for the poor and agri markets to remain open: Yediyurappa,"As the 21-day national lockdown entered the second week, the State government on Wednesday announced a slew of measures, including free distribution of unsold milk procured by Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) to the poor and the opening of all APMC and other agriculture-related markets for the benefit of farmers and consumers of essential items.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who chaired a high-level meeting of Ministers and senior officials, announced that excess milk procured by the KMF would be distributed to the poor and the slum residents in cities and towns through urban local bodies from Thursday.

The KMF procures nearly 69 lakh litres of milk daily, and about 42 lakh litres is being sold in markets. Of the remaining 27 lakh litres, the KMF uses nearly 20 lakh to produce byproducts. The excess 7 lakh litres will now be distributed to the poor during the lockdown. The government has paid ₹32 crore to the federation for purchasing this milk, at a rate of ₹36 a litre.

The closure of hotels, reverse migration from cities to villages, and the stoppage in transportation of milk to other States has resulted in the KMF procuring excess milk, a top federation official told The Hindu.

The CM also said there was no need to panic, as sufficient stockof iems was available and markets would remain open. He appealed to the public to purchase essential items needed only for 2-3 days at a time, while also practising social distancing.

He instructed Horticulture Department officials to open Horticultural Producers’ Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) outlets throughout the day in cities. To enable consumers to buy eggs, the government has directed HOPCOMS to sell them.

Market for perishables

For providing markets for perishable produce, Mr. Yediyurappa instructed the Deputy Commissioners of all districts to procure vegetables and fruits from farmers and make arrangements to sell them in urban areas. The police have been instructed to ensure the uninterrupted movement of essential goods.

All rice, dal mills and agricultural processing units will remain open. The government has directed the opening of cocoons markets in Mysuru region and in other parts of the State. Officials in the Agriculture Department have been instructed to pay special attention while dealing with farm inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides and seeds.

With many vegetables and fruits such as tomato, watermelon, muskmelon, and grapes being transported to markets in other States, the Chief Minister directed officials at check-posts to allow the entry of goods vehicles transporting farm produce. Stern action will be taken against officials denying entry to such vehicles. Steps have been taken to transport tomatoes to processing units, he added.

Liquor shops closed till April 14

Despite pressure from the liquor lobby to allow liquor shops to remain open during the 21-day lockdown, Mr. Yediyurappa on Wednesday said no liquor shops would be open till April 14.

Since the lockdown came into effect, the government has ordered the closure of all bars and restaurants, clubs and other outlets selling liquor. Though the sector brings in nearly ₹20,000 crore annually to the State exchequer, the Chief Minister has decided against the sale of liquor during the lockdown.

Defending the decision, Revenue Minister R. Ashok said, “We are providing only food, not liquor.”

In the neighbouring State of Kerala, seven people ended their lives, allegedly over the non-availability of liquor, and this forced the Excise Department in the State to issue passes to supply alcohol.

Compensation

Chief Minister also announced a compensation of ₹5 lakh to the family of a farmer who ended his life following crop loss during the lockdown. In case of crop loss to farmers during the period, the government will issue reimbursement, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ny5hmr/article31233311.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGBSY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/free-milk-for-the-poor-and-agri-markets-to-remain-open-yediyurappa/article31229028.ece

Even as the Mandya district administration is in a fire-fighting mode to combat the spread/outbreak of COVID, some miscreants on Wednesday triggered panic among the entire residents of Dodda Haranahalli in Mandya district by spreading a rumour of outbreak of a “yet-to-be-confirmed epidemic.”

Subsequent to the circulation of the rumour in electronic media as well social networking sites, senior officials from various departments rushed to the village in K.R. Pet taluk.

A thorough examination of health of villagers as well as quality of water being supplied proved that some electronic media scribes had fallen prey to messages on the issue that they received.

According to a message in social media in the afternoon hours, around 100 persons in the village were suffering from fever and cough. Soon, the message was widely circulated in the electronic media.

Stunned by the development, senior officials, including District Health and Family Welfare Officer H.P. Manche Gowda and Pandavapura Assistant Commissioner (Revenue) V.R. Shailaja and others rushed to the spot.

A good number of health workers, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA), and police and revenue department employees were also sent to the village. The health condition of all the 434 villagers from 82 families was examined.

A section of the media had reported that the villagers were hesitating to approach the Health Department fearing that they would be either quarantined or isolated, as many had returned from Mumbai and the Gulf countries. But, no one in the village is suffering from any [especially COVID-19] epidemic. It was hoax news, Mr. Manche Gowda told The Hindu.

Ms. Shailaja has requested the people not to spread rumours as the entire country is fighting the COVID-19.

The Tahsildar had also said in the report that the precautions taken by the Shiralakoppa Town Panchayat to prevent the spread of the disease were not satisfactory and had requested for appointment of an efficient person as chief officer of the urban local body.

Likewise, the patient number 104, who is a 27-year-old male and a resident of Nanjangud, also belonged to the same company. However, the 33-year-old male, who is the patient number 105, is from Bengaluru and was the contact of P-103.

All three confirmed cases had been isolated in the designated hospital in Mysuru. The number of COVID-19 cases has gone up to 17, including 15 cases from the company alone.

Meanwhile, Minister in-charge of Mysuru district V Somanna, accompanied by Deputy Commissioner Abhiram G Sankar and Superintendent of Police C B Ryshyanth, visited Nanjangud on Wednesday and inspected the pharmaceutical company from outside. The minister gave some instructions to the administration in this regard.

Mr Ryshyanth said the police were keeping a close watch on those placed in home quarantine and they shall ensure none of them step out of their homes. There was no need for the public to panic.

Nanjangud had been declared as a “containment area” with multiple cases and the entire town had been placed in 100 percent lockdown barring some essential services.

147,2020/04/01,Coronavirus lockdown: Karnataka govt. to distribute free excess milk to poor,"Liquor shops to remain close till lockdown period

As the 21-day COVID-19 lockdown entered the second week, the Karnataka government on Wednesday announced a slew of measures for the benefit of the farmers and consumers regarding essential items such as vegetables, fruits, eggs.

The State Government has decided to purchase excess milk procured by the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) and distribute it free of cost to residents residing in slums and poor people through urban local bodies from Thursday.

However, in a stern action, the Chief Minister said no liquor shops would be opened till the end of the lockdown period.

The Chief Minister, who chaired a high level meeting of comprised ministers and senior officers to discuss problems faced by farmers owing to lockdown in the wake of COVID-19, has instructed Deputy Commissioners of all districts to procure vegetables, fruits from farmers and make arrangements to sell in urban areas.

He also instructed Horticulture Department officials to direct open Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Societies (HOPCOMS) outlets throughout the day.

To enable consumers to buy eggs, the Government directed HOPCOMS to sell eggs.

“Vegetables are sold through HOPCOMs wherever possible in their outlets for the convenience of farmers as well as consumers,” he said.

The Chief Minister said he had given clear directions to the police to ensure the uninterrupted movement of essential goods. The government would reimburse the crop loss incurred by farmers during the lockdown period, he promised.

With many vegetables and fruits such as tomato, watermelon, muskmelon, grapes were being exported to other States, the Chief Minister directed officials at check posts to allow entry of goods vehicles transporting farm produce. Stern action would be taken against officials who deny entry of such vehicles, he said.

The centre has already announced that check posts to be opened for inter-statement movement of grocery and essential items. “We are in touch with Railway officials regarding exporting of perishable goods to other states” the Chief Minister said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/coronavirus-lockdown-karnataka-govt-to-distribute-free-excess-milk-to-poor/article31225356.ece

149,2020/04/01,CHC staff in Koppal refuse to treat patient with COVID-19 symptoms,"While doctor was away, nurse and other staff refused to come near the patient

In a case that shows how fear of COVID-19 is making medical care difficult to access for those with other ailments, the staff nurse and a ‘D’ Group employee at Kukanur Community Health Centre (CHC) in Yalaburga taluk, Koppal district, refused to attend to a patient who was presumed to have symptoms of the viral infection.

In the intervening hours between Monday and Tuesday, Rudrayya Basayya Salimath, 20, a resident of Channappanahalli village located about two km from the CHC, developed severe abdomen pain and breathlessness. He was brought to the State-run health facility around 12.30 a.m. His attenders told the staff that the patient “might have been infected with COVID-19” and requested them to quickly attend to him.

But the very mention of COVID-19 resulted in the staff quickly moving away from the patient. They then began advising the attenders to immediately take him to the district hospital in their private vehicle.

The staff also videographed the entire episode, which has since gone viral. The video shows the two caretakers struggling to handle the patient rolling on the ground in pain, while the nurse is heard advising them from a distance.

Taking serious note of the incident, Koppal Deputy Commissioner P. Sunil Kumar said that he would initiate action against the staff who refused to attend to the patient. “It was a simple case of stomach pain. But the staff nurse on duty complicated it. It was taken to be a case of COVID-19. I have asked for a detailed report, based on which action would be taken against the nurse,” he said.

Manjunath, Taluk Health and Family Welfare Officer, said that the patient was later taken to the district hospital in a government ambulance. “He got better before he reached the hospital. Now he is fine. The staff nurse on duty should have informed the night-duty doctor about the case instead of refusing to treat the patient and advising his caretakers to shift him to the district hospital. We are enquiring and will submit a report shortly,” told The Hindu.

Mr. Majunath clarified that the CHC had been provided with five Personal Protection Kits to handle the COVID-19 patients. He also added that the duty-doctor who was supposed to be in the hospital on night duty was not in there when the patient was brought. “People are in a state of panic and they tend to attribute even common cold, cough and breathlessness to COVID-19,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/i29ip3/article31233257.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGKOPPAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/chc-staff-in-koppal-refuse-to-treat-patient-with-covid-19-symptoms/article31225168.ece

151,2020/04/01,Coronavirus: Free ‘tele-consultation’ launched in Karnataka,"The Karnataka government launched a free tele-consultation initiative to help citizens obtain information regarding COVID-19 and for clarifications of any sorts with regards to the pandemic. Citizens will now be able to directly interact with doctors through telephonic conversation.

As a pilot project, it will be implemented in the Deputy Chief Minister Ashwanthnarayan’s constituency, Malleshwaram, which is then expected to be rolled out across the state in near future, a release said.

‘Tele-Medicine’ refers to the practice that allows for communication among medical doctors, which is permitted by our legal system. However, there was no provision for interaction with the general public and a doctor. Therefore, the law has now been amended and citizens are allowed to consult doctors through a phone call. The move has been adopted in the light of COVID-19 pandemic, to enable citizens to take advantage of ‘tele-consultation’, the release added.

Implementation procedure:

Citizens can directly contact doctors and specialists over phone for queries related to symptoms of COVID-19, related health problems or issues. The medical professional would note the symptoms described during the conversation and appropriate advice would be given. If necessary, the call will also be forwarded to a specialist, who will provide further information

The service is being provided by Portea Medical and its team of doctors would be available for public consultation between 8 am to 8 pm.. Arrangements have also been made to seek advice from doctors through the website.

158,2020/04/01,Youngsters join hands with admn. to feed the needy,"While the lockdown has forced people to stay indoors, a group of youngsters in Vijayapura ventures out twice a day not for fun but to feed the needy.

Till a few days ago carrying large bags containing food packets, these youngsters visited all major hospitals of the city twice a day to offer food free to patients admitted and also their attenders.

The youngsters have been doing this since COVID-19 pandemic broke out in the region. Now, their routine has changed a bit in the wake of restrictions imposed because of the lockdown and apprehensions about the spread of the pandemic.

They now hand over food to the municipal staff for distribution among the needy. The municipal staff, in turn, send it to localities where there are needy people and distribute it among them.

Some of these patients have been discharged from hospitals but are unable to travel back because of the lockdown, while others are still under treatment for various illnesses.

“We have identified such people in the city, and decided to offer food to these people as they have no means to get food. Several of them are poor and can’t afford to buying food in permitted eateries or takeaway centres,” said Azim Inamdar, founder of Kranti Association, a voluntary organisation.

“Earlier, the number was around 300. They were mainly destitute, but after the lockdown, others too are facing this problem. And, we extended our service to all those in need. The number increased to 700 and now it has gone up to 1,200,” he said. Interestingly, Deputy Commissioner Y.S. Patil had asked organisations to suspend such distribution in the wake of fear of volunteers becoming carriers of infection.

Instead, he said, they can join hands with the administration in doing the service in a proper manner. Since then, such help is routed through the administration and now, more people are being served.

Mr. Inamdar’s organisation is supported by philanthropists who have offered help by supplying vegetables, groceries and some financial assistance.

He wanted others to join hands with his organisation in an effort to serve more people in need.

160,2020/04/01,"HAL records turnover of ₹ 21,100 crore","Upbeat on new LCA, Sukhoi fighter orders

Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd recorded a provisional turnover of ₹21,100 crore for the financial year ended March 31, 2020. The amount is 7% more than the previous year’s turnover of ₹19,705 crore, the company said on Tuesday.

The latest profit figures, which should be on similar lines as sales, would be fully assessed in the coming weeks, HAL CMD R. Madhavan said. For 2018-19, profit after tax showed a year’s growth of over 14%.

The performance of 2019-20 has been achieved in spite of difficulties in cash flows, interruptions in operations due to workmen’s agitation and the interruption arising in March due to the COVID-19 related lockdown, HAL said.

Mr. Madhavan said during the new 2020-21 fiscal, HAL expects three orders — including the chunky and nearly sealed contract for 83 Light Combat Aircraft in the advanced Mark 1A version — to give its order book a “healthy position”.

The LCAs would be delivered over nine years from the signing of the contract.

The other two are an IAF order for 12 more Sukhoi-30MKI fighter planes; and a limited series production of 15 LCH (Light Combat Helicopters.) The latter is in the final stages of discussion.

It expects to spend around ₹1,400 crore in the new fiscal towards the LCA unit in Bengaluru, the helicopter complex in Tumakuru and an extension of its Su-30 repair overhaul facility at Nashik and Koraput.

During the year that ended, 13 ALHs were produced out of the Army’s contract for 40.

HAL said it has high expectations on the business prospects of the glass cockpit Dornier-228 civil transport plane. “The avionics upgrades of the Hawk trainer and Su-30 MKI fighter and the [latter's] BrahMos missile modifications would be a game changer for us,” it said.

HAL attributed the performance to the production of 31 new aircraft; 117 new engines; overhaul of 199 aircraft and 490 engines. It managed to sustain the growth rate and turnover in the current circumstances due to uniform production and project execution measures put in place by the company.

During the financial year, the company has also maintained uninterrupted supplies and services to the defence forces in spite of various constraints including cash flows. Mr.Madhavan said, “[The situation] has encouraged us to focus on cost optimisation measures, including indigenisation of components, increasing our outsourcing efforts and rationalisation of manpower.”

COVID-19 delays deliveries

The COVID-19 pandemic has shut down regular manufacturing activities across HAL centres due to the nationwide lockdown since March 24. The ongoing crisis has affected the final tests and certification of certain additional aircraft which were in final stages of production.

It has delayed customer trials of the first Advanced Light Helicopter customised for the Coast Guard with nine new systems. The ALH awaits a new date at Kochi.

The delivery of the first LCA-Tejas in the final operational clearance version has also been deferred from February. HAL expects to deliver it in April when operations resume.

While HAL and its staff have contributed ₹26.25 crore to the new PM's relief fund, the salaries of daily wage earners throughout the company are being paid in advance, HAL said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hal-records-turnover-of-21100-crore/article31222451.ece
161,2020/04/01,Bevco is all set for its new assignment,"Delivering booze at the doorsteps of alchohol dependants certified by government doctors

The Kerala State Beverages Corporation (Bevco) is waiting for alcohol passes to be issued by the Excise Department to finalise the plans to supply booze at the doorsteps of alcohol dependants. No such passes were received at the offices of Bevco on Wednesday.

On receiving the passes, Bevco will forward it to the warehouse concerned from where alcohol will be delivered at the doorsteps.

23 warehouses

There are 23 warehouses in the State and the nearest one will have to be identified. Staff and other facilities have to be mobilised for the exercise at the time of the national lockdown, said a senior Bevco official.

The initiative is likely to incur losses for Bevco as it will also have to hire vehicles for the door delivery, he said.

Besides the cost of alcohol, a service charge of ₹100 will be levied from the applicant.

The operational aspects of the unusual assignment will be fully known only when the alcohol passes are received, the official said.

The Excise Department did not process the 30 applications it received as it was a dry day on Wednesday.

A circular issued by the department asked senior officials to ensure that only applications certified by government doctors displaying signs of alcohol withdrawal symptoms need to be considered.

IMA, KGMOA move HC

Meanwhile, the Indian Medical Association's de-addition arm, National Mental Health Wing (NMHW), and the Kerala Government Medical Officers Association (KGMOA) moved the Kerala High Court against the government order.

In a petition, N. Dinesh, chairperson, IMA, said the decision was unethical. There are scientific ways to treat those with withdrawal symptoms. Giving them liquor is no solution. If proper treatments are given the syndrome can be fully cured. The government cannot abdicate their constitutional obligation to prevent alcohol and drug abuse. It said the order would send a wrong message that alcohol can be used as a medicine for treating the symptom, which is unscientific.

KGMOA leader Joseph Chacko said all doctors were together in the protest. It was decided to write the treatment protocol too if anyone came seeking certification for withdrawal symptoms.

He said it was against ethics to mention alcohol withdrawal symptoms without proper examination. Such a diagnosis requires a scientific approach and psychiatrists are the qualified medical professionals to give the correct diagnosis, Dr. Chacko said.

No compulsion: CM

Meanwhile, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the government had at no stage compelled government doctors to prescribe liquor to those habituated to alcohol. It had merely followed the pattern adopted by governments in other States which prohibited the sale of legal liquor. Mr. Vijayan said bootleggers, illicit brewers and spirit smugglers had stepped into the void caused by the non-availability of alcohol. He has instructed the Excise Department to prevent such elements from getting a foothold in the State.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/7mp3mw/article31231390.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02TVKZ-PROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bevco-is-all-set-for-its-new-assignment/article31231375.ece
162,2020/04/01,Ayurveda sector ailing under COVID-19 stress,"Steep fall in enquiries for impending Karkidaka season

Kerala’s Ayurveda and wellness tourism sectors, which contribute about half of the over ₹40,000-crore annual revenue from the tourism sector, are neck deep in a crisis owing to almost nil inflow of guests following the COVID-19 situation. There is a steep fall in enquiries for the impending Karkidaka season when demand generally peaks.

While popular stakeholders are hopeful that they can make good the slump through innovation and aggressive marketing in 2021, new resorts and clinics are in a catch-22 situation. “The crisis has hit the Ayurveda and wellness sectors like never before, although health professionals are laying emphasis on boosting immunity to overcome viral infections,” says Sajeev Kurup, president, Ayurveda Promotion Society.

Package sought

The two sectors had sailed past the Nipah outbreak and floods of 2018 and 2019. This time, COVID-19 has struck the markets that they rely on — especially Italy, Germany, France, and other European countries. All bookings till the end of April stand cancelled. It has to be seen whether there will be tourist inflow during the monsoon when different treatments are offered. Both Kerala Tourism and the Ayush Ministry must announce a package to bail out the affected stakeholders, many of whom launched their properties after securing big loans, Mr. Kurup says.

“Already, the Ayurveda and wellness sectors are feeling the heat owing to emerging competition from Sri Lanka. The sectors are critical from the forex point of view since guests stay put continuously for between 14 and 21 days, with each one spending between $100 and $400. Going by the trend, I feel that the sectors will remain badly affected till winter begins in Europe and the people begin to travel,” he says.

Hit by the standstill, the question mark remains on how employees are going to be paid, since the two sectors are highly labour-intensive.

“Thus, it is imperative that the State government temporarily suspend various minimum demand charges which stakeholders have to pay even if there is no patronage for their properties,” Mr. Kurup says.

Sources in Kerala Tourism say the key role played by Ayurveda and wellness will be re-emphasised in the agency’s road shows and other marketing initiatives so that Kerala does not lose ground to competitors.

163,2020/04/01,"Illicit liquor racket busted, three arrested","500 litres of illicit brew seized from Kollam, former excise officer among those arrested

Excise sleuths on Wednesday arrested three persons, including a former excise officer, on the charge of running an illicit liquor racket and seized 500 litres from their possession.

The arrested have been identified as Harish John (51), a resident of Kayamkulam, Rahul (27), of Kallumthazham, and Sanjayan (42), of East Kallada. A team led by Kollam excise special squad circle inspector I. Naushad made the arrests.

The operation was conducted following a tip-off received by Kollam Assistant Excise Commissioner J. Thajudeenkutty that OPR bottles, originally priced at ₹600, are available for ₹1,500 near Ayathil.

Deputy Excise Commissioner Jacob John instructed the special squad to conduct inspections and Rahul and Sanjay were caught with 28 litres of the illicit liquor. On questioning, it was revealed that the trio had been operating a manufacturing unit at Kareelakulangara in Kayamkulam.

Mixing flavours

In the raid conducted on a multistoreyed building rented by Harish John, the team found 480 litres of illicit liquor made by mixing different flavours in spirit. They seized 5,320 empty bottles, high-tech sealing machine used for sealing bottles, 50 empty containers used to store spirit and accessories for blending spirit.

The unit had fake labels of brands, including OPR, Jawan and Daddy Wilson, along with 7,210 fake holographic stickers of the Kerala State Beverages Corporation. Harish John, who was dismissed from the Excise Department for his connection with the illicit liquor lobby, said he had been running the unit for over a year procuring spirit from a smuggler in Palakkad. The flavours are from Goa and the labels are all printed in Sivakasi, he said. Excise inspector Rajeev, grade assistant excise inspector Santhosh and civil excise officers Sarath, Manu K. Mani, Sreentha, Rajagopal Chettiyar and Vishnu were part of the team that made the arrest.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/2xy1dl/article31231205.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02tvko-Counterfeitliquor,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/illicit-liquor-racket-busted-three-arrested/article31231206.ece

No congregation allowed

The police seized 177 vehicles and arrested 210 persons in connection with 211 cases registered in different parts of the district for violating the lockdown norms on Wednesday, according to District Police Chief (DPC) K.G. Simon.

In a statement here on Wednesday, Mr. Simon said the police would not allow grouping or congregation of people as it was against the lockdown norms.

People are supposed to roll out their vehicles to the road only in an emergency or unavoidable situation and strict action would be initiated against those who failed to comply with the lockdown norm.

167,2020/04/01,Tiding over tough COVID through paddy farming,"Award-winning farmer Bibin Varghese is cultivating five rice varieties in his three acres of land

Nothing can stop him from doing what he loves to do most.

Like others, Bibin Varghese, 25, of Karichal in Veeyapuram grama panchayat is strictly observing lockdown imposed in view of COVID-19 pandemic, but it has not prevented him from cultivating five rice varieties, including four rare species, in three acres of land near his house.

A final-year M.A. Sociology student, he says that working in paddy fields and growing vegetables is a huge stress reliever especially during hard times like these.

The inclusion of paddy harvesting, procurement and other related activities in the list of essential services has helped paddy farmers continue farm-related activities during the lockdown.

As a farmer and student at the same time, Bibin says that he gives equal importance to both.

“I have been doing paddy farming for the past four years. This year too, I prepared the fields and started rice cultivation even as I was getting ready for the fourth-semester examination. Although the spread of coronavirus disease has put a lid on my routine life, it has not affected farming. The crop will be harvested in three weeks and I am expecting a bountiful crop this time,” he says.

Apart from cultivating Jyothi, a common rice variety in this part of the region, in two acres, the young farmer has been growing Kalladiyaran, Valichoori, Mallika and Damarasali varieties in rest of the land. He is following organic farming practices. Bibin says that Damarasali with black leaves is being cultivated on an experimental basis.

“Apart from Jyothi, the other four varieties are not common to the region. I collected the seeds of Damarasali from Wayanad at a cost of ₹500/ kg. It is easy to digest. The cultivation of the particular variety will be extended next year based on the yield this year,” he says.

Besides paddy cultivation, the farmer cultivates a wide variety of veggies including beans, snake gourd, pumpkin, spinach and so on. He also raises cows for milk and dung. For his success in vegetable farming, the Veeyapuram panchayat has bestowed him with the best young farmer award.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/85nc4n/article31231190.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30tval1-farmer,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tiding-over-tough-covid-through-paddy-farming/article31230992.ece
168,2020/04/01,"State reports 24 new positive cases, 12 from Kasaragod","237 are currently under treatment in various hospitals

Kerala reported 24 new positive cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, nine of which are cases of people who had returned to the State from Dubai and Sharjah while the rest were all primary contacts of the imported cases.

Of the 24 new cases, 12 were reported from Kasaragod, three from Ernakulam, two each from Thiruvananthapuram, Thrissur, Kannur, and Malappuram, and one case from Palakkad.

Till date, the State has reported 265 cases of COVID-19, out of which, 237 are currently under treatment in various hospitals.

Briefing media, Chief Minister, Pinarayi Vijayan said that of the 265 COVID-19 cases reported by the State so far, 191 were imported cases (disease imported by people with a history of foreign travel or expatriates who returned to the State), while 67 cases were reported in the primary contacts of imported cases. Seven cases were that of foreigners who were tested positive while in Kerala.

Twenty-six people, including four foreigners, have since recovered from their illness and have been discharged while two people lost their lives.

At present, 1,64,130 people are under surveillance, of whom 622 are in isolation wards in various hospitals.

Mr. Vijayan said that in the next four days, Kasaragod Medical College Hospital would be fully equipped as a dedicated COVID care centre.

He said that the Health Department would be strengthening the mental health services and providing counselling online to people in quarantine. These steps were required to combat the issues of stigma and discrimination faced by some over their COVID-19 positive status as well as the misinformation campaign involving the disease

He added that the Health Department was making arrangements to ensure that vaccinations for children would go ahead without interruption.

Mr. Vijayan said that the current lockdown was definitely helping in imposing physical distancing and reducing social interactions and that this would help the State in its efforts to contain the epidemic.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/racto2/article31231018.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02TVTOTALSHUTDOWN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-reports-24-new-positive-cases-12-from-kasaragod/article31230970.ece
169,2020/04/01,Can Edamalakkudy fence out COVID-19?,"Social distancing is a way of life in the remote tribal grama panchayat in Idukki

Edamalakkudy, the remotest tribal grama panchayat inside the Munnar forest division, has a different story to tell during the time of COVID-19.

Life in the village goes on as usual, though there is awareness about the disease.

The community leads a reclusive life and there are many who hardly move out of the settlement in their lifetime.

No motorable roads

The panchayat is without motorable roads, telephone lines, or even shops other than the one selling essential items.

“There is no one among them who has settled abroad or outside the district. An important feature of their life is the physical distance they keep while mingling with those from outside the settlement. It is to be kept in mind that social distancing has been highlighted as a major part of the campaign to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” says an official of the grama panchayat.

Though the chances of contracting COVID-19 are remote in Edamalakkudy, as it is far away from human habitations, awareness campaigns have been held there as usual on the need for social distancing and respiratory and hand hygiene. “The speech of the Health Minister has been telecast and masks have been supplied through the Kudumbashree Mission,” he adds.

He said the community was aware of the disease and almost all families have radio as the main channel of information. Even prior to the awareness campaign initiated by the grama panchayat, the news on the spread of the virus had reached there.

“Essential commodities are ferried from Munnar, nearly 45 km away, by foot and taxis. Since there is strict control of the Forest Department for entry to Edamalakkudy, outside transactions are less,” he said.

Edamalakkudy grama panchayat president Govindaraj said students studying at the model residential schools in Munnar and Marayur had reached the settlements. The 24 hamlets in Edamalakkudy are spread over a wide forestland, at a distance of 3 to 10 km. Though some hamlets have over 20 families, there are hamlets such as Keezhpathamkudy that have less than five families.

No communication link

The total population of Edamalakkudy is around 2,500 and they all reach Societykudy for official needs. Though there is no communication link between the hamlets, local ward members coming to Societykudy know each other.

The womenfolk rarely move out of the settlements and are mostly engaged in farming activities there.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bufoc8/article31230870.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02tvedamalakudy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/can-edamalakkudy-fence-out-covid-19/article31230865.ece
170,2020/04/01,Film crew stuck in Jordanian desert,"Filmmaker Blessy has written to the government and the Kerala Film Chamber to take steps to ensure the return of a 58-member Aadujeevitham film crew, including actor Prithviraj, who are currently stranded in Jordan. Responding to the appeal, Culture Minister A.K. Balan has promised to take all necessary actions.

The crew had been shooting the second schedule of the film at the Wadi Rum desert in Jordan for the past weeks. According to a Facebook post by Prithviraj, the Jordanian authorities, who had earlier given a go-ahead for the shoot, revoked the same on March 27 as the prevailing restrictions in Jordan had to be further strengthened.

“We have now been told that an immediate permission for shoot to resume is unlikely due to the situation and hence our next best option would be to return to India at the first available opportunity. As we had originally planned to stay and shoot in Wadi Rum till the 2nd week of April, our accommodation, food and supplies are taken care of for the immediate future,” wrote Prithviraj.

He further wrote: “We completely understand that given the circumstances around the world, our team of 58 might not be the biggest concern of authorities back home now, and rightfully so. But we also felt that it was our duty to let all concerned know about the situation and keep them updated. There are thousands of Indians around the world waiting to get back home and we hope when the appropriate time and opportunity arrives, we are also able to come back to India.”

171,2020/04/01,Campaign to improve mental health,"‘Break the Chain Make the World’ campaign to overcome lockdown blues

After the ‘Break the Chain’ campaign to slow the spread of COVID-19, the lockdown in place has prompted the State government’s Social Justice and the Women and Child Development departments to launch another initiative aimed at the mental health of those who are home-bound for another two weeks.

Confined to their houses, people experience anxiety and stress in the absence of connections with family and friends. They may fear contact and refuse to step out, worry about supply of household commodities and medicines, stress about their jobs, or have financial concerns. Children, used to being active, may chafe at the isolation, causing stress within the family.

Spreading positivity

The new campaign ‘Break the Chain Make the World’ aims at improving the mental health of people who are isolated in their homes. Spreading positivity by sharing one’s creativity and talents with the community to create solidarity, thereby benefiting not only oneself but others too, is the message that the campaign gives out.

Be it painting, gardening, stitching, exercise, story-telling, poetry, calligraphy, music, dance or anything else that one takes up to keep engaged while spending time at home can be shared with the world as part of the campaign.

Story-telling or reading challenge or any other activity through which friends and family can be roped in are part of the campaign.

Announced on Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s Facebook page, the campaign has as its brand ambassador magician Gopinath Muthukad.

There is a ‘Kids Talk’ segment in which children will be able to share their experience of the lockdown and their jokes, stories, and poetry too.

173,2020/04/01,A tonsorial ‘challenge’ to beat the COVID lockdown,"With salons closed, people have to fend for themselves

The snip of scissors is barely audible in the corridors of city’s comfy salons these days during the lockdown. For many, the panic over COVID-19 has literally made their hairs stand on the end.

Thus, for men, the seemingly safer option now is to try a head shave without worrying about the hilarious makeover and the fun it will evoke among family and friends.

With the closure of salons in the city, served by hundreds of migrant labourers, many are now forced to do a haircut themselves with some finishing touches from the kin or friends. They feel that waiting till the end of the lockdown may transform themselves into unidentifiable figures.

“It was the first time in the past 40 years that we tried a head shave together. Like us, it was a surprise for our family members too. We did it as it was the best option available now to overcome this lockdown challenge,” say Biju Yedoothaman and his friend Shibu Mannil.

These East Hill residents say many of their friends too are now planning to follow suit.

M. Krishnadas, an auto driver from Pavangad, feels that shaven head fad is quickly catching up among youngsters in the city. “The closure of salons is creating an unexpected challenge though it is not being treated seriously. Only that this was an easy option to manage it in a sporty way,” he says.

According to him, his shaved head is now a favourite ‘plaything’ for his grandchildren.

“In Kozhikode city alone, we have 15 such IT professionals who have joined the Home Quarantine Shave (HQS) challenge . All of them are directors of various IT ventures in Kozhikode,” says Abdul Gafoor, secretary, Calicut Forum for IT (CAFIT).

The challenge will be complete only by donating a voluntary contribution to the Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund after posting an image of the shaved head in the HQS Facebook page and challenging another friend, he adds.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vuiy6n/article31230955.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200401-WA0016-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-tonsorial-challenge-to-beat-the-lockdown/article31230789.ece
174,2020/04/01,Matsyafed keeping all outlets open,"Fish sales fall from ₹30 lakh before lockdown to about ₹15 lakh a day

The apex fisheries cooperative Matsyafed is keeping all its outlets open as part of a Statewide effort to ensure availability of food items during the lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

A senior official said here on Wednesday that the cooperative operated 41 outlets and five mobile shops and had a sales turnover of around ₹25 to ₹30 lakh a day on normal days prior to the disease outbreak. However, the sales turnover had fallen steeply to about ₹15 lakh a day.

He said the drop in sales was due to the sharp fall in the number of customers visiting the counters. Besides, fish availability was a big problem. Only small fishing boats were now venturing out and most of the catch was sold at the locales where the boats reached shore.

No auctioning

Though no auctioning was allowed to prevent crowding, fishers were paid a previously agreed rate for the Matsyafed purchases. There was also a lack of variety of fish.

While a Matsyafed stall during normal times put up 20 to 30 varieties of fish, it had come down to four to five now, the official said.

“The outlets are being kept open to ensure that whatever fish stock is available with the cooperative is accessible to the people amid the three-week shutdown.”

The cooperative was able to keep the prices in check too with seer fish being sold for ₹800 in the State capital on Tuesday, while the price of the delicacy is around ₹900 to 1,000 a kg at times. Yellowfin tuna was selling for ₹300 a kg while a trevally variety (neduva) was selling for ₹450 a kg. Pearlspot was selling for ₹550 a kg. In view of the COVID-19 outbreak, the cooperative had decided to drop, for the time being, its plans to launch an online sales platform . If the lockdown continued for a longer period, Matsyafed would look to go online, said the official. The cooperative had planned to launch a mobile app for taking online orders ahead of the Easter-Vishu festive season.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/au5n6/article31230776.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TV02FISHERSSS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/matsyafed-keeping-all-outlets-open/article31230765.ece
175,2020/04/01,"Over 1,000 Indians stranded in Malaysia","Union govt. help for evacuation sought

Over 1,000 Indians, including 300 Keralites, are stranded in Malaysia due to the ban on international flights into the country as part of the restrictions to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Those stranded have been put up at safer locations, hostels, and hotels with the help of NGOs and community organisations.

Those who came on business trips, for holidaying, workers and their families, and senior citizens are among the stranded persons. As many as 70 are in a shelter of the Indian High Commission, Shaji Aboobacker, a native of Thrissur, said over the phone on Wednesday. Another 350 persons, mostly from Tamil Nadu, are at the airport in Kuala Lumpur.

“We have been knocking at the doors of the Indian Embassy and at the highest level in Kerala and Delhi seeking evacuation or permission to travel on the flights being operated by the Malaysian government from Kuala Lumpur to Indian cities to evacuate their nationals,” says Mr. Aboobacker, who came on a business trip to the Malaysian capital on March 10.

Mr. Aboobacker, managing director of the Nedumbassery-based Technoworld, said that he could not get Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on the phone to seek his intervention in the issue. Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraledharan was approached for assistance by his friends and well-wishers.

“The Indian High Commission informed us that it cannot give permission for us to travel back. The ball is now in the court of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Mr. Aboobacker said.

176,2020/04/01,14.5 lakh families get free rice,"Arrangements made to follow social distancing guidelines at ration shops

The distribution of free rice announced by the State government as part of the ₹20,000-crore special package turned out to be a big relief for 14.5 lakh families in Kerala on the launch day itself. Till 5 p.m. on Wednesday, 21,472 tonnes of rice was distributed across the State through 14,250 ration shops.

Though a large number of cardholders reached the shops early in the morning, there were arrangements in place to strictly follow the social distancing guidelines in view of the COVID-19 precautionary measures. Support of Anganwadi workers was sought in almost all shops to manage the crowd.

Till noontime, only Anthyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and priority ration cardholders were allowed to collect the rice based on card numbers. General and non-priority cardholders were allowed to enter the premises only in the afternoon.

Civil Supplies Minister P. Thilothman’s office said the portability facility for beneficiaries to secure their entitled foodgrain under the National Food Security Act from any fair price shop was availed by 2.80 lakh families across the State. If needed, the existing deadline of April 20 to complete the distribution would be extended to April 30, officials said.

The Minister’s office said the distribution of additional free quota sanctioned by the Union government would begin through the ration shops on April 20. It would be available only for yellow and pink cardholders. Civil Supplies Department officials said the distribution expenses would be borne by the State government.

Complaints

Amidst the rush to collect the free ration, complaints related to faulty weighing of foodgrain by some ration shop owners were brought to the attention of the Civil Supplies Department.

Apart from the free ration, the distribution of special kits comprising 17 essential items, including sugar and various grains, will begin soon through Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation’s (Supplyco) super markets. Supplyco officials said the kit, each worth ₹1,000, would be prepared using the facilities at 56 Supplyco depots.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pcyhk3/article31230709.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TV02RATIONSSS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/145-lakh-families-get-free-rice/article31230698.ece
177,2020/04/01,Drastic cut in non-Plan expenditure likely,"Planning Board discusses cut in salary of govt. employees

A drastic reduction in non-Plan expenditure, mainly rationalisation of salary bills of the government, is being seriously explored to mitigate the impact of the fiscal shock rendered by COVID-19.

The State Planning Board is understood to have discussed a cut in the salary of government employees and has concluded that none should be spared of the onus of sharing the impact of the virus outbreak that has battered the economy.

Political weapon

Though the Cabinet has approved a Salary Challenge for government employees, it may not elicit a positive response from all sections, mainly the Opposition United Democratic Front which has used it as a political weapon to target the government. Service organisations affiliated to the UDF too may toe a similar line.

In this context, it has been proposed to study the models put forward by the Telangana and Maharashtra governments.

Though the 11th pay revision commission headed by K. Mohandas has come into being and initiated the preliminary procedures, the commission may take a more realistic approach in the wake of the present crisis and may not make liberal recommendations, sources said.

Debt-servicing, payment of salary and pensions and administrative expenses are some of the main components of non-Plan expenditure.

Repayment of debts cannot be deferred. Hence, the government would have to drastically cut down on the administrative cost as part of the revenue mopping exercise.

This includes a cut in fuel bills, creation of posts, deputation of staff and even conduct of conferences, celebrations and such others. Putting a cap on all activities at one go may not be feasible, but the government would have to take a call on ending all wasteful expenditure to overcome the crisis.

Moreover, the virus outbreak has made it imperative for augmenting the infrastructure facilities in the health-care sector and that would again raise the demand for more resources, sources said.

178,2020/04/01,2 more positive cases in capital,"9 who attended Delhi meet tracked

The district continues to remain in a state of high alert with two more persons testing positive for COVID-19 and 185 others placed under surveillance on Wednesday.

The two patients, from Pothencode and Manacaud, had returned from the Gulf on March 22. The Pothencode native, who arrived from Sharjah, was listed among the primary contacts of a Malappuram man who was aboard the same aircraft and later tested positive for COVID-19.

The 61-year-old Manacaud native, who too arrived on March 22, had not displayed outward symptoms, but was under observation.

Meanwhile, nine people who returned after attending the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizamuddin in New Delhi also were tracked down on Wednesday. Samples have been rushed for tests.

On the brighter side, 347 people completed the 28-day observation period in the district without displaying COVID-19 symptoms. As on Wednesday, 17,981 persons are home-quarantined in the district. Seventy-seven people are under observation in various hospitals. As many as 111 samples were sent for tests on Wednesday.

Vigil at Pothencode

Stringent surveillance measures are in place at Pothencode panchayat that went into a three-week total lockdown on Tuesday following the death of a 68-year-old COVID-19 patient, District Collector K. Gopalakrishnan said.

Emphasising the need to prevent community spread of the disease at Pothencode and its neighbourhood, Mr. Gopalakrishnan urged residents to remain indoors and cooperate with the measures enforced by the district administration.

With people advised not to move out of their homes, the administration is enlisting the services of the Kudumbashree Mission to ensure doorstep delivery of ration materials. The residents can avail themselves of the service by dialling 0471-2730421, 9188527551, 8281573442.

The administration has sought the assistance of the Fire and Rescue Services to disinfect public spaces in the panchayat and surrounding regions. Steps are also being taken to perform COVID-19 diagnostic tests on more people, Mr. Gopalakrishnan said, adding that the administration expected the delivery of additional rapid test kits. As part of the clampdown, the police staged a route march in the panchayat.

167 arrested

The police said 167 people were arrested in the district on Wednesday for violating lockdown rules. Of this, 46 were arrested in the city limits. Thirty-six vehicles also were seized. In rural Thiruvananthapuram, 121 people were arrested and 85 vehicles were seized.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/54vdqc/article31231404.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02TVTVPADMANABHASWAMYTEMPLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/2-more-positive-cases-in-capital/article31230678.ece
179,2020/04/01,"Get Karnataka to remove blocks, HC tells Centre","‘Facilitate movement of vehicles carrying the sick from Kasaragod to Mangaluru’

A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Wednesday directed the Centre government to forthwith intervene and ensure that the blockades erected by the Karnataka on the National Highways that connects Mangaluru in Karnataka with Kasaragod in Kerala are removed to facilitate free movement of vehicles carrying persons for urgent medical treatment across the border.

A Bench comprising A.K. Jayasankaran Nambiar and Justice Shaji P. Chali passed the directive on a public interest litigation filed by the Kerala High Court Advocates Association seeking a directive to remove the blockade put up by the Karnataka government on the roads in the wake of the lockdown.

The court observed that arterial roads that connect Mangaluru to Kasaragod in Kerala, were part of the National Highway network and it was, therefore, the duty of the Central government to ensure that the these roads were kept free of blockades.

Fundamental right

“A citizen also has a fundamental right to life and personal liberty guaranteed to him by the State under Article 21 of our Constitution. Both these rights are simultaneously infringed in the case of a resident of the State of Kerala when he/she is denied entry into the State of Karnataka for availing medical treatment, or is deprived of essential articles of food that are being transported into the State through blockades erected by the State of Karnataka,” the court said.

The Bench further pointed out that “no doubt, restrictions may be imposed in times of a national emergency such as the present, but when the guidelines issued by the Central government under the Disaster Management Act itself permits travel for urgent medical treatment, then the said guidelines have necessarily to be enforced by the Central government through the removal of the blockades that prevent such travel.”

The court also added that India is a signatory to the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 12 of which obliges all State Parties to the Convention to recognise the right of everyone to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and to take steps for the creation of conditions which would assure to all, medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/get-karnataka-to-remove-blocks-hc-tells-centre/article31230313.ece
180,2020/04/01,Patient information to be classified,"CM flays effort by CPM activist to communicate with patients

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday frowned upon the attempt by a CPI(M) functionary in Kannur to send ‘get well’ messages to people in quarantine for COVID-19 treatment by illegally accessing their personal information, including mobile phone numbers.

Mr. Vijayan said the person had no right to obtain the personal information of COVID-19-affected persons and communicate with them at the current juncture.

He asked authorities to treat personal data of COVID-19 patients as classified information.

Mr. Vijayan said the State wanted the Centre to bring police officers, emergency service providers, health workers, LPG delivery persons and pain and palliative care providers under its COVID-19 insurance scheme. He also demanded embassy assistances for nurses and labourers working in the Gulf.

181,2020/04/01,NFF seeks financial aid for fishers,"Forum wants Centre to scrap Aadhaar condition for eligibility

The National Fishworkers Forum (NFF) has sought a monthly allowance of ₹10,000 each for fishing households for up to three months, given the COVID-19-related losses in the fishing sector and the impending monsoon season trawling ban.

In a letter to Union Minister of State for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Pratap Chandra Sarangi, NFF chairperson Narendra R. Patil and general secretary T. Peter said the condition that Aadhaar-linked bank accounts were a pre-requisite for providing financial assistance to fish workers should be scrapped.

In a March 30 letter, the Union Department of Fisheries had requested States and Union Territories to ''ascertain and confirm'' that all affected fishermen, fish farmers, fish workers and vendors had accounts with Aadhaar linkage.

“Since most of the fish workers and some of the fish vendors have been issued licences/ fisher ID cards, these can be verified with the respective State/UT authorities in coordination with the trade unions of fish workers as well as other associations,” the NFF leaders said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nff-seeks-financial-aid-for-fish-workers/article31229557.ece
182,2020/04/01,60 from Tablighi centre quarantined,"CM warns against stigmatising groups for pandemic

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday said the government had quarantined at least 60 persons who had returned to Kerala from the Tablighi Jamaat centre at Nizamuddin in New Delhi in early March.

Mr. Vijayan said there was no cause for panic. The State had foreseen their return and ensured their quarantine. The police had helped identify and trace them.

Mr. Vijayan said the centre had organised meetings before the national lockdown. Scores of people in Kerala had visited the centre as part of their belief. The situation was the same in religious places of worship of other faiths in the country.

Divisive attempts

He said COVID-19 knew no religion or geographical boundaries. The government had stumbled upon attempts by some divisive elements to stigmatise people of a particular faith for the pandemic.

The State would not tolerate such devious attempts to assign blame to persons of a specific faith for spreading the infection. It would prosecute those who resort to such malicious propaganda. Such aggressive and communally charged messages have no place in a secular democracy.

Stranded film crew

Mr. Vijayan said the government had sought the help of Union Ministry of Home Affairs to extend aid to a film crew, including director Blessy and actor Prithviraj, who were stranded in Jordan due to the ban on international travel.

They had gone there as part of a cinema shoot. The Indian Embassy in Jordan has reached out to them and ensured their welfare.

Mr. Vijayan said the German government had conveyed its appreciation of Kerala’s efforts to track down 232 of its citizens spread out in Kerala during the epidemic.

185,2020/04/01,Milma to restart procurement today,"Tamil Nadu agrees to allow Milma convert unsold milk into milk powder

The crisis surrounding milk procurement in north Kerala was addressed to a large extent on Wednesday with Tamil Nadu agreeing to allow Milma convert unsold milk into milk powder in that State. The Kerala government announced measures to help Milma.

Following government-level discussions, Tamil Nadu has agreed to let in two truckloads - approximately 50,000 litres - daily for conversion into milk powder. Nearly 70% of the milk procurement would be restored by Thursday, the Malabar Regional Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union (MRCMPU) said on Wednesday.

The MRCMPU collects approximately six-lakh litres of milk daily from six north Kerala districts. Sales, however, had plumetted on account of the COVID-19 lockdown. Following the dip, the MRCMPU had been converting the unsold quantities into milk powder in units in Tamil Nadu. However, on Monday, Tamil Nadu had closed the doors on milk vehicles from Kerala citing COVID-19 concern.

Faced with a sudden glut, the MRCMPU was forced to declare a holiday for milk procurement on Wednesday much to the dismay of dairy farmers. The State government had taken up the matter with Tamil Nadu on Monday itself on being apprised of the situation by Milma.

On Wednesday, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said part of the remaining unsold milk would be distributed to migrant labourers stuck in labour camps in the State. Mr. Vijayan urged the public to help Milma out by purchasing milk and milk-based products. The products, he said, would be made available through Consumerfed outlets.

Tamil Nadu aside, the MRCMPU plans to send consignments to Guntur in Andhra Pradesh for milk powder conversion. But this plan is fraught with problems due to the large distance involved.

186,2020/04/01,Banks told to hold back currencies for two days,"All notes will be recycled only after 48 hours

Unable to find suitable disinfectants for currency notes, banks have been asked to hold back the “inward remitted currencies” in packets for 48 hours before recirculating them. The notes shall be separately wrapped in packets with dates marked on them. These notes shall be recycled only after 48 hours, according to an advisory issued by N. Ajit Krishnan, convener of the State Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC), Kerala.

The advisory was issued on Wednesday after the SLBC “inferred” that currency notes could be a probable source for the spread of COVID-19. The health authorities had informed the committee that the virus could survive on notes for a maximum period of 12 hours.

Incidentally, the State government had announced that currency notes and coins shall be disinfected considering the possibility of virus remaining live on its surface for some time and the exchange of coins and currency notes contributing to the spread of the disease.

“We searched in vain for a suitable method for disinfecting the currency notes. Chemical washing using is not advisable as it will damage the notes. Fumigation could be an option. However, no agency has come forward with a viable method or a process to fumigate the notes, which are stored in the around 100 cash chests of banks across the State. Throwing open the chests, which are high security areas, for fumigation is also a matter of concern,” Mr. Krishnan told The Hindu.

Though it was suggested that the virus cannot survive on currency notes beyond 12 hours, the committee fixed the hold back period as 48 hours as an abundant precaution. While holding back the currencies, the banks would try to issue fresh notes to its customers. The Reserve Bank of India too offered to supply fresh notes, Mr. Krishnan, who is also the general manager of Canara Bank, said.

Coins should also be thus held back in the respective banks before re-circulating them. The SLBC is open for any proposal for disinfecting notes, including fumigation, he said.

The SLBC asked the banks to ensure the safety of its staff by asking them to wear masks, gloves, use sanitisers and practice social distancing.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/banks-told-to-hold-back-currencies-for-two-days/article31227830.ece
187,2020/04/01,"Coronavirus: UDF opposes salary challenge, says CM’s relief fund not credible","State should create a separate Treasury account to deposit endowments received from the public for combating the pandemic, says Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala

The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) Opposition on Wednesday crossed swords with the Kerala government over the “unilateral” decision of the Cabinet to “appropriate a month’s salary” from State employees to augment the Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund (CMDRF) “purportedly” to tide over the financial crisis brought about by the COVID-19.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala faulted the government for not taking service organisations into confidence before deciding to make it obligatory for government employees to forfeit their wages under the “profoundly unpopular” nomenclature “Salary Challenge”.

Active politics seemed to resurface after a pause in Kerala with Mr. Chennithala stating that he had no trust that the government would use the endowments received by the CMDRF solely for combating the pandemic situation.

The CMDRF could be used for any end thought fit by the government. He demanded the State create a separate Treasury account to deposit endowments received from the public for combating the pandemic.

Flood relief

Flood relief channelled from the CMDRF in 2018 and 2019 had “by-passed eligible persons”. It mostly benefited the Communist Party of India (Marxist) members and sympathisers who did not qualify for the aid, he alleged.

Past experiences had proven that the Left Democratic Front (LDF) singularly lacked the political propriety to rise above partisan politics in the time of national adversity.

The government’s “name is mud” after the police revealed that the CPI (M) in Ernakulam had used the accounts of a party-controlled service cooperative bank to siphon off flood relief funds from the CMDRF by faking the identity of beneficiaries, Mr. Chennithala alleged.

The government had stacked the deck in favour of ruling front constituencies when allotting cash for the repair of flood-hit village roads, he charged.

Mr. Chennithala asked the government to exempt essential services from the salary challenge.

“The CM daily counsels people to be spartan during the lockdown. However, he has no qualms in sanctioning ₹ 2 crore at this juncture to hire a helicopter for VIP travel. There is a dichotomy between what this government sermonises and what it practises,” he said.

188,2020/04/01,Ajmal Sabu from Kerala on creating the video of Donald Trump supposedly crooning 'Mappilapattu',"The editor-cinematographer has a popular Instagram page 'cuts.zzz' dedicated to such mash-up videos

Perhaps one of the most forwarded videos on social media during this lockdown has been US President Donald Trump ‘singing’ Mappilapattu. In this video, which has got 4.25 lakh views on Instagram page, 'cuts.zzz', the president is depicted singing a traditional folk song of the Muslim community in Kerala, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, First Lady Melanie Trump, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and thousands of people cheering him on.

The “mash-up video” features the filmi version of the popular Mappila song, ‘Aminathathede Ponnumolaanu’, from the Malayalam movie Honey Bee 2.5, sung by actor-director Lal. The mastermind behind the video is editor-cinematographer-director Ajmal Sabu. With accolades coming in from the world over for his editing skills in creating the impression that Trump himself is singing those lines, the 24-year-old is on a high. The viral video has so far got over eight lakh views on Facebook as well.

“I didn’t expect such a reach for the video. I am getting messages from across India and even abroad,” says Ajmal over phone from his home at Changanassery in Kottayam district. He adds, “My professional commitments have been stalled due to the lockdown. So, instead of wasting time I thought of doing something interesting. I came across this song in a video my friend had sent me. I was hearing that version of the song for the first time and felt that I should put it to use somewhere. As the ‘Namaste Trump’ event at Sardar Patel Stadium in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, was a much-discussed event, I thought of giving it a try. And it clicked!” says the 24-year-old.

Mass appeal

Ajmal started his Instagram page for mash-up videos two years ago and most of them have gone viral. There are over 50 videos on the page, with another popular one being American wrestler and WWE superstar Big Show and WWE’s chief branding officer Stephanie McMahon supposedly saying the dialogues of Nakulan (Suresh Gopi) and Ganga (Sobhana) from an iconic scene in the Malayalam movie, Manichitrathazhu.

Fact file An alumnus of Maya Academy of Advanced Cinematics in Pune, from where he learnt animation, VFX and post production, Ajmal started out as a cinematographer with a Marathi film, Dhap. He was an assistant director in the Malayalam films Kappirithuruthu and Love Action Drama. He has also been a spot editor and is much sought-after in Malayalam film industry for making promo cuts, teasers and trailers of movies. He has directed short films and has done cinematography and editing in music videos, short films, documentaries and ad films.

He is all set to turn independent as an editor and cinematographer with a Malayalam film. “If the lockdown wasn’t there, the shoot would have begun on April 10. It is a good project and I still can’t believe that I am doing it,” he says.

The first mash-up video he created was of the Joker-Batman scene from The Dark Knight with dialogues from Maheshinte Prathikaram, picturised on Soubin Shahir and Alencier. Among other videos that fetched lakhs of likes are those of Bruno Mars dancing to the tune of ‘Margazhiye malligaye’ from Megham, Rihanna’s video with the track of Popy umbrella ad, scene from Guardians of Galaxy with dialogues from Aniyathipravu and Modi’s speech at a rally with lottery announcement.

Ajmal says that there is no short cut to creating these videos. “It takes several hours to mix and match the scenes. I spent seven to eight hours on the Trump video alone. If you are taking a song or dance number, matching rhythm and steps are not that difficult. But the toughest part is lip sync. It is possible to experiment with all videos. However, you have to keep on trying to get the perfect match,"" he says, adding, “At the same time you shouldn’t compromise on humour.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bh204o/article31227191.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04tvmajmal-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ajmal-sabu-from-kerala-on-creating-the-video-of-donald-trump-supposedly-crooning-mappilapattu/article31227192.ece
189,2020/04/01,Sri Lankan hip hop artiste ADK: ‘Lityananda is not Nithyananda’,"ADK aka Dinesh Kanagaratnam on his latest track, which has verses as a cheeky critique on the fugitive godman

It was a whim, and the question of “whatever happened to him?”, that prompted me to look up ADK, more famous in Tamil Nadu as Dinesh Kanagaratnam, on Instagram.

The Sri Lankan hip hop artiste, who shot to fame after remixing Ceylon Manohar’s ‘Surangani’ (which then found its way to Tamil cinema, courtesy Vijay Antony, as the song ‘Aathichudi’ in the 2009 film TN-07 AL 4777), had popped up in my playlist for a track named ‘Lityananda’.

Of particular interest to me was the character featured on the track’s poster; the art bearing an eerie likeness to the self-styled fugitive godman Nithyananda who fled the country last year after being charged on counts of rape, child abuse and kidnapping. Nithyananda, then, infamously, set up a micronation named Kailasa — believed to be on an island he purchased, and has holed up in this place, the whereabouts of which have yet to be conclusively established, along with his followers.

Divining inspiration

I reached out to Dinesh, who is presently stationed in Singapore, where, unlike many major cities across the world, no lockdown restrictions have been enforced.

He makes it clear that ‘Lityananda’, with its quirky and funny double entendre lyrics, is by no means a misplaced tribute, or anything remotely close to it, for a personality who is on the run from law enforcement.

“I don’t believe anybody who calls oneself God. I’m aware that this song will definitely attract negative comments from his ‘devotees’, but I just wanted to make people laugh. During this time, when everyone’s minds is on the pandemic, I did not want to do a song on the Coronavirus. I wanted to make a song on someone who escaped the virus,” he laughs, and adds: “If you think about it, [Nithyananda] had the foresight, didn’t he? He knew he had to quarantine. That is why he ran.”

It was the “lyrical” nature of Nithyananda’s now infamously famous social media sermons that inspired Dinesh to write ‘Lityananda’. “I used to have a good laugh listening to what he spoke, and though all of us mock him, it was inspiring. All kinds of people inspire my creative irrespective of whether they are good or bad,” he says.

Lityananda’s verse reflects this sentiment albeit in a tongue-in-cheek manner. Sample this line: “Kailasam pogalam jollya oyla, OLA-willa booku panni all ah pogalama, Somarasam irukudu kinnathila baama, Kudicha John Cena can see me how ma.”

But using a third party’s likeness to promote material seldom is a straight path. It could attract legal troubles. “But it isn’t Nithyananda who is on the poster,” says Dinesh; his response prompting me to take another look at the art design. “It is me in that photo,” he adds.

Dinesh explains thus: “If you are an actor and you wish to impersonate someone, then you need to look at least 90% similar to that person. I have long held an acting desire, and since I cannot be a part of a feature film, I thought I could be in the poster. And Lityananda is not Nithyananda. He is another godman,” laughs Dinesh.

A few regrets

Dinesh collaborated with music producer OfRo, known for his work in filmmaker Pa Ranjith’s The Casteless Collective and his association with the Tamil rapper Arivu on the independent album Therukural, for ‘Lityananda’.

OfRo/Rohith Abraham | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

“OfRo (real name Rohith Abraham) is a crazy, super cool guy. We met a long time ago in Harris Jayaraj’s studio.” Dinesh had crooned for ‘Universal Cop’ track for Suriya’s Singam franchise film, S3. “We were supposed to do a song four years ago but I couldn’t concentrate as I was working with many music producers at that point. In fact, I did graphic design on Therukural,” says Dinesh, who is an art director by trade.

I mention that “Tamil Twitter” (the colloquial collective noun used to refer to twitterati tweeting on Tamil popculture content) had been raving about ‘Aathichudi’ in the last few days. When Vijay Antony came across Dinesh’s remixed version of ‘Surangani’ (which predates YouTube’s rise to popularity), he wanted to incorporate it in a Tamil film.

Though it introduced him to the Tamil film industry, Dinesh has a few regrets over how ‘Aathichudi’ turned out. “When I worked with AR Rahman in Kadal, I was credited as Aaryan Dinesh Kanagaratnam. I adopted the stage name ADK for my hip hop work,” he says. Being credited differently in various platforms hits the brand building process, and Dinesh suffered as a result. “I wish more people knew it was I who had sung ‘Aathichudi’ because 10 years later I’m standing in the same place where I started, and I’m still trying to make a difference to music,” he adds.

But the mainstreaming of hip hop music in Tamil films is happening, especially since the rise to prominence of musicians like Hip Hop Tamizha. More opportunities are being offered to artistes like Arivu (who was the voice behind ‘Vaathi Raid’ in Vijay’s upcoming film Master directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj). But Dinesh says he prefers to be “picky” with whom he chooses to work with in the future. “I don’t do vocals for money. I want this culture of rap being a filler in songs to change; rap needs to be a mainstream act. For these reasons, I think I’m done with film in India unless it is Rahman or Yuvan Shankar Raja or Anirudh,” he says.

For now, though, Dinesh is busy writing a script, and is collaborating with Yuvan Shankar Raja to create “either a web series or a feature film”.

“I’m making use of the Coronavirus period to write my script,” he concludes.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/qnt1vs/article31226896.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPDinesh,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sri-lankan-hip-hop-artiste-adk-lityananda-is-not-nithyananda/article31226903.ece
190,2020/04/01,Kannada actor-filmmaker Guruprasad starts new Facebook show to combat COVID-19 lockdown,"The film personality goes live on social media to tickle your funny bone with a 21-day series called 'Hasya Vratha'

Although Kannada film director, Guruprasad has many films to his credit, his name is synonymous with Mata and Eddelu Manjunatha. Both these films went on to become blockbusters. Jaggesh plays the lead roles in both the cult films. Guruprasad even won the Karnataka State Film Award for the best screenplay and the Filmfare Award as the best director in 2009 for Eddelu Manjunatha.

Mata dealt with the mutts and Eddelu Manjunatha was about a lazy man. The Guruprasad-Jaggesh duo come together again after 10 years for Ranganayaka. “This will also be an outrageous comedy and will keep you in splits,” the director says with a laugh. Guruprasad has kept himself busy not just directing films, but also doing cameos in films and being a part of reality shows on television.

Now, with the lockdown due to COVID-19, the director has started a comedy series on his FB page — Guruprasad Manjunatha. The series, titled Hastya Vratha will be on till the lockdown ends. On the show, which streams at 9 pm every night, Guruprasad talks to people about films, the virus, safety, God, how to deal with the lockdown, music and more.

“There is a new topic everyday. The idea is to entertain people and make them laugh. Every one is talking about the virus. I would like to bring in some comic relief to people who are bombarded with COVID-19 news.”

Guruprasad says the cinema he covers on the show, is the result of his three-decade long research on cinema. “Normally I share this material in my school, Guruprasad Scriptwriting and Film Direction, but now I felt it will make the show interesting as many of my followers are film buffs.”

Guruprasad is a firm believer in the art of comedy and believes it is his mission to make people laugh. “I don’t like violence on screen as it sends out a wrong message. I feel it is cheap to portray violence on screen as it promotes the philosophy that it is okay to wield a machete. Comedy is difficult but we can make a point using humour.”

Describing his show as a direct interaction with his audience, Guruprasad says, “There is no censorship of any kind.” Being in lockdown is not new to him, the director says. “When I was writing my first film, Mata I was in isolation at home for six months. While working on Eddelu ... I worked alone for almost three months. So sitting at home is not an issue for me. Currently, I am again using this time to work on my new film Ranganayaka, which will take off as soon as things return to normal. The film is also a comedy and will be a treat for Jaggesh’s and my fans.”

The actor-director also believes “it is natural for man to live in harmony with nature. I feel we overstepped the boundaries in the way we travelled and lived. Take the people of Bengaluru itself. We travel for two to three hours to get to work. How unnatural is that? It is a waste of time and energy. How can this be good or even right? I hope now we realise our folly and treat nature with more caution and live more wisely.”

He applauds the government, police and the medical staff for “being out there in the forefront and managing the lockdown.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/79ep8/article31226857.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200331-WA0017,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kannada-actor-filmmaker-guruprasad-starts-new-facebook-show-to-combat-covid-19-lockdown/article31226860.ece
191,2020/04/01,"‘Keeping Up with the Kardashians’ finale shot using iPhones, says Kim on Jimmy Fallon","The finale of the current season would serve as an isolation diary, said the reality show star, who is married to Kanye West

The season finale of the popular reality show Keeping Up With The Kardashians has been completed using not professional cameras, but iPhones.

Reality TV star Kim Kardashian and her family had to turn to their iPhones to film the season finale owing to the coronavirus lockdown, reports aceshowbiz.com.

Production on the current 18th season of the series was shut down just before Kim and her relatives were able to shoot the last episode.

Kim said on a video chat with comedian Jimmy Fallon in an episode of “The Tonight Show: At Home Edition”, that the finale would serve as an isolation diary.

“We filmed the entire season except for the last episode. So now that we’ve shut down production, it’ll be all of us in quarantine filmed separately by ourselves. We have tripods set up, and our iPhones, and the whole last episode will be what we do in quarantine... I literally have no idea what everyone else has been doing!” she said.

Kim said that she had broken her self-isolation to get her youngest sister Kylie Jenner, to help her get camera-ready for the remote “Tonight Show” chat, conducted at the home of their mother Kris Jenner.

The reality star, who is married to rapper Kanye West, admitted she had not met Kylie over weeks.

“That’s the first time I’ve seen her, because the whole family is distancing so we haven’t even seen each other. So I snuck out and I’m at my mum’s house in her glam room because there’s a door from the outside, so this is all she’ll let us in,” she grinned.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ko5a4o/article31226746.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kardhash,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-finale-shot-using-iphones-says-kim-on-jimmy-fallon/article31226747.ece

195,2020/04/01,Prithviraj Sukumaran on being stuck in Jordan: ‘We will wait for the appropriate time to come back to India’,"The Malayalam actor is at a desert camp in Wadi Rum, along with a 58-member cast and crew team of his film ‘Aadujeevitham’

Malayalam star Prithviraj Sukumaran who is currently stuck in Jordan with a 58-member cast and crew team of his film Aadujeevitham has given an update on their situation.

With a message via brother Indrajith, the actor-director shed light on the issues they are facing, which prompted his film’s director Blessy to request the Film Chamber as well as the Kerala CM to help bring them back to India.

Prithviraj said in his message, “Hello all. Hope everyone is holding up and doing their best to stay safe during these tough times. On 24/03/2020, the shooting of Aadujeevitham in Jordan was temporarily stopped due to the prevailing circumstances. But after an appraisal of our situation, the authorities were convinced that our unit was isolated and operating safely within the confines of the Wadi Rum desert, and hence, we were given a go-ahead for the shoot.”

He added that soon after, the prevailing restrictions in Jordan had to be further strengthened as a precautionary measure and as a result, their shoot permission was revoked on March 27. “Following that, our team has been staying at the desert camp in Wadi Rum. We have now been told that an immediate permission for shoot to resume is unlikely due to the situation and hence, our next best option would be to return to India at the first available opportunity,” explained the actor-director.

Prithviraj explained that the Aadujeevitham team had originally planned to stay and shoot in Wadi Rum till the second week of April, with their accommodation, food and supplies taken care of for the immediate future.

“But obviously, what happens beyond that timeline is a matter of concern. We have a doctor in our team who’s carrying out medical check ups for each member of the crew every 72 hours, and we are also subjected to periodic check ups by a government-appointed Jordanian doctor. We completely understand that given the circumstances around the world, our team of 58 might not be the biggest concern of authorities back home now, and rightfully so. But we also felt that it was our duty to let all concerned know about the situation and keep them updated.”

Prithviraj added that he understood that there are thousands of Indians around the world waiting to get back home, and that he hopes when the appropriate time and opportunity arrives, they will also able to come back to India. “Till then, I hope all of you stay safe and let’s collectively hope and pray that life gets back to normal soon,” he concluded.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/hi8sos/article31225014.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ayyapan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/prithviraj-sukumaran-on-being-stuck-in-jordan-we-will-wait-for-the-appropriate-time-to-come-back-to-india/article31225015.ece

199,2020/04/01,"Actor Prithviraj Sukumaran’s ‘Aadujeevitham’ team stuck in Jordan, requests return to India amid coronavirus pandemic","Director of the film has written to the Film Chamber and Kerala government, hoping for their 58-member team to travel back

Filmmaker Blessy, the director of Malayalam actor Prithviraj Sukumaran’s next film Aadujeevitham, has written to the Film Chamber requesting help for their 58-member team from Jordan — where the shooting of their film was underway — and to ensure their return to India.

The team of Aadujeevitham, including Prithviraj and some of the other lead actors, had been filming their second schedule in Jordan's Wadi Rum the past few weeks, and had got permission from officials in Jordan to continue shooting into the second week of April. But after one of the Omani actors on the team was quarantined along with his translator, and with the coronavirus spread getting more severe, the Jordan government reversed its decision to allow the shooting to progress.

Now, the team of the film are stranded in the desert, and the Film Chamber has requested the Kerala government and Chief Minister’s office to help rescue them. Reportedly, Blessy also relayed the fact that the team had a concern on food shortage as well as growing threat of infection. Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan had earlier enquired about the Aadujeevitham team via the Indian embassy in Jordan.

Earlier, Prithviraj Sukumaran had posted a note on social media, stating that they were continuing the shoot in Wadi Rum as all international flights operating in and out of Jordan had been cancelled, and since their location was only a few minutes outside their camp. He added that all medical and safety measures had been taken and that two of their actors were in precautionary quarantine as well.

Aadujeevitham (The Life of a Goat) is a survival, based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Benyamin. The film stars Prithviraj Sukumaran as Najeeb, an Indian immigrant worker in Saudi Arabia, who gets stranded in the middle of the desert. Resul Pookutty is the sound designer, A. Sreekar Prasad is the editor, and the cinematography is by K. U. Mohanan, with the soundtrack by A.R. Rahman.

200,2020/04/01,Captive audience: film festivals come home,"Dharamshala International Film Festival sets up online viewing room on its website, where it will be streaming its alumni’s films, free of cost to viewers across the world.

“Bringing independent cinema to the mountains” has been the catchline of the Dharamshala International Film Festival (DIFF). Now, it’s unspooling the indies on a computer, laptop, mobile or tablet near you. In a unique attempt in the Indian film festival circuit, DIFF set up an online Viewing Room on its website on Tuesday, where it will be streaming its alumni’s films, free of cost to viewers across the world.

DIFF will be showcasing a set of four to six films every couple of weeks.

The idea of sharing the films that the festival has showcased over the years took root ten days back. “Seeing the situation, the fact that everyone is at home, we thought of doing something positive,” says festival director and filmmaker Ritu Sarin. They reached out to the alumni filmmakers and were overwhelmed by the tremendous response they got in return.

“With COVID-19 reshaping the world, we have been thinking about how to reach out [to the DIFF regulars and patrons] and at the moment the filmmakers also don’t know what the future holds for them,” said Ms. Sarin. The idea then, for all, has been to keep up the spirits and seek inspiration in these uncertain times in cinema itself.

The entire venture is being run on the goodwill between the filmmakers and the festival. “DIFF is run by a no-profit trust. It’s [Viewing Room] in keeping with the spirit of the festival,” said Ms. Sarin.

The programming, too, reflects the festival’s thrust — politically and socially conscious cinema. At a time when online content consumption is rising exponentially, DIFF is not offering the regular popular stuff but a carefully curated list of rare, alternate films with artistic merit, underlined with a humane touch and reflecting the political realities of our times. When we are being forced to shut out the world, these films open a small window to it; when individuals and their respective countries are in a lockdown mode, they offer a fantastic, expansive political and cultural peep into our uncomfortable realities.

Thoughtful selection

Sean McAllister’s A Syrian Love Story (2015) is a heartbreaking documentary that dwells on the human toll in the Middle Eastern conflict, through its focus is on five years of the life of a couple that first fell in love in a Syrian prison and fled to France via Lebanon to seek political asylum. But could they truly abandon the home called Syria?

Naeem Mohaiemen’s experimental film Tripoli Cancelled (2017) looks at the unsettling feeling between being at home and in asylum through a week in the life of a man stranded in an abandoned airport. Jeon Soo-Il’s A Korean in Paris (2015) is about a man cast away in the French capital in search of his wife who suddenly goes missing on their honeymoon. Prasanna Vithanage’s With You Without You (2013) juxtaposes the healing power of love against personal traumas and political strife in the wake of the Civil War in Sri Lanka.

Coming up in the weeks ahead — Emad Burnat and Guy Davidi’s 5 Broken Cameras, Abhay Kumar’s Placebo (2014), Andrew Hinton and Johnny Burke’s Tashi and the Monk (2014) and Ritu Sarin and Tanzing Sonam’s When Hari Got Married (2013).

After the State government made an appeal to those persons who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat conference in Nizamuddin, Delhi, but remained untraceable, to voluntarily report to the authorities on Tuesday evening, 588 people approached district officials overnight. This took the total number of persons who had come forward to 1,103.

“We used multiple methodologies. Religious leaders were contacted. We involved revenue officials and utilised police intelligence. As soon as the appeal was made, phones started buzzing, and people started coming in voluntarily overnight. Teams from the respective Collectorates brought them to the isolation facilities. Containment plans were immediately chalked out,” Health Secretary Beela Rajesh told reporters.

“The containment plan was centred around all 1,103 persons in question, and involved District Collectors demarcating a 5-km radius as a containment zone and another 2-km radius as a buffer zone to take up door-to-door checks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This would be the focus for two days,” she added.

In Tirupattur district, 22 persons who had attended the conference were traced and placed under hospital quarantine. Collector M.P. Sivanarul said five of them were from Tirupattur, seven from Vaniyambadi and 10 from Ambur.

203,2020/04/01,Two-pronged strategy to tackle veggie shortage,"Agriculture dept. motivating T.N. farmers to boost production and co-ordinating with supplier States

Anticipating a shortage of vegetables in the next couple of months as a fallout of the COVID-19 crisis, the State Agriculture Department is adopting a two-pronged strategy to tackle any such eventuality.

The department, through its main arm – the Horticulture wing – is motivating farmers to produce more vegetables in the State. The fact that the current period happens to coincide with the season for the cultivation of vegetables in the State has come in handy for the authorities.

Simultaneously, the Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business Directorate — another arm of the Agriculture Department — is in touch with officials of supplier States such as Maharashtra and Karnataka to ensure the steady supply of vegetables.

As Tamil Nadu receives an average of 250 truck loads of big-sized onion (around 6,250 tonnes) every day from Nashik, Maharashtra, the officials of the western State had, at an inter-State conference coordinated by the Centre on Tuesday, assured their counterparts in T.N. that there would be no shortage of onions, a senior official of the Agriculture Department said. Karnataka is another supplier State, which provides tomato, potato and carrot. Agra in Uttar Pradesh has been a consistent provider of potato to Tamil Nadu’s markets.

As for the domestic production of vegetables, Tamil Nadu, on an average, produces 50 lakh tonnes of vegetables annually, of which tapioca accounts for about 27 lakh tonnes; tomato 3.2 lakh tonnes; onion 2.2 lakh tonnes; and brinjal 1.2 lakh tonnes. Seventy Uzhavar Sandhais (farmers’ markets) in different districts have been relocated to bigger sites outside the limits of cities and towns so that the norms of social distancing could be followed.

In the meantime, the Agriculture Department is overseeing the distribution of urea to the Cauvery delta, where there are plans to raise paddy over 50,000 hectares. Called ‘summer paddy’, this crop will cover 30,000 hectares initially. On Wednesday morning, a consignment of 1,200 tonnes of urea reached the Thanjavur railway junction. The State will get nearly 14,000 tonnes more shortly. Ordinarily, the summer paddy is not encouraged. But given the present circumstances, the authorities are willing to give latitude to the farmers, who have been advised to adhere to social distancing norms.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/latfev/article31231136.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THVEGGIES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/two-pronged-strategy-to-tackle-veggie-shortage/article31231137.ece

205,2020/04/01,Fishing ban dates likely to be changed for this year,"The annual fishing ban for mechanised boats in the State is likely to be advanced this year.

It usually begins on April 14 and goes on for 61 days. However, since fishermen have already been asked to abstain from fishing, the government has written to the Central government, urging that the ban be considered from March 23 till May 23, instead of June 14.

Fisheries Department director G.S. Sameeran said that the Chief Secretary had written the letter and several other States too had followed suit. “We are doing it in the interest of the fishers since otherwise the ban would begin one day ahead of the lifting of the lockdown and they would have to remain without work for another two months. Now, they can save three weeks,” he explained.

If the suggested change is implemented, the fishing ban dole is likely to be paid in April itself. Fishers using mechanised boats on the eastern coast of the country usually abstain from fishing from April 14 so that marine resources can be replenished. Those on the western coast begin their ban as soon as this one is lifted.

In Tamil Nadu, there are a total of 10.48 lakh marine fishers, 5,806 mechanised craft and 41,652 traditional boats. During the ban there is no restriction on fishing by traditional craft.

Fishers said that though the idea was good, the condition of labourers in mechanised boats would be affected. They would have to pay school fees and have other expenses.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/fishing-ban-dates-likely-to-be-changed-for-this-year/article31231059.ece
206,2020/04/01,WFH also includes household work for women,"When domestic duties are shared, women are able to manage better

About a week into the nationwide lockdown against the spread of COVID-19, women, especially those granted the ‘Work From Home’ (WFH) option, have been hard-pressed to cope, as maids, caretakers and baby-sitters have stopped reporting to work. It’s only thanks to the division of labour between family members that women are able to sail through, they say.

“My husband is working in the IT industry and he has the WFH option. Since I don’t have the WFH option, the absence of our domestic help, and with kids at home, I am more of a full-time housewife, which includes taking care of the children, engaging them, and doing all the household chores,” said Marilyn Gracey, who teaches in a college.

The University Grants Commission (UGC) has sent directions asking teachers to do ICT (Information and Communications Technology) learning programmes but, “The UGC does not know that we are quarantined as a family and women teachers are more of housewives now,” she quipped.

Sharing work

Shivakami works for Cohere Consultants, which is a pan-India consultancy platform covering legal, compliance and gender-related aspects of sexual harassment in the workplace. She has a daughter and she has to manage household work with office work. “Thanks to the support from my family and office, I am able to balance both,” she said, adding that her office supports her as well.

Since Ms. Shivakami and her husband were living abroad a few years ago, they are able to manage the present crisis by themselves, she noted. With a mutual understanding between partners, office work and household work could be managed by both spouses, she said.

Priya Karthik, who bakes cupcakes from home, was accustomed to having ample domestic help to assist her. “It was challenging initially but, eventually, my family members pitched in. I am lucky to have them and they are helping me out in washing vessels and also in cleaning. There is no hard and fast rule that so and so should do the mopping. Whoever is free does it,” she said.

Ms. Karthik notes that this is also a time during which one could train children in helping parents with household work. “Since I love cooking, it is not a burden for me. I have extra hands to help me now in cleaning vessels,” she said.

Working things out

There are also people like John Pradeep J.L., a parenting coach who has worked with a lot of parents, having specific arrangements in place. “Our daughter is 6 years old. As soon as we heard about WFH, we re-arranged one of our bedrooms into a workspace and told our daughter that she could come into the ‘office’ only if it was really important.”

When his daughter could not resist coming in, Mr. Pradeep told her he could not play during working hours. “But I spend a good hour during lunch for playing with her. After 2-3 days of tantrums, she now waits for lunchtime and values that time so much,” he said.

“We have formed a parents’ WhatsApp group where we support each other and share ideas on how to engage our kids without too much of our involvement.

208,2020/04/01,Coronavirus | 110 new cases from Nizamuddin Tablighi Jamaat event in Tamil Nadu,"No Stage-3 transmission, says the State Health Secretary Beela Rajesh.

Tamil Nadu’s tally of confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases crossed the 200-mark on Wednesday. With 110 more persons who attended the Tablighi Jamaat conference at Nizamuddin in Delhi testing positive for COVID-19 in 15 districts, the total number of cases in the State increased to 234.

Health Secretary Beela Rajesh said of the 110, one person was from Myanmar and another from Indonesia. “Till yesterday, 80 people who attended the Delhi conference tested positive for COVID-19. With the April 1 count, a total of 190 who attended the conference have tested positive in the State,” she told reporters. However, it was not clear if the count of 80 included the contacts of these travellers.

Also Read 588 report to officials overnight

The 110 persons were in the following districts — 28 in Coimbatore, 20 in Theni, 17 in Dindigul, nine in Madurai, seven each in Tirupattur and Chengalpattu, six in Tirunelveli, five in Sivaganga, two each in Kancheepuram, Tiruvarur, Erode and Thoothukudi and one each in Karur, Tiruvannamalai and Chennai. Till March 31, the Health department had tracked 515 persons, who had returned to various parts of the State after attending the conference.

Ms. Rajesh added that Tamil Nadu had not progressed to Stage-3 transmission as all these cases belonged to one particular group.

“After we made a fervent appeal asking persons who had attended the conference to come forward and report to officials, this number has increased to 1,103 persons. We have admitted them to isolation wards in hospitals, and we have lifted samples from 658 of them so far. We will test samples from the remaining persons in the next 24 hours,” the Health Secretary said.

The department had earlier mentioned that 1,500 persons had travelled to Nizamuddin from TN and it was a “dynamic figure”. It appeared that around 300 to 400 persons are still in Delhi, and many of them have tested positive after laboratory testing. But the exact numbers were not clear, she said.

With the one-year Compulsory Rotatory Residential Internship (CRRI) being extended by a month for interns of the 2014 MBBS batch, the Tamil Nadu Medical Students Association (TNMSA) has requested the State government and administration of hospitals to provide them with, and ensure the availability of sufficient protective gear such as personal protective equipment, N95 masks and hand sanitisers to combat coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

In a memorandum to the Health Minister, the association requested the government to ensure the availability of all protective gear in the workplace without any compromise. They said that the 2014 batch interns could be kept as a reserve medical team for COVID-19 management.

Noting that the world-wide pandemic may last for a few more months, the association urged the government to postpone the upcoming Tamil Nadu Medical Services Recruitment Board exam for medical officers and recommend to the Union government to postpone the upcoming NEET PG 2021.

TNMSA also requested the college and hospital administration to issue the CRRI completion certificates at the end of the original posting period without any delay, provided the candidates had no negative remarks during their internship and proceed further to register in the State Medical Council and to issue university degree certificates. This was because any delay would affect their seniority in registering with the Tamil Nadu Medical Council as their counterparts in private medical colleges have completed their CRRI, the memorandum said.

The association also urged the government to sanction salaries and ensure that they would benefit from the incentives announced for healthcare providers involved in COVID-19 management.

In a unique move, Tiruppur District Collector K. Vijayakarthikeyan inaugurated a ‘disinfection tunnel’ as part of the precautionary measures against COVID-19 at the entrance of the Uzhavar Santhai in Thennampalayam on Wednesday.

This initiative might be the first of its kind in the State, Mr. Vijayakarthikeyan told The Hindu. It was set up by the District Administration in collaboration with Young Indians, the youth wing of the Confederation of Indian Industry.

Two sets of three nozzles will spray 1% sodium hypochlorite solution per 1 ppm (parts per million), as people walk for a duration of between three to five seconds inside the tunnel. “Upon contact [on surfaces], it is efficient enough to kill the virus,” the Collector said. Workers and members of the public were advised to raise their hands with their palms facing front while entering the tunnel to ensure efficient disinfection. However, this disinfection tunnel is only a supplement to precautionary measures such as frequent hand-washing, he said.

The total cost of the tunnel was around ₹90,000. With a capacity of 1,000 litres, the disinfection tunnel will work uninterrupted for 16 hours, hence requiring refilling only once a day. More such tunnels will be set up across the district in the future, Mr. Vijayakarthikeyan said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/gdrx7h/article31226347.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01APRTH-Tunneljpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tiruppur-gets-a-unique-disinfection-tunnel-to-fight-against-covid-19/article31226348.ece
212,2020/04/01,Opt for EMI moratorium if there are cash flow problems: experts,"Banks have started rolling out three month moratorium on all term loans as announced by the RBI under the COVID-19 regulatory package. However, experts say borrowers should opt for it only if they face cash flow problems.

All the term loans like housing loan, auto loan as well as credit card dues are eligible for relief under the scheme. For EMI based term loans, the relief is applicable for three EMIs falling between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020 and the tenor will be extended by three months and have to be paid during the extended period. However, the interest gets accrued on the loans.

“Borrowers must understand that it is only a deferment of the EMI payment and interest gets accumulated. This would be helpful for people who are facing cash flow problems like the self employed category. For salaried, those who face salary issues can take advantage of the deferment,” said Harsh Roongta, a registered Investment Adviser. ""If you don't face a cash flow problem, it’s better to pay the EMI and avoid higher interest,"" he added.

In case of credit cards, Mr. Roongta said if there is no major cash flow problem, it is better to pay of the dues, as they attract higher interest rates.

FAQ by Indian Banks Association also suggested borrowers to opt for the benefits if there is a disruption in cash flow or there is loss of income. It also pointed out that interest rates on credit card dues are normally much higher than normal bank credit and a decision should be taken accordingly, after checking with the credit card provider on the interest payable.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/opt-for-emi-moratorium-if-there-are-cash-flow-problems-experts/article31225927.ece

Mr Gopal explained that the government had also directed the district collectors to allow the movement of vehicles carrying poultry products and materials for making poultry feed.

‘Chicken and eggs safe’

Describing as misleading, a rumour that eating chicken and eggs would cause COVID-19 infection, he said staying away from poultry products would on the one hand deprive people of the protein content in their food and on the other it would cause enormous loss to the poultry farmers.

According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), ever since the lockdown in the last week of March, they have been regularly disinfecting the stations as a precautionary measure. “Though the stations are closed, we don’t want to take a chance and decided to continue with the cleaning of stations using a special chemical. The elevated stations are mostly open and hence, initially, we thought we would begin with them and then decided to extend it to all stations.

217,2020/04/01,COVID-19: Tiruvallur district quarantines 250 villages,"The district administration has made these villages self sufficient with a supply of essential items

In a move to contain spread of COVID – 19, the Tiruvallur district administration has quarantined 250 villages in the district and has made them self-sufficient by forming village committees to supply essentials.

There are nine taluks – Gummudipoondi, Ponneri, Uthukottai, Tiruvallur, Tirutani, Athipattu, R K Pettai, Pooonamalee and Avadi – in Tiruvallur district, in which there are over 525 villages.

As on date, close to 2,000 people, who have either returned from abroad or have shown symptoms of COVID-19, have been placed under quarantine in the district. To prevent people from leaving their villages and getting infected, the Tiruvallur district administration has decided to quarantine all such villages.

“As of now we have quarantined 250 villages. In each hamlet, we have formed committees headed by the Village Administrative Officer and comprising the panchayat president, vice president, anganwadi worker, teacher and five youngsters from each street in the village. In the city limits, ward-level committees have been formed,” said Tiruvallur collector Mageswari Ravikumar. She said that one team will be allotted for 150 houses. In each village there are between 300 and 1,000 houses. The team has a Whatsapp group. The youngsters will go door to door and create awareness about COVID-19.

In case a house needs vegetables or medicines, the team will get it for them. “Besides if anyone shows symptoms, the medical team will be brought to the village. The team will also take steps to prevent stigmatising those who are infected. They will take care of the welfare of migrant labourers too,” she added.

In the coming days, the remaining villages will also be quarantined. The local vegetable and meat sellers will be roped in to provide essentials to the village residents. “No one will be allowed to enter or leave the villages. The village entry and exit points have been barricaded,” said R. Sridhar, assistant director, Panchayats, Tiruvallur.

218,2020/04/01,COVID-19: Tamil Nadu Chief Minister requests Delhi meeting participants to come forward,"Out of nearly 1,300 persons from Tamil Nadu who participated in the meeting in Delhi, 515 have been identified and are being tested, the Chief Minister said

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Wednesday requested those who participated in the religious conference at Nizamuddin West in Delhi to voluntarily come forward, so that they can be tested and treated for COVID-19 if necessary. Mr. Palaniswami, responding to a question, also said if there were symptoms among any participants at the Isha Foundation event held recently, they would also be subjected to testing.

On Wednesday morning, the Chief Minister undertook an inspection of an Amma Unavagam at Santhome and ate an idli there. He also checked if people were maintaining physical distancing and interacted with a few people who were having their food there.

“Out of nearly 1,300 persons from Tamil Nadu who participated in the meeting in Delhi, 515 [two days ago, he had said 981 persons had returned and were being tested] have been identified through different means and they are being tested for COVID-19. Of these, 45 were found positive yesterday. We are trying to trace the remaining participants who returned to the State, but we are not getting their addresses. They should voluntarily come forward considering the intensity of the spread of the virus which will affect not only them, but their family and a large number of people in the society,”Mr. Palaniswami said.

Mr. Palaniswami said that the government will provide them with adequate medical treatment to help them recover and it would be easier to treat if symptoms are identified at the initial stages itself. “Many of those who were found positive are recovering,” he said.

To a question on whether participants at Isha Foundation’s Shivaratri event will also be subjected to medical screening as there were also a number of foreign nationals who took part in the event, the Chief Minister said if anyone were found to be having symptoms, they would be tested and treated. “In this case (Delhi gathering), they had symptoms. Without symptoms, we will not be able to say anything,” he said.

With political parties, individuals and certain organisations offering their premises for creating COVID-19 treatment wards, Mr. Palaniswami said the State currently had 17,000 beds in hospitals and that was sufficient at the moment. “If it comes to such a situation (where there is need for more beds), we will definitely use these (premises being offered),” he said.

On the confusion over EMI payments and banks and financial institutions debiting customer’s accounts despite an RBI guideline, the Chief Minister said the State government and the Centre had made it clear on a three-month moratorium. “However, I will take up the matter with the Central government and insist with them that this be adhered to,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/9wwbvu/article31225037.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01APRTH--Edappadi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/covid-19-tamil-nadu-chief-minister-requests-delhi-meeting-participants-to-come-forward/article31225039.ece
219,2020/04/01,Coronavirus | Three rescue flights to take back stranded Malaysians,"The airline has proposed to operate the first rescue flight late in the night on April 1, the second on April 2 morning and the third on the morning of April 4.

Malindo Air has proposed to operate rescue flights on three different dates to take back the remaining Malaysian nationals stranded at Tiruchi following suspension of international flights in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic. The airline has proposed to operate the first rescue flight (OD 223/224) late in the night on April 1. The second rescue flight (OD 221/222) would be operated on April 2 morning and the next rescue flight (OD 221/222) on April 4 morning.

Several Malaysian nationals who had arrived here earlier this month got stranded following the cancellation of all flights to Kuala Lumpur from March 17 as a temporary measure in the wake of the COVID-19 scare. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has since announced suspension of all international commercial passenger services till April 14 in the wake of COVID-19.The circular said the restriction would not apply to international cargo operations and flights specifically approved by the DGCA.

The stranded Malaysian nationals staying at hotels and places of friends and relatives have been appealing to the State and Central governments to enable their return.

Air Asia operated the first rescue flight and took the first batch of 186 stranded Malaysians a few days ago. Later, Air Asia operated two more rescue flights taking back more than 370 stranded Malaysians from here.

220,2020/04/01,UEFA postpones all internationals in June,"The decision followed a videoconference with Europe’s 55 member federations as part of discussions on how to adapt the fixture calendar in the face of the ongoing coronavirus crisis.

UEFA has made a move towards clearing the decks for the return of club football by announcing on Wednesday that all international matches that had been pushed back to June have now been postponed until further notice.

“This includes the play-off matches for UEFA EURO 2020 and qualifying matches for UEFA Women’s EURO 2021,” said European football’s governing body in a statement. “All other UEFA competition matches, including the centralised international friendly matches, remain postponed until further notice.”

The decision followed a videoconference with Europe’s 55 member federations as part of discussions on how to adapt the fixture calendar in the face of the ongoing coronavirus crisis.

The play-off semifinals and finals that are supposed to decide the last four qualifying berths for the next European Championship were initially postponed at the end of March and pencilled in provisionally for June.

That was “subject to a review of the situation” amid uncertainty over how the pandemic will develop and whether many European countries currently in lockdown will be able to return to some kind of normalcy.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/uefa-postpones-all-internationals-in-june/article31230382.ece
221,2020/04/01,"All days are practically Sundays, says Tejaswin","‘Lack of motivation to keep fit’

On March 14, Tejaswin Shankar was in Albuquerque for the NCAA Division-1 Indoor Tack and Field Championships. The event was cancelled because of COVID-19 and Tejaswin, along with his Kansas State University teammates, moved back.

That was the last time the 21-year-old stepped out of the city he’s called home for the past three years. The national high jump record-holder and Business Administration student has since been trying to keep himself fit and sane even as the pandemic took a serious turn in the United States.

‘Not too bad’

“It’s actually not too bad. The important thing is just trying to stay sane and preserve some semblance of normalcy,” Tejaswin told The Hindu from Kansas. “For most sportspersons, life revolves around a routine of training and working out, that’s how we even keep track of the schedules and days. Now, all days are practically Sundays!”

He admitted he was better off than many others. “Here, because it is a lot of farmland, things are easier. There have been no cases here so far. There are restrictions but I can move out. The training facilities at the university are closed but the high school grounds with tracks are accessible,” he explained. That might change soon, though. “I am expecting stricter restrictions from this week but physical training has been included in essential activities so going out for a run hopefully won’t be a problem,” he said.

Frustrating

He has been trying to improvise his workouts — using rock-filled sacks as barbells and running up and down stairs — but admitted the uncertainty was frustrating.

“Olympics dates have been announced for next year but what if this goes on till September or beyond? No one knows how things will be when it does get over. There is a serious lack of motivation to keep fit,” he added.

Tejaswin, though, knows better than worrying about things he has no control over. “People forever crib about wanting a break from routine but now that they have, most do not know what to do about it. Now it’s all about mental strength,” he signed off.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/r7q148/article31230347.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02TEJ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/all-days-are-practically-sundays-says-tejaswin/article31230348.ece
222,2020/04/01,Gamechangers on and off the field,"Domestic cricketers step forward with community service

While elite athletes in India have been contributing to various relief funds created to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the domestic cricketers have gone out of the way to do their bit for the community.

While Saurashtra veteran Sheldon Jackson has been offering homeless daily-wagers in his hometown Bhavnagar packed food and water every day the last week, a group of Maharashtra cricketers — led by Ranji Trophy regulars Naushad Shaikh and Nikit Dhumal — have started a crowdfunding initiative to take care of the families of groundsmen at the Nehru Stadium in Pune.

According to Jackson, one of the architects of Saurashtra’s maiden Ranji Trophy title last month, the plight of the homeless workers drove him to do something that he refers to as “nothing special”.

Family tradition

“We have a tradition in the family that whenever I do well on the field, we feed stray animals — dogs and cattle — for a few days; so when I came back to Bhavnagar after the final, we were doing the same,” Jackson told The Hindu.

“It’s been an overwhelming experience. Every day, I see many of those with tears in their eyes as they admit they haven’t eaten anything for two or three days. The government is doing the best it can, but in our country, it’s so difficult to reach out to everyone,” Jackson said.

“Most of these people don’t even know anything about the pandemic. All they know is there is some ‘beemaree’ (disease). I am just doing my little bit to offer them a snack and some water or juice.”

Crowdfunding initiative

Meanwhile, a group of cricketers in Pune has been trying to create a corpus for the families of groundsmen at the Nehru Stadium. Even though the stadium is in the heart of the city, it no longer hosts top-flight games.

“Some of us friends were following the migration that followed the lockdown and thought of the groundsmen at the club, most of whom are migrants,” said Shaikh, who captained Maharashtra in the first half of the Ranji Trophy season.

Having devised the title “The Gamechangers Relief Fund” for the initiative, Shaikh and Dhumal have reached out to former and present cricketers through social media.

“We have set a window of one week for ourselves to get donations, starting Sunday. And the response has been unexpected and the support pouring in,” Shaikh said.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/sport/article31228964.ece
223,2020/04/01,Doctor assaulted over death of COVID-19 patient,"Two COVID-19 patients attack junior doctor after death of family member

Medical fraternity at Gandhi Hospital were agitated after COVID-19 patients, family members of another patient who died, allegedly assaulted a junior doctor on the seventh floor of the hospital on Wednesday evening. Hyderabad police have registered a case against those who misbehaved with the hospital staff.

Four members from a family, including a woman, were admitted in the isolation ward of the hospital and all of them tested positive for coronavirus. One among them, a 49-year-old patient, died on Wednesday evening. Telangana Junior Doctors Association members alleged that two male family members attacked a general medicine junior doctor, blaming doctors for the death.

“One of the patients, an old man, was in a critical condition in the last two days. We had informed his two family members about his condition but they did not give us permission to intubate (to provide oxygen) the patient. After he died, the two family members slapped the doctor and assaulted security guard,” said a junior doctor from the hospital.

Soon after the incident on Wednesday evening, junior doctors gathered at the entrance of the main building in protest. Senior officials from the police and Health department visited the hospital to bring the situation under control.

“Despite multiple appeals, the COVID-19 patients came out of their ward and started walking around. The junior doctors in their mid 20s are putting their lives at risk by attending to patients. People have to understand the kind of efforts that are put in by the doctors, nurses, and other staff,” said an official.

Condemning the assault on doctors, Health Minister Eatala Rajender said strict action would be taken against the attackers. “Doctors are working round the clock. The government will provide all support. Measures will be taken to ensure that such situation does not arise again,” Mr Rajender said.

Director General of Police M Mahender Reddy said the Police department will beef up security immediately and take all necessary measures to provide protection to all the doctors and para medics treating COVID-19 patients.

224,2020/04/01,Niloufer doctors test negative for coronavirus,"Telangana Health department officials heaved a sigh of relief as 11 junior doctors, and a few senior doctors, Class-IV employees, from Niloufer Hospital tested negative for coronavirus. The healthcare professionals gave their samples for tests after they got exposed to a three-year-old toddler, whom they have treated, tested positive for coronavirus.

As the toddler did not have history of travel or contact with a COVID-19 patient, he was admitted in Emergency ward of the hospital. He had history of blood disorder and developed pneumonia. The patient was shifted to isolation ward in the hospital. After swab samples collected from him tested positive for coronavirus on Sunday, the patient was shifted to Gandhi Hospital.

The hospital authorities have asked senior doctors, junior doctors and others who attended the patient in the Emergency ward to give their swab samples for tests and be under home quarantine. “All of their samples tested negative, including the junior doctors,” said an official from the hospital. The junior doctors too confirmed the test results. However, they will remain under home quarantine for a few more days.

225,2020/04/01,Phone-a-doctor helpline in Adilabad District Collectorate keeps ringing,"Just a three-day-old service, doctors are answering about 50 calls-a-day not only from the area but from Hyderabad, Warangal and Khammam, but from neighbouring Maharashtra

It is as nondescript as a help-desk can be but the phone-a-doctor helpline set up in the District Collectorate is steadily gaining popularity. Doctors manning the desk - set up just three days ago - are answering about 50 calls everyday not only from this area but from Hyderabad, Warangal and Khammam and even some places in neighbouring Maharashtra.

The concept of people ‘consulting’ a doctor on phone and even getting prescription for minor ailments on phone is the brain child of Adilabad Collector A. Sridevasena who roped in the services of the local branch of the Indian Medical Association. “The idea is to keep people with minor ailments indoors in view of the lockdown,” the Collector said.

Common complaints

The help-desk operates for 12 hours every day between 8 am and 8 pm. It is manned by two qualified doctors and one official of the Panchayat Raj Department. Prescriptions are given on phone itself as most of the callers are complaining of cough and cold and sometimes even fever fearing it could be a COVID-19 infection.

“The callers want to know if running nose and cough means COVID-19 infection. We are prescribing antibiotics, anti-allergic medicines and cough syrup asking them to try for the next three days,” revealed Dr. M. Dattu who was on duty at the help desk on Wednesday.

Dispelling doubts

“Sandhya Rani, a caller from Warangal even called us back and thanked as she is feeling much better relying on our prescription. The most important thing is we are able to dispel the doubts of the callers about COVID-19,” he added.

The other important function of the help-desk is to disseminate all information related with prevention of COVID-19 spread to callers. “We are telling them about aspects like social distancing and the need for maintaining personal hygiene in order to restrict the spread,” disclosed Dr. D.S. Bhushan.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/phone-a-doctor-helpline-keeps-ringing/article31227041.ece

One member of a family of a retired government employee, who returned from the Tablighi Jamaat in Hazrat Nizamuddin, New Delhi, was also tested COVID-19 positive. Six other members of his family tested negative and reports of two others are yet to come, according to District Collector C. Narayana Reddy.

Family members quarantined

In a press release here on Wednesday, the Collector said they have all been put in quarantine wards. The retired employee belonged to Quilla Road, and was diagnosed with COVID-19 symptoms on his return from the Jamaat on March 28, and has been in Gandhi Hospital.

Meanwhile, health officials, with the help of police and revenue personnel are carrying out a door-to-door survey to trace the persons who had gone to the Jaamat, and who had come in contact with them after their return. The survey is being done in Muslim-dominated localities of old town. A similar operation is also going on in Kamareddy district.

227,2020/04/01,Coronavirus lockdown | Largest facility for migrants in U.P. district awaits first occupant,"Jaypee Sports Complex, which can accommodate 2,000 people, is lying vacant two days since it was opened

The Jaypee Sports Complex on the Yamuna Expressway, the largest facility created by the Uttar Pradesh government in Gautam Buddha Nagar to provide shelter to stranded migrant workers, with a capacity to accommodate 2,000 people, has zero inmates so far, The Hindu found during a visit here on Wednesday.

Spread over approximately 12 acres, the facility consists of an estimated 57 large tin sheds – some of which have been designated ‘family sheds’ – lined with wooden panelling to keep a check on the ambient temperature as summer progresses, mats with visibly clean white sheets, sanitation and potable water supply, in addition to separate toilets for men and women.

The only thing seemingly missing at the camp since it was opened on Monday evening, according to officials associated with its creation and upkeep, is the people for whom it exists.

“Before the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) took over this property in February, this facility was utilised to house up to 10,000 construction workers engaged in different projects by the builder concerned. Now, given the necessity to practise social distancing to check the community spread of COVID-19, it has been decided that it will accommodate no more than 2,000 individuals,” an official present at the site said.

“We have been here for the last two and a half days and not even a single migrant worker has turned up. We suspect most of them went to Agra along the banks of the Yamuna on foot or via the currently unused railway lines that criss-cross the area,” said another official.

Former DM’s plan

The former District Magistrate of Gautam Buddha Nagar, B.N. Singh — who was transferred earlier this week following a rebuke by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath over the high number of COVID-19 cases in the district comprising Noida and Greater Noida — had issued an order last Sunday under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, designating the area as a shelter home for migrants in the midst of their exodus to their respective hometowns.

After the order, arrangements for as many as 6,050 migrant workers were made at 28 shelters spread across 60-odd kilometres between Noida and Jewar. Most of these, according to sources familiar with the developments in this regard, are either vacant or have “very thin occupancy”.

“YEIDA has made all the necessary arrangements for migrant workers, who were not able to travel to their respective hometowns, at this facility. We look forward to receiving anyone in need of shelter here,” said Navneet Goyal, Officer on Special Duty, Land, YEIDA.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/n967u2/article31231371.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE02SHELTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/largest-facility-for-migrants-in-up-district-awaits-first-occupant/article31231372.ece
228,2020/04/01,Coronavirus | 14 more positive cases found in Rajasthan,"As part of the continuing measures to control the pandemic and generate resources to fight COVID-19, the State government has deferred part salaries of the Ministers, MLAs and officers.

Fourteen more COVID-19 positive cases were detected in Rajasthan on Wednesday, taking the number of infected persons in the State to over 90.

Thirteen of the infected persons were found in the Ramganj area of Jaipur’s cufew-bound Walled City, which has emerged as a major coronavirus hotspot. When counted with the 18 evacuees from Iran staying in the Army’s wellness centres in Jodhpur and Jaisalmer, who have tested positive, the total number of cases in the State went up to 108. Medical & Health Minister Raghu Sharma said as many as 19 of the confirmed patients had turned negative and 15 of them had been discharged.

The 13 infected persons found in Ramganj were the contacts of the first person in the area who had tested positive recently. They were kept in the isolation facilities at Rajasthan University of Health Sciences and the National Institute of Medical Sciences. All of them were being shifted to the Sawai Man Singh Government Hospital in Jaipur. The other case was reported from Jodhpur, where a 65-year-old man with no travel history or contact with any patient, tested positive for the disease.

Drones to be employed

After sealing the Walled City of Jaipur, the administration decided to monitor the curfew and carry out surveillance of the area with the help of drones. A flag march will also be conducted to instil confidence among the residents of Walled City.

Mr. Sharma said 183 persons had been identified in the State after they attended the Tablighi Jamat event in Delhi. Staying in 13 districts of the State, they would be screened and sent to isolation or qurantine as per the medical advice, he said.

229,2020/04/01,U.P. records its first two virus deaths,"One hid his travel history, while the other got infected from son-in-law

Uttar Pradesh recorded its first two fatalities due to COVID-19 on Wednesday. They were a 25-year-old man from Basti, whose relatives allegedly hid his travel history to Mumbai, and a 72-year-old man from Meerut.

The patient from Basti died at the Baba Raghav Das Medical College in Gorakhpur. Subsequently, it was reported that he was infected with the virus, BRDMC principal Ganesh Kumar told The Hindu.

District Magistrate of Gorakhpur, K. Vijyendra Pandian, said the patient had been treated for renal failure for the last three months and died early on Monday, following which his sample tested positive for COVID-19. A second test at the King George’s Medical University in Lucknow reaffirmed it.

The patient’s kin had hidden his travel history to Mumbai, alleged O.P Singh, in-charge of the Basti hospital. “When the patient arrived at the hospital, after complaining of breathing issues, he was admitted to the OPD ward. His attendants claimed he was ill for a month. He didn’t have any history or fever at the time. Our doctors diagnosed him in OPD and like a normal patient he went to the ward,” said Dr. Singh.

Had the family of the patient even mentioned once that he had returned from Mumbai, we would have admitted him to the Corona ward, the doctor added.

Tracing his route

The authorities are now trying to trace the people he may have contacted in two districts, including the hospital ward in Basti, where he was first before being shifted to the BRDMC on Sunday. Eight persons who came in touch with him were put under quarantine, informed Mr. Pandian. They are the six paramedics who treated him, the driver of the vehicle that brought him to BRD and his attendant. Besides, they are trying to track those who performed his final rites.

The patient in Meerut, a diabetic who was suffering from chronic pulmonary disease, tested positive on March 29, said R.C. Gupta, principal of the Meerut Medical College. Earlier, the patient’s son-in-law tested positive. The latter, who is from Khujra and lives in Amravati, had stayed at his in-law’s place but didn’t tell anyone, said Dr. Gupta, adding that he had also met relatives at three places.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, seeking financial assistance of Rs 25,000 crore to fulfil the state government’s commitments of providing free ration to the people and continuing other welfare schemes amid a dip in the revenue at a time when all businesses are shut due to the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown.

In the letter, Ms. Banerjee stated that the West Bengal government needs assistance from the Centre to cope with the unprecedented “impasse to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic”.

“Our state finances like that of many other states, is in a dire situation with practically no revenue flows after the closure of all businesses. Despite this, we have somehow been able to pay the salaries, wages and pensions of government employees this month though some major states of the country could not do that on full. And even with the massive debt trap left behind by the previous government, we were able to service the debt so far, but future remains uncertain,” Ms. Banerjee said in the letter to the Prime Minister.

“Furthermore, we are required to meet our commitments towards girl child, students, farmers, unorganised workers, weaker sections, minorities, SC, ST and OBCs. We are also having to honour our commitments of providing free ration to almost 9 crore people, who need this so crucially to survive in this perilous time,” she wrote.

Ms. Banerjee said the Centre should sanction Rs 25,000 crore to West Bengal and also release the other funds due to the state.

The Gujarat Police has identified 72 persons from the State to have attended the Tablighi Jamaat religious congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area, which has emerged as a major coronavirus “hotspot”.

Of them, 71 persons have been traced and quarantined; one of them died of COVID-19 in Bhavnagar district.

Among the 71 persons, 34 are from Ahmedabad, 19 from Bhavnagar, 12 from Mehsana, four from Botad and two from Navsari.

‘Come forward’

“Efforts are still on to identify and trace other attendees. I urge them to voluntarily come forward and contact the police so that they can be quarantined,” Gujarat Director General of Police (DGP) Shivanand Jha told reporters in Gandhingar, adding that the situation could worsen if such people do not come forward.

Earlier, Chief Minster Vijay Rupani had also said that every person from the State to have attended the congregation would be traced and quarantined. He, too, warned of action against those who had attended the Nizamuddin event and did not inform local authorities of their participation.

The State police, along with civic and health authorities, are organising medical examination of all the identified attendees of the congregation.

Going by list

Mr. Jha said the exercise to identify the people who had attended the event was being conducted in accordance with a list shared by the Centre. The list, however, has the names of all the persons who were present in the entire Nizamuddin area during that time.

Earlier in the day, the State Health Department said the list received from the Centre had stated that around 1,500 people from Gujarat had visited the Nizamuddin area last month, and that most of them had not attended the Tablighi congregation.

Meanwhile, Surat Municipal Commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani said that 43 people who had visited Nizamuddin area were traced on the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday and were sent to a central quarantine facility set up by the civic body in the city.

‘Only in the area’

“A detailed questioning of these 43 persons has revealed that only one out of them had actually attended the event inside the Markaz (Tablighi centre) while others had gone to the Nizamuddin area for some other work or they were on a business trip,” said Surat Commissioner of Police R.B. Brahmbhatt.

While 13 such persons, who were in Nizamuddin area, were traced and quarantined in Bhavnagar on Tuesday, four others were quarantined in Botad district,” said Inspector General of Police (IGP) Ashok Yadav. Ten others to have been in the area were traced and quarantined in Valsad while 15 have been quarantined in Navsari so far.

All of them were part of the 1,500 people who had visited Nizamuddin area.

“All the 37 persons who have been identified, including 12 Kyrgyzstan nationals, have been subjected to medical examination and quarantined,” Mr. Pandey.

The DGP also said that the identification of 57 international travellers is to be ascertained.

Earlier last week, a 65-year-old preacher from Malaysia, who too had attended the religious congregation in New Delhi, had travelled to Araria district in Bihar, where he died two days ago. But the district administration said the death was caused by a cardiac arrest and the deceased had shown no symptoms of COVID-19.

Bihar has, so far, reported 23 COVID-19 positive cases with one death. “Most people who have tested positive have a travel history,” said State Principal Health Secretary Sanjay Kumar.

The State Chief Secretary Deepak Kumar said, “All those who have come to the State from March 15-23 are to be screened and their samples will be collected for the COVID-19 test.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/4shcp1/article31228337.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BIHARVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/covid-19-37-tablighi-jamaat-returnees-identified-in-bihar/article31228338.ece

236,2020/04/01,"Khattar government is using health emergency to make political points, says Hooda","‘Govt trying to derive political mileage by putting photos of CM and his deputy on hand sanitizers’.

The Haryana government is trying to derive political mileage even during a national health emergency by putting photos of Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and his deputy, Dushyant Chautala, on hand sanitisers, Congress leader Deepender Hooda said on Wednesday.

Speaking with The Hindu, Mr. Hooda alleged that the decision to put labels with Mr. Khattar and Mr. Chautala's photos led to a further delay in distributing sanitisers to people, especially at a time, when they have been hit hard by an acute shortage.

“The distillers, who were making these bottles, were forced to put the stickers on the bottles. They were told that their stocks won't be lifted if the stickers are not there,” said the newly elected Rajya Sabha member.

“In the middle of a lockdown, when all printers are closed, this decision [putting labels with CM and Deputy CM's photos] resulted in delayed supplies by two-three days to a week in some cases,” Mr. Hooda alleged.

“It was unfortunate that the State government was trying to do politics even during a national crisis. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji called for everyone to come together in India's fight against Corona, everyone has contributed. From block level to every member of the Legislative Assembly to common citizens have offered whatever they could. In such a situation, for the government to try and take credit is quite cheap.” If sanitizers were bought by the BJP or their ally, the Jananayak Janata Party (JJP), with their own resources, then the Opposition couldn't have objected, he said.

“Personally, I may not agree to put such stickers during a health emergency but then I would have held back my judgement. But here public funds are being used for propaganda.

237,2020/04/01,Kashmir parties oppose Centre’s new domicile law,"Insult is heaped on injury, says Omar Abdullah.

Jammu& Kashmir’s regional parties on Wednesday criticised and opposed the Centre’s new domicile laws for the Union Territory (UT), introduced eight months after the former State’s special status was revoked on August 5 last year.

Former chief minister and National Conference (NC) vice president Omar Abdullah described it as “an insult being heaped on injury”. “The law offers none of the protections that had been promised. It’s hollow. It has come when all our efforts and attention should be focused on the COVID outbreak,” said Mr. Abdullah.

Also read: Govt. jobs to be reserved only for domiciles of J&K, says Centre

A party spokesman Aga Syed Ruhullah Mehdi said several States like Himachal Pradesh have land rights that are adequately safeguarded by domicile laws but no such provision is included in J&K’s domicile law. “It’s shocking, a tehsildar has been empowered to dole out domicile certificates. It’s discriminatory to J&K’s residents,” he said.

J&K Apni Party president Altaf Bukhari, who met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah recently in Delhi to discuss domicile laws, said, “This order in its entirety is a casual attempt, cosmetic in nature, to hoodwink the people of J&K who genuinely believed that post October 31, 2019, their rights and privileges in the matter of employment and other rights would remain as it had been.”

Demanding that the order be put in abeyance, Mr. Bukhari said, “It’s unacceptable. There are no tangible legal and constitutional mechanisms to safeguard and protect the privileges of people of J&K. There are sections in the order that are antithesis to what was promised by the PM and the HM on the floor of Parliament,” he said.

Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) general secretary Surinder Choudhary said the Centre’s order “is frighteningly ambivalent, irresolute and akin to rubbing salt to the people’s wounds”.

“It’s ill-timed, very badly drafted and the outcome of confused and chaotic bureaucracy. It should be immediately rolled back. The people in the corridors of power are playing mind games with the perturbed people of J&K, battling hard times for decades,” said Mr. Singh.

A spokesman of the Peoples Conference (PC), headed by Sajad Lone, said: “It’s humiliating and insulting. Doing away with district and divisional recruitment, is an affront to the concept of affirmative action. The Centre has embarked on an erroneous path and seems to be in no mood to rectify wrongs.”

He said just the lowest rung Class 4 jobs have been reserved for locals. “Ironically, the order has come in the dead of night and in the middle of one of the worst medical disasters facing the world,” the PC spokesman said.

CPI(M) leader M.Y. Tarigami said the law has escalated fears among the locals of losing not only jobs but also land to outsiders. “After some time the majority of posts will be held by non-locals. A 15-year and 10-year cap is primarily meant for children of security personnel and other central government employees. After five years, they will settle them here,” asserted Mr. Tarigami.

He said unlike the tribal areas of Telangana, Himachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Sikkim, where people from rest of the country can’t buy land, only J&K was being targeted.

“The arbitrary decision of the BJP government to revoke Articles 370 and 35-A was the murder of democracy. The manner in which the Centre is dealing with J&K is a grave warning about the danger posed to erstwhile State’s rights and federalism. Such moves have to be unitedly opposed,” added Mr. Tarigami.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ra5nzf/article30666960.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BUKHARIK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/kashmir-parties-oppose-centres-new-domicile-law/article31225866.ece
238,2020/04/01,Husband turns room into 'ICU' after hospital discharges woman in a coma for 11 years,"The hospital had to discharge the patient because it has been turned into exclusive COVID-19 centre.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought Nagaland’s Aneile Kenye back home after more than 11 years in an intensive care unit (ICU).

Ms. Kenye, 50, was discharged from the Naga Hospital Authority Kohima on March 30 after the State government decided to convert it into a novel coronavirus-specific hospital.

She was shifted to a house adjoining the hospital that her husband — martial artist and writer Okenjeet Sandham — had rented to stay close to her.

“We are happy that she has come home but at the same time worried because there’s a difference between her room and the ICU. The decision to move patients out of the hospital was quite sudden and must have created problems for other patients and their attendants,” Mr. Sandham told The Hindu from Kohima on Wednesday.

The hospital provided him with an a portable suction machine for draining out deposits in his wife’s windpipe, where a tracheostomy pipe has been inserted to help her breathe. This was after he failed to get one at medical equipment stores in Kohima, affected by the countrywide lockdown.

“I want to turn the room into a mini ICU. I hope the situation (because of lockdown) allows me to at the earliest,” he said.

Ms. Kenye collapsed on August 30, 2009, a year after she became the first Indian woman to officiate in an international Muay Thai competition in South Korea. She was diagnosed with brain tumour and had to be air-lifted to Guwahati for surgery at a neurological hospital.

The hospital discharged her after 41 days but she was confined to a wheelchair in Kohima. She collapsed again three weeks later and had to be admitted to the ICU at the Naga Hospital.

“We have struggled to meet the expenditure but never let others know what we were going through. She cannot speak and we don’t know if she can see us, although her eyes look normal. I have not left her side because I am what I am today because of her. I am just trying to pay back for the sacrifices she made for me, our daughter and son,” Mr. Sandham said.

About 100 devotees, who defied the lockdown restrictions and gathered for observing ‘Urs’ (death anniversary) at a dargah in Sarwar town of Rajasthan’s Ajmer district, were dispersed by the police with the use of mild force. The six-day ‘Urs’ of Sufi mystic Khwaja Fakhruddin Chishti at the dargah ended on Wednesday.

Though the police had given permission to five persons from the world-famous dargah in Ajmer for offering a ‘chadar’ (sacred cloth) at the Sarwar dargah, several others joined them in the ritual. When the police asked them to vacate the dargah premises, they allegedly objected and confronted the police.

According to the police sources, five persons were arrested under Section 151 (arrest to prevent cognisable offences) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

Imran Tanwar, a Congress leader in Sarwar, said the ‘Urs’ had been observed with the necessary rituals by the dargah's workers in the absence of the pilgrims who come every year from different parts of Rajasthan and other States. The devotees, who gathered at the shrine, wanted to join the offering of ‘chadar’ in violation of the orders banning the assembly of people.

The dargah, built near a pond in Sarwar — 60 km away from Ajmer — has the tomb of Khwaja Fakhruddin, who was the eldest son of Khawaja Moinuddin Chishti of Ajmer.

They further said of the 32 samples sent to the Pune-based National Institute of Virology for testing, results of eight were awaited.

On March 28, a 45-year-old man had died of pneumonia in Buldhana. The next day, his test results returned positive for the virus despite the deceased not having any history either of foreign travel or of domestic travel.

Accordingly, the district administration has sealed the district while placing more than 60 people, who had allegedly come into contact with the deceased, in institutional quarantine facilities.

Pune division, which includes districts from western Maharashtra, has recorded 79 positive cases so far, with 50 from Pune and 25 from Sangli, of whom 24 are members of a family hailing from the district’s Islampur tehsil; and two each from Satara and Kolhapur.

241,2020/04/01,"People with travel history must be under home quarantine, says Odisha govt","It says they must follow advice even if they do not show symptoms of COVID-19

Worried over the fact that the State’s fourth COVID-19 patient had not shown any symptoms earlier, the Odisha government urged people who have travel history not to be complacent if they did display any symptoms.

“The persons with travel history but no symptoms should not be complacent. They must follow home quarantine for two weeks and then self-monitor their health condition for another two weeks,” said the State government’s Department of Health & Family Welfare.

As efforts were on to trace the contacts of the fourth patient and the persons who had returned after attending the religious conference at Nizamuddin in Delhi, the State government cancelled all programmes to celebrate Odisha Divas, the State’s foundation day on Wednesday.

“Surveillance, testing, isolation and treatment are essentially technical matters. Our efforts are to detect as many positive cases as possible and contain the disease,” said the department while urging people to follow lockdown orders and contribute to containment efforts of the government.

The 29-year-old man from Bhadrak district, who was the fourth COVID-19 patient with travel history to Dubai, had not shown any symptoms of the disease till he was tested positive for coronavirus on Tuesday night.

While the patient has been shifted from Bhadrak to the SCB Medical College and Hospital at Cuttack, the State Health Secretary Nikunja B. Dhal has asked the Collector of Bhadrak to isolate the close contacts and get them tested and trace all contacts as soon as possible.

The Managing Director of National Health Mission Odisha is monitoring the follow-up action, according to the department.

The three persons who tested positive for coronavirus earlier are undergoing treatment at two government hospitals in Bhubaneswar.

A total of 610 samples were tested in three testing facilities in the State and four were positive for COVID-19 till Tuesday.

Of the total of 11,575 persons who had registered with the government on their return to the State so far, as many as 4,304 had returned from other countries.

On the other hand, with demand for masks increasing, the women self-help groups in the State have risen to occasion to supply affordable masks to government and private agencies and local people. In Cuttack district, 55 SHGs have already supplied 2.5 lakh masks at a nominal rate.

245,2020/04/01,Coronavirus | Special care home staff self-quarantine to protect HIV-affected children,"Lowered immunity makes these children extremely vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.

To save the vulnerable HIV-positive children staying in the special care home at Odisha’s Gopalpur from COVID-19 infection, its staff members have put themselves in indefinite self quarantine along with the inmates since March 12.

This institution, named ‘Sraddha Sanjivani’, has 52 HIV-positive children in the age group of 5 to 15. Twenty-six of them are girls. Lowered immunity makes these children extremely vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. So, they were completely cloistered at ‘Sraddha Sanjivani’ when their schools closed down from March 12 for COVID-19 threat. Seven inmates, who had gone to spend time with their relatives or parents, were asked to stay back where they were.

Strict enforcement

On March 12, staff members of ‘Sraddha Sanjivani’ decided to reduce their outside contact to the extreme so that they do not become carriers of COVID-19 to these vulnerable children, said its superintendent Akash Guru. Eight staff members including Mr. Guru have decided to put themselves in self quarantine till the threat of infection ended. Only persons allowed to enter the premises and go out are a part-time doctor and a part-time educator, who also adhere to strict measures of sanitation during every entry.

Puspita Nayak, the housemother of ‘Sraddha Sanjivani’, has left her 10-year-old son with her father in Berhampur to serve the HIV-positive children round-the-clock. Its housefather, Ujwala Tandi, got married in January, has left his newly married wife at home in Bolangir, to remain in quarantine. Cook Pramila Acharya is staying away from her home and son in Berhampur for these children. Mr. Guru had visited his home in Rayagada district for the last time during Christmas. These staff members have vowed to refrain from going out of the campus till COVID-19 threat ends.

‘Sraddha Sanjivani’ collects its groceries, vegetables and other goods of daily needs through telephonic contacts. Local police also help the staff for it. The supplies are left at the gate of the institution to avoid possibility of passing of infection to the inmates by any outsider.

To a question, Mr. Guru said, “We are so engaged throughout the day to keep the HIV-positive children busy in different activities that we forget about our own woes.”

Social distancing

249,2020/04/01,Class 5 student from Kashmir writes to the Prime Minister,"‘I feel sad, frustrated, angry and stressed because I could not attend the online classes organised by my school due to 2G connection. Online classes do not work on 2G.’

A Class 5 student in Kashmir has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging restoration of high-speed Internet, after missing the virtual classes started by her school in Srinagar on Monday. The letter has since gone viral on social media.

Hiba Arjimand Wani, a Class 5 student of Srinagar’s Presentation Convent High School, wrote, “I feel sad, frustrated, angry and stressed because I could not attend the online classes organised by my school due to 2G connection. Online classes do not work on 2G.”

Underlining that she had been away from school from August 5 and only attended it for a brief period in March, Ms. Hiba wrote: “I request you [PM] to give back our 4G so that I don’t miss online classes”.

The letter was widely circulated by netizens in Kashmir. Speaking to The Hindu, Ms. Hiba said she was forced to write the letter because the absence of high-speed Internet was hampering her daily learning, which was one major option to help keep her mind away from the COVID-19 scare and the lockdown.

“I cannot access online videos. I have to take the help of my mother’s friends, who are teachers, to guide me on certain subjects,” she added.

Arjimand Hussain Talib, father of Ms. Hiba, said only about 10% of students were able to attend the online classes on Monday. “It was a welcome idea to have these homebound children being taught online with teachers conversing and explaining on the blackboard. We couldn’t login due to 2G speed. In fact, not many students were able to attend these classes,” added Mr. Talib.

Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch, a non-governmental rights group, called upon India to withdraw any restrictions on access to the Internet in Kashmir.

“During a health crisis, access to timely and accurate information is crucial,” said Deborah Brown, senior digital rights researcher and advocate of HRW. “Internet shutdowns block people from getting essential information and services. For many children and others seeking an education, Internet is needed to continue learning as schools shutter around the world,” she added.

Referring to the global pandemic, the rights watchdog said it was time to impose a moratorium on Internet shutdowns. “Governments should ensure immediate access to the fastest and broadest possible service for all,” Ms. Brown added.

The HRW named India among four other countries, including Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Myanmar, where there are restrictions on access to the Internet.

“These countries should prioritise their responsibilities under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and avoid complicity in human rights abuses, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic,” the HRW said.

Internet has been partially restored in J&K. Currently, high-speed Internet is only available on the fixed lines, while postpaid mobile connections have a low bandwidth of 2G. Most prepaid connections have no Internet service available.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/class-5-student-from-kashmir-writes-to-the-prime-minister/article31222680.ece

252,2020/04/01,"Coronavirus | Odisha doctors decline advance salary, demand protective gear","The Odisha Medical Service Association has also expressed similar concerns in its second missive to the government within one week, stating that personal protective equipment are very essential to fight the outbreak.

A group of doctors from Odisha’s Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (VIMSAR) turned down the four months’ advance salary announced by the State government to encourage them in the fight against COVID-19.

Instead, they have demanded the proper supply of personal protective equipment (PPE). Doctors and paramedics have expressed concerns over the acute shortage of PPE, stating that they were at risk while carrying out their duties.

“We don’t want the advance salary as the country needs the funds at this most critical juncture. What we need is good quality PPE, so that we will not be carriers of the disease,” said Dr. Shankar Ramachandani, a senior resident doctor. “We have urged the government to withdraw the advance salary. The government should take steps to make PPE available to doctors and health workers,” said Dr. Ramachandani.

The Odisha Medical Service Association (OMSA) has also expressed similar concerns. “Instead of supporting us by giving four months advance salary, we need life protecting materials for the doctors and paramedical staff like N95 masks, sanitisers, PPE kit (goggles, boot covers and gowns), which are very essential to fight the coronavirus,” said OMSA president Narayan Rout.

It was OMSA’s second missive to State government on the shortage of PPE within one week. Earlier, the association of resident doctors and nurses at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Bhubaneswar’s had come up with identical demands. They pointed to the non-availability of PPE at AIIMS-Bhubaneswar.

In wake of these concerns, AIIMS-Bhubaneswar Director B. Geetanjali held a COVID-19 preparedness meeting on March 20. It was also decided to additionally procure PPE, masks and sanitisers by the hospital’s purchases division. The State government admitted that PPE was short in supply.

Odisha said on Tuesday that three persons from the State who attended a religious conference in Delhi's Nizamuddin West area have been quarantined in government hospitals.

Family members of the three persons have also been advised home isolation, said the State government’s Chief Spokesperson for COVID-19, Subroto Bagchi, at an official briefing here.

Mr. Bagchi said the government had also gathered information that some other people from the State were returning after participating in the religious conference that was held in Delhi earlier this month. Efforts are on to trace them, he added.

‘Stay at home’

Reiterating the government’s appeal to the people to stay home to stay safe during the remaining two weeks of the lockdown, Mr. Bagchi also requested people to continue taking necessary precautions to fight the coronavirus.

Mr. Bagchi informed that a total of 473 samples were tested in the State till Tuesday afternoon and the number of persons testing positive for coronavirus still remained three. As many as 57 persons are being kept in isolation wards in different hospitals in the State. The State government has identified 377 quarantine centres with 32,538 beds in 114 Urban Local Bodies in the State, said Mr. Bagchi.

Testing facilities

Mr. Das announced that the Indian Council of Medical Research (IMCR) has granted permission to have testing facilities to detect coronavirus cases at the SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack. The State has two such facilities in the State at present – AIIMS Bhubaneswar and the Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC) in Bhubaneswar.

254,2020/04/01,No bail for self-styled godman Asaram: Gujarat HC,"Rape and sexual harassment convict’s plea for four months temporary bail rejected

In his petition he submitted that he wanted to come out of the jail fearing infectious disease COVID-19 if remained imprisoned.

The 84-year-old self-styled godman Asaram, convicted in a rape and sexual harassment case, and lodged in a jail in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, where he was convicted in a separate case, sought release from jail for four months, stating that his advanced age and poor health made him more vulnerable to the coronovirus pandemic.

In his petition, his advocate submitted, “Considering the age and condition of the applicant, he would be more vulnerable to COVID-19 and therefore, this is a fit case to grant temporary bail to the applicant as prayed for.”

Additionally, the lawyer appearing for him also cited the Supreme Court's order to various State governments to release prisoners so the risk of the spread of coronavirus could be curbed inside prisons, which are congested.

After the arguments, Justice Bela Trivedi rejected Asaram’s bail plea and observed in her judgment, “It also appears that his regular bail applications were not granted by this court as well as by the Supreme Court. The case of the applicant also does not fall under any of the categories mentioned in the guidelines issued by the High Power Committee constituted pursuant to the order passed by the Supreme Court.”

It may be noted that the committee recommended the release of those undertrial prisoners who are behind bars on charges punishable with imprisonment up to seven years.

However, Asaram is facing charges of rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment, in which the maximum punishment is life imprisonment.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/no-bail-for-self-styled-godman-asaram-gujarat-hc/article31221847.ece

Of the 12 infected persons, 11 belong to a single family residing in a multi-storey building in Ramganj. The 45-year-old man, who first tested positive several days after he returned from Oman via Dubai on March 12, came in contact with a large number of people before he developed the symptoms of the disease and went for diagnosis.

Suraiya Parveen, a retired government school teacher residing in the Walled City's Ziledarji Ka Chowk, said though there was panic in the area, strict actions being taken by the administration would instill confidence among the people. “We will be helping the health care authorities by staying at home... My son has imposed a ban on all family members from venturing out,” she said.

House-to-house survey

With the total number of 21 COVID-19 positive cases – including those of an Italian tourist couple – detected in the city, Jaipur is just behind the worst-affected Bhilwara town which has so far reported 26 cases. State Medical and Health Minister Raghu Sharma said active surveillance and house-to-house survey were underway to find out the people who may be carrying the virus.

Meanwhile, about 3,000 pilgrims stranded in the localities near Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti’s dargah in Ajmer have appealed to the authorities to make arrangements for sending them to their native States. The Dargah Committee, which is a statutory body, has written letters to the Prime Minister's Office and Chief Ministers of States such as Telangana, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, seeking their intervention in the matter.

Dargah Committee's Nazim (administrator) Shakil Ahmed said though there was no possibility of a crisis like Delhi's Tablighi Jamaat centre emerging in Ajmer, pilgrims could be sent back by special trains to three directions from the city. “Pilgrims here are not staying at a single location. They are scattered in hotels and guest houses and among the relatives. They are not exposed to the virus infection in a group,” he said. Five persons in Ajmer have so far tested COVID-19 positive. They have been shifted to the isolation ward in Sawai Man Singh Government Hospital in Jaipur for treatment.

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot urged all government employees to serve as volunteers during the ongoing lockdown. “Each of them should help in taking care of 20 families. Please ensure that the poor and needy get the benefit of steps taken by the government in this time of crisis,” he tweeted.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/1211dz/article31221775.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/sixGMI799QAS1GNM799RO83jpg-31march,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-steep-hike-in-cases-in-jaipur-worry-health-experts/article31221665.ece

Varavara Rao (80) and Shoma Sen (61), accused in the Elgaar Parishad case, were refused bail by a special court set up to try cases under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) on Tuesday. The two had sought interim bail citing their bad health, their age and the spread of COVID-19 virus.

In her application, Ms. Sen has said she suffered from multiple ailments including osteoarthritis, glaucoma and high blood pressure which could make her vulnerable to a virus like COVID-19 which is spreading rapidly. Mr. Rao too claimed in his application that the elderly were more vulnerable to the virus.

Ms. Sen’s daughter Koel Sen tweeted on Monday, “Dear Mr. Thackeray, During this COVID19-CRISIS, I whole-heartedly request you to please release my mother, Nagpur University Prof. Shoma Sen from Byculla Jail along with other jailed intellectuals post #bhimakoregaon on bail/parole @CMOMaharashtra @AnilDeshmukhNCP #lockdown”.

The plea was opposed by Special Public Prosecutor Prakash Shetty who argued that their previous bail pleas were rejected, and that there is no new ground for bail available to them, and also said that the accused were booked under UAPA and the procedure for bail is different.

Rejecting the bail pleas the court observed that the accused were booked under provision of UAPA along with other sections of the Indian Penal Code, and that the directions of the high power committee excludes accused booked under UAPA from other category of undertrials and prisoners for granting bail.

The two are among the 11 person who were booked by Pune Police, before the investigation was taken over by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) recently.

258,2020/04/01,Goa extends helping hand to stranded foreign visitors,"Relief flights take hundreds home, others get food, essential supplies from the police

Amidst the COVID-19 outbreak and the resultant 21-day lockdown, Goa is doing all it can for the 1,000-plus tourists stranded in the coastal State.

As the sixth relief flight with 133 Russians left for Moscow on Tuesday, taking the number of evacuated foreign tourists to 930, the Goa Police put out videos showing its personnel providing supplies to tourists from the U.K. The tourists, who have been stranded without provisions at Palolem beach, 90 km from Panaji, had made a distress call to the police.

The police have also been providing cooked food to construction labourers stranded across the State.

The Foreigner Regional Registration Office in Goa has received applications from over 1,000 people seeking an extension of stay during the lockdown period. Most of these foreigners have been in the State since September 2019.

For those wanting to head back home, the Indian government is in touch with their respective countries. A special nodal officer has also been appointed to ensure that this process is smooth. Between Monday night and early Tuesday morning, a special flight carrying 317 tourists from Germany and other EU countries took off for Frankfurt.

Officials said that despite the skeletal staff in attendance, operations at Goa airport, led by director Gagan Malik, were under way round the clock. Several other tourists will be leaving the State after April 5.

Quarantine update

Chief Minister Dr. Pramod Sawant said there was no new case of COVID-19 in the State on Tuesday, adding that nine people had been put under home quarantine. Eight others, who were contacts of previous patients, had been sent to quarantine facilities, while 16 suspected patients were put under hospital isolation on Tuesday.

Dr. Sawant said the newly set up COVID-19 testing laboratory at the Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMC-H), Bambolim, could not start conducting tests as pathologists faced some technical issues. The problems are being resolved with the help of doctors and private pathologists.

“Today, 62 samples had to be forwarded to Pune for testing. Fixing the issue is our priority,” the Chief Minister said. Of the six samples sent for testing to Pune on Monday, four were negative while reports of two were awaited. A total 106 people are under quarantine in government hospitals.

Health Minister Viswajit Rane clarified that samples were sent to Pune to ensure there was no backlog in testing. “We are trying to streamline the process. Four tests have been conducted during the day and more will be done overnight,” he said.

Dr. Sawant held a meeting with the officials of the Public Works, Municipal Administration, Panchayat, Waste Management, Fire and other departments with regards to a cleanliness drive.

Appeal to pvt. doctors

The CM also appealed to private doctors to start operating their clinics after taking all precautions. “If they find symptoms of coronavirus then these cases can be referred to the State-run GMC-H,” he said.

259,2020/04/01,"Dashboard, mobile app to help Pune combat contagion","PSCDCL develops integrated dashboard to monitor quarantine facilities, suspected patients’ health

In the wake of rising COVID-19 cases in Pune, the Pune Smart City Development Corporation Ltd. (PSCDCL), in association with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), has developed an integrated dashboard to coordinate its fight against the contagion.

PSCDCL has also mapped each case using GIS, tracking healthcare operations at the city’s Naidu Infectious Disease Hospital and drawing up a containment plan using heat-mapping technologies. For this, it has converted its high-tech command centre into a ‘war room’ from where authorities can monitor operations to check the spread of the contagion.

“The integrated dashboard will be monitoring quarantine facilities, track the health of suspected patients and their contacts placed under home quarantine,” said Rubal Agarwal, additional municipal commissioner and chief executive officer of PSCDCL.

The disaster management cell of the PMC will also provide help to quarantined people through a helpline.

“The PSCDCL is using Geospatial Information System for tracking and monitoring the areas and create buffer zones where patients are diagnosed positive with the COVID-19 infection. This helps to implement the containment plan as per government guidelines. The mapping of the containment zones will reflect in the dashboard,” Ms. Agarwal said.

The mobile application, which is called Sayyam, has been developed to provide comprehensive online support to quarantined people, said an official from the PMC’s IT cell.

“The PSCDCL has also provided free Wi-Fi to those kept in the isolation centres. A massive awareness campaign is being carried out through social messaging on VMD screens, social media and the PMC website. Citizens can get updates on pmc.gov.in/covid,” the official said.

The command centre already has the advanced technology in place to see various functions on screen at a click, so with some tweaking it could leverage the technology in supporting the war against the virus.

PSCDCL had constructed the command and control centre three years ago to monitor various smart elements, such as variable message display screens, public announcement systems, emergency call boxes, municipal functions including street lighting, monitoring of bus movements and CCTV cameras for security. As the coronavirus hit the city, this command and control centre has diversified.

Meanwhile, the PMC has opened relief camps at 15 civic-run schools to halt the exodus of thousands of migrant workers from the city and provide them with food and shelter.

Ms. Agarwal said the schools had been converted into temporary shelter homes to accommodate the workers, while stating that social distancing norms were being strictly maintained in these places.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ta7xr7/article31222514.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01bmsmart-city,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/dashboard-mobile-app-to-help-pune-combat-contagion/article31222515.ece

“Besides him, we have not found any other person who had attended the Delhi event. However, we have informed all the district authorities to keep looking for such travel history,” Dr. Yadav said. Though the Philippines national had tested positive for COVID-19, the State has not counted him among the fatalities from the virus as yet and his death is still under review.

Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain said on Tuesday 24 people who took part in the congregation have tested positive for the coronavirus.

State Minority Development Minister Nawab Malik said Tablighi Jamaat has some followers in Maharashtra. “After learning that some 100 people from Maharashtra attended the congregation, I have asked my officials to find out how many actually attended it and their current location.”

The minister tweeted, “Tomorrow’s April 1st. The annual tradition of making an ‘April Fool’ of people has already begun on WhatsApp & social media.

The Maharashtra government will purchase 10 lakh litres of milk per day at the cost of ₹25 per litre directly from dairy farmers in the State, in a bid to avoid losses to them during the coronavirus-induced lockdown.

The decision, taken in a meeting chaired by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Tuesday, will be applicable for the next two months.

According to data from the State Dairy Development Department, of the total milk production of 12 lakh litres per day, around 10 lakh litres is not being lifted during the lockdown. “Dairy farmers are facing the brunt,” said an official from the department. He said that due to the high supply of milk, private dairies are paying merely ₹15 to ₹17 per litre.

“Apart from milk producers, it is affecting farmers and agricultural labourers as well. As a result, the State government has decided to purchase the milk through cooperatives,” said the official.

Purchased milk will be converted into powder and stored for online sale. The scheme will be implemented through the State milk federation and is expected to cost the exchequer ₹200 crore.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/f2liff/article31222453.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1BMUNLOADINGAMULMILK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/to-curb-farmers-losses-state-to-buy-10-lakh-litres-milk-every-day/article31222454.ece
264,2020/04/01,"In lockdown, Hyderabad classical dancers teach digitally","As Coronavirus pandemic forces everyone to stay home, Yamini Reddy, Vyshnavie Sainath Yagnesh and Kiranmayee Madupu talk about adapting and teaching on the digital platform

As the lockdown continues in a bid to curb the novel Coronavirus pandemic, classical dance teachers in Hyderabad stay connected with their students through online classes. It is easier for musicians, singers and instrumentalists to hold live performances or take classes online but teaching dance is a challenge. Here, classical dancers Yamini Reddy, Vyshnavie Sainath Yagnesh and Kiranmayee Madupu share their experiences.

Creative outlet

Dancer Yamini Reddy reluctantly joined the digital teaching sphere. “I am not fond of online classes but in this situation, it is our creative outlet,” she says. After a few trial and error classes, the sessions on Zoom app began with senior students and now juniors have also joined in. “Not everyone is self motivated and self disciplined to practice dance on their own. So they require a teacher’s presence to make them practice; it improves their stamina and keeps them physically and mentally active.”

Her approach was to develop an easy method so that online learning isn’t challenging for her disciples. With a bit of researching and teaching, she adapted to the digital platform. “I took some time to understand and find a right platform where my students are able to see me and I am able to see them clearly. Dance is not about listening and cannot be taught online the way you do in your regular classes.”

Her online sessions are for an hour where she teaches them a piece with mudras. “As they practice on their own, I have to do a lot more homework imagining where they can go wrong with steps.” There are some funny moments too during their online classes. Yamini shares, “On screen, sometimes the heads get cut off and sometimes their feet. I constantly tell them to adjust so that I can see their head and face.” Once the classes are over, the group takes 10 minutes to relax and have fun before they disconnect. Yamini calls the online classes a temporary bridge. “These online classes are good for me also as it keeps me busy; they are my family and I miss seeing and talking to them.”

To mark Ramnavami Are you one of those who is missing out on going to concerts and watching performances? Here is a little something to lift your spirits during this lockdown. Yamini Reddy is celebrating Ramnavami on April 2 at 6.30 pm by telecasting a short recording of her performance of ‘Tulasidas Ramayan’, choreographed by her parents and gurus Raja and Radha Reddy. Watch it on Yamini Reddy’s YouTube channel, https://www.youtube.com/

At home with dance

Vyshnavie Sainath shifts regularly between Zoom and Google Hangouts to connect to her students. “The big advantage of teaching online is that many of amma’s (dancer Rajeshwari Sainath) students who have settled abroad have reconnected.” Everyday there are five batches, thrice a week to accommodate classical dance enthusiasts through different time zones. Joined by her team member Jayalakshmi Narayanan, the duo share the screens — from a batch learning adavus and slightly advanced segment to a group honing their alaripu, jati swaram and varnams.

She was initially apprehensive of how the online classes will take off. “Although the kids were enthusiastic they would look at the screen and get easily distracted. I have to come up with different methods to get them to focus at the screen.” One of Vyshnavie’s friends is joining the online sessions from Germany. “She was anxious of the current scenario and was living with fear. Now by connecting through dance, she feels positive, motivated and knows she is not alone. She looks forward to the one-hour session.”

With many apps for the classical art, Vyshnavie hopes to create a real-time experience for the students. “I am taking feedback from those who have signed in for the online classes so that I can make it a more student-teacher journey rather than just learning dance online. I want to see how I can be available to them on a real time basis and grow with them in their journey.”

Connecting through dance online brings in a different experience. “We feel we all are at home and it’s also a huge step for the language of art.”

Easy to shoot videos

Three days before the start of Janata curfew, dancer Kiranmayee Madupu called one of her senior students home to shoot a dance session. “We sent these dance videos to 35 students so that they can practice,” she says. Kiranmayee prefers teaching through WhatsApp videos over Zoom or Skype as they are hassle-free and easier to shoot. “The students watch and learn, and when they practice, their parents shoot their videos and send it back to me so that I can give feedback,” she says.

A mother of an eight-month-old baby, Kiranmayee feels these videos are the best way to stay connected with her students mostly between the ages of 6 and 12 years. She also uploads series of videos on Instagram. “As these are small children, the parents play a major role by playing my video and then sending back the video they shot at home. It may not be perfect but the bigger deal is to stay safe at home. It is a welcome change for parents who thrive on these schedules to keep them busy.” She admits traditional dance cannot be tutored. “That is why it takes a toll. Otherwise we wouldn’t have so many dance schools in the first place. One needs ‘gurumukham’ — a teacher in front of you to tell you what is wrong. we are missing out on it.”",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/anwyym/article31226133.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym01vvyshnavie,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/yamini-reddy-vyshnavie-sainath-yagnesh-and-kiranmayee-madupu-talk-about-adapting-and-teaching-on-the-digital-platform/article31226138.ece
265,2020/04/01,Jos Buttler to auction World Cup final shirt for hospital appeal,"The 29-year-old wicketkeeper/batsman played a key role in England's thrilling defeat of New Zealand at Lord's in July

Jos Buttler is auctioning the shirt he wore in last year's dramatic World Cup final win in support of hospitals treating the coronavirus.

The 29-year-old wicketkeeper/batsman played a key role in England's thrilling defeat of New Zealand at Lord's in July, scoring a fifty, batting in the Super Over and then running out Martin Guptill off the very last ball of the match.

In a social media video posted on Tuesday, the 29-year-old said he would be posting the jersey, signed by all members of the World Cup-winning squad, on eBay.

All proceeds will go to the Royal Brompton and Harefield hospitals' charity.

“As we all know, hospitals, doctors, nurses and the NHS are all doing quite an incredible job at the moment,” Buttler said.

“And in the weeks and months to come they are going to need our support even more.

“Last week, the Royal Brompton and Harefield hospitals' charity launched an emergency appeal to provide lifesaving equipment for those two hospitals, specialising in lung and heart conditions in preparation for the COVID-19 outbreak.

“To help with their fundraising effort I'm going to be donating this shirt, which is the shirt I wore in the World Cup final last year, signed by all the players who were members of the squad.”

British television personality Piers Morgan submitted a bid of £10,000 ($12,422) but the value of the shirt had soon passed the £12,000 mark.

Cricket, in common with many sports, has seen its fixture programme brought to a shuddering halt by the global spread of the coronavirus.

Buttler was on England's tour of Sri Lanka that was recently abandoned during a warm-up game and was due to play in the lucrative Indian Premier League Twenty20 event, which has been postponed until at least April 15.

266,2020/04/01,"Nine years on, Dhoni at the crossroads","Time running out for the World Cup-winning skipper

The stands were a blaze of light. In the middle, though, M.S. Dhoni shone the brightest.

His bat speed and dextrous wrists had combined wonderfully as he sent a full ball from Nuwan Kulasekara for the maximum over long-on in the maximum city. You can freeze the frame.

The stunning shot brought an entire nation to life. India had, on April 2, won the 2011 World Cup at Mumbai’s iconic Wankhede Stadium.

Bold move

Dhoni was captain courageous in a big game — the summit clash — promoting himself ahead of the in-form Yuvraj Singh when the contest was delicately balanced at 114 for three; India was chasing a challenging 275 against the gallant Sri Lankans.

And along with a resilient Gautam Gambhir (97), he first ran like a panther between the wickets and then cut loose in what was a brutal onslaught.

Dhoni’s 79-ball unbeaten 91 had guided India to a raucous six-wicket triumph. And the spectators swung to the rhythmic beating of the drums as if there was no tomorrow.

Outside, there were traffic jams. The skipper was the toast, made all the right moves.

That was then; Dhoni at the height of his powers. Now, the scenario is different. Time waits for no one and Dhoni is pushing 39. Deep down Dhoni realises that his best days are behind. But then, he still has the eye of the tiger.

Had not Martin Guptill scored a sensational direct hit in the 2019 WC semifinal, he and India might have had a different story to tell.

Dhoni, on 50, was lining himself for the big hits. India was in doldrums at 92 for six, when he rallied with an inspired Ravindra Jadeja to keep the Men in Blue in the hunt. Under the circumstances, the criticism that Dhoni came under was harsh and without reason.

In the IPL, he has whipped up spectacular moments in the last two seasons, making the impossible possible. And he still possesses the fastest hands behind the stumps.

Yet, the odds are loaded against a Dhoni comeback for the World Twenty20 with the Coronavirus pandemic putting a huge question mark over the IPL and a stage for the CSK skipper to conjure blitzkriegs and put himself in India contention.

The luminous star of 2011 now finds his career at the crossroads.

267,2020/04/01,Rajasthan Royals open to shortened IPL among Indian players only: franchise CEO,"The BCCI is yet to take a decision on the 13th edition of the lucrative league, which remains postponed at least till April 15 due to the coronavirus pandemic and the resultant travel restrictions on foreigners’ entry to India

Even a shortened IPL with just Indian players would be good enough in these “extraordinary times”, Rajasthan Royals CEO Ranjit Barthakur said on Wednesday, revealing that a final call on the glitzy event’s fate is unlikely to be taken before April 15.

The top executive spelt out his franchise’s wish even as the number of positive cases and death toll due to the pandemic continued to rise across the world.

The BCCI is yet to take a decision on the 13th edition of the lucrative league, which remains postponed at least till April 15 due to the coronavirus pandemic and the resultant travel restrictions on foreigners’ entry to India. It was originally supposed to start on March 29.

“We are open to a shortened tournament with only Indian players, at the end of the day it is the Indian Premier League,” Barthakur told PTI.

Also read: It could be a truncated IPL, says Ganguly

With a nationwide lockdown in place to combat the spread of the disease, the event seems unlikely to go ahead unless the BCCI figures an alternate window later in the year, compromising a few bilateral commitments.

The RR executive though said they are confident that the Board will take a decision keeping in mind the best interests of the franchises.

“These are extraordinary times and the BCCI will do the best it can when things improve,” he said.

“Earlier we could not think of an Indians-only IPL but now there is enough quality to choose from. It is better to have an Indians-only IPL than not at all.

“When can we have it? That the BCCI decides. And I think that call be taken only post 15th April,” Mr. Barthakur added.

The novel coronavirus has so far infected over 850,000 people worldwide while claiming the lives of more than 42,000. Over 1600 positive cases have so far been reported across India besides over 40 deaths.

Talking to BBC World Service last weekend, RR’s majority owner Manoj Badale admitted that the IPL “pales into insignificance in terms of things we should be really be thinking about right now”.

In view of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the tickets sale for the inaugural edition of ‘The Hundred competition has been postponed.

“... We feel it is appropriate at this time to postpone opening our second priority ticket window and general sale. We will continue to review this and will let you know any further information in due course,” said an official statement on the tournament’s website.

The Hundred is a 100-ball format that is set to launch in July with the men’s and women’s tournaments to run concurrently over a five-week period.

The first priority sale of the tickets took place in February with the ECB saying that initial sales had surpassed expectations. The second installment, available for subscribers, was due to open on April 2 and the general sale was scheduled for April 8.

Sanjay Patel, managing director, The Hundred, said: “In the midst of an epidemic which is affecting the nation in unprecedented ways, it would be wholly inappropriate for us to promote and sell tickets to The Hundred.”

“We appreciate this may cause some disappointment to fans that were keen to purchase tickets in the April sales window, accessing early bird prices and securing tickets to the most in-demand games.

“When it is appropriate to go back on sale, we will of course offer the same ticket offers and accessible pricing. Like the rest of the nation, we all hope that it is not far away before cricket returns to our screens, stadiums, parks and clubs,” he added.

278,2020/04/01,"Fodder, feed availability worries cattle growers","P. Kanagaraj, a resident of Ganapathy Ganesh Layout, is worried about the 15 cows at his house.

“I milk around 130 litres a day to make around ₹650 a day, after deducting expenses. But now I’m worried – not necessarily because I can’t make that much money. But because my cows are going without food.” He feeds 50 bundles of green fodder and 100 – 150kg of feed that is a mixture groundnut cake, bran, cotton seed and a few other items. “Now, during this lockdown, I’m unable to source either green fodder or the feed,” he rues.

R. Kalyanasundaram, a resident of Vadavalli, says there is no green fodder almost anywhere in Coimbatore as the district is dependent on Erode.

R. Mylsamy of K.N. Palayam, Sathyamangalam, says he used to supply around 2,000 stacks of maize – the green fodder – to cattle growers in Ganapathy, Sanganur, Edayarpalayam, Vadavalli, Vellakinaru, Saravanampatty, Vilankurichi and a few other areas. But with police stopping vehicles and he having paid advance to farmers, is stuck. “On the one hand, I’m unable to transport goods to Coimbatore, and, on the other, the advance I’ve paid to farmers to harvest maize is as good as gone as the crops are wilting and I cannot ask them to return the advance.”

Farmers’ Association (non-partisan) general secretary P. Kandasamy says the Association has taken the issue to the notice of the officials concerned. In fact, the Agriculture Department Secretary has on March 24 written a letter to all officials to allow movement of agriculture goods and keep open shops selling agriculture goods, including fertilizers. Since the transport of fodder is covered under this, officials manning check-posts should have no problem in allowing movement of vehicles carrying green fodder or animal feed from anywhere in the State. But, the reality is that, many officials who man the check post are unaware of such an order.

Collector K. Rajamani says farmers and cattle growers have brought the issue to his notice. He has had a word with the Erode Collector, who apparently has asked the Revenue Department officials in Gobichettipalayam to permit movement of vehicles with fodder.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/fodder-feed-availability-worries-cattle-growers/article31223586.ece

282,2020/04/01,Anti-smog guns installed at 14 large project sites in Delhi,"The device sprays nebulised water droplets into the air through high-pressure propellers to curb dust pollution

More than two months after the Supreme Court ordered the installation of anti-smog guns at all large construction sites among other locations to reduce dust pollution, the devices have been installed at 14 of the 47 large projects in Delhi.

But most of the government agencies, including the municipal corporations and the Public Works Department, are yet to comply to letters sent by the Delhi Pollution Control Board (DPCC) to instal anti-smog guns, said officials.

The anti-smog gun sprays nebulised water droplets into the air through high-pressure propellers, which help dust particles settle down. “The remaining 33 sites have informed us that they will instal the anti-smog guns as soon as they get the supply,” a Delhi government official told The Hindu.

On January 13, the Supreme Court had said that anti-smog guns should be mandatory in projects that require environmental clearance from the State or Centre, and have a built-up area of over 20,000 square metres.

The DPCC then made a list of all projects that have taken an environmental clearance and wrote to them on January 22, asking them to come up with a plan in 30 days, and then gave them a deadline of March 18 to instal the devices. “We will analyse the condition and give a fresh deadline to the remaining 33 projects,” the official said.

The DPCC wrote to all the five municipal bodies in Delhi, the Public Works Department, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC), Delhi Development Authority (DDA), and Delhi Jal Board (DJB) on January 16, and instructed them to issue directions to contractors who carry out the latter’s works to instal anti-smog guns.

“Most of them are yet to respond to us except for NHAI and NBCC. All the municipal corporations said that they are busy with dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak. We will send them reminders,” the official said.

An anti-smog gun has been parked at the construction site in India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO). But it has been used only at one spot.

“For the last few days, it has been at this spot. We need a tractor to pull it as the 500-litre tank makes it heavy for even two people to move it. So, we have been using it only at this part of the site,” a worker told The Hindu.

Though the site had rented two such devices, one was not functioning and the other was taken out of operation, according to officials at the site. The device was not able to control dust at the site as it was stationed only spot in the vast area.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/8onw3a/article31231325.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2DEGUN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/anti-smog-guns-installed-at-14-large-project-sites-in-the-capital/article31231326.ece

285,2020/04/01,Nizamuddin event: Centre seeks action against officials responsible,"Govt. counsel seeks suo motu action for ‘negligence’

A Central government standing counsel has written a letter to the Delhi High Court seeking to initiate suo motu action against the State government officials responsible for alleged negligence in preventing the religious congregation in Nizamuddin here that led to further spread of COVID-19.

Central government Standing Counsel Gaurang Kanth, a resident of Nizamuddin East, also sought action against the organisers and participants of the religious congregation at Alami Markaz Banglewali Masjid in Nizamuddin West for “compromising the safety of people and contributing to the spread of COVID-19”. He also sought immediate action and remedial measures for curtailing and preventing the spread of COVID-19 in Nizamuddin.

Mr. Kanth said that being a Central government Standing Counsel, he required requisite permission from the Centre for filing an appropriate writ petition before the High Court on the issue. However, in view of the emergency situation and being an officer of the court, it was his duty to bring this to the attention of the court, he said.

Mr. Kanth said the religious gathering was organised in violation of the March 16 order issued by the Health and Family Welfare Department of the Delhi Government in accordance with the Delhi Epidemic Diseases, COVID-19 Regulations, 2020 under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897.

“These gatherings were also in violation of another order issued by the Office of the Commissioner of Police, New Delhi, which was effective from March 18, 2020, wherein assembly of five or more individuals was prohibited,” it said.

“However, despite the said orders being in place, the congregation [being conducted] shows carelessness and gross negligence of the State government and other officials, including the District Magistrate [South East] in handling the emergency situation in Nizamuddin. It cannot be denied that officials were not aware of the presence of such a large gathering at the markaz in Nizamuddin West,” he said in the letter.

“This clearly constitutes a lapse on the part of the State government machinery and is inexcusable and unpardonable,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/nubp08/article31232935.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE02HC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/nizamuddin-event-centre-seeks-action-against-officials-responsible/article31231229.ece

Delhi Police on Wednesday recorded the statements of Hazrat Nizamuddin police station staff and occupants of a centre who were in quarantine. The statements were taken over the phone.

“We are preparing a list of people who will be questioned. We are also maintaining social distancing during the investigation,” said a police officer.

The police said that the evacuation process ended after 36 hours, at 4 a.m. on Wednesday. All occupants were screened by the Health Department and were either shifted to a hospital or sent to quarantine. The building and the area outside were disinfected by a sanitation department team. The entry to the building is restricted till the time the Health Department surveys it.

“We have prepared a list of Indians and foreign nationals who were part of the Tablighi Jamaat and have shared it with other States to track the people and put them in quarantine. We also got details of attendees from the people in quarantine. A team of U.P., Haryana, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh police visited the area to get more details about the people who went back after attending an event at the centre,” said an officer.

A senior officer said that the staff of the local police station claimed that they visited the centre on March 23 and were informed that around 1,000 people had left and the remaining were from other States and it was impossible for them to leave.

A video has been provided by the local police where personnel can be seen instructing people to vacate the centre as the event violated the Delhi government’s order prohibiting the gathering of 50 or more people.

“We are also probing the claims of Jamaat officials that they had sought permission from the SDM to vacate the centre and that a list of vehicles were given to seek passes,” the officer added.

“A Delhi police team visited Maulana Saad’s hometown in western U.P., but he was not there. He was last seen on March 28,” the officer said.

288,2020/04/01,Home Ministry wakes up to Tabligh event,"2,100 foreigners visited India for Tabligh programmes since Jan. 1: Home Ministry

As many as 360 foreigners were deported from Delhi in 2018-19 for reportedly indulging in “missionary activities” while they were here on a tourist visa, a senior Home Ministry official has said. In 2016-17, the number of such violators stood at 120, the official said.

Currently, foreigners who participated in a Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Nizamuddin have come under the Home Ministry scanner, which is the nodal agency that gives permission to any foreigner to participate in any international event.

Any conference/event application is routed through an Indian mission abroad and without the Home Ministry’s permission, the event cannot happen and participants are not issued visas.

According to a Home Ministry statement, some 2,100 foreigners visited India for Tabligh programmes since January 1 this year. “Usually, all the foreign nationals visiting India as a part of Tablighi team come on the strength of tourist visa. MHA had already issued guidelines that they should not indulge in missionary work on tourist visa. State Police would be examining categories of visas of all these foreign TJ [Tablighi Jamaat] workers and take further action in case of violation of visa conditions,” the Ministry said.

‘Visa conditions violated’

On Wednesday, Cabinet Secretray Rajiv Gauba asked Directors- General of Police to initiate “action” against the foreigners and the organisers of the event as the “foreigners who had participated in the Tablighi Jamaat had violated visa conditions”

The Ministry is apparently set to blacklist the 824 foreign Tablighi members who came here on a tourist visa and “participated” in religious congregations and meetings.

The Jamaat congregation, part of regular Tabligh activity, was attended by people from Nepal, Malaysia, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Algeria, Kyrgystan, Indonesia, Thailand and Sri Lanka.

The Tabligh position

In a press release issued on Tuesday, the Tablighi Jamaat said. “When Hon’ble Prime Minister announced the “Janta Curfew”, for 22nd March 2020, the ongoing programme in Markaz Nizamuddin was discontinued immediately, however due to sudden cancelation of rail services across the country on March 21, 2020, a large group of visitors who had to depart by way of railways got stuck in the Markaz [centre] premises.”

“Before the Janta Curfew could be lifted at 9 p.m. [on March 22], the Hon’ble Chief Minister of Delhi announced lockdown of Delhi beginning at 6 a.m. on March 23, 2020 till March 31, 2020, thereby further diminishing any chances of these visitors availing road transport for their journey back home. Despite this challenging situation, with the help of Markaz [centre] administration, around 1,500 visitors left Markaz [centre] Nizamuddin by availing whatever meagre transport was available,” the release said.

“Suddenly on the evening of March 23, a further nationwide lockdown was announced by the Hon’ble Prime Minister with clear message for people to stay-put wherever they are. Under such compelling circumstances there was no option for Markaz Nizamuddin but to accommodate the stranded visitors with prescribed medical precautions till such time that situation becomes conducive for their movement…” the statement said.

“During this entire episode, Markaz [centre] Nizamuddin never violated any provision of law, and always tried to act with compassion and reason towards the visitors who came to Delhi from different states. It did not let them violate the medical guidelines by thronging ISBTs or roaming on streets,” the release added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/home-ministry-wakes-up-to-tabligh-event/article31231155.ece
289,2020/04/01,"Supply is erratic, say grocers","‘No need to panic as distributors will replenish stocks soon’

A week into the nationwide lockdown, several grocers across the city, said that supply of essential items, including dairy products were in shortage. However, they added that there was no need to panic as distributors had promised to replenish stocks at the earliest but were rationing a few products.

Biplab Banerjee, who runs a grocery store in CP Park markets said, “Items like milk powder, cheese and even tea are not being supplied regularly. Most of what we have now is what we stocked just when the lockdown was announced. Foodgrain is the only item with a regular supply as of now.”

Speaking about if distributors had assured them stock, Mr. Banerjee added, “All company deliveries which are done are not happening currently. For other items, we are approaching local distributors and collecting whatever we get. We are not really sure of what the scenario will be like in the next few daysand one can only leave everything to the Almighty.”

Subir Pramanik, another grocer in the market said, “Supply for most products, apart from bread, milk and foodgrain, is very erratic these days. Products like biscuits and other junk items are mostly the stock we had procured before the lockdown.”

Imported goods

At a store that stocks several imported goods in Defence Colony, the owner said, “Those who are finicky about a particular brand may find it hard to find a product but there is no cause for concern. Customers understand that not all products will be available and some of them have left their phone number with me to call them when stocks arrive. However, when it comes to imported goods, supply has stopped.”

Ramesh, who works in a shop in another south Delhi neighbourhood market added, “Supply of most items is less than half of what we are ordering. If we ask for 10 units of a particular item, we are getting only two or three. Because of the low supply, the stock is also getting over really quickly.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/supply-is-erratic-say-grocers/article31231131.ece
290,2020/04/01,People in riot-hit areas of Delhi who applied for ration online yet to get response,"Noor-e-ilahi and Ghonda residents had applied on Delhi govt. website 4 days ago

The residents of north-east Delhi’s riot-hit Noor-e-ilahi and Ghonda said they had applied for ration on the Delhi government’s website but are yet to her back from the authorities.

The government recently launched a website for services listing “food required”, “ration required”, “₹5,000 compensation for construction workers”, “pension amount” and “e-pass for travel during curfew”.

At least 120 residents had applied for ration and none of them have either received a call or been visited by any official, it has been learnt. The area is inhabited mostly by unskilled workers, who hail from Uttar Pradesh or Bihar, and are now out of work.

One of the residents, identified as Salman, who runs a medical shop, said he had helped families apply for ration on the government’s website, adding that they had also requested for e-passes. “People in the neighbourhood are niether educated nor technologically sound and so they sought help. I applied for ration for 120 families,” he said and mentioned that the application was made four days ago.

“Many of those who have applied do not belong to Delhi and do not have ration cards here either. They are out of work due to the restriction of non-essential services and are in need of ration,” he said.

A 23-year-old woman, identified as Imrana, a resident of Noor-e-ilahi, who used to work in a diaper-making factory, said that her family has eight members, four of whom, including her, were working. All of them, however, at home, without work and without money. “The employers said that they would not give money and we don’t know when this lockdown will end. My brother is a rickshaw-puller and my father ran a small business which has been shut now. We are left with little money which will not last long.

291,2020/04/01,Ration shop owner held for misappropriation of foodgrains,"Accused saw an opportunity to sell foodgrains at higher price, says police officer

Owner of a fair price shop was arrested for allegedly misappropriating foodgrains in west Delhi’s Raghubir Nagar, the police said on Wednesday.

The accused was identified as Ravinder Kumar (64) who was arrested by the team of Additional Commissioner of Police (West) Sameer Sharma.

The police said that an information was received about misappropriation of foodgrains by an owner of a fair shop owner at Raghubir Nagar’s M Block after which the shop was identified and the shop where foodgrains were suspected to have been shifted was also identified.

Register checked

“The shops were cordoned off. Area Food and Civil Supply officer was informed,” said a senior police officer, adding that the shop owner was then called and asked to open the shop where the sale and stock register was checked.

“There was a board outside the shop which carried a general notice that there is no ration and therefore, ration will not be disbursed today. Subsequently, the local general store where the stuff was suspected to have been transferred was also checked where 21 jute bags of rice which were meant for disbursement at the fair price shop were found,” the officer said.

The police said that the accused who was supposed to sell 6 kg wheat and 1.5 kg rice free of cost to ration cardholders saw this is an opportunity to sell at higher price. The police are also looking at the role of owner of the general store where the foodgrain were kept.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ration-shop-owner-held-for-misappropriation-of-foodgrains/article31231116.ece

According to a report published by the Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyaan (DRRAA), 32% of the ration shops visited by the organisation were found closed. Of the 37 ration shops inspected by the DRRAA across the city including, Narela, Murika, Mayur Vihar, Hauz Rani, Dakshinpuri, Nangloi and others, 12 were found to be closed, the report said.

No fresh stock

“Two shops in Narela were found to be closed on three consecutive days. Upon further inquiry, the DRRAA was told that one of the shops has been shut for a long time and the shopkeeper distributes ration in another location. In four shops which were found to be shut, we were informed that the stock had finished and the shop will open when new stock reaches,” the report read.

Noting the Delhi government’s announcement on the ration for two months to be delivered to shops by March 29, the report said, “There is no way to ascertain whether all the beneficiaries have indeed been able to get their rations, as neither the proof of distribution is available in the public domain nor are the contact details of ration cardholders available for verification by phone.”

The report added that all the shops that were open, distributed ration free of cost, as per the government directive. It also said that in 10 of the 37 shops, no civil defence volunteer, representative of the MLA or police personnel could be located.

295,2020/04/01,Coronavirus | Delhi Police to track phones of people under quarantine,"Strict action to be taken against violators, says Kejriwal as he follows example of other nations to curb COVID-19 spread

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday announced that the mobile phones of all those who have been asked to home quarantine themselves will be tracked by the Delhi Police to keep a check on their movement.

Several other countries have used this technology to contain the spread of COVID-19, and that tracking mobile phones was one such way to ensure people abide by quarantine norms, he said.

“The government has given 14,345 phone numbers to the Delhi Police on Wednesday to track them, in addition to 11,084 numbers it had shared on Tuesday. Strict action would be taken against those not adhering to the government’s order on home quarantine,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

Making the announcement during his daily digital briefing, the Chief Minister reiterated that there has not been any community transmission of COVID-19 in Delhi.

He added that for those persons who do not have ration cards, the Delhi government said it was a challenge to distribute ration to them but it had has created a system for roughly 10 lakh people who do not have ration cards.

“I want to request all those people to apply for a ration card on the Delhi government e-district website. You can take the help of MLAs and SDMs. You will not get a ration card but will get ration every month till COVID-19 persists,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

No salary cut

Appealing to employers to not cut salaries of their employees, Mr. Kejriwal said, “Today is April 1, and to release the salaries of the employees, the employers, and their accountants need to work through the offices. For this, the Delhi government is issuing two passes each to the employers for the next two days, so that they can release the payments online to their employees.”

298,2020/04/01,"Coronavirus | Forced to stay back, these workers now battle hunger","Their ration cards are in Bihar and they have no money left

‘Stay home and stay safe’, the global slogan to contain the spread of coronavirus doesn’t sound too convincing to Mohammed Hakim and his associates who, unlike many other migrants, were forced to stay back and are battling hunger each day.

Their names are listed on ration cards but the cards, along with their families, are at home in Bihar. Living five to six persons in one windowless room at shanties behind the Jal Vihar bus terminal in the shadow of the posh Lajpat Nagar 1 colony in Delhi, they are now struggling to get one meal a day.

Coronavirus | Supreme Court upholds right to discuss COVID-19

“There are about 180 of us from Katihar who live here. Majority of us drive auto-rickshaws or pull cycle-rickshaws for a living. On March 28, many of us, by then having exhausted whatever little money we had, couldn’t get anything to eat. Then there were rumours that the lockdown will continue for three months. That jolted the others who still had some money to head home,” Mr. Hakim says.

For them it’s a race between the fear of an unknown virus and very real hunger pangs.

Coronavirus | Helpline numbers | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

Nearly 100 of them left for home. With no trains or buses, they just rode home in auto-rickshaws and cycle rickshaws, that on a normal day was the means of earning a living. Thirty-two of them pedalled cycle-rickshaws to cover a distance of 1,390 Km to Katihar. Three days later, covering a distance of 554 km, they reached Lucknow on Tuesday morning. “Their mobile phones are switched off, so we don’t know if the police caught them or if they are still continuing on their journey,” Mohammed Nizammudin, another auto-rickshaw driver, whose distant relative is one of the 32 making the journey, says.

For the 80-odd who stayed back, each day is getting more challenging. Coronavirus, the lynchpin of this lockdown, doesn’t occupy much mind space, though all of them are wearing masks, some readymade, some fashioned out of gamchas. It’s a race between the fear of an unknown virus and very real hunger pangs.

Charge against police

The group complains that the police posted outside the gates of the colony don’t let them step out. “They hit first and ask questions later. We are shooed back into the colony each time we try to leave. We heard on the radio that the Delhi government is providing food, but we don’t know where or how to get to it,” 38-year-old Abdul says.

After a day without any food on Sunday, the Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan provided Rs. 2,000 for emergency rations on Monday. A government relief centre is providing free cooked food about a kilometre away, but the men say that they are beaten by police enforcing the lockdown if they venture out of the colony, showing the marks of lathis on arms and legs.

Full coverage | Lockdown displaces lakhs of migrants

As if hunger was not enough, being reduced to running behind vehicles delivering food or standing in queues to get a paltry amount has shaken many. “We never imagined that this day will come. We have always earned a respectful living and spent whatever we got. Never had to beg for food. We used to save enough to send some home too,” Mr. Nizammuddin adds.

As the chorus of complaints gets louder their anger against the government erupts. “Modi ji, sitting on a comfortable chair from his air-conditioned home comes up with these declarations. First it was demonetisation and now this. Since he came to power the country has been standing in queues,” Ahmed a cycle-rickshaw puller says.

The common grouse is that the government should have given them a few days notice to reach their home towns before declaring a lockdown.

“If they extend the lockdown by another day after April 14, we all will leave, even if they are to shoot us down.

There is no truth in the information being circulated on WhatsApp and other social media that 150 COVID-19 patients have been admitted to Apollo Hospitals, Jubilee Hills, from two areas in the city, said a release from the hospital.

Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Apollo Hospitals Y. Subramanyam, in a statement here, said that the information was false and a clear case of trouble-mongering.

“Apollo Hospitals strongly condemns the circulation of this fake news with malafide intentions. We have lodged a complaint with the authorities and hope the culprits will be booked,” the CEO said in his statement.

He added that a COVID-19 unit with 50 beds has been set up away from the hospital and suspected or confirmed patients were being treated at this facility.

“This ensures complete separation of COVID-19 and non-COVID patients,” he said.

300,2020/04/01,Most of Delhi returnees in TS identified,"10 Tablighi Jamaat workers take tests at a Hyderabad hospital

Health Minister Eatala Rajender said on Wednesday that over 1,000 people from Telangana went to New Delhi for Markaz prayers. Barring 160, all of them have been identified, and tests are being conducted.

The State government on Monday had stated that six people from Telangana who attended a religious congregation in New Delhi from March 13 to 15 succumbed after they contracted coronavirus.

Stating that the State government was the first to announce a lockdown, Mr. Rajender said they were the ones who informed the Centre about the Tablighi Jamaat congregation. He stressed that there was no community transmission in the State. Till Tuesday night, 77 active COVID-19 cases were reported here.

Two people were discharged from Government General and Chest Hospital, Erragadda, on Tuesday and two more from Gandhi Hospital would be discharged from Gandhi Hospital on Wednesday. They have to be under home quarantine for another 14 days.

Besides, 10 more people with COVID-19 who were isolated at Gandhi Hospital have tested negative for coronavirus. They too would be discharged if they test negative in second consecutive test.

Meanwhile, around 10 workers of the Tablighi Jamaat, including some from its Telangana and Andhra Pradesh leadership, were taken to the Government General and Chest Hospital for tests on Wednesday.

The move comes after several Jamaat workers who had returned from the Aalami (Global) Markaz in Banglewaali Masjid in Nizamuddin, Delhi tested positive for coronavirus.

According to sources, the workers were taken to the hospital as a precautionary measure, given the fact that they were operating from the Tablighi Jamaat Markaz in Jama Masjid Moazzampura in Mallepally, Hyderabad and could have come in contact with those suspected of being infected.

A source from the Tablighi Jamaat said that its Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Ameer (chief) Maulana Ikram was also taken to the hospital as a precautionary measure.

Speaking to The Hindu, one of those who were taken to the hospital said, “While the masjid committee has closed the masjid, the Jamaat has its office in a room on the first floor. We have been fully cooperating with the police and Health department. Some of us were liaising with the authorities throughout the day. The Hyderabad police, as a precautionary measure told us last night to get tested. We have agreed and come to hospital,” a senior Tablighi Jamaat worker said.

He explained that the Jamaat office was closed voluntarily and temporarily. “Since we had to come here, we locked the doors of the office,” he said.

Later in the the day, the workers said that their swab samples were taken for tests on Wednesday and the results would be made available to them in a day or two.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/z9pj3v/article31231221.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-MAIN-MARKAZ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/most-of-delhi-returnees-in-ts-identified/article31231204.ece
301,2020/04/01,‘OPDs not closed but telemedicine preferred’,"OP facility mainly for patients with chronic ailments

As people are slowly getting adjusted to life under lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19, anxiety levels are mounting for some about access to medical care for other ailments.

Most people go to the OPDs of corporate hospitals for any health issue rather than the ‘over-crowded’ government hospitals. Now, the government advisory to discourage crowds at OPDs for some time did unnerve families with senior citizens and chronic patients.

When this concern was presented to corporate hospitals, their response was clear — OPDs are not closed and people can still walk in though telemedicine facility is available in every major hospital. People themselves have stopped coming to OPDs unless the health condition demands physical examination, they said.

Group president of Apollo Hospitals Hari Prasad said that those with health issues that need consultation in person must come to hospital. But, those who can consult a doctor over telephone should make use of Apollo’s telemedicine facility.

“Apollo Hospital at Jubilee Hills gets 150 to 200 tele-consults per day. The footfall to OPDs have come down by 40% to 45%,” he said.

Director of Yashoda Hospitals Group Abhinav said that OPD now was mainly for patients with chronic ailments.

302,2020/04/01,"₹9,000 crore to be raised through market borrowings","With dwindling resources on the financial front, the State government has apparently decided to mobilise funds in the form of auction of securities and market borrowings in the coming days to tide over the crisis.

Accordingly, the State government has decided to mobilise around ₹9,000 crore in the first quarter of the current financial year. The Reserve Bank of India has announced the indicative calender of market borrowings by State governments and also released the weekly schedule of auctions to be held during the period along with the name of States who have confirmed participation along with the tentative amounts indicated by them.

According to the indicative calender, the State government has decided to opt for market borrowings of ₹9,000 crore in six instalments.

Instalments

The first instalment of ₹2,000 crore would be raised on April 13 followed by ₹1,000 crore on April 28, ₹2,000 crore on May 12, ₹1,000 crore on May 26, ₹2,000 crore on June 9 and ₹1,000 crore on June 30.

The development assumes significance in the light of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s assertion at a press conference the other day that the State government would convince the Central government and the RBI for availing overdraft if need be to bridge the gap in the resources.

The government had raised ₹2,573 crore through sale of securities during the auction conducted by the RBI on March 30.

Of the total amount, ₹1,000 crore was with a tenure of five years with cut off price/yield of 6.88%, ₹750 crore with tenure of eight years and cut off price/yield of 7.25% cent and the remaining ₹823.97 crore with tenure of 10 years and cut off price/yield of 7.35%.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/9000-crore-to-be-raised-through-market-borrowings/article31231142.ece
303,2020/04/01,Rural MLAs face bigger challenges than their urban counterparts,"Quarantined people being monitored through geo-tagging

Challenges in the rural areas seem to be more for the people’s representatives in this time of crisis while their urban counterparts seem to be relatively at ease as rural areas come with multitude of problems to deal with lesser resources available.

The teleconference of Huzurnagar MLA Shanampudi Saidireddy with officials of his constituency revealed the tough time officials and MLAs go through in the rural constituencies. Right from farmers to farm labourers to nuisance creating tipplers to keeping track of the home quarantined and the influx of people at the Registered Medical Practitioners (RMPs) and the shortage of staff to the high expectations of people - its one mad scenario.

A highly motivating aspect of the entire episode is the enthusiasm shown by the officials in trying times and the motivation from the MLA. An agriculture officer expressed that farmers were apprehensive of their produce despite Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao categorically committing that every grain would be bought by the government while there was a complaint of tipplers violating the norms trying to get liquor as the wine shops were closed.

The MLA asked the agriculture officers to reach out to farmers to inform that procurement will start in a couple of days as gunny bags are expected any time and farmers should have confidence in CM’s assurance. At the same time, he instructed the police officers to ensure that the belt shops are closed at any cost to avoid gatherings. “It’s tough to explain to rural people how dangerous the virus is and most of our energy is consumed for this,” he told The Hindu.

Health officials are facing a unique problem in the rural areas as it is the season for chickenpox as well and it comes with fever that people are mistaking for coronavirus symptoms.

“We are trying to educate people in all the health centres,” an official explained. However, Mr. Saidireddy asked officials to ensure that RMPs do not treat fever and cold symptoms and immediately alert the Health department.

‘Arrest’ option

An official said quarantined people are now being monitored through geo-tagging and several seem to be violating it. “The only way to control them is to arrest and move them to isolation centres,” Mr. Saidireddy said.

Seizure of vehicles ferrying farm labourers was another concern but the MLA instructed that they have to travel only in tractors and not in autorickshaws, which would be seized at any cost. One common aspect repeatedly raised by several officials was youngsters gathering in lanes and bylanes due to low presence of police.

“This is a common problem even in cities,” the MLA said and revealed that police were already overburdened and the educated youngsters should cooperate with the government.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/3f5vkz/article31231129.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY02SHANAMPUDISAIDIREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/rural-mlas-face-bigger-challenges-than-urban-counterparts/article31231130.ece

All of them were traced by police to various mosques in Nalgonda and were first shifted to a function hall on the outskirts. They reportedly reached Nalgonda on March 17. Medical officials said they conducted preliminary diagnosis and then decided to move them to the facility. “All of them are healthy and none of them showed symptoms,” an official said.

After the deaths of six of the Delhi returnees, the administration intensified contact tracing. The Medical & Health department has formed 20 new teams to trace their secondary contacts now.

A family member of the retired government employee, who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat and tested positive, also tested positive. Six other family members however tested negative and reports of two others are yet to come, according to Nizamabad Collector C. Narayana Reddy. The retired employee is undergoing treatment at Gandhi Hospital.

A person at Gajwel tested positive and was reportedly shifted to Gandhi Hospital. According to sources, the 51-year-old reached Gajwel on March 20 after the Delhi meet. Police are trying to find out his primary and secondary contacts. A senior official, confirming the case, informed that the man had met about 14 people at Daultabad and Mirdoddi mandals and all of them were put in home quarantine.

Meanwhile, the total number of Delhi returnees in Adilabad rose from 52 to 57 on Wednesday, with five more being identified and stamped for the 14-day quarantine. Only two returnees have not yet been stamped as they are reported to be stuck in UP.

In Nirmal, authorities are continuing to identify returnees and expect it to be around 60. The DMHO department in association with IMA Karimnagar chapter conducted door-to-door survey in the ‘red zone’ areas.

307,2020/04/01,"‘Tablighi Jamaat is non-political, peaceful’","Its primary activity includes constituting jamaats or preacher batches

The Tablighi Jamaat took shape after its founder Maulana Mohammed Ilyas returned from performing Haj in 1925, as a religious reformatory movement with focus on Meo Muslims of Mewat.

It is often described as a loosely based organisation, but has a hierarchy with an ameer (leader or chief) in charge of administrative circles that could be a neighbourhood, district or State.

While there are no card carrying members, the organisation, has workers across the globe running into lakhs. Workers include students, professionals and even daily wage earners. It has its global headquarters at the Banglewaali Masjid in Nizamuddin, Delhi.

A senior Tablighi Jamaat functionary said that the organisation is ‘non-political’, ‘peaceful’ and inward looking, meaning that it focuses on the Muslim community. One of its primary activities includes constituting jamaats, meaning batches of preachers, who camp in mosques for a duration of usually a day, three days, 10 days, 40 days or four months, and are engaged in largely spiritual activities, and self-finance their travel and food expenses.

They also go door-to-door preaching basic tenets of Islam to Muslims with a grassroots level approach, known as gasht meaning perambulation.

There are 88 circles in Greater Hyderabad area. These apart, there are 23 circles in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, with each erstwhile district being a circle. The current chief is Maulana Ikram Ali who was preceded by Maulana Nayeemullah Khan.

The Tablighi Jamaat is now divided into two factions.

Mahender Reddy and senior officials, the Chief Minister is said to have briefed her about the steps the State government is taking to control COVID-19.

Meanwhile, the Governor on Wednesday interacted with IIT-Hyderabad director Prof. B.S. Murthy via video conference and complimented him and his team of professors who have suggested “Bag valve mask” as an alternative to meet any surge in demand for ventilators to fight COVID-19.

Prof. Murthy informed the Governor that IIT-Hyderabad developed the design of the bag valve mask, also known as Ambu bags. He said they are inexpensive, easy to use and portable small devices. “It is easy to use as breathing support in case of an emergency. These bags can be manufactured for less than ₹5,000,” he said. However, to start the production, the bags need to be tested and clearance secured from the Union Government.

Earlier in the day, Ms. Tamilisai distributed food packets and asked officials to continue their distribution to the poor and needy everyday between 12 noon and 1 p.m. till coronavirus is contained.

She also extended her greetings on the occasion of Sri Rama Navami. “All of us together should pray Lord Rama to give us enough strength to combat COVID-19,” the Governor added.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bf6p14/article31231149.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy01Givernor,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/chief-minister-briefs-tamilisai/article31231150.ece

Giving final bath to the body of a loved one before cremation or burial is a ritual practised across cultures, but the kin of COVID-19 deceased should refrain from it.

According to the standard operating procedure specified in the document ‘COVID-19: Guidelines on Dead Body Management’ released by the Director General of Health Services, Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, relatives of the person who dies of COVID-19 infection may not be allowed to bathe, kiss or hug the dead body.

Further, religious rituals which do not require touching of the body may be allowed. The standard infection prevention control practices include, among others, maintaining hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment such as water-resistant apron, gloves, masks and eye-wear, safe handling of sharp tools, and disinfecting the bag housing dead body, and instruments and devices used on the patient.

All staff handling dead bodies in the isolation area, mortuary, ambulance and the workers in the crematorium or burial ground should be trained in infection prevention control practices.

310,2020/04/01,Wanaparthy DSP warns lockdown violators of ‘corona treatment’,"‘People-friendly policing’ goes for a toss with boastful police threats

There seems to be no let-up in complaints of police high-handedness in the State, with another incident coming to light on Wednesday.

In a video, in possession with The Hindu, Wanaparthy DSP Kammaripally Mallikarjuna Kiran Kumar is seen warning villagers that the police will cane the backs of lockdown violators with rough wooden sticks that are fitted with sharp nails.

“The flesh from your backs will fly off, and you will not be able to move for at least two months. I urge the sarpanch and other village heads to spread the message among youth, especially those consuming alcohol, gambling and playing cricket,” he said while addressing villagers over the public address system, in the presence of several police officers.

The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon in Kanimetta village of Kothakota mandal in the district even as Mandal Parishad president (MPP) Gunta Mounika was seen standing next to the DSP. Further, Mr. Kumar said that he had already instructed the circle inspector and sub-inspectors to raid the villages soon after getting information and shift the violators to the district headquarters.

According to him, in Wanaparthy, the police have started ‘corona treatment’, a new technique in which rough wooden sticks with sharp protrusions are used to thrash people. “The flesh from your backs will fly off when you're trashed with these sticks, with your pants down. Now, you decide if want to get the treatment or stay safe at home and contain the spread of the virus,” the DSP threatened, adding that the sole purpose of his visit to the village was only to send this message.

The officer in question did not return the calls from The Hindu. However, one of his subordinates in the district maintained that Mr. Kumar intends to instil fear among people since they are regularly defying the lockdown. “We received several complaints from that village. His address to the villagers should not be seen in a negative light since several people have been very unruly and have no regard for the law,” he said.

Ever since the lockdown was announced, many such incidents of boastful police threats of violence have been reported from different parts of the State, with many threats quickly turning into atrocities. Videos from all parts of the State are commonly seen on social media, where police officers were thrashing and abusing doctors, nurses, journalists and several others who come under essential services.

On Tuesday, Khammam Commissioner of Police Tafseer Iqbal attached Mudigonda SI Satish Kumar to Armed Reserved Headquarters after he was caught on camera thrashing a few gamblers outside their houses, which evoked much criticism.

Last week, Khammam ACP Ganesh was attached to the DGP office here for assaulting a young lady doctor, who was on her way to a hospital.

The police excess on general public goes in the face of the ‘People Friendly Policing’ initiated and promoted by DGP M. Mahender Reddy.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/9pudge/article31230056.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy01Wanaparthy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/wanaparthy-dsp-warns-lockdown-violators-of-corona-treatment/article31230057.ece

Around 10 workers of the Tablighi Jamaat, including some from its Telangana and Andhra Pradesh leadership, were taken to the Government General and Chest Hospital here for testing.

The move comes after several Tablighi Jamaat workers tested positive for the novel coronavirus in the recent past.

315,2020/04/01,Lesser-known gems from Pandit Ravi Shankar,"At a press conference in Mumbai around two decades ago, a journalist asked sitar maestro Pandit Ravi Shankar what it felt being the “godfather of world music”. Poker-faced, he replied, “Do I anywhere look remotely as handsome as Marlon Brando?”

Birth centenary

Besides being one of India’s leading classical music exponents, Shankar has been behind some outstanding projects fusing Indian and international musical styles. To mark Shankar's birth centenary various events had been planned, including one in London featuring Anoushka Shankar and Norah Jones. Sadly, they all stand cancelled because of the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. As we approach his birth centenary on April 7, it’s an opportune time to listen to some of his experimental albums.

Most fans would have heard his albums, West Meets East with violinist Yehudi Menuhin, Passages with American composer Philip Glass, his two sitar concertos with conductors Andre Previn and Zubin Mehta, and his synthesiser-fuelled Tana Mana. Shankar’scollaborations with George Harrison, cellist Msitslav Rostropovich and flautist Jean-Pierre Rampal are well known.

Global fusion

Here are five albums that are evidence of Shankar’s innovation, global approach and musical broad-mindedness. All of them are available on the Internet. The first, is the album Symphony, released seven months before Shankar passed away on December 11, 2012. Set in a four-movement symphony format and based on Indian melodies, it features the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by David Murphy, with daughter Anoushka Shankar on sitar. The third movement ‘Scherzo’ leaves me with goosebumps.

Besides the symphony, Shankar had also worked on an opera titled Sukanya. It is based on a tale from the Mahabharata, and was performed by Murphy with the LPO, with an ensemble cast. It was released as a double CD in 2017, and features both operatic singing styles and Indian instruments. Check out the tracks ‘Tarana’ and finale ‘New Life’. Third on our list is Transmigration Macabre, containing music from the 1967 avant garde horror film Viola. Not a widely known work, Shankar never mentioned it when asked about his international projects. But it’s unique in its own way, and chilling in parts.

A more popular album is Jazzmine, Shankar's attempt at drawing the link between Indian classical and folk music with jazz. Though this connection is less apparent in the first half, it comes across beautifully in the finale ‘Misharank’, The live ‘preview’ performance at the 1980 Jazz Yatra in Mumbai featured alto saxophonist John Handy, tenor saxophonist George Adams and keyboardist Louiz Banks.

Finally, we have the 1996 release Towards The Rising Sun, where Shankar and tabla maestro Ustad Allarakha team up with Japanese musicians Susumu Miyashita on koto, a stringed instrument, and Hozan Yamamoto on shakuhachi, a type of flute. The piece titled ‘Improvisation On The Theme of Rokudan’ is absolutely extraordinary.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/8xqce2/article31228973.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2bm-pg4-RaviShankar,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/lesser-known-gems-from-pandit-ravi-shankar/article31228974.ece
316,2020/04/01,"TASE, Josh Vivian offer leg-up to Chennai’s upcoming indie musicians","TASE invites upcoming musicians to collaborate with Namma Ooru Boy Band’s Josh Vivian for their debut tracks

When Josh Vivian started Namma Ooru Boy Band in 2014, he relied heavily on support from fellow indie musicians — a network he had created from years of singing covers. “These guys helped me out by playing in my song for a low charge, or sometimes, for free.”

But not everyone has this kind of network, he acknowledges. Josh and Mervin T Thomas, founder of TASE (The Audiophile's School of Sound Engineering), have come up with an initiative for aspiring musicians to record their debut tracks with them.

The duo is inviting musicians to send in their tracks for the next couple of weeks, and will feature the good ones on TASE’s social media pages. The best entry will be developed into a professionally recorded music track, along with a video that Josh will feature in.

“Mervin is a sound engineer himself, and also runs a studio, apart from the school. We have been associated for a long time, and he knows how difficult funding for indie musicians is. So he came up with the idea to encourage upcoming artistes, and provide them the support that they need for mixing and mastering of tracks,” says Josh.

While Josh will help with the vocals and arranging music — “We will take your raw track and add music with the help of our network of artistes” — Mervin will handle post-production: recording, mixing and mastering.

Any genre of music is invited. Josh adds that a complete mastered song normally costs around ₹60,000 or ₹70,000, but they are willing to work with whatever musicians can afford. The shooting of the video, however, will be done only after the lockdown ends.

“This 21-day period is the perfect time for musicians to get creative and write songs,” he believes, “They might have written songs already but because this is like a contest, they can start making changes to perfect their song, and come up with their best version.”

317,2020/04/01,Bengaluru's Chamarajpet Ramaseva Mandali creates posts its inaugural concert online,"Classical goes digital: With many Ramnavami concerts being cancelled, the Chamarajpet Ramaseva Mandali creates history by posting its inaugural concert online

The Bengaluru Ramanavami series is all set to go digital with the Chamarajpet Sree Ramaseva Mandali hosting its inaugural concert online. Violinists, father-and-son-duo Dr Mysore Manjunath and Sumanth Manjunath, with mridanga by TB Ravishankar will perform the inaugural concert from Manjunath’s home in Mysore for viewers worldwide.

“This is the 82nd year of the Ramaseva Mandali, which traces its roots to my father, SVN Rao’s tireless work towards the cause of music,” says SN Varadaraj, General Secretary of the Mandali. “Every year we have seen the Mandali grow with our programme listing growing bigger. The who’s who of classical music have performed on our platforms. The Mandali was called a ‘Temple of Music’ by statesman C Rajagopalachari. This year if we are advised to go this route for the inauguration, we will accept it as a good thing. This will be a way of keeping Ramanavami music alive.”

Varadaraj says this would be the only concert going live online as of now. “We are yet to get clarity on the other concerts at the Fort High School grounds after the lockdown. It would depend on several other factors including Government rules and stipulations. We will take a call after the third week of April.”

Speaking on the phone from Mysore, Manjunath, who had to cancel a concert in Germany, said he was happy to be performing for Ramaseva Mandali’s first online Ramanavami show from his home in Mysore. “If 2020 is remembered for corona virus, my son Sumanth and I will share memories of providing the first online Mandali concert for viewers worldwide on April 2. The paddhati (tradition) of pooja followed by melody is being followed by the Mandali, albeit virtually. There is nothing to beat this spirit of life in humans. Dreams and hopes will take us forward.”

The violin brothers, Manjunath and his brother Nagaraj, have been associated with the Chamarajpet Ramaseva Mandal for the last four decades. “I have been with the Mandali from the age of 12 — either accompanying eminent musicians or for violin duets. Nagaraj and I have also been conferred with the Mandali’s Ramagana Kalacharya Award,” says Manjunath. “No Ramanavami is complete without music, and in these times, going digital is the way for classical music lovers.”

Ask Manjunath about the programme for the concert and he says, the 90-minute concert will feature popular compositions on Srirama, especially by Tyagaraja with RTPs and bhajans.

318,2020/04/01,Anand Bhaskar Collective’s latest music video tells the stories of unsung real-life heroes,"Titled ‘Main Hoon Zameen’, the song experiments with pop rock, a deviation from the band’s musical style

When you think of the Anand Bhaskar Collective, you think of Carnatic blending with rock; of a classically trained voice showing off its abilities to violin notes and electric guitar riffs. What you do not expect is a pop rock-esque experience with an accompanying choir for the final chorus, telling the tales of unsung real-life heroes, which is what the band’s recently released music video, ‘Main Hoon Zameen’, delivers.

Though finalised and released this Tuesday, the song itself had taken shape three years ago, with the melody by Bhaskar and lyrics by his erstwhile boss, Anand Karir of A Glass Of Whisky Productions. “The melody came first. I thought it is quite evocative; it creates this urge to reach new heights and new horizons. And that is what prompted the lyric,” says Bhaskar.

With the passionate lyric came the idea of telling the tales of people who live up to it, “The brief is simple: give us the ability to choose. For example, if today someone wants to be zameen (land), and tomorrow he chooses to be asmaan (sky) — two polar opposites — it’s his or her choice to make. That thought led us to people who actually do this in real life; people who don’t wait for their ambitions to be facilitated by external factors. They just go out and do it.”

After some research and going through a string of recommendations, the team zeroed in on three living examples of this attitude: Prayas Foundation co-founder Ramesh Raut, animal rescuer Reshma Shelatkar, and environmentalist and Turning Tide Foundation creator, George Remedios.

Raut’s Prayas Foundation has been providing free tuition classes to hundreds of underprivileged school children for nearly 12 years now, in addition to providing them with daily meals. Remedios’ Turning Tide Foundation diverts biodegradable waste to the creation of urban food forests amid the bustling metropolis. Shelatkar has been feeding and caring for hundreds of stray animals for the past 15 years, from her own income as a tutor.

Or so, found the team — Anand Bhaskar Collective and A Glass Of Whisky Production House — after some exhaustive research. “We discussed a number of case studies, and these three were shortlisted. Some others weren’t available. We also had in mind an LGBTQ activist who is doing a tremendous amount of good work for the community, but the change that she is bringing about is not something we could show in the video. We wanted to shoot people doing what they do.”

For instance, shots like those of Remedios digging soil and watering saplings; a young boy’s face lighting up as he slowly understands what Raut is trying to teach; a cat scrambling down a wall and across the street towards Shelatkar as she passes by. All these visuals are the result of the crew following these changemakers and shooting their everyday activities for weeks —“They were not enacted for the video,” clarifies Bhaskar. The scenes are interspersed with performance visuals of the band, for which “the crew had travelled with us to three different shows: Calicut, Hyderabad and Pune.” The entire process, he says, took 18 months.

‘Main Hoon Zameen’, says Bhaskar, also marks a shift in the band’s musical style. “It’s part of an EP called Ufaq, which means ‘horizon’ in Urdu.

“Sonically, we are usually very heavy rock. With this EP, we are moving in the direction of pop rock. We are ditching the heavy feel for a while; maybe we will do it again in the future.”

The four-song EP also features a folk-rock song called ‘Dholaa’. “This is the first time we have ventured into the folk space. It also features our very first collaboration with another artiste,” says Bhaskar. That artiste is the famous Mame Khan, a playback and folk singer from Rajasthan. Clearly, this is an EP of many exciting firsts.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/219k02/article31227405.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2MPAnand-Bhaskar-Collective-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/anand-bhaskar-collectives-latest-music-video-tells-the-stories-of-unsung-real-life-heroes/article31227407.ece

The arrested was identified as Biju, 47, of Kochi. He was arrested invoking the Disaster Management Act on a petition lodged by the Labour Department. The police said that the owner of the agency had also been arraigned as an accused.

The migrant employee had gone without food and water and was even allegedly denied salary following which he lodged a complaint with the Labour Department. He was employed with a city-based security agency, Bright.

After receiving the petition, the Labour Department intervened and directed the accused to arrange food for the guard.

320,2020/04/01,Pandemic poses serious challenges to private security guards,"Those guarding emergency departments in hospitals a vulnerable lot

Hundreds of private security guards here are braving the odds to continue their vigil, especially at vulnerable spots, despite the challenges posed by COVID-19 pandemic.

Except for a few who opted to take leave because of health issues, majority of the guards on the rolls of private security companies are reporting for duty at various places including hospitals, retail stores, apartments and private establishments.

Those guarding emergency departments in hospitals are a vulnerable lot as they open entry doors every time patients and their bystanders enter and leave the point. “I have been extra cautious and use N95 masks, disposable gloves and also wash my hands regularly using soap,” said a 55-year-old security guard at a hospital in Angamaly.

Companies providing security guards claimed to have taken steps to ensure the attendance and well-being of guards. The supervisor of an agency based in Palarivattom said that the agency had made arrangements for providing food three times a day to all guards, who were otherwise depending on hotels. “Some of our clients are also providing food to the guards who are staying at sites 24x7,” he said.

Customers’ ire

Life is equally tough for guards manning retail stores. With the government imposing restrictions on the number of customers that can be permitted at a time, security personnel have to manage the rush by requesting people to form queues outside the entry door. “Some customers lose their patience and vent their anger on us. I am managing the situation by issuing tokens to those in queue,” said a guard at a retail store in Aluva.

A security guard in an apartment complex, who took leave heeding to repeated requests from his family members, hoped that his agency would not cut his salary. “We usually get the salary on the 10th of every month. I am relying on the government’s directive that the salary should not be reduced in view of the COVID-19 situation,” he said.

Labour Department officials said that any labour violations could be reported at the Statewide toll-free number 1800 42555214.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pandemic-poses-serious-challenges-to-private-security-guards/article31231281.ece

The District Kudumbashree Mission has launched a talent hunt among its over-three lakh Neighbourhood Group (NHG) members who are largely confined to their homes during the lockdown.

The hunt is to find the best singer, poet and photographer at the district level with the singing contest getting under way on Wednesday. The contest will last till April 5, which will be then followed by poetry writing contest from April 5 to 20 and photography contest from April 10 to 25.

“The brainstorming to evolve a concept to engage all our NHG members in a productive way during this lockdown led us to this talent hunt. They could either use this as a diversion from their domestic pressures during this tough time or as an opportunity to explore their creative side and recoup their forgotten talents they had given up in the face of daily rigours of life,” said Shine T. Money, district programme manager (gender).

Participants of all three contests will have to send their entries to the official WhatsApp groups of their respective Community Development Societies (CDSs). Groups were formed for all 101 CDSs to dispense communications on Covid-19-related activities. Those participating in singing and poem writing contests will have to send eight lines of their singing and poems on any chosen subject to these groups. Similarly, photography contestants should send photographs on model activities during the lockdown.

CDS members will choose the best in all three categories and the 14 block coordinators will further select the best in each block. The district-level contests will be held after the lockdown and winners will be given cash awards.

“As soon as we publicised the contest, we started getting a lot of inquiries from other districts, especially Idukki and Kottayam.

325,2020/04/01,‘No shortage of goods in Odisha’,"7-member team ensuring smooth movement, says govt.

The Odisha government on Wednesday assured the people that there will not be shortage of essential goods across the State in the remaining days of the lockdown.

A seven-member State-level unit has been monitoring the situation to ensure smooth movement of essential goods, said Surendra Kumar, State Water Resources Secretary, who is heading the monitoring unit.

The State government has asked the district and municipal administrations to treat trade licence certificates as valid document for movement of essential items, said Mr. Kumar.

Stating that long queues of vehicles were noticed at the inter-State borders affecting supply for two days initially, Mr. Kumar said their movement was smooth after Prime Minister Narendra Modi accepted Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik’s suggestion to do away with differentiation of goods as essential and non-essential.

Mr. Kumar said the government has also decided to keep all wholesale markets open 24 hours so that small traders and retailers can buy essential goods without facing any rush. He also urged people to go to market twice a week to avoid chances of contracting coronavirus.

On rumours, State government’s chief spokesperson for COVID-19 Subroto Bagchi said that any rumour will be dealt with severely. The government will take strong action against rumour-mongers and action for any fake news shall be taken under the IT Act and Epidemic Act, he said.

He informed that 610 samples had been tested till Wednesday noon and the number of positive cases stood at four. As many as seven contacts of the fourth patient had been traced. The fourth patient had reached his home in Bhadrak district on March 18. His asymptomatic sample was collected on March 30 and it tested positive on Tuesday, he said.

326,2020/04/01,Devotees defying lockdown dispersed from dargah,"6 arrested in Rajasthan’s Sarwar town

About 100 devotees, who defied the lockdown restrictions and gathered for observing the rituals of ‘Urs’ (death anniversary) at a dargah in Sarwar town of Rajasthan’s Ajmer district, were dispersed by the police with the use of mild force.

The six-day ‘Urs’ of Sufi mystic Khwaja Fakhruddin Chishti at the dargah ended on Wednesday.

Though the police had given permission to five persons from the world-famous dargah in Ajmer for offering a ‘chadar’ (sacred cloth) at the Sarwar dargah, several others joined them.

When the police asked them to vacate the dargah premises, they allegedly objected and confronted the police.

Dargah’s mutawalli (manager) Mohammed Yusuf told The Hindu that while all gates of the shrine had been closed, some local devotees scaled the wall and tried to join the offering of ‘chadar’. “This was clearly in violation of the prohibitory orders,” he said.

According to the police sources, six persons were arrested under Section 151 (arrest to prevent cognisable offences) of the Criminal Procedure Code on charges of infringement of orders banning the assembly of people.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/devotees-defying-lockdown-dispersed-from-dargah/article31231109.ece

The association urged its members to utilise telemedicine facilities to help their patients. They can also offer services through telephones. This would reduce hospital visits and make social distancing effective. The IMA functionaries warned against the use of private mobile applications for consultation.

331,2020/04/01,Popular demand pulls down price of veggie bags by ₹50,"MADURAI

One thousand take-away vegetable bags were sold out at 10 locations across the city through mobile outlets on Wednesday. A Madurai Corporation official said that 100 vegetable bags were sold at each location.

In view of the huge demand for these bags, the Corporation has decided to reduce the price of the bag by ₹50. These bags will have 16 different vegetables and be sold at ₹200 from Thursday.

The sale of these bags by the Corporation is to prevent crowding of people at markets as a measure to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Volunteers from various non-governmental organisations helped in selling these bags to the people.

Each vegetable bag, which will be priced at ₹200, will contain essential vegetables like potato, onion, cabbage, carrot, tomato, brinjal, green chilli and ginger.

A Corporation official said that though the vegetable bags were sold out on Wednesday, the civic body decided to reduce the price of the bag as it was also difficult to give change to the people. “Many people paid ₹500 and it took a lot of time to give them the change. So, we reduced the number of vegetables from 19 to 16 and the cost of the bag to tackle this problem,” said the official.

Also, the new price would be affordable to many more people, said the official.

Banu Balakrishnan, a resident of Kochadai, said that the sale of these bags was a boon for the people during the lockdown. “We are scared of buying vegetables at markets as it is extremely difficult to maintain personal distance there,” she said.

Advocate S. Muthukumar, a volunteer, said that on Wednesday they sold vegetable bags even in the parts of Anna Nagar which were cordoned off after reporting of COVID-19 positive cases.

The volunteers said that the civic body had provided face masks, gloves and sanitisers to them.

332,2020/04/01,Papad industry faces the heat,"Freeze on manufacturing in smaller units hits workers, owners hard

MADURAI

Summer season in Madurai usually sees a number of small houses in Chintamani and Anuppanadi areas turning into tiny appalam (papad) manufacturing units. Hundreds of women are engaged in the process of preparing the dough, cutting it into pieces and flattening and drying the pieces to make papads.

This work requires tremendous skill and patience, says S. Karupayee, 34, a resident of Chintamani, who once used to work at a papad factory. Since February 28, many workers have been asked to go home as there is no way of exporting the packaged item.

K. Radha Jeyalakshmi, who co-owns Madurai Pandian Appalam, says they have completely stopped exporting papads to the western countries, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Singapore and Malaysia due to COVID-19 outbreak. Stocks worth ₹30 lakh have now accumulated but they will be of no use in the coming months when they will expire. “Papads last for a maximum of five months. With this much stocks piled up, we have no choice but to stop production,” she says.

At big papad companies in Chintamani, which export the product to other countries, labourers usually get a monthly salary and work through the year. Many other companies set up shop only during the season to make the most of the Madurai heat.

K. Janani, 26, says she works only for the summer months as the company is located close to her house and it helps her family save more. Now, however, there is no scope for this additional income. “Unfortunately, since it is not classified as an essential commodity, we have been asked to stay back. I have got some additional amount apart from my February salary. We must all stay back at home because it has been enforced upon us. If not, most of us will be at work despite the disease outbreak. For us, earning a living is as important as living itself,” she says.

President of Madurai Appalam, Vadam, Moar Vathal Producers’ Welfare Association G. Thirumurugan says they have submitted a petition to the State government urging it to procure papad stocks at production cost and give them to people as part of monthly ration supply. Or else, papads will go waste, he adds.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/papad-industry-faces-the-heat-madurai/article31229160.ece
333,2020/04/01,"In Madurai, Alcoholics Anonymous members opt for virtual conference calls","With liquor shops across the State closed due to the lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19, hundreds of AA members from across the State are encouraging themselves to remain sober by regularly attending these virtual sessions

It is around 9.45 p.m. and Palani*, a resident of Melur in Madurai, speaks during an Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) session held through a virtual audio conference call. “Hello, naan oru kudi noyali (I am person with alcohol addiction),” he begins.

“With the closure of liquor shops and the restriction to stay indoors to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, the past one week has indeed been a difficult journey. But, regularly attending AA sessions through calls keeps me motivated to stay away from alcohol and helps me sail through the period. In fact, I helped my wife clean the house today and played carrom with my children,” he says.

Ever since the lockdown, like Mr. Palani, hundreds of AA members from across the State are encouraging themselves to remain sober by regularly attending these virtual sessions. Senior members say that many new alcoholics are also attending their sessions to find psychological support at a time when liquor outlets are closed.

Gaurav*, chairman of the AA group in Madurai, says that initially one session was introduced for each day in the region and the number of one-hour sessions got increased, as more number of people started attending these meetings.

“Currently, we have sessions from 6.30 a.m. to 10 p.m. People from various parts across the State now speak during these sessions and the number is only increasing. In Madurai, we have even had more than 70 people participating during one session,” he says.

“In every sitting, we observe that many alcoholics, who are attending the session for the first time, are sharing their experiences on how they are coping during this time when access to liquor is restricted,” says Anab*, a senior member from Madurai AA group.

“I feel positive when I speak in the conference group as they can understand what I go through in the current crisis. When senior members share their success stories in giving up alcohol, I get inspired to follow suit,” says Jagdishor*, an alcoholic from Valayankulam, who has been attending the virtual meetings for the past one week.

Realising that the 21-day lockdown period can be best used to help the alcoholics to recover from addiction, the AA members are individually calling up alcoholics from the region and are encouraging them to attend the sessions, says Mr. Anab.

“Those alcoholics who do not require medical treatment, can make use of the psychological support from the members and recover during this period. The only thing that is required is the individual’s desire to give up alcohol,” he says.

The members say that they are also working towards having a virtual conference call facility to connect all Tamil-speaking AA members from across the globe.

334,2020/04/01,Parents of special children come up with different coping mechanisms,"Disturbance in routine makes them emotionally vulnerable

For S. Balamani, a single mother who takes care of her 22-year-old daughter with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the last few days were more challenging than ever before. The 21-day lockdown to prevent the COVID-19 transmission has disturbed her daughter’s evening walk and her daily routine.

“She gets emotionally affected as her regular outdoor activities get disturbed. She screams and sometimes tends to become violent. We live in a rented apartment and our houseowners get irritated when my daughter throws a tantrum,” she says.

Like Ms. Balamani, many parents of special children are having a hard time handling their children amid the lockdown. With the closure of special schools and restrictions in their outdoor activities, the daily routine of these children is disturbed, making them emotionally vulnerable.

Due to the lockdown, these children are unable to attend their therapy sessions, says Saravanan Indiravel, a parent. “My son regularly attends a speech therapy session and is progressing well. Now we are worried and we do not know how our son will continue his sessions after a long break,” he says But, in the backdrop of these problems, parents are coming with different coping mechanisms to tackle the issue.

S. Jerald Rajan, a parent, says the most important aspect in managing the child is to keep him engaged throughout the day.

“We must make a schedule for the children for the entire day. Since my seven-year-old son is interested in cooking, we give him kitchen chores every morning. We ask him to peel off potato skin or pour idli batter into the mould. We also spend time with him on the terrace every evening. We are a family of four and abiding by a schedule, each one of us spends time with him,” he says.

For T. Arun Prasad’s nine-year-old son, long drives in a car, is a compulsory component in his weekend schedule.

“But, since the lockdown, my son and I sit in the car every evening. We listen to music inside the car for half-an-hour and my son is happy,” he says.

During this current crisis, there is a need to create a conducive atmosphere at home for the special children, says K.S.P. Janardhan Babu, Director (Programmes) of M.S. Chellamuthu Trust and Research Foundation.

“Involve the children in activities they like the most - drawing, painting, watching television, cooking or gardening. The parents can ask their children to do household chores like mopping the floor as physical activities help them sleep peacefully,” he says.

‘Parents, take care’

Mr. Babu also adds that parents also have to take care of their emotional well-being. “They can meditate or do yoga. Also, every member of the family must take turns to take care of the child,” he says.

In the long run, there is a need to establish community-based rehabilitation centres with essential support system for special children in every district, says A.

335,2020/04/01,Udupi admn. allows movement of horticultural produce,"The Udupi administration has given its nod to lift and transport watermelons, pineapples, papaya and Mattu Gulla after growers in the district complained that their produce will go waste and start rotting due to the lockdown on account of COVID-19. Watermelon is being cultivated in 25 hectares in the district and its production is 1,000 tonnes, while pineapple is cultivated in 150 hectares and its production is estimated at 9,732 tonnes. Papaya is grown in 22 hectares of land and its production is estimated at 1,551 tonnes.

Due to the lockdown, it has been difficult for growers to transport their produce to other districts and States. Assistant Director of Horticulture Guruprasad said that the administration has decided to give seven passes for vehicles so that growers and merchants can transport their produce.

Accordingly, arrangements have been made to transport six tonnes of Mattu Gulla to different parts of Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts and 82 tonnes of watermelons to Dakshina Kannada, Uttara Kannada and Dharwad districts. While 13 tonnes of pineapple will be transported to Dakshina Kannada and Shivamogga, 10 tonnes of papaya will go to Uttara Kannada.

Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha said that the administration has already held a meeting with wholesale fruit merchants registered with the Agriculture Marketing Produce Committee (APMC). It has directed these merchants to purchase 35 tonnes of pineapples, 55 tonnes of watermelons and 5,000 bunches of bananas from growers and sell them within the district and also send them to other districts.

Such transportation has been exempted from prohibitory orders, he said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/udupi-admn-allows-movement-of-horticultural-produce/article31230467.ece
336,2020/04/01,Situation normal in Mangaluru,"A day after witnessing pandemonium when the three-day shutdown was relaxed on Tuesday, the situation turned to normal with no panic buying after administration decided to offer relaxation window everyday from Wednesday.

The decision to completely shut retail trade at Central Market, district’s wholesale market for vegetables and fruits by keeping general public out of bounds helped to contain crowding. Only retail merchants would be allowed to lift products from wholesalers between 11 p.m. and 4 a.m. from this market. About 250 retail traders functioning from the Central Market complex were asked to shut operations temporarily even as administration has promised to relocate them.

There were no queues in front of milk booths, grocery shops and supermarkets when the lockdown was relaxed between 7 a.m. and noon on Wednesday, mainly because people were told this would be a regular feature.

On the other hand, there were reports that there was short supply of essentials in the wholesale market as consignments were not arriving from other places. Everywhere, traders have been facing shortage of manual labourers to load and unload products.

Though vegetables and fruits were normal in supply, many retail merchants have jacked up prices exploiting the situation. This is in stark contrast to situation elsewhere in the state where farmers were throwing produces for want of good price and inability to sell them.

In a recorded video message, Mr. Poojari said that Tuesday’s experience showed that people could not maintain social distancing while buying essential commodities.

In the same message, MP Nalin Kumar Kateel said that the administration had to take the harsh decision in view of five non-Dakshina Kannada and two Dakshina Kannad COVID-19 positive cases in the recent past.

338,2020/04/01,Heavy rush in Mangaluru during relaxation period,"When shops selling essential commodities were opened for about nine hours on Tuesday morning after the three-day complete shutdown in Mangaluru, there was a mad rush at the Central Market — the wholesale vegetable and fruits market, while people waited in endless queues elsewhere in the city to buy essentials.

District in-charge Minister Kota Srinivas Poojari had announced the three-day shutdown to combat the spread of COVID-19 pandemic by discouraging people from venturing out. What transpired on Tuesday was exactly the opposite with people keeping aside social distancing in market places to buy essential commodities under panic. On the other hand, they had to wait in very long queues for hours together near supermarkets and grocery shops, under a harsh Sun, to buy essential commodities.

Meanwhile, MLC Ivan D'Souza and city corporation councillors met district in-charge Secretary V. Ponnuraj demanding at least a four-hour window every day for people to buy their supplies, failing which, they said, people’s representatives would resort to selling essential commodities themselves.

Mangaluru City Corporation Civic Group Coordinator Nigel Albuquerque said that the three-day shutdown was unscientific as it resulted in a mad rush on Tuesday. He wondered why the administration failed to adhered to the directive by the Director-General and Inspector-General of Police to keep shops selling essential commodities open round-the-clock in the State.

Durga Ramadas Kateel, a resident of Bejai, said that he stood in a queue in front of a popular grocery shop at 7.45 a.m., got inside at 11.10 a.m. and came out with his supplies at 12.15 p.m. Two elderly people, who fainted after standing in the queue under the harsh Sun, were allowed immediate entry by the shop management, he said. Manjunathaswamy, a resident of Chilimbi, said that he had to wait for over four hours to enter a supermarket in the locality.

It was chaos at the Central Market where people jostled for space to buy vegetables and fruits even as fruit merchants used the occasion to dispose of old stock. Hardly any social distancing was observed thereby defeating the purpose of lockdown, said Jatin Raj, who was there to buy his supplies.

On the pandemonium, orthodontist P.N. Ramaraj said that the much-talked about door delivery had not taken off yet; this rush could have been avoided if it had been implemented. Each councillor should have been given responsibility for this, he said.

Ramakrishna Acharya, a resident of Kadri, said that people resorted to panic buying only because of excessive restrictions. If the administration had allowed the sale of essential commodities during the day as done elsewhere in the State, there wouldn’t have been this rush, he said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/s1r74q/article31223623.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01MNRUSHMARKET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/heavy-rush-in-mangaluru-during-relaxation-period/article31223624.ece

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has announced more measures to fight economic disruptions caused by COVID-19, including extension of the realisation period of export proceeds and allowing States to borrow more.

“Presently, the value of the goods or software exports made by exporters is required to be realised fully and repatriated to the country within nine months from the date of exports.

“In view of the disruption caused by the pandemic, the time period for realisation and repatriation of export proceeds for exports made up to or on July 31, 2020, has been extended to 15 months from the date of export,” the RBI said. The measure will enable exporters to realise their receipts, especially from COVID-19 affected countries, within the extended period, and also provide greater flexibility to exporters to negotiate future export contracts with buyers abroad.

The central bank has also formed an advisory committee to review the ways and means limit for State governments and union territories. Till the panel submits its report, the central bank has increased the ways and means advances limit by 30% for States and union territories.

“Pending submission of the final recommendations by the Committee, it has been decided to increase the WMA limit by 30% from the existing limit for all States/UTs to enable State governments to tide over the situation arising from the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The revised limits will come into force with effect from April 1, 2020 and will be valid till September 30, 2020, the RBI said.

The ‘Ways and Means Advances’ is a scheme that helps meet mismatches in receipts and payments of the government. Under this scheme, a government can avail itself of immediate cash from the RBI.

The central bank has also deferred the implementation of counter cyclical capital buffer (CCyB) for banks.

“Based on the review and empirical analysis of CCyB indicators, it has been decided that it is not necessary to activate CCyB for a period of one year or earlier, as may be necessary,” the RBI said.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/qsuhsi/article31230239.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THBURBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/rbi-relaxes-export-rules-allows-states-and-uts-to-borrow-more/article31230240.ece

The Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AiMed) is targeting to produce 50,000 ventilators per month by May, particularly with companies like Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra & Mahindra committing support to help scale up production of medical devices.

“Huge efforts are being put to increase medical device manufacturing capacity by the manufacturers ... big companies like Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra, Kalyaani, Tata Motors, Hyundai etc. will possibly offer to collaborate with our members to rapidly scale up production of ventilators. The aim is to produce 50,000 ventilators per month by May,” Rajiv Nath, Forum Coordinator at AiMeD, said.

Also read: Automobile makers asked to manufacture ventilators: Health Ministry

Huge disparity

The press statement issued by the association noted that as per a Brookings report, the country might need anywhere between 1,10,000 - 2,20,000 ventilators by May 15 in the worst-case scenario and the number of ventilators available today in the country is about 57,000. “There is a pressing need of ventilators in India and a huge disparity in their availability in various States. For instance, Mumbai has 800 to 1,000 ventilators, while States such as Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh have 1,500 and 1,800, respectively. Bengaluru has approximately 400 ventilators, whereas Kerala has 5,000,” as per the statement.

AiMeD said seven of its ten major manufacturers have confirmed that the current production capacity of ventilators is 5,500-5,750 pieces per month, compared with production of about 2,700 units in the previous month.

Consortium set up

SkanRay, the leading ventilator manufacturer, has created a consortium with BEL, BHEL and Mahindra & Mahindra to ramp up production from 2,000 units per month to 5,000 units per month, and to 30,000 pieces per month by May. Likewise, AgVa Healthcare has tied up with Maruti Suzuki to scale up production from 400 units per month to 4,000 units in April and 10,000 units per month by May.

Others are similarly gearing up to address the challenge, the association added. “For masks, the manufacturing capacity of the 20 manufacturers in AiMeD’s list is over 25 million/month. Usually it’s excessive capacity, so many manufacturers export their surplus but now demand has spiked and the government has banned exports ... There may be other manufacturers beyond this list as well. As on date, the market has probably expanded to over 40 million pieces per month,” the statement added.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nzrl16/article31230634.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2TH-VENT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/medical-devices-association-eyes-production-of-50000-ventilators-a-month-by-may/article31230636.ece

The merger of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Limited (GSKCH) with Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL), which was announced in December 2018, has been successfully completed after obtaining all the necessary approvals.

In addition, the board of directors of HUL has approved the acquisition of the Horlicks brand for India from GSK for ₹3,045 crore by exercising the option available in the original agreement made between Unilever and GSK.

The other brands, which were under the ownership of GSKCH, like Boost, Maltova and Viva have also come under HUL’s brand portfolio by virtue of the merger, stated a release by HUL.

Incidentally, the acquisition of the Horlicks brand by the India unit of Unilever would result in savings for the Indian arm by avoiding expenses like royalty and brand royalty, said HUL chief financial officer Srinivas Phathak, in a media conference call.

He further added that owning a brand brings tax benefits as well including the option of claiming depreciation.

“This (acquiring Horlicks) will enable HUL to utilise cash on its balance sheet and create value for shareholders. In addition, it will enable HUL to drive better salience in a local context,” added the release.

Horlicks, with a volume share of close to 50%, was introduced in India in the 1930s.

Meanwhile, HUL will be partnering with GSK through a consignment-selling arrangement to distribute brands of the GSK Consumer Healthcare family in India.

“This partnership, with world class brands from GSK (like Eno, Crocin, Sensodyne etc.) and HUL’s distribution strength can unlock value for GSK and build further Hindustan Unilever’s go-to-market capabilities,” stated the release.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/gskch-hul-merger-process-completed/article31230377.ece

“Sales were impacted by the nationwide lockdown and BS VI transition. We expect similar deterioration in volumes over the next 1-2 months due to the ongoing lockdown amid COVID-19 issue,” added Mr. Shah.

352,2020/04/01,"Welcomed then, stigmatised now","India must ensure that messaging and reporting on COVID-19 doesn’t stigmatise foreigners

Over a fortnight ago, an Italian tourist at Wagamon, a beautiful hill town in Kerala’s Idukki district, reportedly had to spend a night in a cemetery attached to a church. The reason? He had been denied a room in all the hotels and resorts in the area. At the time, government authorities had told hoteliers not to let in foreigners, particularly those from high-risk countries such as Italy, France, China and Iran. If they did, the hotels/ resorts were told to keep the tourists in isolation for a fortnight.

In another town, Munnar, in the same district, a British tourist tested positive for COVID-19 on March 15. In a moment of high drama, the individual, along with a group of British tourists, “escaped” from the Munnar resort and boarded a plane at Kochi that was bound for Dubai. The ‘positive’ result came as the tourist was boarding the plane. The authorities got all the passengers offloaded, the flight’s departure was delayed by a few hours, and the British tourist group was kept isolated in a hotel. Briefly, there was even talk of shutting down the airport for fear of a virus outbreak.

Coronavirus | India suspends all tourist visas till April 15

Viewed with suspicion

Shocked by the news, Munnar imposed a lockdown the following day. The people in the town, which attracts thousands of foreigners during the tourist season, started to view every foreigner with suspicion. In Kochi, a foreign couple was turned out of a restaurant by fellow diners. In Kannur district, a French-Italian pair had to starve for a couple of days as restaurants refused to serve them. The same story played out in many places in Kerala, a State which otherwise prides itself on being extremely tourist-friendly.

Such incidents were reported from other parts of the country as well. A Venezuelan tourist operator, Ma Dagnino, said: “All over India, foreigners began to be seen as a threat.” She said over a WhatsApp message: “If guests are treated like outcastes, and refused the most basic of courtesies, it is India itself that will be the most profoundly hurt.”

COVID-19 is a huge threat to India and it’s natural that people will panic. But governments and the media need to be mindful that their decisions and reports, respectively, don’t evoke knee-jerk reactions from the people. Creating panic might serve to keep people on their toes in the initial stages, but this only becomes counterproductive later. When there is hype and panic, people view foreigners as enemies of the people and want them out of the country. In tourism-reliant States like Kerala, the economic cost of this kind of behaviour will be massive.

The government’s steps against the virus should not lead to the kind of scare and stigma that were the outcomes of the anti-HIV/AIDS campaign during the early stages of the epidemic in India. Back then, some doctors refused to examine HIV/AIDS patients, and paramedics sent the afflicted people out of hospitals. The infection caused extensive social stigma and ostracism.

For a sensitive campaign

While working for this newspaper, I had reported an incident which showed how society viewed HIV/AIDS once. In 1996, in a village in Kerala’s Malappuram district, a group of men led by a school headmaster rounded up two young women claiming that they had been “spreading AIDS” in the village. The group thrashed the women and got their heads shaved. It was a campaign focusing on infusing fear and loathing against AIDS patients that resulted in such a response. The incident created immediate reactions and caused a drastic rethink on the way the anti-HIV campaign was being run in Kerala.

“Please stop infusing fear among your citizens,” was Ma Dagnino's message to the government. “Don’t trash your own country by exchanging kindness for fear.”

353,2020/04/01,A pandemic in an unequal India,"The official strategies place the responsibility on citizens, a majority without privilege, to fight the virus

If the COVID-19 pandemic lashes India with severity, it will not be just the middle class who will be affected. India’s impoverished millions are likely to overwhelmingly bear the brunt of the suffering which will ensue. The privileged Indian has been comfortable for too long with some of the most unconscionable inequalities in the planet. But with the pandemic, each of these fractures can decimate the survival probabilities and fragile livelihoods of the poor.

The measures adopted by the government to stymie the progress of the virus were first to introduce a ‘work from home’ measure, to urge people to wash their hands frequently, physical distancing, and then an unprecedented 21-day lockdown.

Coronavirus | Treat migrants humanely, Supreme Court tells officials

Deepening a social divide

Public health experts are divided about whether this lockdown was absolutely necessary and indeed implementable. It should have been clear that a total lockdown was possible only for the rich and the middle class with assured incomes during the period, homes with spaces for distancing, health insurance and running water supply. But how can we justify the choice of a strategy which throws the dispossessed, who lack all of the above, to both hunger and infection?

When ordering the lockdown, did the government not remember the millions of informal workers and destitute people who would have no work if they stayed home, many of them circular migrants, estimated at 100 million? These include casual daily-wage workers; self-employed people such as rag-pickers, rickshaw pullers and street vendors; and people forced to survive by alms.

Many among them are people whose earnings each day barely suffice to enable them to eat and feed their families. Does the government expect them to voluntarily starve and let their children die to prevent the spread of the infection? This crisis of hunger is even more dire for older people without caregivers, and persons with disability. The government also seems to be in amnesia about hundreds of thousands of children, women and men in every city whose only home is the pavement or the dirt patches under bridges.

Full coverage | Lockdown displaces lakhs of migrants

Recorded messages on our phones urge us to wash our hands regularly. We forget, however, that millions live in shanties without water supply, and they buy a pot of water, sometimes for a fifth of their day’s earnings (irregular incomes which are further decimated by the lockdown). Regular cleanliness is a remote luxury beyond their means.

We are also advised ‘social distancing’ (physical distancing) and ‘self-isolation’. How is this feasible for large extended families who crowd into narrow single rooms in slums and working-class tenements? Or for the homeless people who have no option except to sleep in overcrowded unsanitary government shelters, veritable breeding centres for infections? Or for destitute people in beggars’ homes? Indeed, prisoners in overcrowded jails? And I cannot forget those confined to detention centres in Assam, which are jails within jails.

And then consider the capacity of the health system to deal with the pandemic if (or when) it actually submerges India. India’s investments in public health are among the lowest in the world, and most cities lack any kind of public primary health services. A Jan Swasthya Abhiyan estimate is that a district hospital serving a population of two million may have to serve 20,000 patients, but they are bereft of the beds, personnel and resources to do this. Few have a single ventilator. India’s rich and middle-classes have opted out of public health completely, leaving the poor with unconscionably meagre services. The irony is that a pandemic has been brought into India by people who can afford plane tickets, but while they will buy private health services, the virus will devastate the poor who they infect and who have little access to health care.

The Union government has announced a package, including additional 5 kg grain a month for the next three months under the PDS; ₹500 per month for the next three months for women holding Jan-Dhan Yojana accounts; three months’ pension in advance to nearly three crore widows, senior citizens and the differently-abled; and ₹2,000 more for MGNREGA workers. If you and I were told that we have to survive on just two days’ salary and 5 kg grain a month, with no health insurance, how would the future look?

Editorial | Short end of the stick

The visuals of thousands of migrants, suddenly left with no food and work, walking to their homes hundreds of miles away, dodging the police, until the States were ordered to seal their borders, showed clearly that the lockdown is ineffective.

What must be done

Most of the official strategies place the responsibility on the citizen, rather than the state, to fight the pandemic. The state did too little in the months it got before the pandemic reached India for expanding greatly its health infrastructure for testing and treatment. This includes planning operations for food and work; security for the poor; for safe transportation of the poor to their homes; and for special protection for the aged, the disabled, children without care and the destitute.

For two months, every household in the informal economy, rural and urban, should be given the equivalent of 25 days’ minimum wages a month until the lockdown continues, and for two months beyond this. Pensions must be doubled and home-delivered in cash. There should be free water tankers supplying water in slum shanties throughout the working days. Governments must double PDS entitlements, which includes protein-rich pulses, and distribute these free at doorsteps. In addition, for homeless children and adults, and single migrants, it is urgent to supply cooked food to all who seek it, and to deliver packed food to the aged and the disabled in their homes using the services of community youth volunteers.

Coronavirus | Forced to stay back, these workers now battle hunger

To ensure jails are safer, all prison undertrial prisoners, except those charged with the gravest crimes, should be released. Likewise, all those convicted for petty crimes. All residents of beggars’ homes, women’s rescue centres and detention centres should be freed forthwith.

India must immediately commit 3% of its GDP for public spending on health services, with the focus on free and universal primary and secondary health care. But since the need is immediate, authorities should follow the example of Spain and New Zealand and nationalise private health care. An ordinance should be passed immediately that no patient should be turned away or charged in any private hospital for diagnosis or treatment of symptoms which could be of COVID-19.

While one part of the population enjoys work and nutritional security, health insurance and housing of globally acceptable standards, others survive at the edge of unprotected and uncertain work, abysmal housing without clean water and sanitation, and no assured public health care. Can we resolve to correct this in post-COVID India? Can we at least now make the country more kind, just and equal?

354,2020/04/01,The cost of a cure for COVID-19,"If Gilead’s drug is successful, the Indian government should issue a compulsory licence under the Patents Act

The World Health Organisation declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared COVID-19 an orphan disease, or a rare disease. Which of these statements is true? As of March 23, it seemed both.

COVID-19 and the Orphan Drug Act

In the U.S., under the Orphan Drug Act, 1983, companies are provided incentives to develop therapies, or orphan drugs, for rare diseases. The idea is that without these incentives, companies would find it difficult to recoup their R&D costs given the small number of people suffering from the rare disease. The Act allows seven years of market exclusivity and financial incentives to innovators of these drugs. As a result, orphan drugs are often exorbitantly priced. Privileges under the Act may be conferred to companies for drugs to treat a disease that affect less than 200,000 people in the U.S., or for a disease that affects more than 200,000 people but for which there is no hope of recouping R&D costs. Interestingly, according to the regulations for revocation, if the number of people suffering from the disease exceeds 200,000 after designation but before approval, this would not be a ground for revocation.

Coronavirus | India to join WHO’s COVID-19 trials

In an egregious misuse of the Act, the FDA granted Gilead Sciences orphan drug status for its antiviral drug, Remdesivir, on March 23. Originally developed to treat Ebola but found ineffective, the drug is now being tested for treating COVID-19. Clinical trials are already in Phase III. But in an interesting turn of events, on March 25 Gilead announced that it had submitted a request to the FDA to rescind its designation for Remdesivir. It alluded to the fact that abbreviated trials were behind the initial designation, though it is well known that there are other avenues for abbreviated trials in such circumstances.

The question that remains is, how did the Act apply to a potential drug for COVID-19, which is anything but a rare disease, with 800,049 confirmed cases across the world? How does the U.S. FDA justify conferring the status of an orphan drug on a therapy designed to treat COVID-19? Sure, as of March 25, the U.S. had 54,941 people suffering from the disease. But this is simply a technicality. Congressional findings for the Act state that the purpose of the legislation is to provide financial incentives for drugs that may reasonably expect to generate relatively small sales. Is it legal to apply the benefits of a statute to something entirely outside its stated objective and purpose? The simple answer is no.

Gilead is reported to have said that it intends to make the drug accessible and affordable around the globe. However, Gilead’s exorbitant pricing of its drug to treat hepatitis C and its drug to treat HIV attracted attention in the past. Yet in 2017, Gilead placed its HIV therapy in the Medicines Patent Pool, a move that would make the medicine more accessible. For Remdesivir, Gilead’s suspension of its “compassionate use” programme raised alarm bells. The programme was reinstated for only children and pregnant women; Gilead said it cannot process “the overwhelming number of applications”. Gilead also stated that it had transitioned to an “expanded access” programme, for emergency use in severely ill patients. Public apprehension is somewhat justified, not least of all on account of the FDA’s conduct in conveniently interpreting a statute to benefit big pharma during a pandemic.

Impact on the U.S. and India

So, what would have been the impact of this orphan drug status for the U.S., given the status of its patents? Patents are open to challenge. Had Gilead not sought that orphan drug status be rescinded, generic manufacturers would not have been able to market a drug to treat COVID-19 with the same active ingredient till the seven-year period of market exclusivity had ended. This would have given Gilead free rein on pricing and licensing which would have had disastrous consequences on the healthcare system.

What does this mean for India? While the orphan drug status of Remdesivir would have no impact on India, Gilead Sciences does hold a patent in India, which it is likely to claim for this use. As far as its patent rights are concerned, Indian law permits the government to issue a compulsory licence in certain circumstances of a public health crisis under Section 92 of the Patents Act. This would allow third parties to manufacture a patented drug without permission of the patent holder. Indian companies have already expressed their capability to manufacture the drug. The firepower under this provision has never been deployed before. If the government does not exercise its powers to issue a compulsory license if required, Indian manufacturers would not be able to manufacture generics (without challenging the patent). This would leave the people vulnerable to Gilead’s pricing policies and licensing conditions, should its drug be successful.

355,2020/04/01,Beyond social distancing to fight COVID-19,"In the global South, a military style lockdown, though inevitable given the circumstances, may reinforce prejudices

I agree with Eric Klinenberg’s recent submission to The New York Times that social distancing, advocated by health authorities worldwide, as a means of combating the spread of the coronavirus, can only be a part of firefighting. The rapid worldwide spread of COVID-19 has a lot to do with the fallout of globalisation, including the travel industry, tourism and the neoliberal attack on universal health care. Moreover, unfettered promotion of social distancing can reinforce existing social prejudices driven by different forms of social exclusion.

The Korea example

In illustrating how social distancing actually works in the periphery, I will draw from a few examples from corona-affected countries. The COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea started with the controversial Shincheonji Church of Jesus with a personality cult centred around 88-year-old Lee Man-hee, identified as a messianic saviour. This cult facilitated the transmission of the disease from Wuhan to South Korea because of frequent travel among its followers. Consequently, more than half of all COVID-19 patients at the onset of the epidemic belonged to this religious movement, which accounted for less than 1% of the Korean population.

Coronavirus | Unsure what herd immunity or social distancing is? Here’s a coronavirus dictionary

Social isolation among new immigrants in Korean cities was incidentally a major incentive for people to join this cult. In this context social distancing was not popular among them due to the simple reason that the movement served as an extended family for many of its members. In this instance, social distancing once successfully introduced may have actually served to contain the epidemic, but it also further stigmatised a religious group already in the margins of Korean society, interfering with disease containment.

Iran became a leading COVID-19 hot spot in West Asia due to a unique set of circumstances. It was compelled to develop ties with China due to economic sanctions imposed by U.S.-led western countries. An Iranian trader who made a business trip to Wuhan was reportedly the very first COVID-19 patient in Iran. The initial hub of disease transmission in Iran was Qom, a popular pilgrimage centre for Shiite Muslims. The next centre was the Iranian Parliament, having strong ties with Qom, the spiritual hub of Iranian society. As many as 23 parliamentarians, comprising 8% of all MPs, were infected with the disease by March 3. Social distancing was contrary to popular forms of social greeting in Iran particularly among the ruling elite. In any case the coronavirus was introduced in Iran through globalisation-triggered international alignment and incubated through political and religious processes.

Spread in Sri Lanka

The onset of the COVID-19 epidemic in India and Sri Lanka has a lot to do with tourism and labour migration, processes intimately connected with globalisation. Both in India and Sri Lanka, the first cases were reported among foreign tourists from Italy and China, respectively. The tour guides who travelled with the respective tourists and their contacts became the first set of local people exposed to the disease triggering local transmissions. Both Sri Lanka and Kerala in India have large portions of their labour force employed overseas. Returnees from these overseas destinations have contributed to the upsurge in the COVID-19 epidemic in South Asian countries. For instance, among 18 conformed COVID-19 patients in Sri Lanka by March 15 as many as 11 (61%) were Sri Lankan returnees from Italy, a popular destination for Sri Lankan migrant workers from the 1990s.

Thus, imported cases and those directly exposed to them comprise over 90% of all COVID-19 cases detected in Sri Lanka as of March 22. Roughly about 20.5% of confirmed cases are connected with tourism. Nearly 60% of all cases are among Sri Lankan workers returning from abroad and their contacts indicating that exposure to the disease through overseas employment has triggered the epidemic in Sri Lanka. Considering that nearly 50% of the entire caseload in Sri Lanka is among workers returning from Italy, it is important to note that many Sri Lankan workers in Italy work as live-in care givers for elderly people. The spurt of cases of Indian origin lately has led to identification of Chennai as a high risk region in Sri Lanka.

Coronavirus | Sri Lanka reports first death, terms Chennai COVID-19 ‘high-risk zone’

Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic can be seen as a fallout of globalisation, particularly in the global South. The quarantine and social distancing processes may not be totally effective in so far as these workers and their families are often in between two states, experiencing difficulties at both ends. The workers returning from Italy and South Korea were the first to be sent to quarantine centres in Batticaloa and Kandakadu from March 10. Initially, they resented the mandatory two-week quarantine in a remote location. Both migrant workers and tourist guides already experience discrimination of various kinds because of their occupations and the risks involved. A military style lockdown though inevitable given the circumstances is likely to reinforce the existing prejudices. This clearly shows that we need to think beyond social distancing and address problems of the fallout from globalisation in dealing with the pandemic in the global South. It appears as if the much publicised problems of a run-away world have been finally crystallised in this deadly global epidemic.

356,2020/04/01,"Weaker, later: On Olympics postponement","The postponement is better than cancellation, but Olympics is not on anyone’s mind now

Sport at its best is a glorious indulgence that blends adrenaline rush, exultant joy and mind-numbing grief both for the athlete and the expectant fan. However, in its worst form, sport is war minus the shooting while the cause of nationhood whips up jingoistic passions. But whatever be its intrinsic nature governed by context and history, sport can never exist in a vacuum and it needs a functional society to serve as its bedrock. In these distraught times of the pandemic and the resultant social distancing, basic survival takes precedence over moving limbs and the frenzied applause from a thrilled audience. And it was no surprise that sports events have been postponed or cancelled and the latest to face a disruption in its schedule is the Olympics. Football continues to be the beautiful game but the Olympics remains the world’s greatest congregation adhering to its eternal ‘faster, higher, stronger’ motto. Originally slated for a July 24 to August 9 slot at Tokyo this year, the high-voltage event got derailed once the coronavirus took flight from Wuhan’s wet market and coursed through the veins of an inter-connected globe. Initially, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and host Japan were in denial and Australia and Canada threatened to boycott the event before better sense prevailed and the Olympics was pushed to a July 23 start, next year.

A postponement is a first in the chequered history of the modern Olympics since its inception at Athens in 1896. But worse has happened, especially the cancellations, during 1916, 1940 and 1944, when the World Wars drew vicious lines of hate. There were also the Cold War years when the United States and its allies boycotted the Moscow Games in 1980 and the erstwhile Union of Soviet Socialist Republics retaliated along with the Eastern Bloc by skipping the 1984 Olympics at Los Angeles. The most heart-rending was the ‘Munich Massacre’ during the 1972 edition in then West Germany when a Palestinian terrorist group, Black September, killed 11 members of Israel’s squad. Seen through that prism of a bloodied past, the latest postponement seems a mere quibble. IOC president Thomas Bach and Tokyo 2020 president Yoshiro Mori concurred that fresh logistics had to be worked out and ideally a year’s preparation was mandatory. Initially estimated to cost about $28 billion, a delayed Olympics will have to factor inflation and a shrinking economy coping with a pandemic. Over the next 12 months, it is hoped the virus will wane and a semblance of normalcy will set the stage for the Olympics. Sport then would be a welcome balm. But for now, universal health is the overriding priority.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/weaker-later-the-hindu-editorial-on-olympics-postponement/article31221843.ece
357,2020/04/01,Step up: On citizens’ responsibility during a pandemic,"Citizens must not hide their travel or contact history as authorities deal with the pandemic

With any big crisis comes great responsibility. In this time of a pandemic, while there is extensive, proven value in adopting recommended personal hygiene standards, maintaining physical distance, and demanding the States and Centre provide adequate facilities for testing and treatment for the ill, it is also essential to leave that word on the top of the pile — Responsibility. Every public health emergency requires community recognition that this is an extraordinary set of circumstances requiring far-from-ordinary responses. A reasonable restriction on citizens’ rights may come into play on invoking provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act. State police are already slapping cases on violators of the lockdown conditions; action is also being taken on those who violate quarantine. However, the strongest weapon that one can unleash against this pandemic is with every individual. The time to say this nicely is over. It is time to insist that every individual respond responsibly during this time: To inform authorities of relevant history of travel, stay in quarantine even if asymptomatic, follow all other protocols. Keeping health authorities in the loop could make the difference between life and death.

Individuals volunteering information will help the Central and State governments narrow down on the cluster cases centred around the Tablighi Jamaat conference in Nizamuddin, Delhi. The spread of cases from this one spot, which reportedly had several foreign nationals who later tested positive, and where six among those who attended died, has emerged as a key milestone in India’s management of the epidemic. The conference was held on March 13, more than a week before the Sunday lockdown. Since then, people from the conference moved on, back home, and several, including Indonesian nationals who were present at Nizamuddin, have tested positive. While the State has deployed ‘hotspot’ containment strategies in ground zero in Delhi, it is the people who have spread out in the community that are absolutely crucial, over the next few days, to shaping one stretch of the course of the epidemic in India. While it is a massive exercise to track down all the attendees (it is now believed that thousands of people were present) and each of their contacts, it must still be done. Some States have already expressed being thwarted, without co-operation from the participants, and their close contacts. Unfortunately, this may leave the job half done, or undone, leading to disastrous consequences. It is indeed a Herculean task, and may even be considered impossible, unless those who went for the meeting in Delhi step up themselves, engage with health authorities, submit themselves to a test, and remain under quarantine for the prescribed period. Humanitarian crises such as pandemics invoke the worst among men and women, but also their best. The latter is eminently possible, as long as people believe that the enemy is the pandemic, and act responsibly.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/step-up-the-hindu-editorial-on-citizens-responsibility-during-a-pandemic/article31221838.ece
358,2020/04/01,"COVID-19: Nearly 9,000 people in essential services use BMTC buses","People visiting hospitals and blood donors are also allowed to use the service

The decision of the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) to operate 160 buses during the lockdown is helping thousands of people carry out essential services in the city. Every day, close to 9,000 people working in the health sector and in agencies such as BESCOM, BBMP, BWSSB as well as employees of banks, petrol bunks and police personnel use the services to reach their workplace. People visiting hospitals and blood donors are also allowed to use the service.

BMTC driver Shivaprasad who operates on Outer Ring Road (ORR) said, “I have been working in the Corporation for more than 15 years and never experienced this kind of situation. I am driving the bus on a long route to and from Banashankari. After reaching Hebbal, we go to Marathahalli, Hebbal and then back to Banashankari. There are many hospitals on this route.”

Bus drivers say that roads are empty. On a normal day, it would take Mr. Shivaprasad four hours to complete a trip on ORR. “Now, we cover the distance in two hours even though we drive slowly,” he added.

BMTC conductor Somashekar said that only people with valid ID cards are allowed to travel in the bus. BMTC provides hand sanitisers, masks and gloves for the bus crew.

“We also maintain social distancing. Only one passenger is allowed to sit in a row. We are happy to serve at this crucial time. We drop off passengers at the bus stop located closest to their workplace,” said Somashekar.

As a precautionary measure, only 20 people are allowed to travel in the bus. However, the Corporation operates only from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and the timings are not conducive to those working late hours or in night shifts.

Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research Director C.N. Manjunath said, “Transportation during lockdown is an issue for people, especially those who don’t have their own cars or two-wheelers. BMTC’s services have helped them. However, as the frequency is less, we are contemplating hiring a few mini buses that can be operated between major bus stands for our staff.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hfb02t/article31230015.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02BGBMTCSPECIAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-nearly-9000-people-in-essential-services-use-bmtc-buses/article31230016.ece
359,2020/04/01,"COVID-19: In Bengaluru, police seize over 5,000 vehicles for flouting lockdown rules","Owners will be able to collect their vehicles only after the lockdown is lifted

The police on Wednesday seized over 5,000 vehicles and booked motorists for allegedly “misusing the leniency shown to them to buy essentials”. This comes in the wake of the government being criticised for not enforcing the lockdown strictly in Bengaluru to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

DG&IGP Praveen Sood took to Twitter to reinforce the rule. “This is not an April Fool's prank. Two/four wheelers are banned from use till the 14th of April. We will SEIZE your vehicle if you CEASE to ignore this lockdown regulation,” he said.

A senior police officer said, “The city police had warned people to follow the directions and stay at home, but many are moving around in their two-wheelers and cars citing fake emergencies. Our appeals have not worked and so we have decided to seize vehicles.”

As of Wednesday evening, the police had seized 5,106 two-wheelers, 181 autorickshaws and 263 four-wheelers. Owners will be able to collect their vehicles only after the lockdown is lifted.

Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao on Monday directed the police to intensify the drive. “It was noticed that people were leaving their houses in their vehicles and giving silly excuses. Citizens should respect the lockdown, and in case of an emergency walk to your grocer,” Mr. Rao said.

Many families are upset with the police’s decision.

“We’ve been isolating ourselves at home and not buying in bulk. But we are a family of four with two children. I need to buy my weekly groceries. Without the car, I will have to make multiple trips to the market to carry grains, wheat, vegetables and kitchen staples,” said a private school teacher and resident of HSR Layout.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/6i2kb5/article31228141.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02BGCARONAVEHICLES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/police-seize-over-5000-vehicles-for-flouting-lockdown-rules/article31228142.ece
360,2020/04/01,IISc. researchers building electro-mechanical ventilator prototype from scratch,"Using only components found or made in India, they hope to ready it in a few weeks

As India races to overcome the possibility of a shortage of ventilators in its battle against COVID-19, a team of engineers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) is building a prototype of an electro-mechanical ventilator from scratch, using only components found or made in India. It is expected to be ready within the next few weeks.

The project, which is based on guidelines issued by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, is aimed at countering the challenge of manufacturers being unable to source key components such as sensors and flow controllers from abroad due to the current disruptions in global supply chains.

“We are building it so that anyone can use it free of cost,” T.V. Prabhakar, Principal Research Scientist at the Department of Electronic Systems Engineering (DESE) and one of the founders of the project, was quoted as saying in an IISc release.

Gaurab Banerjee, Associate Professor at the Department of Electrical Communication Engineering and one of the project coordinators, said they have been working on it since 10 days. “We hope that by the end of April, manufacturers can have their own prototypes done, which they can scale up very quickly,” he added.

According to the release, there are currently around 40,000 ventilators available across the country, but if the number of severe cases surges, several thousands more may need to be produced very quickly.

“Patients with severe COVID-19 infection have inflamed or damaged lungs that struggle to receive sufficient oxygen. When doctors put them on a ventilator, the machine critically assists lung function, feeding the patients a controlled mixture of air and oxygen and buying their body time to fight the infection. A well-designed ventilator has built-in sensors and actuators that allow doctors to set the volume and pressure of gas delivered to the patient precisely, which depends on the severity of their illness,” the release said, explaining the need for the project.

To overcome the unavailability of ventilator components not manufactured in India, the IISc. team is building some components and co-opting others. To store and mix air and oxygen, for example, they reused sedimentation tanks found in household RO water purifiers. “The mixing process that we have come up with has parallels to those in gas turbines and industrial burners, where the ratio of fuel and oxidizer is carefully controlled,” team member Pratikash Panda, Assistant Professor at the Department of Aerospace Engineering said.

Controlling the pressure at which gas is pumped into the patient’s lungs is crucial. To check pressure levels, the team used sensors similar to those used to detect air pressure in car tyres. The team is also developing a flow rate sensor, which shows exactly how much air is flowing into the patient’s lungs, from scratch.

The team is also getting inputs from doctors to simplify the interface and create a dashboard preloaded with approved settings, allowing it to be operated quickly in an emergency even by untrained technicians or nurses, said the release.

The researchers are already working with potential manufacturers to check the inventory of critical components before including them in the final design, according to team member Manish Arora, Assistant Professor at the Centre for Product Design and Manufacturing.

The project has also received technical inputs from nearly 100 volunteers. “Companies such as Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited have expressed interest in supporting mass production,” the release added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/vpmz9e/article31227761.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGIISC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/iisc-researchers-building-electro-mechanical-ventilator-prototype-from-scratch/article31227762.ece

366,2020/04/01,Coronavirus | Managing pregnancy and childbirth,"“Doctor, I am in my 31st week of pregnancy; neighbours and friends tell me that I am more prone to get the infection. I am afraid. What should I do?”

As obstetricians taking care of mums-to-be, we have received many a phone call seeking help and reassurance. The fear and anxiety is understandable. Thorough knowledge of the infection and its consequences will certainly help allay this fear and anxiety.

Does pregnancy make a woman more susceptible to coronavirus infection? Although pregnancy is an immuno-compromised state, we know from years of experience that most pregnant women go through pregnancy without any major compromise. Compared to the general population they are more likely to contract the infection and hence categorised as a high-risk group. There is, therefore, a need for more strict measures to be followed by both the pregnant women and their caregivers.

Sneezing, running nose, sore throat, fever and sometimes cough – extremely common symptoms. Then, how does one differentiate the common cold from a possible corona infection? Common treatment for such symptoms would be steam inhalation, paracetamol and antihistaminics (for cold).

In the absence of exposure to or contact with a known COVID suspect or history of travel within close contacts (family and friends), the initial treatment should contain the infection. If however your symptoms persist, become more severe or recovery is delayed – it may be an indication of a more severe respiratory infection and you should contact your doctor. Please do not panic as this may still not be indicative of a COVID infection. Kindly ascertain from your doctor regarding the place of consultation. It may not be the clinic where you regularly visit.

The need for social distancing and self isolation cannot be overemphasized. Pregnant women should stay indoors, not participate in social gatherings and postpone “baby showers”. If a family member develops a cough or cold you should isolate yourself for a minimum of two weeks in a separate room or till he/she recovers.

Our knowledge of the infection itself and its spread is limited. Given the limited information currently available, it would be prudent to strictly adhere to social distancing, especially beyond 28 weeks of pregnancy.

COVID infection and pregnancyThere is insufficient evidence at present to support vertical transmission from mother to baby in utero, during delivery or breast feeding. Reports of miscarriage, growth restriction in the baby, especially when the infection occurs in the last trimester and induced preterm labour, though occasional, should be kept in mind.

Routine Antenatal (pregnancy) Care

You may be at various stages in your pregnancy. Trimester I or upto 12 weeks, after pregnancy confirmed on ultrasound scan, there is no need for an urgent AN visit.

Certain scans i.e., the first trimester scan, anomaly scan and growth scan are time-bound and you should contact your doctor. If you do not have any significant risk factors i.e., age, multiple pregnancy (twins), raised blood pressure, diabetes or other medical or pregnancy related disorders, you can at your doctor’s discretion reschedule your monthly visits. The aim would be to minimise exposure to the women and their caregivers. Routine clarification of doubts can be over telephone or video calls.

Delivery and immediate post partum

Your obstetrician and maternity unit may not be able to comply with all aspects of care you may have agreed to in your birth plan. Safety is of utmost importance and this will be definitely ensured. Risks of airborne transmission is high during normal delivery and precautions will be taken even if you are not a COVID suspect. If an emergency caesarean section is required, your doctor will advise you accordingly.

You can breastfeed your baby. Isolation may be advised only if there is suspicion or history of exposure.

Home Delivery

We have had requests for “home delivery” as it is presumed to be a “safer” place than a maternity unit in a hospital. Delivery at home certainly has many attendant risks and should be strongly discouraged in the current scenario. Monitoring of the mother and foetus may be sub-optimal. Access to emergency care, if it becomes necessary, i.e., transport, availability of blood and maternity units and personnel may be very difficult to organise.

Working women

Working women without any co-morbid factors can continue to work but must follow social distancing. If you are more than 28 weeks pregnant or have any risk factors it is best to coordinate with your workplace and your doctor and make a decision.

There could be a number of asymptomatic individuals among us who are carrying the virus.

The care of pregnant women affected by the coronavirus will be protocol driven and is not discussed here.

Remember, my dear parents to be. Our priority should be reduction of transmission and safety first. My wishes to all of you for a smooth, safe pregnancy and delivery.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/92ivfl/article31231107.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/expert,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/experts-speak-on-coronavirus-managing-pregnancy-and-childbirth/article31231108.ece
367,2020/04/01,Why do people step out of their homes? Police collate reasons,"Stern action on the cards, based on the data collected

It looked like rush hour on Padi flyover on Wednesday morning as close to a hundred vehicles clogged the roads after the police conducted a surprise check on motorists flouting the lockdown.

The men and women in uniform stopped every vehicle and noted down registration numbers. “We wanted to find out how many people step out of their houses for essentials and medical emergencies and how many just to roam the streets. We are also checking to find out how many are going around the city with curfew passes,” said a senior officer.

Further action will be taken based on the data collected. “We will decide if we have to reduce the number of curfew passes or take measures to prevent people from leaving their locality,” the officer added.

The checking led to a jam on the flyover, a junction for vehicles coming from Villivakkam, Thirumangalam, Korattur and Retteri. “There were too many people. Since we checked each vehicle, there was a pile-up,” said an officer.

M. Balaji, a motorist who was on the way to a hospital with his mother, said: “They checked our papers and took down details. The police did their duty as people are roaming the streets without realising the seriousness of the pandemic.”

Prohibitory orders were enforced in the city from March 24 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. People, apart from those coming under the exempted categories, were asked not to come out of their houses, unless they have to buy essentials or have a medical emergency.

From March 24 till date, the police have booked over 2,000 persons for flouting prohibitory orders. Cases were filed against those who were roaming around unnecessarily and many were made to do squats on the middle of the road.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/y09f52/article31231095.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2THPADI2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/why-do-people-step-out-of-their-homes-police-collate-reasons/article31231096.ece

The Chennai Corporation has planned to expand COVID-19 containment zones across the city, said Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash.

Currently, just 25,000 houses are covered in the containment zones. Once containment zones are expanded to cover the entire city, across 426 sq.km., at least 10 lakh apartment complexes and individual houses will be included in field-level operations to control COVID-19.

“The Corporation has launched COVID-19 containment-related exercises in all locations where positive cases have been reported. Currently, 10 containment zones have been earmarked in 21 locations across Chennai. COVID-19 positive cases have been reported in the 10 zones,” said Mr. Prakash.

“Each containment zone has 2,500 houses. The houses will be monitored by Corporation workers every day, checking if residents have symptoms. The exercise will continue for a month,” said Mr. Prakash.

“Over 15,000 personnel, including SHG members, will be used by the Corporation to scan the containment zones, every day. The term ‘scan’ means workers will note down symptoms of residents in each household,” said Mr. Prakash.

“As many as 10 lakh locations, including apartment complexes and individual houses, will be monitored daily by the 15,000 workers. Doctors will further examine the residents who have symptoms. The field-level containment plan for the entire city is ready. We will get 100 doctors, in addition to the 200 doctors in Corporation hospitals. Thirty doctors are already at work, containing COVID-19 in the city,” said Mr. Prakash.

Many doctors who have received appointment orders have requested a few days to join duty.

The Corporation is also planning to use services of primary schoolteachers for implementing the plan.

Vacancies in posts

Currently, the civic body has around 50% vacancies in posts of sanitary inspectors, who play a key role in pandemic response. The civic body has just 110 sanitary inspectors in 200 wards of the city. Each sanitary inspector is in charge of one ward, with an average of 50,000 residents. But most sanitary inspectors are handling additional charges of the neighbouring ward, affecting containment-related exercises.

Some women belonging to SHGs have reportedly agreed to join containment-related exercises, said officials.

Many SHGs have already started manufacturing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Some wards have at least 120 SHGs, with 20 members each. But such SHG members have said that they would carry out containment operations only after the Corporation provides personal protective equipment. “The Chennai Corporation has not even supplied masks for Amma canteen staff,” said an SHG member.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/82e626/article31231073.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2THRGGGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ten-lakh-flats-houses-to-come-under-containment-zone/article31231074.ece

371,2020/04/01,COVID-19: When seniors have their ‘guardian angels’,"Here are cases of how youngsters are being a pillar of support to the elderly in these difficult times

A few days ago, 63-year-old Sunanda, a resident of Officer's Colony in Mogappair, realised that both her bubble-top water cans had gone empty, and she knew what to do.

She telephoned S. Shanmugam and apprised him of the matter. He got the two water cans replaced promptly before rushing to deliver a pack of medicines in another section of the neighbourhood.

Thirty-three-old Shanmugam is not a multi-tasking salesman, with an array of small businesses under his belt.

He is a volunteer who gets groceries, medicine and other essentials for seniors in the neighbourhood. He has in fact been authorised by Officer's Colony Residents Welfare Association to offer this free services to senior citizens to help them tide over the lockdown.

Shanmugam’s phone number has been shared in the Association’s WhatsApp group.

“Many senior residents of Officer's Colony helped me pursue my education for many years. Now, it's time for me to return the favour,” says Shanmugam, a father of two children.

With a diploma in mechanical engineering, Shanmugam is a draftsman by profession. Now working from home, he manages to find some time to help the seniors in the locality in this manner,

Similarly, some young software professionals working at Ambattur IT Park in Thirumullavoyal also pitch in for senior citizens, by getting basic items such as milk, vegetables and groceries for them. ""As we go to buy essentials like milk every day, we also ask senior citizens nearby about what they may want. We also take senior citizens to a nearby clinic for routine check-up,"" says K. Rakesh, a resident of Thirumullavoyal.

Similarly, R. Rajasekar, a 33-year-old school van driver, is a familiar face at Anna Nagar Western Extension Phase-II. Beyond the rush hour when he has to pick and drop students at school, Rajasekar attends to electrical, plumbing and carpentering works that may come his way.

During the shutdown, he does a lot of volunteering work, which includes delivering bubble-top water cans at houses in the neighbourhood; collecting a list of grocery items that are needed by a group of few senior citizen families in the neighbourhood every day and delivering them at their doorstep. ""We honour them (volunteer youngsters) during annual meeting of the residents' association as a mark of encouragement to their service,” says V. Rajagopal, president, Anna Nagar Western Extension Phase-II Residents Welfare Association.

373,2020/04/01,"At crisis time, school friends in Chennai get together to help","The group is funding meals at several Amma Canteens in the city, and also helping with supplies for homeless persons in community halls

Over the past few days, the number of footfalls at the Amma Unavagam in Sivagnanam Road in T. Nagar have increased significantly.

Initially, the customers were mainly security personnel posted outside the many apartment complexes in the area. The queue has been lengthening since Friday. On Sunday evening a police van was stationed outside the canteen and police were regulating the customers who were instructed to maintain one-arm distance.

Jayalakshmi, in-charge of the Unavagam, said more people sought the canteen facility as they had no other place to go to eat. “It is only after the first day of full-day lockdown that we are seeing more people here,” she said.

According to the employees, in normal times around 120 people would come. But in the last week that number has jumped to 200 as word spread that food was offered free of cost.

Ms. Jayalakshmi said that that a person had offered to pay for all the people who ate at the canteen, be it breakfast, lunch or dinner. “I issue tokens and give him the numbers. He pays for the customers,” she said.

S. Balasubramanian, who is funding the free food, said it was a team effort by a group of school friends. The initial plan was to distribute cooked food but since the government had ruled against it, they decided to fund the canteens. The group chose Amma canteens in Mylapore, R.A. Puram, T. Nagar and Greenways Road. The group has allocated ₹15,000 a day for the purpose.

The group is also helping the 250 homeless persons sheltered in four community halls in Alwarpet, Mandaveli, Mylapore and Abhiramapuram by providing them with essential supplies that the organisers ask of them, Mr. Balasubramanian said. Though non-governmental organisations had made an effort to supply food and water, they needed items such as soap, clothes and hand sanitisers, he said.

Mr. Balasubramanian and five of his friends do the field work while behind them is a team of 100 others also working to carry forward the work, he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/edckzl/article31226499.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01APRTH-AMMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/at-crisis-time-school-friends-in-chennai-get-together-to-help/article31226500.ece
374,2020/04/01,Chennai Corporation launches ‘Corona Monitoring’ app,"Users can report symptoms and also submit photos of crowded spots in the city

The Greater Chennai Corporation launched a ‘Corona Monitoring app’ which can be downloaded from its website.

Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash said that if any resident of the city has symptoms, which include fever, dry cough and breathlessness, he /she will have to take a picture of their door or a selfie from their homes and send it in. “It will reach our server and instantly we will know the location. Our medical team can then examine whether the symptoms are normal or require a higher level of medical attention,” he said.

For persons who don’t know how to download and use the app, he encouraged neighbours or anyone nearby to help them send a picture from their homes.

The app gives the users three options -- ‘Quarantine capture’, ‘General fever symptoms’ and ‘Report crowded spots’. While Quarantine capture requires users who are under quarantine to send in photos of the label pasted outside their homes, persons who are exhibiting symptoms can send in a photo using the fever symptoms option. Furthermore, if any resident comes across a crowded public spot, or shops other than essentials which are functioning or any other mass gathering, they can send in a picture and submit it through the app.

People can go to http://www.chennaicorporation.gov.in/ and click on the ‘Corona monitoring app’ option on the homepage to download the Android app.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/bhkja9/article31225831.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01APRTH-Corpnjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-corporation-launches-corona-monitoring-app/article31225833.ece
375,2020/04/01,COVID-19: People throng to buy Siddha drug kabasura kudineer,"Siddha specialists however, have cautioned against its non-prescription use

Many pharmacies selling AYUSH medicines, particularly Siddha, have been witnessing a significant turnout of people queuing up to buy kabasura kudineer in the belief that it will help keep COVID-19 at bay.

However, experts have clarified that kabasura kudineer, a Siddha drug, was only suggested to the government for possible use as a complementary drug in the treatment of COVID-19 or for those considered highly vulnerable.

Usman Kani, a resident of Vettuvankeni, who visited Indian Medical Practitioners Co-operative Pharmacy and Stores Ltd (IMPCOPS) in Adyar, was disappointed that kabasura kudineer was not available. “I was, however, suggested another drug that will help in boosting immunity,” he said.

While Usman Kani said he was going to use this as an additional precaution apart from maintaining hygiene and distancing, a few others who came to buy the drug, seemed to strongly believe, erroneously, that it would prevent COVID-19.

C. Dinesh Kumar, who runs an AYUSH pharmacy, said that he had sold 2,000 bottles of kabasura kudineer and other Siddha drugs which he termed as ‘immunity boosters’ on Monday alone. “We have run out of stock,” he said.

According to him, the demand went up following Prime Minister’s recent meeting with renowned AYUSH practitioners. Following the meeting, there were media reports and virally-circulated social media posts linking kabasura kudineer with the treatment of COVID-19.

G. Sivaraman, a Siddha practitioner and managing director of Arogya Healthcare, who attended the meeting said that kabasura kudineer was never suggested as a drug to prevent or cure COVID-19. According to him, the drug, prepared from 15 herbs and spices, has long been used in Siddha for treating pneumonia-like symptoms that lead to severe complications including respiratory issues.

He said that the suggestion made during the meeting was to use this as a complementary drug for two groups of people -- those who are highly vulnerable to COVID-19 due to contacts or travel history and to those who are asymptomatic but have tested positive for COVID-19. “We suggested trying this and clearly documenting the outcomes that will help us further our research in using this in the future for COVID-19,” he said, adding that China has also been trying its traditional medicine in treating COVID-19.

Claiming that the drug will not have any side effects, he, however, stressed that it was not good for people to buy this over the counter and use it unnecessarily.

Highlighting that the suggestion was only made to the government to use it as a complementary drug, R. Meenakumari, Director, National Institute of Siddha, Chennai, said that people buying in huge quantity was creating a shortage of the drug for its intended use.

“Kabasura kudineer is not for boosting immunity,” she said, adding that people should instead rigorously follow regular hand-washing and physical distancing as suggested by the government to prevent COVID-19.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hexlji/article31225179.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01APRTH--Drugjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/covid-19-people-throng-to-buy-siddha-drug-kabasura-kudineer/article31225180.ece
376,2020/04/01,COVID-19: Chennai Corporation releases lists of shops that deliver essential items at the doorstep,"All the 15 zones are engaged in this exercise; lists prepared by some zones are already being circulated widely on social media platforms

To ensure residents enjoy access to essential items, especially groceries and medicine, without relinquishing the safety of their home, Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) has released lists of shops and pharmacies that have come forward to offer free home-delivery option in view of two twin requirements of the hour — social distancing and staying at home.

Though the contents of the lists are not exhaustive, the lists have tried to cover the 200 wards across 15 zones, with every zone preparing lists pertaining to areas within their jurisdiction.

The addresses and phone numbers of the shops are listed. At the time of this article being published, most zones had prepared the lists, and a small number of them were close to finalising their lists. Lists from a few zones are already being shared widely on social media platforms. Government officials point out all the lists will be made available at the Corporation website

According to Corporation officials, each zone was advised to collect details of such shops, adding that the exercise included a thorough background check of the each shop and pharmacy being considered for listing.

Corporation officials point out that field-level officials of the civic body will monitor if these shops and pharmacies will keep this service free, as promised; and they add that complaints in this regard from residents will also be acted upon.

The free service, civic officials said, will be available only during the stipulated time — up to 2.30 p.m every day.

“For the preparation of these lists we have roped in local residents' welfare associations by sending details of the shops and pharmacies to their common WhatsApp group,” says a Corporation official.

Among other initiatives, Corporation officials say, with food sourced from Amma canteens, free food is served for the homeless and migrant workers at Corporation community centres — this is particularly the case in Madhavaram (zone-3), Thiruvottiyur (zone-1) and Royapuram (zone-5).

This service is said to be offered to homeless persons and migrant workers who have registered with the Corporation.

Besides, Corporation officials have made an appeal that residents’ groups should participate in relief work by providing at least one-day’s rations to the local civic body office as doing so would go a long way towards helping the needy in this time of crisis.

Residents welcome move

Representatives of various residents’ welfare associations have welcomed the move. “This helps people stay indoors and avoid crowding at shops,” says Geetha Ganesh, secretary, AGS Colony Residents’ Welfare Association, Velachery West.

377,2020/04/01,Coronavirus | Help that counts in a time of crisis,"To inspire other residents to spare of thought for the foot-soldiers in their midst, The Hindu Downtown is compiling lists of individuals and residents welfare associations that seek to support daily wage-earners at this hour. If you know of such ‘COVID-19 Santas’, share their details with us

They are an invisible workforce — plumbers, electricians and odd-jobs men and women: They are hardly remembered beyond the time they fix somthing around home; and they will again spring to mind only when something else goes out of whack.

Nesamani Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association in Perumbakkam is breaking this pattern of self-centredness by remembering such people in this moment of crisis, and offering them cash incentives, as a mark of gratitutide for what they have done so far for the residents of the neighbourhood.

N. K. Raja, president, Nesamani Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association, Perumbakkam, provides a list of the foot-soldiers who will receive a cash incentive — Ayyappan, plumber; Ranjith and Nagalingam, electricians; Chellappa and Sargunam, watermen; Karthik, Ethiraj, Jayaseelan and Mari, conservancy staff, Manbahadur, a security guard, and Munuswamy, a milk-vendor.

“That is not all. They will be honoured at a function scheduled to be held after April 15,” says N. K. Raja.

One-month’s provision

This is multiplier effect at work. One man decided to share a small part of his resources with those who are struggling to meet ends meet; and this thought now seems set to galvanise a neighburhood into a form of relief work.

On March 31, K. Sanjaya Kumar, a resident of Jain Nagar, Hasthinapuram, distributed one-month’s essential commodities (provisions) to ten families in Chromepet and Hastinaouram that depend on daily-earnings to run their lives. The wage-earners in most of these families are painters and cooks.

The provisions include rice, toor dal, oil, mustard, ‘jeera’, fenugreek, chilly and turmeric powder, onions, brinjals, raddish, biscuits and puffed rice packets.

Taking note of this act of mercy, Jain Nagar Residents Welfare Association, Hasthinapuram, and Federation of Civic and Welfare Association of Pallavaram (FCWAP) have issued a call to residents to make similar contributions, and also have a plan to support such community initiatives.

378,2020/04/01,Tamil Nadu CM writes on how the State is stopping the pandemic in its tracks,"""The world is watching us to know how we are going to tackle the deadly virus""

The COVID-19 pandemic has spread around the world — 204 countries/regions/territories so far. In India, the first case was reported from Kerala on January 30, 2020. The first case in Tamil Nadu was reported on March 7 —a person in Kancheepuram who had travelled abroad.

Realising the nature of this virus quite early on and even when this dreaded infection was confined to one country alone, in January 2020, I directed the State Health Department to screen all the international passengers who had arrived in the State. To curtail community spread, Amma’s [Jayalalithaa’s] government wasted no time in closing down educational institutions and all high-risk areas such as big commercial complexes, malls, theatres, places of worship and so on, on March 15. When positive cases began showing up in the neighbouring States, I announced the closure of the State’s borders as well, again on March 15.

The Tamil Nadu government made a life-saving decision on March 24, which was announced by me in the Legislative Assembly — of a complete ‘lockdown’ and the imposition of Section 144 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure throughout the State till March 31. Our call for social distancing was further strengthened when the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India made the announcement of a national-level lockdown till April 14, 2020 on the same evening which was intended to break the infection chain. The participation by 1.3 billion Indians in this national exercise once again proves our unity in diversity.

Coronavirus | 57 more test positive in Tamil Nadu; highest single-day rise

Augmenting infrastructure

Tamil Nadu shares its boundary with States which reported COVID-19 positive cases in the early days of infection in India. The four international airports and four major ports in the State also compounded the risk of infection in the State. But the Tamil Nadu government was ready and around 2.09 lakh international passengers have been screened besides screening data obtained from the Immigration Department on persons who are natives of Tamil Nadu but who have entered the country through an airport other than Chennai. As a result of this screening, around 43,537 people are under home quarantine and observation as on date for a period of 28 days. The houses of this high-risk category have been identified and stickers were pasted in front of their residences. They are being monitored through audio/video calls made from a dedicated district control room by doctors posted there round the clock. They have also been given medical advice and counselling.

Since Tamil Nadu is right now transiting to Stage II of COVID-19 transmission, the State government has in place a detailed ‘Local Containment Plan’ of conducting door-to-door surveillance in the zones where positive cases have been identified. People who are identified through active surveillance will be facility quarantined. Passive surveillance to trace the contacts of positive persons outside the zone is also being undertaken in parallel.

The first exclusive block to treat COVID-19 patients has been set up at Chennai’s Omandurar Government Medical College Hospital, with a capacity of 500 beds; ₹10 crore has also been allocated for the required medical equipment. There are also dedicated COVID-19 hospitals in each district to treat confirmed cases. All medical college hospitals and district headquarters hospitals have been designated as hospitals for the management of suspected patients. Quarantine facilities have also been arranged for passengers arriving from affected countries. These are at Poonamallee, Madurai, Coimbatore and Tiruchi, which are close to all four international airports in the State. The Health Department has earmarked about 17,000 beds in isolation wards; 3,018 of those are equipped with ventilator facilities. I have also ensured the scaling up of the procurement of essential medical equipment, protective gear for health workers, and drugs and medicines. The Health Department has managed to establish 17 COVID-19 testing laboratories to cover all the regions of the State. I am personally reviewing and monitoring these steps.

Coronavirus | Here’s what Tamil Nadu has been doing since January

I have extended full support to all frontline workers (doctors, nurses, para-medical staff and sanitary workers) who are working round the clock. A decision has been made to recruit 530 doctors, 1,000 nurses and 1,508 lab technicians to augment the robust medical team already in place. Ambulance services have also been increased, by 200.

The challenges in providing adequate masks and other personal protective equipment for health-care workers are being met. I have advised the District Collectors to involve self-help group members to manufacture triple-layered masks and hand sanitisers to augment supply. Highly populated and crowded areas, market places, bus stands, other public places and dwelling areas are being disinfected regularly. Thermal screening is being done in public places and government offices. Besides creating awareness on frequent hand washing through advertisements, hand washing and sanitising platforms have been installed in places of public gathering. I have announced an additional one month’s salary in recognition of the untiring work by frontline health workers.

Addressing fundamentals

The national lockdown will have a telling impact on the poorest and daily-wage workers in the unorganised sector. An immediate and comprehensive relief package of ₹3,280 crore has been announced. All rice card holders will receive rice, sugar, dhal and edible oil free for April along with ₹1,000 each. Besides, as a mark of addressing their undue hardship, workers in the unorganised sector including auto-rickshaw drivers will get 15 kg rice, 1 kg dhal, 1 kg oil free and ₹1,000 each. Pavement vendors will get an extra ₹1,000 each. Also, migrant workers from other States will receive the commodities in equal measure. For those migrant labourers who are without shelter, community halls/marriage halls are being utilised, where hot, nutritious cooked food is being provided, apart from medical facilities.

The nationally acclaimed State initiative, “Amma Canteens”, which provide meals at subsidised rates, will serve the needy. Keeping in mind the well-being of Anganwadi children, dry ration for 15 days is being provided in advance to families to meet nutritional requirements. Those under isolation are also provided with nutritious and vitamin-rich food. Senior citizens, who are being served by Anganwadi centres, will be provided food at their places of stay.

I have announced an additional two days wages to cover those rural households which are dependent on their employment under MGNREGA for their livelihood. Around 1.5 lakh pregnant women who are due in the next 60 days are under close monitoring. Necessary steps have been taken to provide medicines for the next two months to patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, HIV and TB.

Ensuring physical distancing

The failure of many advanced countries in handling the pandemic has given us enough wisdom not to take the lockdown lightly. Since India has a large number of densely populated urban areas, the world is watching us to know how we are going to tackle the deadly virus.

However, to make this happen, the singular message of social distancing should percolate to every individual citizen. Several effective communication materials have been circulated in the media and displayed in all the public places highlighting the necessity of isolation and staying at home. The State government has a dedicated website (https://stopcorona.tn.gov.in/) to pass on verified and valuable messages. Severe legal action is being taken against violators and those spreading rumours on the spread of the infection and its treatment.

There are several initiatives to increase the number of field functionaries to create awareness and to monitor the home quarantine individuals; as on date, around 38,809 volunteers have registered themselves and the count is increasing every day.

For active enforcement of the lockdown and to address the important issues , we have constituted 11 co-ordination teams with senior-level IAS officers. I have also constituted a State-level task force headed by Chief Secretary to monitor the preventive measures.

Using video-conferencing, we are frequently reviewing the District Collectors for effective and timely implementation of all the steps. With all the schools, colleges, shopping malls, and cinema theatres closed, adequate supply of daily basic necessities including groceries, agricultural products, milk and medicines are being ensured. Petrol bunks will operate till 2.30 p.m. Only parcel services are being allowed from restaurants. Call centres are operating 24x7 to offer assistance. I have also set up a ‘Crisis Management Committee’ in all districts under the chairmanship of District Collectors, with representatives from the Chambers of Commerce, private hospitals, NGOs and other stakeholders. I have directed all the Ministers to coordinate prevention and treatment aspects in the districts.

Energising the economy

It is the responsibility of State governments to ensure the welfare of the poor and the vulnerable. Like many State governments, Tamil Nadu too has also announced relief packages. The Centre has supported these measures with its Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana relief package. The timely intervention of the Reserve Bank of India in announcing liquidity and interest rate reduction measures will also help the economy. However, the economic impact of this unprecedented lockdown is likely to be very severe and State governments will suffer substantial reductions in tax and revenue receipts. A lot of measures will have to be taken to revive economic growth and to stimulate consumption and investment demand. The Centre should help the States continuously in this regard. To overcome this crisis, I have therefore written to the Prime Minister, requesting the Centre to allocate a special grant of ₹1-lakh crore to all the States including ₹9,000 crore to Tamil Nadu; relax, as a one-time measure, the fiscal deficit norm of 3% of GSDP for 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 and permit, during 2020-21, additional borrowing of 33% above the previous year’s level.

At this juncture, our priority is to fully focus on the eradication of the pandemic. After achieving this primary goal, I hope the country as a whole will join hands and provide the necessary thrust to the economy.

Nothing could be so inhuman, irresponsible and sadistic than banding helpless, stranded and harassed migrant workers together and then spraying disinfectant over them (Page 1, “Migrant workers given mass disinfectant bath in Bareilly”, March 31). Even animals are not treated this way. Already the government is found to be at fault for having enforced a lockdown without providing enough time for people to reach their homes and providing them necessary transportation. It is after almost a week that State governments are moving to provide shelter and food for stranded migrant workers. It is least remembered that it is this unorganised section of the workforce which is the real wealth creator. Those who are responsible for this shabby act, made even more graphic in the picture with the report, need to be dealt with accordingly to repose confidence in the minds of the vast section of the working class.

An opportunity

The lockdown should be used as an opportunity by civic authorities to clean all public spaces such as roads, pathways, parks and improve the condition of towns and cities.

The effort of keeping cities and towns clean should be continued as an ongoing process in all States. People violating such efforts should be warned and fined. Also, all stray animals such as cattle and dogs (which seem to have taken over the roads and become aggressive) should be taken to suitable shelters away from cities and towns.

Lockdown woes

Most citizens are aware that the national lockdown has been declared with the purpose of breaking the transmission chain. They are also aware an exception has been made to help people move out to buy essential commodities. However there are quite a few instances of some policemen on duty on the main roads, blocking the public when they are out to stock up on things for the house. In some cases, they are not even ready to listen to “genuine cases” and resort to humiliating the person on the road. In spite of assurances by officials that there should be verification on a case-by-case basis, some policemen are unwilling to do this. Will the authorities concerned look into this?

It takes years to master Kalaripayattu, says Ajith Kumar T of Maruthi Kalari Sangham at Mudavanmugal. He does not want his students to lose momentum with the martial art because of the lockdown. “There are moves one can practise without direct supervision of an ashaan (trainer),” he says. Taking the ‘Penkaruthu’ (woman power) programme that it introduced last year, the Kalaripayattu school has now tied up with the Kerala State Youth Welfare Board (KSYWB) for online classes.

The series, titled ‘Athijeevanakalathe Penkaruthu’ is available on the Board’s YouTube channel, KSYWB Official, where lessons on the basic moves of the art can be accessed. “These are mostly 10-minute videos demonstrated by a few of our students, laying out fundamental exercises and chuvadu (moves) in Kalaripayattu,” explains Ajith, who provides the voice-over instructions. These are the basic moves, he reiterates and there is no use of weapons in it, he says. Maruthi Kalari aims to put out a video a day till April 14.

C S Suchith of Buddha Kalari, Anayara, feels a little differently about instructing a complete beginner through video classes. So he offers them only to his present batch of students. “We primarily rely on WhatsApp where the students send me instant videos of practice sessions and I respond promptly through voice messages,” he says. However, the sessions are limited to only basic moves to avoid injuries and incorrect learning and are conducted under the supervision of a guardian, he clarifies.

Gym trainers and fitness consultants are putting out handy work-out videos. Sandy Nair is one of them with his YouTube channel, Dr Sandy Nair that he started in 2007. He confesses he was not very active on it and had just seven subscribers. But now, post lock-down, he has 196 subscribers! An assistant professor at the Department of Physical Education at NSS College, Pandalam, Sandy is also a fitness consultant, and strength and conditioning coach. He has begun posting regular fitness videos.

He says, “I am a fitness consultant at Fascino Fitness ad Performance, Vellayambalam. While most of my clients have shifted to paid online training sites since the self-quarantining period, some of them requested me to post videos they could follow that didn’t require any equipment. I decided to post it on my YouTube channel so that it’s accessible to anyone.”

On his videos, Sandy starts each workout with a warm up “It’s important to do a few warm-up stretches before and after a workout.” His videos also include demos on the right way to do push-ups squats, circuit training, Swiss ball exercises and so on. His seven-minute long ‘Workout with trainer Sandy’ videos are intensive. “I am planning to introduce workout for children as well as for the elderly soon,” he says.

Sandy’s sister, Shaly is also a fitness instructor. A computer science engineer, she says holding online coaching for class 12 students gave her the idea to begin online exercise sessions for her clients. She says her clients are anything between 25 and 75 years of age. She does sessions for groups thrice a week and also holds one to one classes for a few of her clients.

Shaly’s hour-long sessions are a combination of Zumba, aerobics and high-intensity interval training. She shares them via Skype. And just like regular classes, she keeps a close eye on her to see if they are keeping up with her moves. “I tweak the steps if they find it challenging and check to see if everyone is keeping up with the rhythm.” She is considering going daily as many of her students have been clamouring for her to do so.

For those who are into yoga, the city’s Sivananda Yoga Centre at Enchakkal has taken to ‘Facebook live’ sessions for the practitioners.

“Our instructors take online classes through Facebook live from our social media page every morning, and it is open to everyone. We also rely on the video-conferencing app Zoom where one-on-one interaction is required,” says Yashpasl Singh Rawat, Director of Sivananda Yoga Centre.

Hungry Wheels, a company by army veterans, was set to launch ‘electric mobile restaurants’ when the COVID-19 pandemic displaced those plans.

Vikram Sood, CEO, Hungry Wheels, says: “However, over the last four days, we have been sending our vehicles out for delivery. We have tie-ups with two companies that have large FSSAI-approved kitchens (one with a capacity of 15,000 meals a day and the other 8,000 meals a day). One is for people who are used to having slightly more expensive food so the dishes are about ₹80 each. One dish is a meal for an entire family (two adults and two children). On the other side, we have lime rice and so on for about ₹38. The trucks have gone to Rest House Road, Kammanahalli, Halasuru, Whitefield and Old Airport Road. The police have given passes for two vehicles.”

Stating that he is a Food Safety Officer, Vikram adds that the company follows a stringent auditing process.

Hungry Wheels has now created a Community Food Volunteer programme. Under it, FSSAI approved and audited kitchens (home chef networks, caterers, and so on) can sign up. They will then be audited by the Food Safety Officer from Hungry Wheels.

Says Vikram, “It is not like an e-commerce plan. We are calling upon communities to identify/nominate or become a Community Food Volunteer. The role of the volunteer will be to help the elderly in the community, neighbours, staff and so on. Collect orders one day in advance, update order sheet, facilitate digital payment by the buyers to the food company, confirm delivery to one pick-up point, informing buyers of pick-up time and helping those who need the food. We plan to start this in Chennai and Mumbai as well.”

383,2020/04/01,Longest-running US cooking series ‘America’s Test Kitchen’ shoots season 20,"There are cooking shows hosted by celebrities, some of whom may know a fricassee from a frittata, and also shows that feature arrogant chefs and bad cooks. There is even an upcoming digital series in which blindfolded chefs get smacked in the face with a dish and compete to identify and make it.

Then there is the gimmick-free America’s Test Kitchen, in its 20th season of expertly guiding viewers through well-vetted steps for savory sauces, perfectly grilled fish and flaky pie crusts, among the 1,000-plus recipes it has demystified to date. Also on the menu are reviews of a range of ingredients, from anchovies to baking chocolate to pasta, as well as cookware.

No need to sample more than a half-dozen styles of yogurt, including Australian and Bulgarian, because America’s Test Kitchen has done it for us. Being practical, not trendy, has its benefits — it boasts of being the longest-running U.S. cooking series (Japan’s Today’s Cooking, which debuted in 1957, has it beat internationally).

The show’s unwavering focus explains its success, said Jack Bishop, chief content officer for America’s Test Kitchen and on-screen host of the product comparison segments.

“There’s a lot of food content on television and on video platforms, especially in either the competition genre or in the travel genre,” Bishop said. This is the first and foremost show that helps people to cook.”

The average weekly audience is 2.25 million, holding steady and even climbing a percentage point or two in the past two years. Meanwhile, the show has expanded its reach — and appeal — online, with a YouTube subscription channel whose audience includes cooking-curious young men who hadn’t discovered the series on TV, according to the America’s Test Kitchen company.

The company publishes the Cook’s Illustrated and Cook’s Country magazines, which are ad-free like the public TV series.

Recipes are tested dozens of times by more than 50 full-time cooks who are aided by a panel of some 40,000 home cooks. The goal is to create a reliable blueprint that can be followed by viewers

It all happens in the vast, industrial-looking kitchen in Boston seen on TV. Taping on this season’s 26 episodes were completed before the Coronavirus epidemic forced a widespread shutdown of TV and movie production.

“All the research we do about the shows indicates people like to just turn it on and spend time with us,” Bishop said. “We actually like each other. I’ve done the shows since day one. I’ve known Bridget since 1998, Julia since 1999, and Adam (kitchen equipment expert Adam Ried) since, I think, 1995.”

There are talking points but no scripts or prompters, Bishop said, which means that viewers are getting accomplished chefs and other experts sharing their knowledge in a relaxed way.

Perhaps the biggest change over the years can be found in the recipes themselves. When America’s Test Kitchen launched, there was an emphasis on traditional family fare that mom or grandmom made. That interest has all but evaporated, Bishop said, and people instead are choosing to re-create the dishes they enjoy when eating out.

“They want to make Thai food, Mexican food, Italian food, and do it well. So the recipe selection has really evolved over the 20 years of the show and reflects the audience tastes,” he said.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/uit2kh/article31226003.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30MPTVAMERICASTESTKITCHEN,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/longest-running-us-cooking-series-americas-test-kitchen-shoots-season-20/article31226004.ece
384,2020/04/01,"Positive mother, six-month-old reunited","30-year-old moved from Kasturba Hospital close to baby boy in Jogeshwari

In the isolation ward on the eighth floor of Jogeshwari’s HBT Trauma Care Hospital, a small cabin is sheltering a young positive COVID-19 patient: a seven-month-old boy who had travelled with his parents to Dubai.

On Monday, the boy’s 30-year-old mother, who was the first to test positive, was shifted to Jogeshwari from Kasturba Hospital so she can continue breastfeeding him. The duo is now in the same cabin along with one more positive patient.

Breastfeeding crucial

Skin-to-skin contact with the mother and breastfeeding is crucial for the growth of babies. “The doctors have allowed me to breastfeed. Since I am not producing enough breast milk, we are feeding him formula milk too,” said the mother, adding that the baby has not developed any symptoms so far.

According to the mother, they had been planning the Dubai trip for long and had decided to go after the baby turned six months old.

“It was a four-day trip,” said that mother, adding that they returned to Mumbai on March 10 and directly went to her maternal home in Bandra (East). The baby’s father, who runs a business, resumed work and also paid a few visits to their Byculla home. When she developed a slight cold, they decided to go to Kasturba Hospital and get tested. She then tested positive on March 26.

Soon, the civic body began contact tracing spanning in H East and E wards that cover Bandra (East) and Byculla areas.

While the baby’s father and maternal grandfather tested negative, the baby, his grandmother and aunt tested positive on March 28 and were admitted to the hospital in Jogeshwari. “I requested the doctors to shift me so that I could be close to my baby,” said the mother.

According to the World Health Organization, women with COVID-19 can breastfeed if they wish to do so. “They should practise respiratory hygiene during feeding, wear a mask where available, wash hands before and after touching the baby, and routinely clean and disinfect surfaces they have touched,” the WHO states.

According to Dr. Tanu Singhal, an infectious diseases expert from Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, breastfeeding is important for the babies to thrive. She said, “In this case, since the mother and child both are infected, there is no point in denying the nutrients from breast milk. Even otherwise, the WHO guidelines state that COVID-19 positive women can breastfeed.”

3-day-old youngest patient

A three-day-old boy and his mother from Ghatkopar have tested positive for COVID-19, making him the youngest patient in the city. The baby was delivered at a local hospital where a patient with respiratory distress was admitted. He later tested positive. The baby and mother have been shifted to Kasturba Hospital

Nurses demand PPE

Meanwhile, the nurses at HBT Trauma Care Hospital have demanded full personal protective equipment (PPE) kits. The nurses said they have no reservations in carrying out with their duties during the health emergency, but they want to ensure their own safety as well.

The nurses submitted a letter with their demands to the hospital’s medical superintendent on Wednesday.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/positive-mother-six-month-old-reunited/article31231416.ece
385,2020/04/01,Court grants bail to doctor accused of illegal abortion,"Accused offered to serve the needy

The Aurangabad Bench of the Bombay High Court has granted temporary bail to a doctor, accused of causing the death of a woman after performing an illegal abortion on her, and directed him to offer his services in Aurangabad in the fight against COVID-19.

The doctor’s bail was rejected by the Aurangabad sessions court on January 23 this year. A single Bench of Justice T.V. Nalawade on Monday was hearing an application filed by Dr. Suraj Rana on March 30 seeking temporary bail on the grounds that he would serve the needy in society.

Despite complications, Dr. Rana performed the surgery on the woman on July 21, 2017, following which she died. The Pundlik Nagar police arrested him in August last year and he has been in jail since August 10.

He was charged under Sections 314 (death caused by act done with intent to cause miscarriage), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender), 203 (giving false information respecting an offence committed) and 120b (punishment of criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.

The Bench granted him bail on a bond of ₹15,000 and directed him not to tamper with the prosecution witnesses in the case.

The court also directed him to approach the dean of the Government Medical College and Hospital in Aurangabad and submit an undertaking that he is ready to discharge services.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/court-grants-bail-to-doctor-accused-of-illegal-abortion/article31231384.ece

Patients needing to visit hospitals or doctors could also make use of the services apart from bank officials and those associated with the stock market, the company said in a release.

For ease of commuting, Everest Fleet has asked passengers to provide valid documents to prove that the travel is essential, as specified under the government’s guidelines.

The documents can be uploaded at the site https://jarvis.everestfleet.com.

For the safety of passengers and the drivers, the company had made available face masks and hand sanitizers in each of the cars. Only two passengers were allowed per car to maintain a safe distance.

“These precautionary measures are being taken to keep both the drivers and passengers safe while commuting,” the company said.

Started as a pilot through a WhatsApp broadcast by a handful of people to various known groups a few days ago, the Everest Fleet team had received a large scale response, it said.

The company’s team is now reaching out to banks, hospitals, and government institutions to provide commuting assistance to the staff who continue to support the city and its citizens during the lockdown.

Siddharth Ladsariya, Co-Founder Everest Fleet said, “We wanted to help with whatever resources we have. We sent a WhatsApp to our network of friends and family to see who needs help with transport in the current lockdown. We have been overwhelmed by the initiative people took in sharing this message with those who really need a safe and easy way to commute.

387,2020/04/01,IIT professors modify app to monitor people,"SAFE App sends alerts once in five to 10 minutes to those advised home quarantine

Two professors with the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay) have modified an application used for tracking students’ attendance to now keep a check on quarantine adherence.

Professor Bhaskaran Raman and Kameswari Chebrolu of the Computer Science Engineering department of IIT Bombay had originally developed the application five years ago to solve the problem of keeping track of around 700 students without wasting too much time.

Professor Milind Atrey, dean of the Research and Development Centre of IIT Bombay, said, “The application has been modified by a team led by the two professors and can be used by officials to keep a track of the people required to stay under quarantine. The application is called SAFE App and is capable of sending alerts once in five to 10 minutes to those advised home quarantine.”

Prof. Atrey said the users, who are under quarantine, are required to respond to the alert immediately by sending a selfie. The location of the person is also tracked through WiFi and Global Positioning System (GPS).

“The alerts can be scheduled or random. We have approached a lot of State governments along with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and a few of them are interested in the application, but due the chaos caused by the coronavirus it has been difficult to conduct meetings over this issue,” he said.

The professor believes that the app will work as people will not leave their phones at home even if they do step out.

“Not only does the app track the location of the user, but they also need to respond immediately to the alerts that can be sent every few minutes. This will ensure that a strict check is kept on them. A single server can keep a check on about 1,000 people at a time. The signal coverage can be increased or decreased as per the requirement of a specific area,” Mr. Atrey said.

The application can hold all the information of users and ensure complete confidentiality. The IIT-B team is willing to provide its services free of cost to the government to help deal with the pandemic.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/iit-professors-modify-app-to-monitor-people/article31222581.ece
388,2020/04/01,"Bimbisar Nagar, Dahisar slum in lockdown after five test positive","BMC disinfects both areas, monitors people for symptoms

Part of Bimbisar Nagar in Goregaon and Ambavadi slum in Dahisar (East) were sealed off on Tuesday after five people tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has disinfected both the areas and is monitoring residents for COVID-19 symptoms.

Worli Koliwada was the first area to be under total lockdown on Monday.

At Bimbisar Nagar, a resident who had returned from the U.K. was found positive along with two others.

A woman in her 20s had returned from the U.K. earlier this month. When she was screened on arrival, she did not have any symptoms and was advised home quarantine. Late last week, she developed symptoms and visited a local doctor who advised her to get tested. She then went to Hiranandani Hospital, where she was found positive on Saturday. Soon after, her father and brother also tested positive.

“There are nine high-risk contacts in this case who were tested. Of them, the results of four have come. Her mother and a domestic help tested negative while her father and brother have been found positive. Results of the rest, including that of the doctor, are yet to come,” said Devidas Kshirsagar, assistant municipal commissioner of P South ward.

On Tuesday, a large part of the colony consisting the building was declared a containment zone, and was locked down. Police personnel were deployed there, barricades were placed, and nobody was allowed to go in or out.

“We are now going door to door, looking for anyone with the slightest symptoms. People are coordinating with us to report any symptoms. The entire area was disinfected. The objective of the lockdown is to make sure nobody else comes in contact with them,” an officer from the ward’s public health department said.

The three confirmed patients have been admitted to a hospital while the other seven are in quarantine.

Two in Dahisar slum

On Tuesday, Ambavadi slum in Dahisar (East) was also locked down after two members of a family tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The slum is part of Valmiki Nagar.

A person in his 60s, who had travelled to Nashik recently but had no history of foreign travel or contact with a COVID-19 patient, became the first confirmed case from the slum. His daughter-in-law was also found positive. Both have been admitted to Kasturba Hospital.

The 11 other members of the family tested negative but as a precautionary measure, they are being kept at Ambedkar Hospital.

“After this person returned from Nashik, that city reported its first positive case of COVID-19. We are checking if the two are related. Otherwise it might be a case of community transmission as there is no other source,’ said former Shiv Sena coporator Abhishek Ghosalkar.

Sandhya Nandedkar, assistant municipal commissioner of R North ward, said, “The person had travelled to Nashik in public transport, so it seems to be a case of community transmission. He had no foreign travel history and had not come in contact with any known coronavirus patient.”

Meanwhile, there is panic in the densely packed slum considering the close living quarters. The BMC has disinfected the area.

389,2020/04/01,"Now, flying squads to trace contacts","CM reviews city’s preparedness at meeting, requests private doctors to continue running their clinics

Following Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s direction, a flying squad was set up in each of the 227 wards in Mumbai to trace contacts of COVID-19 patients, and also to look for those with pneumonia-like symptoms. The CM on Monday held a meeting with officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) via videoconferencing. Cabinet Ministers Aaditya Thackeray and Anil Parab were also present.

After the lockdown in Worli Koliwada, and considering how densely populated the city is, the CM ordered the formation of flying squads with immediate effect. Each team will consist of officials from the BMC, police, revenue department, and health department. The move will expand the scope of testing as more contacts and more symptomatic patients will be tested.

Mr. Thackeray also reviewed of the city’s preparedness. “For people’s convenience, we had allowed shops to run round the clock. But if people are found misusing it to roam on the streets, we will have to discontinue that,” the CM said at the meeting.

Late on Tuesday night, the CM said, “If there are foreign travellers who have not yet got themselves tested, then they should come forward. There was a list of countries published by the Centre initially. Even if they have travelled to the countries not listed by the Union government and yet not tested themselves, then they should do so now.”

He asked the citizens to not hide any symptoms of cough, cold and fever. “There are a number of private medical practitioners who have closed their establishments for the time being. I appeal them to open them and treat patients with illness other than cough, cold and fever. Only government doctors will check patients with these three illnesses.”

Mr. Thackeray, while asking citizens to avoid cold drinks, air conditioners and cold water, said these measures are not to curb the novel coronavirus. “But this is to avoid falling ill because of cough and cold. It will unnecessarily increase the burden and anxiety of all.”

Meanwhile, BMC Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi has ordered all private doctors and pathology labs to continue to operate to reduce the burden on public health infrastructure. All patients should be screened at the outpatient department level. The private hospitals will continue to operate at routine level and if they are found to be shut, the administration can take action against them under the Epidemic Diseases Act. Besides, the BMC will be requisitioning private flats, lodges, and hostels to use them as quarantine facilities.

390,2020/04/01,Police chief reaches out to citizens through Twitter,"Commissioner fields queries on lockdown, isolation, essential services; police win praise for dedication

Police Commissioner Parambir Singh on Tuesday went ‘live’ on Twitter, answering questions from Mumbaikars in real time to clear their doubts about the lockdown in the city.

From 3 p.m to 4 p.m. on Tuesday, Mr. Singh fielded queries through his official Twitter handle, @CPMumbaiPolice. Responding to multiple questions about the lockdown, Mr. Singh said, “We are ensuring strict enforcement of the lockdown orders and legal action will be taken against those violating it. We request Mumbaikars to cooperate with us.”

Asked what steps are being taken to ensure that the lockdown orders are followed, he said all the locations are being monitored by closed circuit television cameras, patrolling vans and drone cameras.

Replying to a bank manager who complained about being pressurised to vacate his house by society members as he is required to go to work every day, Mr. Singh said, “Banking is an essential service. No one can force you to vacate. Please approach the local police station. Appropriate legal action will be taken.”

He said doctors do not need to provide any extra pass in case they want to travel for emergency cases, and their identity cards are enough.

A large number of people were concerned about refuelling of their vehicles in case of emergencies and voiced concerns like petrol pump attendants claiming that only vehicles carrying essential commodities would be given fuel, which Mr. Singh categorically denied. People also raised concerns about their elderly parents living alone, and were advised to get passes from the nearest police station as well as limit their visits to the bare minimum.

Mr. Singh also clarified that no orders have been given by the Mumbai Police to limit the working hours of grocery shops from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. “Shops selling essential commodities are allowed to stay open for 24 hours. We are recommending to housing societies to place collective orders from the nearest vegetable and grocery shops and that a few people collect them for all,” he tweeted.

The interaction also threw up gratitude and appreciation towards the police for their tireless efforts.

“All police personnel and their families are following the lockdown guidelines and health norms assiduously. They have been provided with adequate medical supplies and equipment to protect themselves from getting infected,” Mr. Singh said.

He advised citizens to immediately report to the police any attempt at rumour-mongering or capitalising on panic.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/q3x2jc/article31222547.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1BMPARAMBIRSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/police-chief-reaches-out-to-citizens-through-twitter/article31222542.ece
391,2020/04/01,"Mumbai civic chief orders private doctors, pathology labs to resume operations","Municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi has ordered all private doctors, pathology labs to continue to operate to reduce the burden on public health infrastructure. Besides, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will also be requisitioning private flats, lodges, hostels if required to quarantine those advised so.

Since the lockdown, many city doctors had shut down their private clinics as patients with flu-like symptoms were flocking in large numbers. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had made repeated requests to these doctor to continue to operate so as to ensure that public hospitals are not overburdened. However, so far, at least two city doctors and three nurses have contracted novel coronavirus while several health care staffers have been quarantined after they were found to have come in contact with those patients. This led to panic among city doctors.

Mr. Pardeshi has now ordered private hospitals, clinics, pathology labs to continue to operate. All patients should be screened at the OPD level. These doctors will have to refer patients with symptoms like fever, cough to designated COVID-19 hospitals. Only those without these symptoms should be allowed inside the private hospital. The private hospitals will continue to operate at routine level and if they are found to be shut, administration can take action against them under the Epidemic Diseases Act.

Also, after a person is home quarantined, he or she is expected to stay away from other members of the house and even have a separate bathroom. But considering that might not be possible in small houses leading to exposure, BMC has decided to utilise spaces that are lying vacant. Therefore, assistant municipal commissioners can now requisition empty flats, lodges, hotels, dharamshalas, clubs, exhibition centres, colleges, hostels, dormitories, residential cruise ships, marriage halls, and gymkhanas, among others to quarantine people.

The civic body has also marked 146 containment zones in the city from where positive cases have been reported. Residents of these zones will not be allowed to go out of the area and will be provided all essentials.

“The doctor’s daughter had returned from the U.S. on March 16 and was home-quarantined, of which he did not inform the PMC. In the information that we received from the immigration department, we learnt about his daughter who was home-quarantined,” said PMC deputy municipal commissioner Sanjay Shinde.

As per the rules, if doctor has a home-quarantined family member with whom he is in touch, he too should be home-quarantined and should not come in contact with anyone else, he said. “He had not informed us about his daughter and continued to treat his patients even after coming in contact with his daughter.”

Dr. Mohite, a paediatrician, had 12 patients in his hospital who continue to be in the hospital with staff. “We have asked the patients to be discharged one by one and said no new patients should be admitted.

In two raids conducted by separate units on Monday, the Mumbai Police Crime Branch seized large caches of hand sanitisers and face masks allegedly being hoarded to be sold at increased prices to capitalise on the novel coronavirus crisis.

The first raid was conducted on Maulana Azad Road in Madanpura on Monday evening by the Crime Branch Unit III after police inspector Nitin Patil received a tip-off saying three-ply surgical masks were being sold at ₹25 apiece, instead of the ₹15 fixed by the government.

“Acting on the information received, we raided the a room in the Patra Chawl in Madanpura and arrested Aquib Ansari (22). We seized 1.22 lakh three-ply surgical masks from the room, worth ₹30.52 lakh,” a Crime Branch officer said.

Mr. Ansari has been charged under the Essential Commodities Act and is now being interrogated on the source of the masks.

The second raid was conducted in the Sakinaka area by Unit VII, based on a tip-off received by police constable Deepak Khare saying a large quantity of hand sanitisers was being hoarded by people who did not have valid licences.

“Accordingly, we raided Synergy Hygenic Corporation on 90 Feet Road in Saki Naka on Monday where sanitisers, manufactured by a company called Oshine, were being stored in unhygienic conditions in large quantities,” a Unit VII officer said.

The police seized 1,362 bottles of 500 ml capacity and 360 cans of five litre capacity from the spot, collectively worth ₹22.13 lakh.

A communication issued by IIT-Bombay Dean, student affairs, Professor A.K. Suresh, said, “Apparently there is stuff circulating on WhatsApp about a relative of a hospital staff having been tested positive for Covid-19. I have had a detailed discussion with the Chief Medical Officer about this, so that there is no unnecessary panic.”

Professor Suresh informed the faculty and students that the person in question had himself not been abroad. “He is likely to have contracted the infection on March 12 or earlier, at the workplace, again from a secondary contact. He last visited our hospital OPD on March 17 for some non Covid-like symptoms, for a blood test and is being treated in an outside hospital since March 26, during which Covid-19 infection was suspected. BMC took his samples and a positive result on the test came in on Monday,” Professor Suresh said.

The faculty and students were informed that the person is currently doing fine without any fever, but is being kept in the hospital since it requires two negative test reports before he can be discharged.

“The IITB hospital has taken all appropriate steps according to standard protocols in tracing his contacts during his March 17 visit and asking them to be on self-quarantine just as a matter of precaution, although by that date, all protocols were firmly in place and whoever saw him in the hospital was wearing necessary protection.

Sources said he was admitted at the rural hospital on March 28 and his samples returned positive on Tuesday. The victim worked in a Thane factory and had no international or domestic travel history.

He said, “We have placed five personnel under observation at Kasturba and six have been asked to be in home quarantine. These are GRP personnel who have been in contact with him in the past few weeks.” Officials said they have made a list of 32 officers who may have come in touch with the constable since March 15.

Senior officials from the Railway Protection Force (RPF) said they had been informed of the development and checked within their department if anyone had come in contact with him. “There has been no one who has come in contact with him. However, we have alerted everyone to immediately inform us if they feel any symptoms,” a senior RPF official said.

The constable lived with his family in Kalyan and worked at a GRP police station in south Mumbai. He had joined the force in 1990. Till date, 36 people have tested positive in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, of which around 10 are from the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation.

Vashi man tests positive

Meanwhile, a 52-year-old resident of Vashi and two others from Nerul tested positive for COVID-19 on Monday. The Vashi man was in touch with the secretary of the mosque who was in direct contact with a 68-year-old Islamic scholar from the Philippines, the index patient in Navi Mumbai, who had tested positive on March 13. The secretary had hugged the Filipino scholar when he visited the mosque, along with nine others, between March 10 and 12. It has been confirmed that the scholar had attended the Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi. The scholar succumbed at Powai’s Hiranandani Hospital on March 22. The secretary’s son, grandson and their house help later tested positive.

“The man was at home itself since lockdown. He had come in direct touch with the secretary while he took him to medical stores. He has 10 more persons in his house and all are ready to get tested and are under home quarantine,” NMMC Chief Annasaheb Misal said.

Two cases in Nerul

The second new case from Navi Mumbai is a 32-year-old man who was in touch with a positive patient. “The patient was employed at BKC. His boss was an international traveller and his colleague was found to be positive,” NMMC chief medical officer Balasaheb Sonawane said. From March 16 to 20, he had gone to his office at BKC. On March 21, he had worked from home and on the next day he didn’t work as he had fever. Till March 26, he continued to stay at home as he had fever. On March 27, he got admitted to Vashi General Hospital and was transferred to Kasturba Hospital the next day and was placed under isolation. On March 29, he was transferred to Raheja Hospital after the report was confirmed to be positive and is said to be stable now. Meanwhile

The third new case is a 38-year-old suspected to have a travel history. NMMC was alerted by Kasturba Hospital about the positive case, but the corporation has not been able to find the history of the patient. The family of the patient is said to be in home quarantine. The Nerul police have alerted residents of the area to be vigilant.

Currently under NMMC, 659 are in home quarantine, 80 in institutional quarantine at Sector 14, Vashi. As many as 113 travellers have completed the 14-day quarantine, while six of them are in isolation wards in Vashi General Hospital. The number of positive cases is 11, while 32 have tested negative.

398,2020/04/01,An online storytelling event for children to start on April 6,"An online storytelling event for children will be held by Bengaluru-based Theatre for Change. The stories will revolve around the nine rasas

Bengaluru-based Theatre for Change has something special planned for children, starting on April 6. “We decided to float an initiative on the nine rasas (emotions) that is a mandatory requisite for theatre art. Professional storytellers and actors across the globe come together to narrate stories (first person/outsourced with personal anecdotes) on the nine emotions: shringara (love/beauty), hasya (laughter), karuna (sorrow/loss), raudra (anger), veera (courage), bhayanaka (terror/fear), bibhatsya (disgust), adbhuta (surprise/wonder) and shantha (peace/tranquillity),” says Sujatha Balakrishnan, founder of Theatre for Change.

For the online event, which will be held over a week, starting at 6 pm on April 6, actors will record a video on one rasa, in which they will tell a story as well as include personal anecdotes. Storyteller Vikram Sridhar will introduce the event. Parvati Ramchandran, an actor from Mumbai, will tell a story on karuna, which will introduce children to loss/sorrow in a beautiful way. Artistes such as Abhishek Iyengar, Pooja Tripathi and Mimansa Ojha will also be a part of the event. “I have also roped in the nurse Sunitha, who is from Spandana Senior Care; she takes care of my mother. She is a prolific Kannada poet and she will be penning down a poem on anger, which she will perform for the event,” says Sujatha.

Speaking on why she chose to do an event on the rasas, Sujatha explains: “As a society we do not address all the emotions with the fear of them not being in the best interest of a child. To quote from what the actor Parvati says: This is very similar to Howard Gardner's multiple intelligence theory which says we focus only on the maths and language skills leaving the others behind. Interpersonal skills, for instance, is similar to karuna, which is compassion/sorrow/loss and which is the need of the hour for children to contribute to this pandemic. It is believed that fear is not in the best interest of a child and so we seldom talk about it. This results in over protectiveness that is detrimental to their development. Psychologist Emma Kenny argues that scary stories, like nightmares, are a sort of dress rehearsal for real-life fear, helping kids learn to cope with the emotion in a low-stakes environment. Sociologist Margee Kerr, a “scare specialist” who studies fear, says frightening experiences can be a helpful tool in developing confidence and can be a boost for self-esteem.”

The event will be held on Theatre for Change Facebook page. Sujatha hopes that the event will connect with children across borders. “We will also be sharing the videos with organisations working with less privileged children. Our message is “indoor or outdoor, theatre art will always open a door for fun learning.”",children,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/hpazy2/article31227036.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Mimansa-Ojha,https://www.thehindu.com/children/an-online-storytelling-event-for-children-will-be-held-by-theatre-for-change/article31227039.ece

402,2020/04/01,"CPI(M) demands direct relief for daily wagers, street vendors","The government’s announcement of ₹2,000 as direct cash transfer to the bank accounts of all cardholders is hardly adequate to meet their requirements, said party secretary R. Rajangam

The Communist Party of India (M) has urged the Puducherry Government to provide a overall package to daily wagers, street vendors and those from the unorganised sector in the wake of the current lockdown due to COVID-19.

In a memorandum addressed to Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi, R. Rajangam, secretary of CPI (M) said the government should come to the aid of daily wagers and provide them with direct relief.

“The government’s announcement of ₹2,000 as direct cash transfer to the bank accounts of all cardholders is hardly adequate to meet their requirements. The amount should be disbursed immediately,” he said.

Mr. Rajangam said that neighbouring States like Tamil Nadu and Kerala had increased the allocation of essential items through the Public Distribution System (PDS) and have initiated steps to ensure widespread coverage of the needy sections.

The Puducherry government should also emulate them and provide them with direct relief at the time of this crisis, he said. The government should immediately intervene and ensure that the Central allocation of rice and other essential commodities is provided to them without further delay, he added.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/cpim-demands-direct-relief-for-daily-wagers-street-vendors/article31225670.ece
403,2020/04/01,Cuddalore police launch ‘Stay Home Stay Safe’ campaign,"The video has already gone viral on a social networking site and has over 16 lakhs views and has been shared 38,000 times so far

‘Stay Home, Stay Safe’ is the new mantra in a video released by the Cuddalore district police. Finding that the cooperation from the people to the repeated calls made by the police to stay at home to contain the spread of COVID-19 is not forthcoming in full scale, the police have come out with a video clip to convey the message of safety during the pandemic.

The video has already gone viral on a social networking site and has over 16 lakhs views and has been shared 38,000 times so far.

In the 1.20 minute video clip shot by the Social Media cell of the Cuddalore district police, the rank and file of the force starting from Beat constables, Sub-Inspectors, Inspectors and senior police personnel are seen appealing to the locals to stay at home on the grounds that if only people stayed at home, the police also would be safe and return to their places with the satisfaction of providing safety to the society.

Superintendent of Police M. Sree Abhinav said the police hit upon the idea to make the video clip after the locals failed to adhere to physical distancing. In spite of the situation, the police are running to remain on duty. However, the lack of cooperation from the public has been discouraging, he said.

“People have been coming out of their homes even for unnecessary reasons. We tried to explain to them to stay at home for their own safety and not to put at risk the safety of police, volunteers, health and municipal workers who are on the field to contain the spread of the pandemic.” There is a mistaken notion among the locals that the men in khaki like to enforce the lockdown. This is not true. The police have to make arrangements, supply food and ensure the well being of the personnel during the lockdown, he said.

The police also have to check on over 6,000 residents who had returned from abroad and are in self-quarantine. If given a chance, the personnel too would prefer to stay at home. The more people come out of their homes, the more we have to increase the strength of the personnel, he said.

Cases booked for defying the prohibitory orders will remain even after the lockdown is lifted and this would only reflect on those applying for government jobs, passport and visa applications. People should bear this in mind and stay at home to break the infection chain, Mr. Abhinav added.

404,2020/04/01,COVID-19: Two more positive cases in Puducherry,"The patients are asymptomatic and are being looked after by a team of doctors at the Government Hospital for Chest Diseases, Gorimedu, officials said

Of the three persons from Ariankuppam in Puducherry, who returned from attending a religious conference at Nizamuddin in New Delhi, two have tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday.

The patients, aged 37 and 51, are asymptomatic and are being looked after by a team of doctors at the Government Hospital for Chest Diseases, Gorimedu, Director of Health and Family Welfare Services S. Mohan Kumar told The Hindu.

The test results of the third person from Ariankuppam is expected any time. The three were traced and kept under isolation on Tuesday after reports of a large number of people who visited the Islamic centre in the national capital getting infected, he said.

“All three are asymptomatic even now. They returned to their village on March 24. We have started contact tracing from Tuesday itself,” he said.

According to a government source, three more persons hailing from Katterikuppam, Thirubhuvanai and Thiruvandarkoil who returned after attending the conference at Nizamuddin have been traced. Two of them have been kept at the isolation ward in a private medical college and the other at the Chest Clinic. Their throat swab was sent to Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research for testing to check for COVID-19, the source said.

Three more persons, two from Karaikal and one from Yanam, who attended the religious function have been traced and shifted to the isolation wards, the source said.

With two more testing positive, the total number of COVID-19 cases in the Union Territory has gone up to 3.

405,2020/04/01,Real Kashmir coach Robertson yearning to return home,"Stranded in Srinagar, he wants to attend to his ailing mother in Aberdeen

David Robertson has faced his fair share of challenges in his three years as head coach of Real Kashmir Football Club, but the latest predicament may be the toughest one yet.

Having endured through the security lock down and communications blackout imposed in Jammu and Kashmir last year, Robertson is now stranded in a Srinagar hotel on account of the ongoing lock down to tackle the coronavirus pandemic threat.

With commercial international flights suspended, Robertson, son Mason (who plays for Real Kashmir FC) and wife Kim are waiting on the United Kingdom government to employ evacuation measures to take them back home to Scotland.

Give support

The Robertson family is particularly worried about David’s mother, who was recently diagnosed with cancer. “My mother, who lives in Aberdeen, just finished her second chemotherapy session. If anything were to happen, it would be just horrible. I want to be close to her — to support her at this tough time. My dad is caring for her, but he is not in the best of health either. My siblings drop off groceries outside their home. It’s a tough situation, all over the world,” Robertson told The Hindu from a Srinagar hotel run by Real Kashmir co-owner Sandeep Chattoo.

“We’ve contacted the British High Commission in New Delhi to help us return home. It could be a few days, few weeks — it is a case of sitting and waiting. We also have (English winger) Kallum Higginbotham, four players from Africa and a few U.K. coaching staff with us here in Srinagar. All foreigners are facing a similar situation,” Robertson, a former Rangers FC and Leeds United player, said.

Tougher to handle

Robertson stated that the latest restrictions have been tougher to handle than the security lock down and communications blackout.

“It is never easy in Jammu and Kashmir. That’s why I keep coming back — there are so many challenges to tackle. Last season was tough (due to the security lockdown and communications blackout), as we did not have internet and could not call home. But at least the team was together, and we could play football,” Robertson said.

Grateful to owner

The 51-year-old is grateful to Chattoo for his support. “Chattoo is staying here with us in the hotel. He is away from his family as well. There are around 20 hotel staff with us here; no one is allowed in and out. We’re all helping each other. There is a lot of responsibility placed on Chattoo. He’s doing everything possible to keep all of us comfortable,” Robertson said.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/pr1ai2/article31230128.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02DAVID,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/real-kashmir-coach-robertson-yearning-to-return-home/article31230129.ece
406,2020/04/01,Start-up founded by SASTRA alumnus designs innovative kits,"They can help healthcare professionals to fight COVAD-19

Having developed a cost-effective respiratory product for the country's defence personnel earlier, a biomedical research and development start-up founded by an alumnus of SASTRA Deemed University has approached the State government with innovative kits it has developed for the country's fight against novel corona virus.

The efficiency of the products: AURA Dokat (to deployed in the isolation wards to support doctors and paramedics), CURA Dokat (Autonomous robot with UV light tower to disinfect hospital beds and environment) and CURA Docket (to disinfect the novel coronavirus using UV light), products developed along with two other start-ups was explained by V. Pragadeeswaran, Founder and CEO of Aries Biomed Technology, Coimbatore, to senior officials of the Health Department.

As a pioneering company to manufacture unique products for biomedical testing and validation, the start-up company that came into being during 2015 had developed and manufactured mobile handy turbine-based resuscitation units for Defence Bio-Engineering and Electro Medical Laboratory (DEBEL) Research and Development unit of DRDO.

The autonomous robots helps in reducing exposure risk to medical personnel and improving efficiency. Running along photosensitive strips on the ground to carry trays of food and medicines, the robots equipped with optical and magnetic sensors know where to stop, and returns to the origin after the task is completed.

The CURA Dokat has proved more effective in sanitising entire rooms, especially on door handles and shadow areas, significantly reducing population of microbes under five minutes.

The UV-disinfectant robots can be used to sanitise hospitals, emergency medical service vehicles and isolation wards. The rays are detrimental to microorganisms. There must be no person in the room when the robot is activated, Mr. Pragadeeswaran, who had completed M. Tech in Biomedical Engineering in SASTRA Deemed University said.

Incubated in PSG-STEP facility, the start-up funded by Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council and Department of Science and Technology, had tied up with Katomaran, another start-up specialising in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, to develop the innovative products to deal with novel coronavirus.

The start-ups had in recent years designed emergency transport ventilators and anaesthesia ventilators.

“There is no need for sophisticated ventilators to treat COVID 19 patients. A basic model with the required functionalities could be manufactured cost-effectively even for ₹1,000 to 1,500 per unit, when manufactured on a large scale,” Mr. Pragadeeswaran said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/start-up-founded-by-sastra-alumnus-designs-innovative-kits/article31231345.ece
407,2020/04/01,Rations to be supplied at doorstep of quarantined residents,"Financial assistance of ₹1,000 will also be given to them

Elaborate arrangements have been made for supply of PDS rations at the doorstep of family cardholders living in quarantined streets of Kumbakonam.

The COVID-19 financial assistance of ₹1,000 for rice card holders will also be distributed to them along with the provisions.

While tokens have been issued to family cardholders to draw the financial assistance from PDS outlets, the cash will be distributed to people residing on Madhappa Lane and other nearby streets that have been quarantined, Collector M. Govinda Rao said in a release on Wednesday,

The streets have been closed to public movement since a resident of Madhappa Lane tested positive for COVID-19. Along with financial assistance, the ration for the families in the streets will also be distributed from April 2 to April 15.

As far as other areas of the district are concerned, distribution of financial assistance will be made at PDS outlets for 100 smart cards per day.

Retail markets

Meanwhile, the Kumbakonam Municipality has set up temporary vegetable retail markets at 25 places in the town in order to prevent crowding at wholesale vegetable markets on the border of the municipality near Dharasuram and at Palakarai within the town.

Further, the vegetable vending unit of Chandrasekarapuram Cooperative Wholesale Market in Kumbakonam has also taken up mobile vending of vegetables in the town.

408,2020/04/01,Manapparai-Vaiyampatti belt building workers in dire straits,"A week after the nationwide lockdown for containment of the novel cornavirus came into force, several thousands of construction workers in Manapparai-Vaiyampatti belt have their fingers crossed as they have are left with no money.

Absence of agricultural activity in the region has dealt a double whammy.

The labourers who used to make a living by working daily at construction sites in Tiruchi city and suburbs have now been pushed into a situation of complete dependency for livelihood on the government relief of ₹1,000 per family card holder for the lockdown period for containment of novel corona virus.

The curtailment of train services had dealt a severe blow to their livelihood. The workers used to avail themselves of the utility of the season tickets for to and fro travel to Tiruchi and back. The construction sector in Tiruchi has always been entirely dependent on the passenger train service between Tiruchi and Dindigul.

“It is because of the presence of workers from the Manapparai-Vaiyampatti belt that the construction industry in the city has not found the need to employ work force from the Northern States,” Babu, a building contractor, said.

Though the government has taken steps to ensure farm activities are not affected, it has meant precious little for the daily labourers. For, the farming sector in that region is in a dire crisis. The lockdown has meant that the farmers have no option but to helplessly let the flowers they have cultivated on thousands of acres to wither away on the fields.

Unlike in the case of agricultural crops, the flower cultivators are required to incur heavy costs for electricity. In fact, the flower cultivators pay hefty amounts as deposit for securing power connection, Muthukrishnan, a flower trader said.

The farmers spent as much as ₹2.70 per sapling from the nurseries in Hosur for raising the flower crop. But, all have gone waste.

Private loans

In fact, a good number of farmers abandoned agriclture and took to construction work after the Gaja cyclone caused destruction to their standing crops. With only hope for better times in their minds, the farmers mobilised the money by pledging jewellery and raising private loans at exorbitant interest rates to raise the crops.

There is no scope now to extricate them from the debt trap. There is a huge possibility of penury claiming lives in the Manapparai-Thuvarnkurichi-Marungapuri belt, a farmer observed.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/manapparai-vaiyampatti-belt-building-workers-in-dire-straits/article31231330.ece
409,2020/04/01,Volunteers feed hungry street dogs in Tiruchi,"The canine population on the streets across Tiruchi city is now getting fed, thanks to a group of animal lovers.

The main source of food for the dogs is usually roadside stalls and tea shops. With none of them functioning, the canines have been having a hard time.

Now, a 30-member volunteer group cooks food and crisscrosses the length and breadth of the city to feed the starving street dogs. The initiative was started by G. V. Karthik, an animal rights activist who has been feeding about 15 to 20 street dogs near his house during the lockdown.

He realised that the plight of all dogs across the city would be similar. He pitched his idea to Citizens Forum chairman M. Sekaran, who welcomed it. “With his help we were able to scale up our efforts,” the activist said.

Mr. Sekaran applied and acquired ID cards and permission required for volunteers to travel around the city and feed the dogs during the curfew.

A total of 50 kg of rice is being fed to nearly 600 dogs along with discarded chicken pieces bought from poultry stalls.

“The smell of meat draws the dogs. They eat well because of it,” Mr. Karthik said.

Funds for the food are contributed by the volunteers themselves.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/69in1/article31231319.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY02-DOGS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/volunteers-feed-hungry-street-dogs-in-tiruchi/article31231320.ece
410,2020/04/01,Pat for moratorium,"Farmers representatives have welcomed the State government’s announcement of moratorium for agriculture loans taken through cooperative societies. At the same time they urged the government to consider waiver of these loans in view of the financial stress being experienced by the farmers due to the COVID-19 virus pandemic.

In a statement, the president, All Farmers Organisations Committee, Tamil Nadu, P.R.Pandian welcomed the announcement but also pointed out that farmers were finding it difficult to take up regular farming activities in view of the virus scare.

Further, the ryots were unable to get their horticulture produce such as banana, watermelon, mango and vegetables marketed due to the nation-wide lock down as the transporters and traders fear movement of perishable commodities during this period could not be achieved in time.

He had also demanded that the financial assistance of ₹6,000 per annum to farmers extended through the Pratan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana be provided as one-time payment considering the problems faced by the farming community.

Stating that farmers who have taken up pulses cultivation were unable to harvest the same, the State Vice-president, Thamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangangalin Koottamaippu, R.Sugumaran said that only waiver of crop loans would help farmers wriggle out of the debt trap. Already non-availability of farm hands and non-availability of fertilizer have jeopardized the summer cultivation, he added.

While welcoming the announcement, the president, Nasuvini Riverbed Farmers Welfare Association, V.Veerasenan, however, said the announcement lacks clarity. Because, a farmer who takes agriculture loan from a society has to repay it in lump sum with interest once he completes the harvest. At the same time those who had converted their agriculture loan as a long term loan would also be repaying the loan on instalment.

Thus, asking the borrower to repay the loan with interest after three months would not bring any succour to the farming community, he said and demanded waiver of the entire loan or at least the interest part of the loan should be considered by the government.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/pat-for-moratorium/article31231311.ece

412,2020/04/01,"Customers, shops and officials try to get their act together","Queues continue to be seen at grocery stores, pharmacies and vegetable shops, even as efforts to maintain social distancing are under way

Medical shops in the city have a beeline of customers amid apprehensions over stocks running out and possible extension of the lockdown.

“A majority of our customers who take daily dosage for conditions such as hypertension or diabetes are buying medicines for a month. Normally, it is only for a week or two,” said a pharmacist at a chain outlet in Thillai Nagar.

The buying spree also includes medicines for cold and fever, he added.

The long queues are mainly the result of fear that the medicines may run out of stock, said K. Deepa, a customer and resident of Thennur. “It is the beginning of the month and medicines will be available. However, it is possible that they may run out later. So, why take chances,” she asks.

Another customer, M. Pushpa, a resident of Puthur, attributes her presence at a medical shop to apprehension that the curfew may not be lifted as scheduled on April 15.

“My father has sufficient medicines to last him at least until the lockdown ends, but he wants me to buy additional quantity. With the number of coronavirus cases increasing, he thinks that the lockdown will not be lifted soon,” she says.

K. Manoharan, president, Tamil Nadu Chemists and Druggists Association, assures of steady supply of stock. “Since medicines are essential commodity, there will be no shortage. While an artificial paucity may be created by hoarders, we have enough stock to handle the situation,” he says.

Some shops have fixed a cap on purchase to curb shortage. “We are not allowing customers to buy medicines for more than a month,” he says.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/twmeoj/article31231294.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY02-MEDICINES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/customers-shops-and-officials-try-to-get-their-act-together/article31231295.ece

414,2020/04/01,Aavin maintains procurement level,"Private dairies reduce purchase due to restrictions in movement of transport

Despite difficulties in marketing dairy products due to the lockdown, Tiruchi Milk Producers Union — popularly known as Aavin — has decided against scaling down procurement from milk producers.

According to official statistics, Aavin has marginally surpassed the volume of procurement when compared to the corresponding period of last year.

As on Wednesday, the daily procurement stood at 4,26,000 litres. It was 4,24,000 litres on the same day in 2019. The average milk procurement hovers around 4.2 lakh litres for the last one week. Since many of the private dairies reduced procurement due to restrictions in inter-State and inter-district movement of transport, milk producers, who had so far been supplying to them, diverted it to Aavin.

“We make sure of procuring daily milk collection from the farmers associated with our member societies. It will not be reduced,” said C. Karthikeyan, Chairman, Tiruchi Milk Producers Union, Tiruchi.

As a special step, he said it had been decided to explore the possibilities of procuring milk from other farmers. Steps were taken to draft them under Primary Milk Producers Co-operative Socities.

R. Suman, General Manager, Aavin, Tiruchi, said the supply of milk to various institutions, hostels and hospitals had declined as all of them had closed down. However, sale of milk through agents for domestic consumption had gone up for the last one week. It increased to 1,15,000 litres as against 1,09,000 litres a day. Before the lockdown, milk for domestic consumption was supplied twice a day. It had now been restricted to once a day. The agents were asked to complete sale of milk before 9 a.m.

Besides local sales, two lakh litres of milk was being sent to Chennai daily. About 60,000 litres was sent to Aavin’s milk powder plant in Tiruvannamalai. The remaining quantity was being sent to Erode for its milk powder plant, Mr. Karthikeyan added.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/2hw92w/article31231260.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY02-AAVINMILK07,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/aavin-maintains-procurement-level/article31231261.ece
415,2020/04/01,Complaints of glitches in door delivery system,"It is a week since the Corporation announced phone-in orders and door delivery of groceries, but the social distancing measure has been hit by glitches.

Six major private grocery chains, GRO Mart, Kaveri Super Market, Femina Shopping Mall, Reliance Retail, Kumudham Departmental Store and Pothy’s Super Market, were shortlisted under the scheme and their mobile and landline customer service numbers publicised through social media. Customers were advised to place their order by phone from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and allow a day for delivery.

However, shoppers continue to throng the markets for groceries and fresh produce due to lack of response to phone calls. Shortened working hours — 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. — have added to the frenzy.

“The larger difficulty has been to figure out which shop is open and what items are in stock,” S. Lakshmi, a resident of Ramalinga Nagar, told The Hindu. “One of my medicines has to be taken with skimmed milk. Since it comes from another State, the stocks are low now.”

Also, shoppers are made to wait outside before being allowed inside in small groups. Only some stores have made seating arrangements, forcing others to stand in the sun for a long time.

“Once you go in, there is panic among buyers, as store personnel ask you to make the purchases quickly because there are other customers waiting for their turn,” said a shopper in Cantonment. “Even though tokens are issued, many jump the queue,” he rued.

There are complaints about shortage of products such as bread, readymade batter, yoghurt and feminine hygiene products. Those with small children at home also point to lack of recreational items on sale as most stores have closed down their novelty and stationery sections.

Big fruit and vegetable vendors are seen functioning a little beyond the stipulated time. “Although we are supposed to close by 2 p.m., it can take longer as everyone has to be properly billed,” said a counter clerk at a leading store with a long line of customers.

However, phone-in delivery has largely been trouble-free for customers ordering meat and chicken, especially after poultry and eggs were declared to be safe for consumption.

Personal shopping has become a challenge for those with the elderly and infirm under their care. “I live with my aged father, who usually walks down to buy fruits and vegetables. But I am afraid to send him out now. On the other hand, I cannot leave him unattended for long at home while I am out shopping,” said K. Kalaivani, a local resident. “His medicines are have become difficult to purchase because of the rush in pharmacies.”

Telephone calls from The Hindu to the designated stores for their reaction went unanswered.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/complaints-of-glitches-in-door-delivery-system/article31231247.ece

As many as 2,000 beds were added to isolation wards at several hospitals in the city, in the wake of a fresh wave of COVID-19 cases.

The overnight addition of beds was necessitated after the State recorded 43 cases in a single day on Tuesday, with all of the cases directly linked to a Tablighi Jamaat meeting held in Delhi recently.

In Visakhapatnam, 62 persons have been kept in isolation in the last two days as most of them had attended the meeting. Five persons among the 62 have already tested positive and officials expect the number to rise as all those who attended the meeting are believed to have been in close contact with each other at the meeting as well as during their journey home.

A 46-bed isolation and treatment facility was opened at GIMSR (GITAM) Hospital at Rushikonda on Wednesday, and a 100-bed isolation facility was set up at the NRI Hospital at Seethammadhara.

“Hospital officials have been told to discharge the existing patients and not to admit any new cases. In view of the social distancing norms, adequate space is being ensured between the beds,” Dr. P.V. Sudhakar, principal of Andhra Medical College, said on Wednesday.

“Isolation facilities have been arranged at Shraddha Hospital, St. Joseph’s Hospital and Apollo Hospitals at Ram Nagar. In all, 2,000 beds have been arranged at various hospitals for COVID-19 cases. The Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases (GHCCD) has a 100-bed isolation ward. A 50-bed facility will be set up the Government ENT Hospital for use, if required,” said Dr. Sudhakar.

“Maternal and child healthcare facilities are being offered at King George Hospital (KGH) and the Victoria Government Hospital (Ghosha Hospital). Children and pregnant women from private hospitals are also coming here as many private hospitals are extending COVID-19 services. A 20-bed ward has been opened at KGH as women and children with symptoms can be shifted there,” Dr. Sudhakar said.

Testing centre

Most of the equipment required for the setting up of a COVID-19 testing centre at KGH is ready.

However, one machine is still en route from Mumbai, with its transportation being delayed due to the lockdown. Once the machine is brought here, the testing centre will be up and running, officials said.

Emergency meeting

Meanwhile, an emergency meeting was held by KGH Superintendent G. Arjuna to review the preparedness of the staff and house surgeons.

It was decided to treat the existing and emergency cases with a skeletal staff. The Superintendent deputed 100 house surgeons and 100 staff nurses in addition to doctors to VIMS for COVID-19.

Dr. C. Jayaraj, Professor and Head of Department (HoD) of General Surgery, and Dr. P. Ashok Kumar, Professor and HoD of Orthopaedics, attended the meeting.

After examining the deal, rate negotiation and “discrepancies” in the survey numbers, it was deemed fit to cancel the allotment, the GO said.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/land-allotted-to-accord-university-cancelled/article31230393.ece
426,2020/04/01,A Coronavirus lockdown reading list by Samit Basu,"Staying indoors for a while? We have you covered. For your weekly Reading List, fantasy and sci-fi author Samit Basu recommends comfort reads by writers unparalleled in their genres, including some who inspired his own writings

Guards, Guards by Terry Pratchett

Sir Terry’s Discworld, a multicultural fantasy universe, was one of the primary inspirations for the world-building of my first novel. Guards, Guards! is the first book of the City Watch trilogy, one of the best entry points into Discworld. I wish Pratchett were still alive today — he’d have brought so much wisdom, empathy and humour to a world that really needs it.

Leave it to Psmith by PG Wodehouse

Wodehouse is very old-school nowadays, but this book has been a lifelong favourite. Reading it can still give you the same feeling seeing a dog GIF in the middle of a dozen terrible news reports can. I grew up on this.

The Fifth Season by NK Jemisin

NK Jemisin swept all the fantasy/scifi awards for all three books in the trilogy that begins with The Fifth Season. In a time of climate change and other earth-shattering events, it’s also extremely contemporary and relevant, even though it’s completely timeless and possibly alternate-world. It’s hard to write a truly new and epic fantasy nowadays, but she does it.

The Select Nonsense of Sukumar Ray translated by Sukanta Chaudhuri

Carroll, Seuss/Gissell, Nash, Lear: Ray’s children’s classics match the best of these masters, and his other works reveal an immense ability for dark satire, both political and social. A lot is lost in translation, but what resonates when you read the originals is a confidence very few other Indian storytellers possess.

427,2020/04/01,Urban wildlife spotting during COVID 19 lockdown,"While wildlife experts caution against fake news, the lockdown has certainly had a positive impact on urban wildlife. Now, birders take on a balcony safari as Bird Count India commences a 21-day lockdown birding challenge

A civet cat that slunk along a silent street in Meppayur in Kozhikode district a few days ago created a stir on social media. The video of the animal moving languorously through an otherwise crowded street junction was shared multiple times with a message that urban wildlife has started venturing out during the lockdown.

Some even called it the “critically endangered Malabar civet”, a species whose existence is still in question. As the video trends on social media, wildlife experts point out that the description accompanying the clip is incorrect. “First, the animal in the video is the Small Indian Civet, not the Malabar Civet. Also, the lockdown or the virus outbreak have nothing to do with the sick animal having strayed out into the open,” says Sandeep Das, research scholar at the Kerala Forest Research Institute and a research fellow at the Zoological Society of London.

The Small Indian Civet, which is commonly found in rural areas, is a nocturnal and shy animal that does not venture out in broad daylight. “The animal which was roaming the streets during the day was in distress and died soon after officials from the Forest Department rescued it,” he says.

21-day birding challenge Meanwhile, Bird Count India has commenced a 21-day lockdown birding challenge. Over 2,000 bird watchers from across Kerala will observe birds from their balconies or front/backyards of their homes for 15 days to one-month and enter their findings on the eBird platform. Birders from all over India are participating in the challenge, observing birds from their respective homes. “Documentation is happening in a systematic way,” says Nameer. Entries are recorded between 4 am to 6 am and 6 am to 9 am; then from 4 pm to 7 pm and 7 pm to 10 pm. Entries can be listed after 15 minutes of observation.

“The inputs will be analysed thoroughly at the end of the challenge and it may reveal some interesting trend in bird behaviour,” he adds.

Social media and misinformation are not strange bedfellows, but the COVID-19 crisis has just led to a profusion of such fanciful ideas, says Nameer PO, professor of wildlife, Kerala Agricultural University. The National Geographic described fake news about wild animals taking over human territory “as contagious as the virus itself”.

News of wild elephants parading through Wayanad town, dolphins by the Mumbai sea shore and peacocks strutting about through backyards, spreading their glorious feathers are all being attributed to the COVID-19 lockdown. It may be true that since fishing activity has stopped totally, dolphins do come closer to the shore. Peacocks usually exist in hot, dry areas and now that people spend their whole days and nights indoors, they are free to roam.

Another image of deer lazing on a road side went viral, and it was being circulated as a view of the Coimbatore-Ooty Road. Wildlife experts clarify that deer in the picture is the Wild Sika deer, found in Japan, which look very much like our spotted deer.

Positive impact

“The lockdown would definitely have impacted the urban wildlife. All of a sudden, noise pollution has reduced, air quality has improved and traffic has practically come to a standstill. This change would certainly have impacted them in a positive way. However, it is too early to arrive at conclusions without having studied animal behaviour in detail,” says Sandeep.

Urban wildlife is a broad term that includes animals such as the Small Indian Civet, mongoose, jackal, jungle cat, toddy cat, (Asian Palm Civet), squirrel in addition to a number of amphibians, reptiles and birds, which have learned to coexist with humans.

“In all likelihood, it is just that people didn’t have time to observe all these creatures that co-existed with us before,” says Nameer. “Now that people find themselves with a lot of time on hand, they are looking at these creatures with new found interest.”",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/i6vqcr/article31228050.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02mpabhilash,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/covid-19-lockdown-not-all-news-of-urban-wildlife-spotting-is-factual/article31228052.ece
428,2020/04/01,How you can bring the sparrows back,"N Dhanasekar of Coimbatore’s Chittukuruvigal Arakattalai Trust has some tips for the return of the once-ubiquitous bird

“I remember sparrows visiting our homes looking for grains and water,” says N Dhanasekar. The 38-year-old is the founder of of Chittukuruvigal Arakattalai Trust that has tried to bring sparrows back to Coimbatore. Besides awareness meetings, and camps at educational institutions and Government schools, the six-year-old trust also distributes nest boxes and bird feeders to homes and institutions.

Co-exist with birds

On World Sparrow Day (March 20), Dhanasekar spoke on All India Radio about sparrows and conservation. “The association between humans and the house sparrow dates back several centuries. Their nests dotted almost every house in the neighbourhood as well as bus bays and railway stations. They lived in colonies and survived on food grains and tiny worms,” he explains. Traditions also fostered the co-existence with birds. “For example, when my mother and grandmother used a muram to clean the rice and pulses, the little bits of grains and worms would fall to the ground. The sparrows fed on them. Now, our food grains come cleaned and packed off the shelves!”

House sparrows are indicators of biodiversity, he says. “Rampant use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides have wiped away the vital nutritious food of the sparrows. Only organic farming can bring them back in large numbers.”

High-rise buildings have also driven away the little birds away from the neighbourhood. “Modern concrete structures avoid provision that encourages nesting of birds. We have made RWH compulsory to get an approval for a new building. Similarly, we should encourage some space for the birds to nest too. It is important to introduce this culture among the public. Over time, it will become a habit, which is good for the environment, birds and the humans too,” he says.

Sparrow nests

Recently, Dhanasekar reached out to over 1,000 people who gathered for Kaanum Pongal festivities at Karattumedu village near Saravanampatti. “We put up banners on sparrow conservation and had a Q& A with the public on why the sparrows have disappeared from the cityscape. We also gave a demo on how to make a sparrow nest using discarded shoe boxes. We have to keep talking to people, especially students. It is an ongoing thing, spreading awareness. I also addressed a gathering at the Tamil Nadu Forest Academy on World Forest Day. ”

Dhanasekar has distributed over 2000 sparrow nests to the public. Made of pine wood, it is designed to provide comfortable nesting. It can be kept on terraces, windows and compound walls. “We have to ensure that the opening is just about 1.5 inches. This will stop other predators like mynas, shikras and crows from entering the nest.”

Sparrows often hop around greenery and marshy bushes. “When you have more sparrows in your home, it indicates that you live in a healthy environment surrounded by agricultural lands and a water source. Nurture native plants like moringa and hibiscus in your backyard to bring them back.”

Dhanasekar is happy that students and institutions want to be associated with the trust. It has also led to many sub-organisations that restore water bodies, promote green drives with native trees and in the process conserve birdlife. “We work collectively towards the common goal of conservation. Everyone is concerned about the environment. This is a healthy sign.”",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/7x4c7t/article31225404.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BIRDS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/n-dhanasekar-of-coimbatores-chittukuruvigal-arakattalai-trust-has-some-tips-for-the-return-of-the-once-ubiquitous-bird/article31225408.ece
429,2020/04/01,How couples in India are coping with the Coronavirus lockdown: chores and personal space,"A few couples are making use of the time during the COVID-19 lockdown, to knock down walls, build bridges, and forge stronger relationships

Weeks before the Coronavirus pandemic, Nishant Sinha, Hyderabad-based roaster was enthusiastic about a new business he and his wife had planned to start. “My wife and I are flying back tomorrow to Delhi,” he said. His wife Sheetal Saxena is looking to start her own venture. “Last night over dinner we discussed how we have become more business partners than a couple!” While the couple spends a considerable amount of time with each other, it is mostly doing their individual work, and less about talking house and home.

Cut to the lockdown announcement: Nishant was seen in a video on social media doing the dishes, while his wife videographed him, appreciating his housekeeping skills. Sheetal is heard saying, “Nishant, thank you for choosing to do utensils, as I hate this chore. This, however, is not enough and you will have to pamper me like always.”

Social media is full of memes and jokes on couples’ spending some downtime together. Shilpa Nainani, an emcee, says, “I thought things would be tough with us breathing down each other’s neck. One weekend or a week with each other is a totally different thing from being with each other for three weeks, minus help at home.”

Shilpa says she is amazed at how her husband, a lawyer, has swung into action and actually seems to be enjoying it. “He does the dishes, sets the table before and after food and basically does things that help me relax. We are also ending up doing our workout together and enjoying the time.”

What about fights? Says Sarita Bhavani, “We are mostly avoiding it because the kids are at home. My daughter now works from home and I don’t want her colleagues to hear us arguing about wrong placement of table mats or a misplaced tea cup. My husband is helping me in the kitchen to speed up work, such as organising everything after dishes are washed and final wipedowns,” she laughs. So how is Sarita keeping away from her kitty group and card parties? “We always make sure everyone eats together at the dining table. Plus, we are playing something that requires a lot of skill: Carrom,” she says, laughing.

A homemaker shares one simple rule to keep it all smooth. “Just ignore the mess. It is social distancing, so no one is going to visit us. I am not complaining anymore about an empty coffee cup in the front room or a shoe under the dining table, till this is over. Thankfully for me, my husband has agreed to manage the kitchen. That comes with cooking and cleaning utensils,” laughs Babli Mohan.

According to an expert...

Myriam Siddham, a psychologist and trainer, shares how couples can nurture their relationship during the lockown.

“If coronavirus does not kill us, we will definitely kill each other by the time this lockdown ends,” say a frustrated couple. Most people seem to be dreading this lockdown more because of the fear of domestic spats increasing.

However, there are ways to navigate through these difficult waters, and maybe also use this to your advantage to reconnect with your partner. Here are six ways to do it:

1. Respect boundaries: If one or both of you are working from home, decide on your workspots, and a common break time to chat and talk. While sharing common spaces, it is important to be sensitive towards one another’s needs, to reduce conflict. It could be things like keeping the volume under control while watching television or listening to music while the other is working, respecting the wish of the partner to have some downtime or letting them take a nap without disturbing them.

2. Decide on a routine: Making a list of chores and dividing the responsibilities and duties between each other would help. Cleaning, meal preparation, keeping children occupied could all be on the list.

3. Limit triggers: Once the routine has been decided, it helps not to remind the other person constantly about doing their part or how they should be doing their work. Arguments or disagreements start when people feel they are being ignored or not being valued.

4. Bond with children: Childcare tasks need to be planned too between the couple. If the children are older depending on the age they could be given age-appropriate tasks to keep them occupied. You could also use this as quality time with your children and talk to them, play games as a family or start a fun family activity together. There are tons of activity ideas for families online.

5. Reconnect: Planning some quality time together daily after work can be helpful. Since our social interactions are reduced to social media now, it is important to talk to one another. Pursuing a new hobby together, exercising together, watching a movie or cooking together could be some options.

6. Accept ‘me’ time: Everyone needs their own space and be on their own for a while. Respect that, be patient, compassionate, and respectful.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/r04swm/article31225677.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/couple-newjpgimage784410,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/how-couples-across-india-are-working-together-at-home/article31225682.ece
