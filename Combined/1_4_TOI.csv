1,['4/01/2020'],Veda Krishnamurthy: 2020 is exciting for women's cricket,"This story is from January 4, 2020

She’s an intrinsic part of the batting line-up for the Indian women’s cricket team. Bengaluru-based Veda Krishnamurthy has become the pin-up girl for many aspirants in Karnataka and India. She is excited about the upcoming 2020 T20 World Cup in Australia, where she says, “We have a lot to live up to, as the Indian women’s cricket team has announced that we are in it for the big haul.” Excerpts…

How does 2020 look for women’s cricket in general and you in particular?

2020 looks very exciting for women’s cricket. We have the Women’s T20 World Cup coming up this year, followed by the 50-over World Cup that will be held early next year. It is going to be a very busy and exciting year for us. There is a lot at stake, not just for those playing cricket and in the team, but for those who are vying for a spot to play for the nation.

As for me, I have ended the last year well, so I hope I carry forward the same form. Since the World Cup is very close, I hope to continue all that I’ve been doing for the past three-four months. We’ve got a core group with members who have been playing together for a while. I am hoping that everything works for us.

What is going to be India’s biggest strength at the 2020 World Cup?

That’s a tough question. I think our biggest strength are our spinners, they are superior compared to the teams across the world. Our spinners bowl most of the 20 overs, so if our spinners get it right, it will work the most in our favour. Given the fire power that we have in our batting, a good show by the spinners can help boost and complement that.

The camaraderie within the team is very important to keep the rhythm and chemistry of a batting line-up going. How do you girls bond when not playing?

If you see our social media accounts, especially Instagram , there is a lot of banter that goes on between us. We are always active, we all tend to comment when someone posts something new, which actually shows the bond we share. We are basically a bunch of youngsters, so there is so much energy off the field as well. For instance, if one starts to dance, the other 14 join in. If one sings, the other 14 do so too. We do almost everything together, it is natural and organic. In fact, I feel our bond off the field reflects on the field too. This is important for those who are part of a team, and this team shares that kind of bond.

Which is the team that our team is watching out for?

Any day, it is Australia hands down. They have been so dominating in the past few years and they are the defending champions playing in their home conditions. They are going to be our biggest competition. But, since it is T20, it is also about who clicks on that day. It depends on the performance on that particular day.

Is there anything you feel is required or not in place yet to give women’s cricket that extra push?

The ICC has done a good job of spacing out various events. We saw that with the 2017 World Cup as well. There was a lot of publicity. There were many hoardings and ads during the men’s Champions Trophy, which brought in awareness about the event. There was a lot of talk about women’s cricket too, there was a lot of crowd and a lot of people watched it even back home in India.

Now, since the next World Cup is happening in Australia, which is also a country where people love their sport, there is a lot of thought that is going into the planning of these events. Incidentally, our final match coincides with International Women’s Day. The BCCI is making sure all our games are televised, including those played at the domestic levels. They are putting a lot of effort to get the domestic scene right. Now, people are aware of the women’s cricket team and the fixtures. If one compares the 2017 World Cup to the upcoming T20 World Cup, people are aware that the match is happening in Australia. Awareness is half the battle won.

You have met upcoming players who are part of Karnataka’s women’s cricket team. What is the potential you see there?

We’ve got a very good bunch of youngsters. Karnataka has one of the few associations that train children right from the time they are about 10-11 years of age. They are trained to be a part of the under-16 games. There are a lot of youngsters to watch out for. At the same time, it is about them doing well in their age group, and continuing to perform well at the next level. That is the kind of potential selectors look for — they see who has the potential to perform well in the next level.

Off field appearances have been taking up a lot of your free time. Do you find it challenging to put in an effort towards styling yourself?

I’m getting better at that. Though, even today, if I am hanging out with my friends, you will find me in my joggers, t-shirt and chappals. But over time, I am also becoming more aware of what suits me in terms of outfits, hair and makeup. I am learning.

Writer, activist, anchor, and queen bee Apsara Reddy fills you in...Sources close to the actress say that she really wants to start a travel-related venture that includes ‘soul cleansing’, ‘spiritual road trips’ and ‘adventure experiences’. The lady, who has been doing a lot of rustic travel and spending most of her days in Auroville, is keen on getting this travel business off the ground.South India’s multiplex head honcho, who fought off the popcorn fans of a certain multiplex when her company took it over, is touring India with none other than Rajinikanth himself. This self-made single mom has won the Superstar’s heart, we hear. He ensures she has eaten and has told people on his team to take care of “thangachi”! The secret — she has never once opened up about her sadness or struggles and has worked as hard as anyone else.The son of a medical college university’s head honcho, Chef Anish, works at a popular hotel in the city and can’t stop impressing guests. So much so that a lady who went as a chief guest to his dad’s university spoke about his culinary skills during an event! The reason, when kitchens were closed and no orders were being taken, this chef went out of his way to feed a hungry pack of women who were manhandled at a city protest.Art gallery owner and social activist Meena Dadha, who is known for celeb-driven events held to raise awareness on the differently abled, has a legion of fans for her authentic Rajasthani food. A senior bureaucrat who visited their home recently was so impressed with her Papad Curry that he refused to take back some, but sent his wife the next day to learn how to make the dish.Ishari Ganesh’s New Year’s Eve dinner at his plush home in ECR saw the presence of a bevy of cine stars and loyalists. While the Nadigar Sangam election results have been withheld for various reasons, the significant few who turned up at his home assured him of their unswerving loyalty. A crowd even gathered outside his home to spot the celebs.Calling for an emergency meeting of her party pals, this young woman in the city, who works for a marketing agency, ensured she sent out teams of charged-up women to nab her cheating boyfriend. The fair-complexioned and rather chubby man is apparently two-timing this pretty lady with a skinny and sour-faced self-proclaimed industrialist and influencer who is also known for her foul temper at hotel lobbies when staff refuse to recognise her.

But within three months, the storyline changed and recently, Aarti was replaced on the show. Ask her whether the sudden change in the script has upset her, and she says, “Not really. These things happen in our profession, it is not unusual. A love track was planned between Dr Shashank Gupta and Roshni Mathur (Mohnish and Aarti), but it didn’t take off as the makers felt that it was not required and so, it was better that I do not continue with the show.”Producer Siddharth Malhotra shares, “It was unfortunate, but then everyone knows that such changes happen in TV shows. I did not want to waste Aarti’s talent and hard work because the focus is only on Sid and Ishani.”Meanwhile, Seema Pandey has replaced Aarti on the show.

And now, even as he’s busy filming it, the actor has signed his next — Pambattam . To be directed by VC Vadivudaiyan , the film will go on floors by the end of this month.“It’s a horror thriller, and we will start shooting by January 20,” begins the director, “The film will be shot in Chennai, Hyderabad, Kerala and Mumbai, among other places. It will be a solid visual treat for our audience because we’ve zeroed in on some very beautiful locations and will also be doing extensive CG work.”So, how did he rope in Jeevan? “He is one of those actors who would okay a film only if the complete script is ready. He believes in good screenplay. I narrated three scripts to him and he chose this one. I can say with confidence that the way the story will move, it will keep the audience on the edge of their seats,” he says.Vadivudaiyan , who’s also helming the multi-lingual Veeramadevi, says Jeevan has been doing a lot of home work for his role in this film. “There are a lot of action blocks in the film, and so, he’s been training hard and also attending workshops.

In a conversation with us, he spoke about plans to build a separate complex for Bengaluru International Film Festival, one wherein they can maintain archives to highlight of the glory of Kannada film industry as well as create small theatres at taluks across the state. Excerpts:Every year, a huge amount of money is spent on getting venues for conducting the Bengaluru International Film Festival. This expense can be reduced if we have a dedicated complex for screening the movies. When there is no festival, the venue can be kept active by carrying out film-related activities.Preservation of the works of legendary directors, actors, producers and technicians of the Kannada film industry is of utmost importance. When filmmakers from around the world come to Bengaluru, we should be able to acquaint them with the Kannada film industry. And if we have our archives in order, then all our delegates and visitors can see our contribution to world cinema. Plans are afoot to set up an advisory committee that comprises actors, directors and producers, who can suggest how we can take Sandalwood a notch higher.The academy is also planning to take content-driven films to smaller cities and taluks that have a population of more than 10,000. Many good films fail to reach smaller cities due to a lack of cinema halls. Building small theatres will also help develop the habit of watching quality movies among people.Budding filmmakers can use the academy as a platform to learn the nuances of acting and film direction. I have come across many young people, who are passionate about filmmaking, but cannot pursue it due to financial constraints. They also struggle to find the right guidance.

6,['4/01/2020'],We write lyrics that resonate with the current generation: Ratty Adhiththa,"Today’s songs are all about catchy lyrics. Cashing in on the trend is Na Kudikka Poren by singers Ratty Adhiththan and Sahi Siva . With over one million views and counting, the singers, originally from Jaffna, Sri Lanka, are pretty kicked about the response.Ask them about the making of this number and the story behind this catch phrase (also the title), Ratty, who resides in Paris now, says, “The title came about during a freestyle performance and I thought it would be a great Friday anthem song. It has a vibe that people can relate to and it is catchy. Hence, the name Naan Kudikka Poren. Cultural aspects are always hidden within our childhood. So, when making music we try to incorporate as much as possible into the hip hop elements of the music we make. The video was shot at various locations in France, particularly in Paris.” He adds, “I wrote the chorus and the rap verse, Sahi wrote my hook and second verse. Although we share elements of the creative process to ensure synchronisation, the song was sort of a work in progress over the last year.”Music is a powerful tool to send out important messages, especially in times of crises. Did they appreciate the usage of this catch phrase? “Truth be told, everyone drinks and it’s just something that people need to accept. We do not intend to promote any sort of disrespectful or harmful behaviour. We simply write lyrics that will resonate with the current generation. The response to the song is based on this resonance that they have with the song and the vibe it brings,” says Sahi, who resides in UK now.The genre of the number is varied... was that conscious? Says Sahi, “Fusion is something that we’ve always admired, and bringing together two different parallels of hip hop trap with the cultural elements, including the nadaswaram, worked out to be an extremely unique yet enjoyable. It’s something that we have explored and continue to explore in other songs, and with the right balance of both, the output will be great!”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73084554,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-868597/73084554.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/music/we-write-lyrics-that-resonate-with-the-current-generation-ratty-adhiththa/articleshow/73084554.cms

His feature film, Quota , has been selected for the PickurFlick Indie Film Festival Award December 2019. The film’s plot is about identifying and tapping the talents of underprivileged children who are denied opportunities due to their backgrounds.An elated Amudhavanan says, “The plot revolves around a talented child from a tribal hamlet who yearns to become a gymnast. But, his economic condition and identity are a huge deterrent to his dream. Though the film begins with a tribute to the tribal freedom fighter and leader Birsa Munda, it does not focus on a particular caste or tribe. The spotlight is primarily on how children from underprivileged backgrounds continue to struggle to achieve their dreams, when it shouldn’t be so. Why can’t every talented child get his/her due?”Amudhavanan’s maiden film Veruli was a thriller that dealt with potholes which became death traps. The director has shot Quota predominantly in a tribal hamlet in Mannarkad, Kerala. The star cast includes reality show talents and child artistes Bhavaz, Niharika and Aadhil.

8,['4/01/2020'],Gully is everything: Divine,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Dressed in his characteristic black leather jacket and a cap, Vivian Fernandes is a man of few words. But say the word gully, and the idolised rapper’s eyes light up. “Gully is everything. That is where my journey began and it is something that I keep going back to,” the rapper says, flashing a smile, as we pulled him aside for a quick chat at his recent Gully Gang concert in Chennai.

Known better by his stage name, Divine , the underground rapping sensation is one of the main forces behind catapulting regional hip hop to Indian audiences. His inspiring journey from the streets of Mumbai found a prominent appearance in Zoya Akhtar’s breakout rap drama Gully Boy , which was inspired by Mumbai rappers Naezy and himself. The Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt-starrer traces the journey of a rapper from working-class Mumbai. Rapping, to Divine, is all about expressing stories from his community. His work often reflects his own personal experiences, which help him strike a connection with listeners, he says.

Representing Bombay and its stories was one of the reasons why Vivian wanted to become a musician. “One of the reasons I became a musician is to tell stories about my gully to people. I had so many stories I had to tell about Bombay and that is how my journey with hip hop began,” he says. His introduction to hip hop, too, has an interesting backstory. He once spotted his friend from school wearing a t-shirt of American rapper 50 Cent. “That was my first taste of hip hop. I wanted to know more about hip hop and from there I never stopped,” he adds. While he first equated hip hop to English music , he eventually realised that hip hop was whatever anyone wanted it to be. “I always thought hip hop was supposed to be in English. But I later realised that it is more than that. Someone had to tell stories of communities from every nook and corner,” Vivian says, adding that hip hop has grown leaps and bounds since he started out.

Did Gully Boy propel more people to embrace the genre? “I think the Bombay hip hop scene was already thriving even before the film released. But the big screen experience in India is truly something else. The film definitely helped catapult the emerging hip movement across the country in different regions. It also gave people a peek into the lives of musicians like us and perhaps even made them want to find out more about hip hop artistes in their own community or locality,” says the musician.

Like it is with many other cities, Chennai, too, has an emerging hip hop scene, he observed. “Chennai’s hip-hop scene is exciting, like it is in many parts of the country. I have come to perform in Chennai before in a college, but this is my first ever big concert here,” he says, further fondly recalling his collaborations with Madurai rap ensemble Madurai Souljour and Sid Sriram. “I recently collaborated with Sid Sriram for this song Too Hype from my album Kohinoor. We had such a fun time. Madurai Souljour and I, too, teamed up for a video song. The south hip-hop scene is definitely something to look forward to,” he adds with a grin, before going on to serenade his fans waiting a few metres away.

I have been called Aadhi on many occasions and I decided that this new year would be a great time put a full-stop to this.

18,['4/01/2020'],Hurt Churchill Brothers eager to bounce back,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Panaji: Bernardo Tavares was really angry, and so were the rest of the players. The loss against Indian Arrows was unexpected and nobody could look at the Churchill Brothers FC coach in the eye.

In the dressing room, there was funeral silence. At the training ground the next day, the mood was no different, before the Portuguese coach reminded everyone that there is a tomorrow.

That tomorrow has come. But the challenge would be even stiffer as Churchill cross swords with East Bengal in an I-League clash at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Saturday.

Until that loss against AIFF’s developmental side – after taking the lead – Churchill had won two games in a row, including a convincing one against Mohun Bagan, away. The loss at home took away the momentum, and three crucial points, which might prove to be the difference in the end.

“It was disappointing, to be honest. We had 19 shots on goal, while they had just four and Arrows scored from two big mistakes of ours. We must look at that game like an accident. I know that the performance, particularly with shooting, won’t happen again,” Tavares told TOI on Friday.

For the last one week, Tavares has seen a noticeable difference within the team. “They are more focused and want to paint a different image of the team,” said the Portuguese coach, who believes that the character of the team is best reflected during times of crisis like this defeat brought.

“It won’t be any easy for us against East Bengal. In my mind, they are the best team, alongside maybe Mohun Bagan. They are first in the table, haven’t lost as yet and they have two players for every position. They are not just strong with their eleven (players), they have equally competent players on the bench,” said Tavares.

East Bengal coach Alejandro Menendez will be pleased with such glowing praise. They are the only undefeated team in the league, pulling themselves clear with two consecutive victories after the initial draws against Real Kashmir FC and Punjab FC.

“We come here with a lot of confidence. We come after winning games. We know that it’s a big game in this league and our idea is to win. I expect the team to show the same level like the previous games,” the East Bengal coach told reporters.

The visitors will be without defender Mehtab Singh and winger Pintu Mahanta, both of whom are suffering from chickenpox, but like Tavares pointed out, they should still have enough in reserves.

“I am sure that Churchill Brothers will come back even stronger (after the loss). They will put in more effort, physically and mentally. But I know we will compete. We need to negotiate tough games. We don’t expect any easy outings,” said Menendez.

19,['4/01/2020'],"Ranji Trophy: Vijesh, Sumiran put Goa on top","This story is from January 4, 2020

Panaji: Goa took a lead of 119 runs against Manipur on the first day of the Plate Division Ranji Trophy at the Academy ground, Porvorim, on Friday. Right-arm medium pacer Vijesh Prabhudessai stole the limelight with an excellent spell where he took six wickets for 14 runs in 10 overs as the hosts bowled out Manipur for 106 in 32.1 overs.

Goa were 225-2 as opener Sumiran Amonkar (115) hit the fourth ton of his career. Vaibhav Govekar (64*) and night watchman Amulya Pandrekar (4*) were at the crease at the end of the day's play.

Goa captain Amit Verma won the toss and had no hesitation in asking the visitors to bat first. The 22-year-old Vijesh found early rhythm as he got rid of opener Bonny Chingangbam when he edged a ball to keeper Smit Patel on the third ball of his first over. Sultan Karim (2) was his next victim as Vijesh shattered his wicket. On the first delivery of his third over, he trapped Akshaykumar Singh in front of the wicket for nought, leaving Manipur reeling at 3-5 in the fifth over.

Four balls later, Jayanta Sagatpam failed to break his duck when he gave an easy catch to Suyash Prabhudessai in the gully. The visitors were soon in deep trouble when they lost five wickets for five runs. Captain Kangabam Singh was caught behind by the keeper off Vijesh.

Vijesh was on a roll as he took all six wickets. He trapped Karam Dharmendra leg before wicket in the 10th over, the fourth batsman getting out on zero.

Allrounder Rex Rajkumar adopted an aggressive approach as he realised it would be futile to carry on as he hammered three fours in his 36-ball 21 before he nicked one to Smit off Lakshay Garg. Smit had a field day as he also caught Thomas Moirangthem (9) off Felix Alemao.

Opener Al Bashid Muhammed, who was holding one end while others fell cheaply, threw caution to the wind by hitting a six and five fours. In an attempt to score quickly, he tried to hit out captain Verma, only to find Lakshay at long on. He was the top scorer with 43 off 88 balls.

Last man Bishworjit Singh tried to do the same by smashing a four and a six before left-arm orthodox spinner Amulya cleaned him up.

With 57 overs to bat, Goa didn't take any chances and batted sensibly. Sumiran and Aditya Kaushik (34) brought up 68 off 17.2 overs before Aditya was caught by Sultan off left-arm orthodox spinner Ajay Lamabam.

Brie scores: Manipur 106 in 32.1 overs (Al Bashid Muhammed 43; Vijesh Prabhudessai 6-14, Amit Verma 1-15) vs Goa 225-2 in 57 overs (Sumiran Amonkar 155, Vaibhav Govekar 64*)

21,['4/01/2020'],Saif Ali Khan: I have never played a character as deranged as Udaybhan,"At a time when the Mughal era is dissected socially and politically every other day, Saif Ali Khan is playing a Rajput warrior who fought for Aurangzeb against the Marathas. The role was frightening, he says, since it was not only loud and dark, but the character himself is utterly deranged. Along the way, he explains his individual view of the Mughal era – he thinks Persianate is a more accurate description – but adds that he prefers to not enter the political conversation on it.On one level obviously, yes and everyone eventually reacts to the fact that it’s the Muslim invader story. Whether it’s Pakistan that becomes the villain, whether it’s the ISI, or the Mughals. But on another level, those are the only kind of antagonists we seem to have had. I mean, we could come up with other stories, but on a large scale if you think about war films, these are the villains, the enemy we have fought against. That seems to be the most dramatic. You could make a movie about the Chinese but somehow I don’t think it will resonate very strongly with our audiences (laughs).So, right or wrong, it becomes one of those things. And when you come to Tanhaji, Aurangzeb and Shivaji Maharaj had very bloody, serious encounters and that went on for quite a long time. So we look for heroes, and filmmakers look for heroes, and Tanhaji fits the bill in the perfect way, being the unsung right hand of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, fighting the autocratic, orthodox Aurangzeb. So that’s the story. Now how historically accurate it is, is another conversation. Whether people are fighting in the name of religion and independence, or whether there are more economic reasons that drive these things. History is obviously an argument that is told by the winner and the story will change depending on which point of view you take.Yes.I have read books that have defined Indian history and said that the west and the English are to blame, really for creating this idea of 'eras' because they divided history as per the classical age of Greece and Rome, and the Medieval Age and the Modern Age. And they wanted to classify Indian history as per the Hindu Age, that is the Classical Age, and the Medieval Age that is the Mughal Age, and the Modern Age, which is the British Age, really. So they created this framework, which is not necessarily how it was. And it is perhaps more correct to call India the Persianate Age rather the Muslim Age, because it was the language that was interactive and was the language of the courts and a lot of the country. And it was kind of the interaction with other cultures and other religions led to a great deal of – of what India is.It is a great time to make a movie about, from the kind of tortures, the intrigues, the murders, the kind of scheming and stuff that used to go on in these people’s lives; the struggle for power is the mark of a good story in itself. They had this drink called poust, which is an opium based drink that slowly drives people mad and robs them of their dignity and kills them, but it takes a couple of months. I read this disturbing story about how Aurangzeb imprisoned his nephew (Sulaiman Shikoh) in Gwalior and forced him to have this drink and he said 'paint his portrait every month because I want to see what he is looking like'.I have learnt stories of great military feats. Babur was supposed to be this military genius, you come across Akbar and Dara Shikoh and… actually these are very Shakespearean characters. Aurangzeb is very much like Richard III, he is this scheming king, who is very handsome in his youth but later on becomes a little crooked, that kind of thing. Dara Shikoh is Hamlet, he is miscast really for this kind of job. He is better off as a Sufi saint rather than the son of the ruler of Hindustan. Shah Jahan is like King Lear, and Jahanara and Roshanara are like Cordelia and her sister in 'King Lear'. And it goes on like this. And two books I read – one was 'The Peacock Throne ' by this guy called Waldemar Hansen and another 'The Last Spring'. And these are fascinating stories.Yeah, so I got a sense of you know, the politics of the time, the kind of art they encouraged and the inter-family complications and drama and you get a sense of that it is not really driven by religion, you know – they seem kind of really Indian, the Mughals, and they kind of really assimilated into the country.Yeah, there is a lot of propaganda and there is definitely a great story. But when you get into it and you read more correctly, and it might not be a popular story, but Dara, as I say, is miscast for this job as the ruler of Hindustan, and he is probably a very artistic and a very liberal person, but he is the wrong man for the job. Aurangzeb was a better general, more successful in the field. Dara was a mystic and a saint. If he had come to the throne, it would have been great, but it would not have worked out, in the sense, he wasn’t very good at the job, unfortunately. He was outmaneuvered.Om (the director) invented a very colourful villain; not a villain, an antagonist. Aurangzeb entrusts him to defend the fort against Tanhaji. The kind of back story that Om gave it and the kind of madness he created, it was a very new experience as an actor. We approached it in a very different way from how I have done anything before. And I have a tendency to try and underplay things, and he was like, no I want you to be much louder, which was very frightening because that’s new for me. And the hair and the clothes and Nachiket Barve, who has done costumes for the film, really made it into a spectacle!I don’t think it is the evil empire, but he is a slightly deranged character, that is for sure.Well, I have never played one quite so deranged before. And it was difficult, I told my mother and she said you be careful, don’t be too loud and make a fool of yourself. It can be quite dangerous to be like that. If I am doing something else, kind of healthy and normal, then it is great fun as a departure, but I don’t think I would like to do this very often. It is a little dark, to have that kind of… but it was fun, it is basically an energetic, happy character. What is deranged about it is that his energy level and his happiness level is not quite suited to the seriousness of what is happening. It was great fun, I remember feeling very happy, especially after the extremely exhausting experience of 'Lal Kaptaan', to just go to set in a very controlled environment perform something.(Laughs) No! I don’t think so, not at all! This was I think the most seasoned kind of acting. It was like breaking down a wall and finding yourself in a new room. I am really pleased with it. It is something that the director and I found together.You know, I do think about that when I am with Aditya Chopra and I see how he has his production, or when I was with the Rajshris and I saw how people respect that production. I think it is also because how in the 90s, people used to differentiate between work and home, and film people and regular people (laughs). That probably sounds wrong! Well, if I can be as elegant in my work as the Rajshris are or as the Chopras are, then I think of maybe a Pataudi Films would be a nice production thing. But I don’t know, I think I’ll go with Black Knight (laughs). I think for that maybe my father would have had to been a film producer, you know. The fact that he wasn’t, and that he was who he is, that means I don’t think I can ever bring his name into the movies. It has to be something else, I don’t know what. But… Pataudi Films? No.I think, in a country like ours, taking either stand sometimes can have different results than what happens normally in an environment where people can voice views and discuss stuff and life goes on. It is a slightly more volatile environment, where the impact of what you say is louder, and some people enjoy that impact, I guess. I am not sure that I do, so I am still trying to form my opinion. It is a very interesting time and a disturbing time and you hear a lot of things, on one hand. And you are wondering how the country is going to define itself. That’s on one hand. And honestly, on the other hand, and I don’t mean to offend anyone when I say this, I have never been happier living in my country. The kind of medical treatment that is available to me and my family, the education for my kids, the professional employment and the work I am getting, everything about my life in India is better than it has ever been. So, I am hopeful.Which is why I tend to keep quiet. Because I understand, that I am not only privileged, but my wants and desires are probably irrelevant to people with burning issues in a literally burning environment. So I get that, and I am quite happy with that. And I don’t feel disenfranchised with that. I do feel that I am absolutely way too privileged to really enter into that conversation with any relevant point of view.I would love it if Taimur could grow up just as a normal kid and be allowed to… Look, like you said we are really privileged and nobody is really complaining. I love the press, in fact the press has been very kind to move away from our house; they used to be stationed right opposite here. Yes, they do give him attention. Luckily, he seems to be very sweet and normal, and he has not gotten affected in some strange way by it. But I’d be the happiest guy if he were just an anonymous, normal kid. Why do people give kids so much importance, which they don’t really deserve? It’s frightening. I don’t know. I don’t know what to say. I would much rather, and he would much rather, be normal and ignored.Yes, he has told me! He’s like, ""No picture!"". And he starts frowning. He doesn’t like too much fuss. It’s not something he is excited about, for sure. But on the other hand, in a positive way, he does seem to make people happy. And he makes me very happy, because he is a cute kid. So I get it… because it’s an outpouring of affection and love. But unfortunately sometimes, in some public places when he goes to school, sometimes it can get a little crowded and that’s something he has grown up with. And it’s not something that any of us enjoy, but what to do?",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73085026,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1113039/73085026.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/saif-ali-khan-i-have-never-played-a-character-as-deranged-as-udaybhan/articleshow/73084736.cms

25,['4/01/2020'],"Gulzar: Don’t pity these girls. The acid has not scarred their ego, or their self-confidence","Ask Gulzar how he approached a topic like the one that ' Chhapaak ' deals with – a movie with a theme that is not music-friendly in the conventional sense – and he is, almost immediately, charged up, instead of the quiet and contemplative frame one had expected. That gives you a sense of the tone that his writing must have.“When I first heard of the story that Meghna was trying to tell, of these girls who have faced acid attacks at the hands of these men, how they have fought their battles, I immediately had a sense ki ek badi zimmedari ki baat kar rahi hai, society ki responsibility ki baat kar rahi hai. There is so much that the attacks try to do. Woh sirf chehra nahi bigaadte, chehre ke peeche jo bhavana hai, jo ambition hai, jo jeene ki arzoo hai, woh sab zakhmi kar dete hain.”So is he writing to reflect the sentiments of an injured victim, then? The response is quick and firm: No. “I was very clear, when I sat down to write, that these are not faces to be pitied, to be offered sympathy. Iss chehhre ke peeche jo koshish hai, jo zindagi hai, us ka samman karna hai. Chehre ki pehchan mitai hai, mere andar ki pehchan nahi miti – that is the sentiment they have. And so that is the sentiment that I have looked to express.”What is his take on the instinctive reflex on the part of survivors of such attacks to cover their face? “That is not a statement of them looking to hide. They have so much courage. They hide their faces because of how people respond to them. It is the people who need to be educated. They see the scars, but not the eyes – the eyes that are still bright with hope, with courage. Unki aankhon mein jo zindagi chamakti hai, woh nazar nahi aati unhe!”Right. What is the sentiment that he is communicating, then? “See, this is not a story about how this poor girl’s life has been destroyed. This is about the courage these girls have. 'Chhapak' inki ladai ki picture hai. Udasi aur mayoosi ki picture nahi hai. Taras nahi hai. Yeh ladai ki film hai – main aise hi ladoongi, jaisi main hoon! What is the spirit of these girls? It is this: Just because the acid scarred my face, took away my recognition, doesn’t mean I’ll give up. I am more than my face, but you have to look through my eyes to see it. With this face also, I am alive, and I am fighting.”Gulzar with his daughter, 'Chhapaak' director MeghnaDid the trigger for these thoughts come from what Meghna narrated, or from what he felt when he met them? “I have met them also. And this is not the first time I have met people fighting such battles, or understood their spirit. For these girls, of course, this has happened through Meghna since she has taken this topic for her film, but for some 25 years I have been working with Arushi (the NGO), with differently-abled children. I know what happens.”A pause, then, as if he is rewinding to the lessons learnt and the emotions absorbed there. “These girls, you know, I would hate it if someone calls them ‘these poor girls’. No! No poor girls. No becharis. Don’t pity them at all. They don’t need pity. They have their ego, they have their self-respect. And all that is intact. The acid has not ruined their self-respect or their confidence. It is the attacker who is defective, it is his mind that is handicapped. He needs to be taught. When people look at these survivors with those looks that say they are not ‘normal’ – it is the people looking at them like that who need to be addressed. There is nothing for the girls to do differently – it is others who have to change, how they think, how they react.” Deepika Padukone as acid attack survivor Malti in 'Chhapaak'Given the news reports that we read day in and day out, is that realistic? Is there any real sense that there is any change in the way our society reacts, behaves when it comes to such things? Soch kahan badal rahi hai? That question charges him up. “Lekin soch kyun nahi badalti? Kyun nahi badalti? The whole fight is that the mindset doesn’t change. But why should we take that for granted? It is not the victim who has to change. It is the aggressor, the one who assaults, his mindset has to change. You can’t get away with taking that mindset for granted!”Fair point, taken. And beyond these – the obsessive attacker, the staring bystander – who else needs to change? “Society. Society has to help – you cannot have acid available at every shop.”Will society help? You keep the question to yourself.What are his favourite lines, from all that he has written in this impassioned, defiant mode? The response is instant, as he recites from the poem written for the ' Ab Ladna Hai ' campaign:Soch samajh ke gaur karna haiThodi si koshish aur karna haiAb Ladna HaiHar chehre ko sanvarna haiChaand ka daag bhi bharna haiAb Ladna HaiIf tough situations demand a flight or fight mode, there’s little doubt what mode the survivors, the movie, and the wordsmith are in.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73084448,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-204997/73084448.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/gulzar-dont-pity-these-girls-the-acid-has-not-scarred-their-ego-or-their-self-confidence/articleshow/73084344.cms

28,['4/01/2020'],Spa treatments to nourish your skin this winter,"It’s cold and windy outside, which can leaves the skin feeling dry and harsh. To combat the winter blues, how about going in for some warming skin pampering that is sure to leave you feeling blissful. A few regimens can do wonders for the skin and can leave it rejuvenated and refreshed. Do a patch test on the hand before you start out.Chocolate is full of antioxidants and that reduce facial lines. It increases the production of collagen and lightens blemishes. Try chocolate-infused facial or a chocolate manicure. Says executive Farinaz Tarsi, “I tried a warm chocolate wrap recently and it was so de-stressing. I would advise everyone to try it.”To battle any skin flare-ups, opt for cinnamon-based skin regimens. Says Lalita Sharma, beauty expert, “Cinnamon has anti-bacterial properties that reduce acne. It tackles hyperpigmentation. Mix it with a little lime juice or tomato for more benefits.”Since the skin gets dry in winter, coconut oil is apt as it lubricates the skin and prevents inflammation. Add it to the scrub. “Grate coconut with a little milk or honey and use it as a moisturising scrub,” adds Lalita.Another great skin relaxing trick is a warming poultice. The steamed bags reduce fatigue, eliminate toxins and increase lymphatic drainage. Add ginger and turmeric to it.Oranges work to lighten skin. Suggests skin expert Ramila Vaidya, “Orange juice combats a sun tan and tones skin. Apply the juice or pulp on the skin. Leave it on for 10 minutes and rinse off. For oily skin, mix multani mitti to it and apply that.”Warming and aromatic mint oil is another must -have ingredient in the spa. Not only does it alleviate cold but also heals the skin. Go for a mint lemon scrub and use it in your neck, back and shoulder massage or foot scrub, which leaves the skin feeling refreshed and invigorated. It can also cool soreness. It has astringent properties and can tone the skin as well.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73086160,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-26706/73086160.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/beauty/spa-treatments-to-nourish-your-skin-this-winter/articleshow/73085966.cms
29,['4/01/2020'],"Yug: Kajol: Sometimes, your kids make you question your ideologies","There are times when the parent-child relationship witnesses a role reversal, and parents end up learning a lot from their children. Kajol , who plays Savitribai Malusare in the upcoming film, Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior, elaborated on the same. Speaking of her children Nysa and Yug , she said, “They teach me so much. The way they look at life, treat people, handle things, it’s so inspiring. They are brutally frank and perceptive about situations and relationships. I would like to believe that I am more mature than them, but sometimes, they make me realise how immature I can be.”Like every parent, she, too, has disagreements with her kids. Kajol added, “We do have our share of arguments. I once fired Nysa for not sitting at the table with us. She said that she didn’t feel like it. I got angry and screamed, ‘You need to spend more time with us, how can you not feel like it?’ I went on and on. After a few minutes, my son Yug, who was sitting on my lap, told me, ‘Mom, you shouldn’t fire Nysa for telling you the truth’. It hit me hard. He is just eight years old! He added, ‘I lie to you sometimes when you ask me to come and sit on your lap. I don’t want to, but I come anyway because I fear you will feel bad. She is telling you the truth and you shouldn’t fire her for that.’ I didn’t know where to look. I apologised to her later. As parents, we sometimes force our kids to do certain things like meeting relatives and talking to us. How else will they connect to their roots and family? But what Yug said got me thinking. It made me re-evaluate myself as a mother and question my ideologies.”On a lighter note, we also asked Kajol what her young daughter thinks about her Instagram game. In her trademark candid demeanour, the actress confessed, “Nysa thinks that my Instagram posts are weird. She asks me, ‘Who talks like that on Instagram?’ I tell her, I am real at least. I don't even try to use the millennial language and hashtags. That’s really pushing it.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73086343,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-126650/73086343.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/kajol-sometimes-your-kids-make-you-question-your-ideologies/articleshow/73086355.cms

31,['4/01/2020'],Ostentatious practices not acceptable: Army chief,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Chief of Army Staff General Manoj Mukund Naravane (file photo)

NEW DELHI: New Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane , much like his course-mates Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh and IAF chief Air Chief Marshal Rakesh Kumar Singh Bhadauria , is dead against ostentatious behaviour and practices in the armed forces.

“Ceremonial activities do have a place in the ethos and culture of the armed forces. But the top hierarchy in all the three Services agree that we need to be more professional in our approach and not get carried away by ceremonial activities when they are not needed,” said Gen Naravane on Friday.

As was earlier reported by TOI, the three current Service chiefs are from the same 56th course of the National Defence Academy and all three attained “wings” — a paratrooper one for Gen Naravane, a helicopter pilot for Admiral Singh and a fighter pilot for ACM Bhadauria — after being commissioned as officers into their respective Services in mid-1980. Moreover, all three had fathers in the IAF.

There is “definitely a lot of scope for ceremonial activities” in the armed forces but to have “pomp and show” on every occasion is simply not acceptable. “There should not be, for instance, any red carpet laid during field exercises,” said Gen Naravane. Even his taking over as the Army chief from Gen Bipin Rawat , who is now the chief of defence staff, was a low-key affair on December 31.

NEW DELHI: His decision to quit as Allahabad University vice-chancellor will not buffer Rattan Lal Hangloo from being investigated for alleged financial, academic and administrative irregularities. Even as President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday accepted Hangloo’s resignation, he ordered a probe against him.

Following the order, the HRD ministry set up a three-member committee under the chairmanship of UGC chairman DP Singh to probe the allegations. The other members include Prakash Mani Tripathi , V-C, Indira Gandhi National Tribal University, Amarkantak and Rama Shankar Dubey, V-C, Gujarat Central University. Hangloo submitted his resignation on December 31 after he was summoned by the National Commission for Women over alleged misconduct. Earlier, the commission’s chief Rekha Sharma had also said NCW will continue with its inquiry into the matter.

In his order for the probe, Kovind directed inclusion of the recommendations contained in the interim report of NCW which point at serious irregularities in the university including inappropriate handling of complaints of sexual harassment against Hangloo.

Hangloo was under the scanner since 2016 over alleged irregularities. He was also summoned by the NCW last week over allegations of improper handling of sexual harassment complaints and lack of grievance redressal mechanism for female students. “I resigned because baseless enquiries were initiated against me. On several occasions it was proved that there was no substance in the complaints,” Hangloo had said in a statement announcing his resignation.

“I am shocked at the manner in which the university has dealt with complaints raised by the female students from time to time particularly on matters pertaining to the safety and security of the female students,” Sharma said.

An officer underlined that it is mandatory for government staff drafted under the Census of India Act and Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003, which provides for preparation of a National Population Register (NPR), to carry out their assigned duties of collecting the database for census and NPR exercises. This is applicable both to enumerators tasked with houselisting phase, who will simultaneously capture NPR data, as well as census officers.

As per Census of India rules, the state governments and UT administrations, for carrying out census within their jurisdiction, must appoint officers that include principal census officer (district magistrates), district and sub-district census officer, supervisor and enumerator.

Section 11 of the Census of India Act lays down penalties — imprisonment up to three years and/or fine — for government or any other staff declining to aid in conduct of census. Similarly any refusal to perform NPR duty may invite up to Rs 1,000 fine under Rule 17 of Citizenship Rules, 2003. The errant staff may also face disciplinary action, said an officer.

Given that NPR is to be carried out alongside houselisting phase of Census 2021 from April to September this year, the teachers and other staff drafted as enumerators have to make themselves available for collecting data for both the exercises. This will be the case in West Bengal as well, even though the state administration claims to have put the NPR process there on hold.

Section 4(2) of the Census of India Act, 1948 states that “the state government may appoint persons as census officers to take, aid in, or supervise the taking of the census within any specified local area and such persons, when so appointed, shall be bound to serve accordingly”. Similarly, Rule 5 of the Citizenship Rules, 2003 states that every official of the central government and state government shall assist the Registrar General of Citizen Registration in preparation of the database.

Pinarayi Vijayan (file photo)

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Days after Kerala assembly passed a resolution demanding that the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act be scrapped, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday sent letters to 11 non-BJP chief ministers asking them to take similar steps. He stressed the need for joint efforts to lend more strength to the demand for repealing the Act as well as against the proposed nationwide roll-out of National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The letter was sent to Mamata Banerjee (West Bengal), Arvind Kejriwal (Delhi), Hemant Soren (Jharkhand), Uddhav Thackeray (Maharashtra), Nitish Kumar (Bihar), Y S Jaganmohan Reddy (Andhra Pradesh), Kamal Nath (Madhya Pradesh), Amarinder Singh (Punjab), Ashok Gehlot (Rajasthan) Naveen Patnaik (Odisha) and V Narayanasamy (Puducherry).

“Apprehensions have arisen among large sections of our society consequent to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The need of the hour is unity among all Indians who wish to protect and preserve our cherished values of democracy and secularism. People from various sections of the society, irrespective of any differences , need to stand united in preserving the basic tenets of our polity, which form the cornerstone of Indian democracy,” Vijayan wrote .

The CM referred to the state government’s decision to halt all activities related to National Population Register (NPR) and said it was done in view of a conviction that NPR would eventually lead to NRC. “States, which have the opinion that CAA should be repealed, can consider similar steps so that it will be an eye opener to the proponents of CAA and NRC,” he said.

39,['4/01/2020'],Opposition undeterred by BJP offensive on CAA,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Congress spokesperson Surjewala (file photo)

NEW DELHI: After challenging Congress to “give citizenship to all Pakistanis” during Jharkhand elections, BJP mascot and PM Narendra Modi on Thursday invoked Pakistan and “Hindu refugees” again in the context of Citizenship (Amendment) Act, a clear attempt to caricature the unceasing wave of protest against the controversial law.

The strategy appears suited to the ruling BJP to force the opposition to rethink its stance. But there are few signs that the opposition would be deterred by the saffron offensive — a face-off that appears to be long-drawn and may be quelled only by the Supreme Court judgement on the constitutionality of the CAA.

Congress spokesman Randeep Surjewala said, “Your allies are not accepting the divisive CAA, your own CMs are not accepting the CAA. Should we send you a Hindi translation.” He was responding to home minister Amit Shah ’s barb if Rahul Gandhi wants to read the CAA in Italian translation.

The arc of opposition to the CAA has only widened since it was sparked by civil society protests in Assam after Parliament passed the legislation in December, and stoked further by students’ agitation that erupted across the country and have not stopped yet.

Not only has the opposition led by Congress taken a strong line, its camp has only expanded, with even reluctant players joining in after initial silence. The rallies led by Congress CMs in the five states it rules, the joint political protest in Kerala, the DMK-spearheaded hardline in Tamil Nadu, Trinamool Congress-chief minister Mamata Banerjee ’s virtual veto in West Bengal have put a vast swath of India against the law.

SP and BSP, which were quiet at the start, have also started making statements against the CAA, thereby pitting a consequential segment of UP politics against the law.

Now, all eyes are on Assam where the street battle against the CAA appears spontaneous and independent, thereby posing the trickiest challenge to the BJP.

Amit Shah (file photo)

JODHPUR: Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday said the Centre was steadfast in implementing Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and “would not budge an inch” even if the entire opposition united against the NDA government on this issue.

Launching BJP’s nationwide awareness campaign to dispel misunderstandings on CAA, Shah told a rally which was attended by about 4,000 Hindu refugees from Pakistan : “Whatever the opposition does to spread misinformation about the Act, you need not fear. We will not move an inch from our position on CAA. Nobody can stop your citizenship.”

Shah reiterated that CAA is not a threat to the existing citizens of India. “CAA is for granting citizenship, not for cancelling the existing ones. This is for people like you, who had to flee Pakistan because of atrocities or forced conversions,” he said.

He accused opposition parties of misleading Muslims on CAA and wondered whether former Congress president Rahul Gandhi had read the new law. “Rahul Baba, if you have read CAA, then come to discuss it anywhere. And if you have not read it, I will translate it in Italian and send the copy for you to read it.”

Shah said there was no bigger violation of human rights than the persecution of the religious minorities in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan . “These refugees are our own people. How can anyone object to citizenship being granted to them?” he said while singling out netas like Rahul, Arvind Kejriwal and Mamata Banerjee in his attack on the opposition.

He said beginning Saturday, BJP will take out 500 rallies across the country and reach out to three crore people to create awareness against the “misinformation” spread by the opposition on CAA. “If they (opposition parties) are protesting against the Act and misguiding people, we will also go to the masses with our side about this Act.”

Bikaner, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer and Barmer districts are home to an estimated five lakh Hindu migrants who have been fleeing Pakistan since 1971. While many of them have got citizenship before CAA came into force, about 8,000 Hindu refugees are eligible for citizenship under the new law.

While a section appreciated Bhopal Municipal Corporation’s efforts to keep the city garbage-free and road clea... Read More

BHOPAL: As Bhopal appears set to bounce back in Swachhta ranking this year after slipping 17 spots in the previous rankings in 2019, some distinguished citizens TOI talked to over the issue seemed divided in their opinion on whether or not the Swachhta campaign changed the face of Bhopal and how far-reaching impact it had on the psyche of people.

While a section appreciated Bhopal Municipal Corporation ’s efforts to keep the city garbage-free and road clean, the other section said that garbage collection and sweeping of road every morning in some patches did not mean any drastic improvement in terms of overall sanitation at a place.

President of Bhopal Citizens’ Forum Arun Gurtu, a former IPS officer, while talking about the Swachhata Campaign said, “Efforts put in by BMC for Swachh ranking this year is appreciable. I will give it 70 to 80 marks out of 100 for effective garbage collection. When such a practice starts, supervision holds key on how effective it would be. There is need for tightening of supervision that is why I have deducted 20-25 marks. But, they have been quite meticulous to ensure that the city looks largely garbage-free. They have now involved housing societies and other institutions in their efforts to keep the city clean. If you see a heap of garbage somewhere and send a picture to BMC cell, the civic officials respond quickly. In fact, I would say that it is for the people now to come forward and carry out their responsibility to keep the city clean. It looks very bad when a well-educated man comes out of a luxury car and doesn’t bother to park his vehicle at the parking zone or highly-educated women ask for plastic bag from a vegetable vendor. We, too, have our share of responsibility and unless that is not met, Bhopal or any other place could not fare well in terms of cleanliness and orderliness.”

On the other hand, activist and co-convener of Bhopal Group for Information & Action (BGIA), Rachna Dhingra said, “Nothing has improved in the area where I work and areas in the vicinity of Union Carbide plant. Yes, it’s true that trash is getting picked up from some areas, but what about quality of water? Keeping the main roads of the city clean is not the only parameter of sanitation at a place. People are drinking water which has high e-coli. They are picking up garbage from some areas alright, but it is not being disposed according to the Supreme Court guidelines – neither at the garbage dump (khanti) nor garbage transfer stations. It’s like trashing somebody else’s backyard to keep your surroundings clean. All lakes in the city including the Upper Lake have become oxidation ponds, where sewage flows into the water and the same toxic water is supplied to households.”

Former BMC commissioner Devi Saran, who is in his eighties and has seen the city grow, said, “The city has definitely improved in terms of cleanliness. In fact, orientation of BMC workers has changed. Now, they attend to calls and respond quickly. Perhaps, their conscience has started pricking them. Competition with Indore and desire to beat IMC in Swachhta ranking has also added to their fervour. But, I don’t find people responding with the same zeal. Take for example, shopkeepers in New Market. They open their shop at 11.00 am. By that time, BMC staff has done its cleanliness exercise. They will sweep their own shop and put the heap of dirt and garbage on the road. Why can’t they keep a dustbin? I asked some of my friends to do it but they didn’t respond.”

Convener of Guardians’ Guild Prof Zamiruddin also appreciated BMC for its Swachh efforts, but admitted that service roads inside the colonies remain littered unlike the main roads, which is now being regularly swept and remain largely clean. He also said removing vendors in the name of encroachment and leaving the vacant space for parking of cars was an “insensitive” act, which the BMC has been doing off and on in the name of Swachhta campaign.

Environmentalist Subhash C Pandey in a “harsh” critique of Swachhta campaign as carried out in Bhopal, said “We had told in our study that 26% of city’s green cover is gone in the past 10 years, which Forest Survey of India too later endorsed. Do we become Swachh by felling trees? Planting saplings in place of full-grown trees and “faking” afforestation won’t help. Can’t you see that vehicles put off the road at places like Delhi under NGT order was sold to people in Bhopal and they are polluting Bhopal’s air with impunity with nobody to check vehicular pollution which constitutes 70% of total air pollution. Unplanned urbanization, which Bhopal has seen over the years, has ensured that even ponds and lakes of the city have been encroached upon. You can see civic staff themselves indulging in bio-mass burning after they sweep roads and collect garbage. Constructions is being carried out in the city in the open, where according to guidelines the site should be covered from all sides and regular sprinkling of water should be undertaken at the site. Swachhta report-2011 said that 26% of people in Bhopal go for open defecation . Public toilets have come up in subsequent years but they have no water. How people would use it? I claim that majority of those who were defecating in the open are still doing it in Bhopal because public toilets are dirty like hell and have no water supply.”

42,['4/01/2020'],PPU to start five research wings this year,"This story is from January 4, 2020

PATNA: Patliputra University (PPU) has decided to further extend its academic activities at its 25 constituent colleges besides three each government and minority, 46 affiliated and 51 BEd colleges in Patna and Nalanda districts. The university has prepared a blueprint to cater to the needs of about 2.5 lakh students studying in regular courses at postgraduate (PG) and undergraduate (UG) levels.

PPU vice-chancellor (VC) Gulab Chand Ram Jaiswal told this newspaper on Thursday that the university is to start five different research wings in 2020 — Mahatma Gandhi Research Studies Centre, Buddhist Research Studies Centre, Pt Madan Mohan Malaviya Research Studies Centre, Pt Deendayal Upadhaya Research Studies Centre and Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar Research Studies Centre. “These proposed centres have also been approved by the PPU syndicate,” he said.

The VC also said a Board of Studies has been set up to strictly monitor courses of studies being taught in the university and its colleges. ‘The Board of Studies is an independent body to suggest the PPU about the required changes in the syllabi as per the need of the time,” he said.

Jaiswal said, “To give an impetus to academic and other activities in 2020, PPU has decided to activate its academic council, senate, syndicate, academic calendar, sports calendar, cultural calendar and national academic depository (NAD) programme to provide maximum benefit to the students. Besides, the university has fixed a day every month to hold a pension ‘adalat’ for retired teaching and non-teaching staff at the PPU headquarters.”

PPU has also started semester-based PG teaching in 14 major subjects as per the UGC criteria. “We will ensure university examinations on time this year and publish the results within a time limit, so that students keen to pursue their education outside the state after UG and PG would not face any difficulty, he said.

Faced with acute shortage of teachers, the PPU has recently got 90 assistant professors duly appointed by the Bihar Public Service Commission in various subjects. “The university has posted the newly appointed assistant professors at the colleges, where paucity of teachers affected teaching the most. The PPU has also completed interview of guest faculty in 14 different subjects to fulfil the needs of colleges at both UG and PG level,” he said.

Surat: A 100-member team of officials of Surat Municipal Corporation accompanied by police removed over 400 handcarts and encroachments from footpaths and roads in Chauta Bazaar area of the city on Friday.

Ketan Patel, central zone in-charge, said, “We have removed illegal encroachments from Chauta Bazaar. More than 400 encroachments, including handcarts and small shops on footpaths and roadsides, have been removed. We will try to ensure these people don’t return to this place again.”

SMC sources said, “The man who had attacked the deputy engineer of the civic body on Thursday during the anti-encroachment drive has been caught. Some more troublemakers are likely to be arrested by Friday night.”

Chauta Bazaar is one of the biggest marketplaces in the city, housing over 2,000 shops in 2.5 square kilometre area of old Surat. It also houses 150-year-old Surat General Hospital. However, no ambulance can pass from the 18 metre road due to encroachments.

City unit BJP president and councillor Nitin Bhajiyawala said, “Hospital authorities had requested the civic body to remove of the encroachments because they were hindering patient care. Also, doctors were finding it difficult to reach the hospital to treat patients.”

In the last one-year, encroachments were removed from Chauta Bazaar at least five times but they would keep returning to the same place. A civic body officer said, “We need political will to fight anti-social elements who had made this market area their fiefdom. The civic authorities are determined not to allow the encroachers to return again.”

49,['4/01/2020'],Tata Sons’ conversion remains illegal: NCLAT,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Mumbai: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) said on Friday that the illegality of the conversion of Tata Sons from a deemed public limited company to a private entity stands and that the Registrar of Companies ( RoC )-Mumbai was free to challenge its judgment in the Supreme Court . It, however, said that a line will be added in the judgment to clarify that the observations cast no aspersions on RoC-Mumbai , an arm of the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA). The NCLAT has reserved its order for Monday.

The tribunal was responding to MCA’s appeal seeking removal of certain words like “illegal” and “with the help of RoC-Mumbai” from the NCLAT’s December 18 order in the Cyrus Mistry vs Tata Sons case. But the NCLAT said RoC-Mumbai cannot challenge its findings before it. “Your action of challenging is prejudicial. You go and challenge it before the Supreme Court.” The MCA told NCLAT on Friday that it only discharged its duty and did not commit any illegality in granting permission to Tata Sons to become a private company.

The two-member bench headed by Justice S J Mukhopadhaya said that it (the judgment) was not passed with any mala fide intention. “Your apprehensions are unfounded. You can’t ask for a change for just seeking a change.” The MCA argued that RoC-Mumbai was duty-bound to perform its statutory function following Tata Sons’ request and there was no hurry on its part in the conversion of the company from public to private.

To this, the bench said, “Hurry was not from your part. It was from their own part (Tata). Your help was in that.” It further said Tata Sons could not change the status of the company without RoC-Mumbai’s nod. “The word hurriedly in the judgment refers to the company and not to RoC-Mumbai.” The NCLAT also observed: “Your arguments seem that you are arguing for the company... You are arguing as a mouthpiece of a company. Don’t plead like that. This is the first time we are seeing a director prosecution (representing the MCA) acting like defence.”

The MCA said that the Companies Act doesn’t prescribe any minimum share capital for conversion of companies from public to private. This, it said, is to help ease of doing business.

Patna University

PATNA: Life returned to the Patna University (PU) campus on Friday with the reopening of all its constituent colleges and postgraduate departments after 10-day Christmas break. Students and teachers of different institutions were seen exchanging pleasantries and New Year greetings with their friends and colleagues, respectively.

The attendance of students in most departments was, however, very thin as several students had not returned from their homes. The inclement weather also prevented the students from coming to their colleges and departments. The attendance is likely to pick up in a day or two, said a senior teacher of Patna College .

Some students of Magadh Mahila College (MMC) and Patna Women’s College (PWC) were seen canvassing for their candidates contesting college student cabinet elections scheduled for January 6 and 11, respectively. While in MMC, elections will be held for 15 posts, elections are to held for five posts in PWC.

PU botany department head S R Padmadeo on Friday joined as the new principal of Patna Science College in place of K C Sinha, who superannuated on December 31.

Soon after assuming his office, Padmadeo asserted that he would do his best to restore the lost academic glory of this premier institution which has been his alma mater.

The postgraduate semester I and III examinations of different faculties will commence from January 6. These examinations were earlier scheduled in the second week of December, but could not be held as the examination programmes coincided with the various national level competitive examinations. Moreover, elections to Patna University Students’ Union were also held on December 7. Now the classes of semester II and IV will commence soon after the completion of semester I and III examinations, said said PU examination controller R K Mandal.

Meanwhile, both the Patna University Teachers’ Association and the Patna University Employees’ Association have expressed their profound shock over the premature demise of PU syndicate member Sudhakar Prasad Singh.

2,000 to receive degrees at PU convocation today: Patna University has made elaborate arrangements for holding its annual convocation at Bapu Sabhagar on Saturday. More than 2000 scholars will receive their degrees at the convocation. “Altogether 41 degree recipients will be awarded gold medals for securing top position in university examinations, the results of which were announced in 2019,” said PU examination controller R K Mandal.

For the first time, guardians of scholars have also been invited to attend the convocation. The recipients were given convocation dress on Friday.

Dry weather and partly cloudy skies prevailed in Patna on Friday

PATNA: The ongoing spell of rainy weather , according to weathermen, would subside by Saturday evening but a fresh spell of showers may hit the state around January 8.

Patna Meteorological Centre has predicted partly cloudy sky with possibility of rain or thunderstorm in Patna, Bhagalpur, Purnia, Gaya and Muzaffarpur on January 8 and 9. The expected showers have been attributed to a fresh western disturbance, the weather systems originating from Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea and Caspian Sea, which cause snow and winter rainfalls in northwestern Indian subcontinent.

Private weather agency Skymetweather also reported on Thursday that another unseasonal spell of rain is expected in Bihar and Jharkhand from January 8 to 10.

“Again, a trough will extend up to Bihar across Uttar Pradesh leading to the rainfall activity. Moreover, humid winds from the Bay of Bengal will also continue to feed moisture to the region during this period,” the Skymet report stated.

Meanwhile, dry weather along with partly cloudy skies prevailed at many places in Bihar on Friday, though light showers were recorded at isolated places. India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued forecast for thunderstorm accompanied with hail and lightning at isolated places over Bihar on Saturday.

53,['4/01/2020'],Sufi backdrop to Kashi’s culture cauldron is Republic-Day tableau theme,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Shehnai maestro Bismillah Khan

LUCKNOW: Sufi shrines Kabir Chaura and Dewa Sharif will be on the same platform as music stalwarts Bismillah Khan and Girija Devi in this year’s entry from Uttar Pradesh in the Republic Day tableau , dedicated to PM Modi’s parliamentary constituency Varanasi.

Titled ‘Uttar Pradesh ki dharmic evam sanskritik dharohar’, the tableau’s syncretic outreach will play up Varanasi’s stalwarts like classical singer Girija Devi, shehnai maestro Bismillah Khan and noted tabla player Pandit Gudai Maharaj while showcasing Barabanki’s famous Sufi shrine Dewa Sharif.

“Initially, we were planning to put up the main gate of Banaras Hindu University as the backdrop, but it was felt we need to blur religious lines. So, the Dewa Sharif dargah will now be the backdrop of the tableau,” said Ram Manohar Tripathi, assistant director, information department. The move comes amidst massive protests in the country, particularly UP against the new citizenship law, which the opposition dubbed divisive and against a specific minority community.

The overtly religious touch to the tableau has also been modified, said sources, and made culturally stronger.

There was a proposal to have a cutout of Kashi Vishwanath Temple at the front of the tableau, but it has now been changed to Varanasi’s sangeet gharanas, said an official, adding changes were recommended by the defence ministry’s expert committee, which vets proposals of various states.

Musical instruments like table and shehnai will be set up on rotating stands in the front. Just behind will be statues of Girija Devi, Bismillah Khan and Gudai Maharaj, all three icons of Varanasi.

“Behind these will be symbols of Kabirdas, Sant Ravidas and Gautam Buddha. Kabir Chaura, the place where Kabir grew up, will be featured prominently, along with artwork which can be seen in Kabir mutt, ghats of the Ganga in Varanasi and other symbols from the city,” said a senior official.

Artistes performing Kathak, a dance form associated with UP which developed in three prominent gharanas of Varanasi, Lucknow and Jaipur, will be stationed on the ground next to the tableau.

Varanasi has been a favourite Republic Day theme for tableaux from UP, even under the SP regime. In 2018, a tableau Subah-e-Benaras did not make it to the final list and was subsequently used for the parade in Lucknow itself.

PATNA: Even after the passage of more than 24 hours, police have so far not been able to arrest anyone involved in thrashing two constables near Krishna Ghat under the Pirbahore police station area in Patna.

The two constables – Santosh Kumar and Rajesh Paswan – were deployed on the banks of the Ganga for maintaining law and order during New Year celebrations. As they confronted some youths for playing objectionable songs on their cellphones and passing lewd comments on girls, they got infuriated and attacked him.

An FIR was lodged against at least 20 unknown youths with Pribahore police station on Thursday on the basis of injured constable Santosh’s statement.

SHO of Pribahore police station Rizwan Ahmed Khan said the youths involved in the attack were yet to be identified. “As it was riverbank, there was no CTTV camera in the vicinity. As a result, identifying the guilty youths is a tough task,” he added.

Patna College police temporary outpost (TOP) incharge Manoj Kumar Singh said the two constables had addressed the youths as ‘bachcha’ while attempting to stop them from passing lewd comments on girls.

“However, instead of listening to their polite request, few youths attacked them with rods, bats and other blunt weapons,” Singh said, adding the two policemen received deep cut wounds. He said the two constables were undergoing training for promotion at new police lines from where they were sent on duty to the ghat.

Three held with arms: Police arrested three criminals from a place near Patna Junction under the Kotwali police station area in the wee hours of Friday and seized a country-made pistol, four live cartridges, seven cellphones and a bike from their possession. The arrested criminals – Ashwani Swaraj alias Sonu, Sunny Kumar and Ajeet Kumar – were involved in several cellphone snatching cases. The three are residents of Indranagar under the Kankarbagh police station area. Police said an FIR for possession of illegal arms and ammunition was registered with Kotwali police station against the three arrested criminals.

One arrested: Police arrested one Suman Kumar from Jyotipuram Colony under the Rajeev Nagar police station area in the city late on Thursday night and seized a country-made firearm and a live cartridge from his possession. A senior police officer said it was being probed whether Suman, a resident of Sarai under the Maner police station area in western Patna, had any criminal antecedent.

Those who don’t believe in New year resolutions



Dev

Mimi Chakraborty

A New Year has begun and brought along with it new hopes and of course, resolutions. It also means that the clock has started ticking, testing your determination vis-à-vis sticking to the promises you have made to yourself about changing things for the better. But as you look ahead, planning to implement these changes in your life, have you ever taken a step back to assess how good you have been in sticking to your resolutions taken in past years? That’s exactly what we asked a few Tolly celebs to do — tell us their resolutions for this year and look back at the ones they made in 2019 but couldn’t stick to. While most of them got candid with us about their hits and misses, some of them revealed that they never make resolutions, as, according to most of them, such promises are made to be broken. Read on...This year, my one and only resolution is to learn how to ride a bike. It is my dream to ride a bike and go around the city. The other resolution is to go on a trip to Ladhak within this year with a special friend of mine.Last year, I had resolved to take my mother on a trip outside India, but I couldn’t keep my word. This year, I plan to do it. Let’s see whether I can fulfil that promise to myself.Everyone says I write well. At times, I pen down poems, short stories and sometimes, short pieces on what is happening around us. It was my childhood dream that my book will get released at the book fair. I am working towards that so that in 2021, I can fulfill my dreams.I know who are my enemies and friends. Last year, I promised myself that I will keep my friend circle small and mix with a limited number of people. But when I look back, I find that last January itself, I socialised with so many people! I am still doing it.Iam an impulsive buyer and end up buying instruments for my gym that cost me a fortune. That has to stop anyhow this year. And the other resolution is that I want to have a physique like Hrithik Roshan . I am working really hard on that.Last year, I remember I wrote on a diary that I will save a certain amount every month. But trust me, I couldn't achieve even half of my target. My parents are ageing and I come from a middle class family, where savings are a must.I am a night owl, but that has to change this year. I read till late in the night and then wake up late. I am trying to change that for my own good. And this year, I will hit the gym to stay fit and toned, not to lose weight.I mix three teaspoons of sugar in a health drink that I have every day. I had decided to stop that last year, but I could do it for just three days. On the fourth day, things were back to square one!This year is important to me in many ways. So, I need to be calmer and more observant and focused. I can only achieve that by reading more and watching meaningful films from all across the world. And watching TV is a complete no-no from now on.Last year, I thought I will revive my personal contacts with my school and para friends, as I realised that they are the best friends one can ever have in life. But I failed, as I was too busy.I really wish people are more tolerant towards each other and spread love. And that includes me too. My resolution is to be happy, maintain a balanced lifestyle and meditate a lot so that I feel happy from inside.Both my husband and I love to travel. Each year in January, we promise each other that we will travel three to four times a year, but last year, we could only go for a vacation once as both of us were busy with work.I don’t make New Year resolutions anymore. They don’t last. So now, I just do the things I want in life.I make my resolutions on my birthday, not the beginning of a New Year. And it’s the same every year — to take on varied, challenging roles.I don't make any New Year resolutions. My only mantra in life is to be good and compassionate towards all.I feel resolutions are made to be broken. I just pray to God to help me stay good to everyone and bless others with happiness and health.My only New Year resolution each year is not to take resolutions, as I feel it’s a farce. I believe in good work and being good to all throughout the year.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73083561,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-107997/73083561.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/bengali/movies/news/tolly-celebs-open-up-about-their-new-year-resolutions/articleshow/73083561.cms
57,['4/01/2020'],Poll year begins with ‘ghostly’ duel between Lalu-Rabri &amp; CM,"This story is from January 4, 2020

PATNA: Two days after CM Nitish Kumar shared private anecdotes about rumours of ghosts and black magic at 1 Anne Marg, the official bungalow of the chief minister, when he shifted there in 2006, former CM couple Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi came out with tweets on Friday to attack Nitish using same “paranormal” terminologies like “bhoot” and “jhar phook”.

“Is baar janta kas ke vote ki jhar-phoonk se inke sare bhoot-pret chhuda degi (People of state will play the exorcist this time and ward off the evil spirits that possess these people),” Lalu, who is serving jail sentence in fodder scam cases, tweeted without naming anyone. The former CM’s tweeter handle is managed by his family members and office.

Former CM Rabri Devi also joined her husband in raking up the issue of “ghosts” at 1 Anne Marg. “A ‘ghost’ had occupied the bungalow when the ‘savour’ (messiah) of the downtrodden (referring to Lalu) had vacated it in 2005. The incumbent CM couldn’t understand the literal meaning of ‘saheb’,” she tweeted.

Displaying her trademark bluntness, Rabri tweeted, “I am sure, even after 15 years, whenever Nitishji is looking at the mirror in CM house, he is seeing a ‘bhoot’ (ghost) in it.”

Interestingly, Nitish would call Rabri “bhabhiji” when the two families enjoyed cordial relationship. Nitish had attended the wedding ceremony of Lalu-Rabri’s elder son Tej Pratap in April 2018 and blessed the newly-wed couple.

Incidentally, Tej too had used “paranormal” reasons and blamed Nitish when he vacated the 3, Deshratna Marg bungalow in February 2018. “I decided to vacate the bungalow because Nitish and deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi had released ghosts in it. The ghosts were haunting me,” Tej had said.

The bungalow was allotted to Tej in the capacity of health minister in the Grand Alliance government of JD(U), RJD and Congress.

Nitish, in an informal chat with a group of people, including some journalists, on the New Year day shared an anecdote that when he entered the official residence of the CM, he was taken aback to find small packets in every nook and corner of the sprawling bungalow. “Even two-foot of soil was dug and taken away by the former CM couple. Lalu told me that he has left a ghost in the CM house,” Nitish had said.

Meanwhile, Nitish’s deputy Sushil Kumar Modi has also come out in defence of the CM and cautioned people against those engaged in spreading rumours to take political mileage.

“CM Nitish had to stay in the state guest house for quite some time as the former CM couple had not vacated the bungalow even after being ousted from power,” Modi tweeted on Thursday.

Describing the former CM couple as superstitious, Modi said the RJD at a point of time had appointed a sorcerer an office-bearer of the party to get reprieve from sins. “However, that didn’t deter him (Lalu) from being landed in jail,” Modi tweeted.

58,['4/01/2020'],First phase of open air theatre project completes,"This story is from January 4, 2020

PATNA: The construction of open air theatre at Gandhi Maidan has hit a roadblock due to “unavailability” of an agency which will arrange for screening of movies and documentaries. The project is being executed under Smart City mission.

Officials said while a control room has been constructed near gate number 3 of Gandhi Maidan, it will take another six months to set up the 40-foot-high full high definition (FHD) mega screen.

Harshita, public relations officer at Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) said, “The open air theatre project was to be carried out in two phases. In the first phase, the equipment were to be procured and tested. In the second phase, an agency was to be hired to arrange for screening of movies and documentaries.”

She added, “The first phase has been completed and efforts are on to hire an agency for the second phase of the project. Once the open air theatre comes up at Gandhi Maidan, people will have a great theatrical experience without paying a penny.”

PMC’s assistant municipal commissioner Devendra Prasad Tiwari said since it is a government project, the movies and documentaries to be screened will have to be selected cautiously. “The work of the agency will be to arrange for movies and documentaries, which are not offensive to anyone and also have a social message,” he added.

Tiwari said, “We are trying our best to hire an agency at the earliest. Once the theatre starts, people of Patna will have a great mode of recreation in the city.”

The sight earmarked for the open air theatre is between gate numbers 3 and 4 at Gandhi Maidan. Officials said the 40x22-foot FHD screen will be a movable to ensure that it is removed in case of any political rally or other big events at the historic Maidan. The theatre will be free of cost for people and open to all. It will screen movies and documentaries only during the evening hours.

59,['4/01/2020'],BJP eyes smooth passage in civic polls with five flyovers,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Rajkot: Chief minister Vijay Rupani has given his home town a New Year gift.

The state government on Friday sanctioned Rs 230 crore to build five new flyover bridges in the city, four of which will be constructed in areas falling in Rupani’s Rajkot (west) constituency. While three are proposed on the 150 ft Ring Road, which witnesses massive snarls at several junctions due to merging traffic, two will come up on Kalavad Road to ease the vehicle movement between Rajkot and Ahmedabad.

In it’s last meeting, the standing committee of Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) had moved the proposal seeking funds for the five bridges.

The move also comes at a time when BJP has started preparations for the crucial RMC election scheduled later this year.

According to the proposal, the new bridges will be constructed at chaotic traffic junctions on Nana Mauva Chowkdi, Ramapir Chowkdi, Kalavad Road near Jaddus restaurant, Umiya Chowk and Greenland Chowkdi.

There are already three flyovers on 150 ft Ring Road. Of the new flyovers, two are proposed at the end of this Ring Road - Gondal Chowkdi and Madhapar Chowkdi. With these new flyovers, there will be total nine overbridges and one underpass on 11 km stretch of the Ring Road.

“These five bridges will address the major traffic problems of the city,” a statement issued by mayor’s office said.

Municipal commissioner Udit Agrawal said, “We have already completed pre-feasibility report for Nana Mauva and Ramapir Chowk bridges and very soon we will appoint consultants for other three.”

Interestingly, Nana Mauva bridge falls in in ward number 11 from where all the four Congress candidates were elected in 2015 poll. Rupani had got the number of votes from ward number one where Ramapir Chowkdi bridge is proposed and in ward number 10 where a bridge on Kalavad road will come up. Mayor Bina Acharya was also elected from this ward.

The area around Umiya Chowk, where a flyover is sanctioned, has a signficant number of Patidar community people.

Leader of Opposition in RMC, Vashram Sagathiya alleged, “Several BJP leaders have made high investment on 150 foot Ring Road and Kalavad Road so all the projects are announced for western part of the city. The government wants cheap publicity making such announcements. The work for four bridges which were announced earlier have not started yet.”

60,['4/01/2020'],"Tata Trustee, group cos move SC against relief to Mistry","This story is from January 4, 2020

Reeba Zachariah & Swati Deshpande | TNN

Mumbai: Apart from Ratan Tata, Tata Trusts vice-chairman Venu Srinivasan, TCS, Tata Teleservices and Tata Industries moved the Supreme Court on Friday with separate appeals challenging the NCLAT order of December 18, 2019. The ruling, among other things, directs Tata Trusts to consult the SP Group on appointment of Tata Sons’ chairman in the future and also while naming directors for its board.

Srinivasan — trustee of Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust, which together own over 50% of Tata Sons — said in his appeal that the NCLAT in “one stroke takes away from the Trusts their basic legal right as shareholders to elect directors of their choice”. “The Trusts can elect directors of their choice under company law on the basis of their majority shareholding even if they had no nomination rights in the Articles of Association (AoA) of Tata Sons,” he said.

He further said that it is the prerogative of the shareholders (subject to any special provision in the company’s AoA) to decide who they wish to appoint or remove as directors of the company. “Consensus and unanimity among shareholders in matters of appointment can be a desirable thing but as a matter of legal rule, shareholders decide by majority. This is the norm the world over.”

The NCLAT had instructed that Cyrus Mistry, scion of the SP Group, should be appointed on the board of Tata Sons, TCS, Tata Industries and Tata Teleservices (Tata Tele) — companies where he was stripped off his directorship. The order to reinstate Mistry as a director on the boards of companies for the rest of his tenure has created confusion in the working of the companies as his terms have expired, the Tata companies said in their appeals. Tata Sons too, on Thursday, had appealed against the NCLAT order.

The order also instructs the Trusts’ nominees to not decide in advance on any issues that may require a majority from the Tata Sons board or a majority vote at the annual shareholder meeting. Srinivasan said that this direction not only interferes with the statutory right of the shareholders, but also with the fiduciary duties of the directors. “It imposes conditions on the directors which are neither contained in the AoA, nor under the Companies Act.”

Srinivasan, who is also chief of TVS Motor, said the NCLAT has wrongly identified Article 121 of the AoA (which gives affirmative voting rights to Trusts’ nominees) as the source of alleged oppressive conduct of Tata Trusts against Mistry. “An affirmative vote gives the ability to say no, it does not give the power to take decisions.” Tata Tele said in its appeal that it was not a party to the proceedings either before the NCLT-Mumbai or the NCLAT and that the latter passed an order granting reliefs to Mistry which he had not even sought. “At the same time, it has been denied the opportunity to defend the justified and lawful removal of Mistry as its director,” it appealed. Tata Tele said “any extension of the tenure available at the time of initial appointment’’ would be beyond the NCLAT jurisdiction and would need to be set aside for that reason alone.

62,['4/01/2020'],Patna: IGIMS conducts rare ear surgery successfully,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS)

PATNA: A major bone bridge implant surgery was successfully performed in the right ear of a seven-year-old child at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences ( IGIMS ) here on Friday under the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK), a government of India programme.

The child, a resident of Danapur, was suffering from congenital disease in which his both ears were deformed.

A team of doctors of the ear, nose and throat (ENT) department headed by Dr Rakesh Singh performed the hour-long surgery involving bone bridge implant beneath the skin in the right ear of the child.

He said, “The child had 80 decibel conductive hearing loss bilaterally with microtia of both pinna. A normal healthy person should have below 20 decibel hearing level. In simple terms, the child was suffering from hearing impairment.”

Singh said it was probably the first time in the entire country that such a major ear implant was done in any government hospital under the RBSK. The child’s father, Sanjiv Kumar Pandey, said the expert hands of surgeons and the RBSK helped revert his son’s heath status from being hearing impaired to normal one.

The ENT department of the IGIMS had in the past conducted several complicated surgeries like cochlear implant and skull base surgery. Singh said this surgery, made free of cost, would cost anywhere from Rs 10 to 15 lakh in private hospitals.

Dr Sujit Sinha, nodal officer of the RBSK said about 15 surgeries of congenital diseases, including those of heart, brain and bones, have been conducted within six months under RBSK at IGIMS.

63,['4/01/2020'],Assembly polls: JD(U) eyes three Patna seats,"This story is from January 4, 2020

PATNA: Days after JD(U)’s senior functionary Prashant Kishor created ripples in the state’s political circles by pitching for more seats for his party than the BJP in the next assembly polls, the Nitish Kumar-led party has now expressed wish to contest at least 50% of assembly seats in Patna Mahanagar area.

Patna Mahanagar area has six assembly constituencies. Of them, only one — Phulwari (SC) — seat was won by the JD(U) in the 2015 assembly election. The JD(U) was then an ally of three-party Grand Alliance which also included Lalu Prasad’s RJD and the Congress. The rest five seats — Digha, Bankipur, Kumhrar, Patna Sahib and Danapur — were won by the BJP candidates.

Addressing a meeting of his party’s booth level workers of Digha constituency in Gardanibagh area here on Thursday, JD(U) MLC Ranbir Nandan said his party would stake claim on 50% seats of Patna Mahanagar. It means the JD(U) would stake claim on three seats, including Phulwari.

As Nandan is considered close to JD(U) national general secretary (organization) R C P Singh, his statement is being taken seriously by political observers who claim that the MLC could not make such statement on a sensitive issue like seat-sharing without having a backing from seniors in the party.

“JD(U) has now raised its organisational structure at each polling booth in the six assembly constituencies of Patna Mahanagar area. We now have a strong organisational set-up in each of six constituencies. We have our active workers besides the party’s president and secretary at all polling booths in Patna Mahanagar. Our workers now want that the JD(U) should contest at least 50% of the six seats in the state capital. Our workers raised this demand at the party’s meeting. I have put forward their demand,” Nandan told TOI on Friday.

In 2015 election, the JD(U), being part of the Grand Alliance, had contested two seats — Phulwari and Digha. Phulwari seat was won by its leader Shyam Rajak, who is now state’s industries minister. But JD(U) candidate Rajiv Ranjan Prasad had to taste defeat from Digha seat which was won by BJP’s Sanjiv Chaurasia. The Bankipur and Kumhrar seats were contested by the Congress and Patna Sahib and Danapur seats by the RJD.

As five of the six seats are presently held by the sitting MLA of the BJP, the JD(U)’s demand, if considered during the seat-sharing, would see the saffron party leaving at least two seats for the JD(U). The BJP had sacrificed its five sitting seats for the JD(U) in the 2019 Lok Sabha election.

Reacting to Nandan’s claim, Bihar BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand told TOI that he could not say in which capacity the JD(U) MLC expressed such opinion which was against the decorum of the alliance.

“Any decision related to 2020 Bihar election will be taken collectively by the top leadership of NDA allies after proper consultation in due course of time,” Anand said.

64,['4/01/2020'],RJD-JD(U) poster war escalates,"This story is from January 4, 2020

PATNA: Poster war escalated between RJD and JD(U) as the Lalu Prasad-led party put up posters in front of its state headquarters on Friday, attacking the NDA for alleged scams and “poor governance”. Earlier, JD(U) had put up posters on Thursday, comparing Lalu-Rabri regime with that of chief minister Nitish Kumar.

The poster put up in front of RJD office showed Nitish clad in saffron kurta, half jacket and dhoti with a CM’s chair on his shoulder and holding a basket on his head with ‘jhooth ki tokri’ written on it. Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi’s basket, on the other hand, has ‘jumlon ki tokri written on it with black money, Ram temple, GST, demonetization and 100 smart cities written inside. Srijan Scam, Rafale deal and liquor mafia have also found space in the poster.

The RJD’s poster came a day after a poster was put up across the state capital on Thursday, comparing 15 years of Lalu-Rabri with that of 15 years of Nitish. While Lalu-Rabri era was shown with broken roads, bloodshed, people holding guns, students studying under lantern and buffaloes in the background, the Nitish era was shown with smooth roads and flyovers, girls cycling and women switching on the light. Though this was not the JD(U)’s official poster, party’s spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan said it was put up by the party’s well-wisher.

RJD state president Jagdanand Singh said his party did not cook up anything for the poster. “We have simply portrayed what NITI Aayog has said about the present government. Bihar has performed very poorly in all the fields, including education and health. So they should question the central government if they have any problem,” said Jagdanand.

RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari also hit out at the present government, saying there was corruption at all levels. “The present government acts like Godfather for corrupts,” he added.

The deputy CM also tweeted on Friday regarding the poster put up against Lalu-Rabri regime. “The poster has nothing new. It reminds 15 years of darkness in the state. Lalu Prasad should explain why lakhs of people had to migrate to other states during his tenure,” Modi tweeted.

JD(U) spokesperson Sanjay Singh criticised RJD for putting up such posters and said a lot had been done during Nitish Kumar’s regime. “They (RJD first family) have no issues to discuss so they are doing such things. The entire family is involved in corruption and the head is serving jail term,” Singh added.

66,['4/01/2020'],Sebi changes rating rules to stop cos’ ‘shopping’,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Mumbai: To stop ‘rating shopping’ by companies, markets regulator Sebi on Friday said in case a company does not provide information to a credit rating agency (CRA) for six months at a stretch for its ratings, its rating will have to be compulsorily downgraded to a non-investment/junk grade.

Rating shopping is a surreptitious method used by companies when they move from one rating agency to another till they get a grade that is to their liking. After these companies get a preferred rating, they stop providing information to those rating agencies that did not give them a favourable grade. Sebi is trying to clamp down exactly on this surreptitious method used by the companies.

Recently the RBI too, in its bi-annual publication relating to financial stability of banks, warned of rating shopping by the corporates and mentioned that Sebi was working to address this issue. The Sebi in its circular said that to strengthen the rating process of the CRAs with regard to ‘Issuer not cooperating’ (INC) ratings, it has taken some decisions.

“If an issuer has all the outstanding ratings as non-cooperative for more than six months, then the CRA shall downgrade the rating assigned to the instrument of such issuer to non-investment grade with INC status. If non-cooperation by the issuer continues for further six months from the date of downgrade to non-investment grade, no CRA shall assign any new ratings to such issuer until the issuer resumes cooperation or the rating is withdrawn,” Sebi said.

The regulator also prescribed how CRAs could withdraw ratings in such situations. These changes will be applicable immediately, Sebi said.

67,['4/01/2020'],"Sensex slides 162 pts, Re loses 44p to 71.81","This story is from January 4, 2020

Mumbai: Thanks to the rising geopolitical tension in the Middle East due to the US airstrike that killed one of Iran ’s top military commanders, global markets including in India showed a nervous trend on Friday with the sensex closing 162 points lower at 41,465. Rising crude oil prices and the weakness of the rupee, which fell by 44 paise to 71.81, weighed on investor sentiment on Dalal Street. The price of gold, usually a safe haven during times of uncertainty, shot up.

According to Kotak Securities senior VP (equity technical research) Shrikant Chouhan, equity markets globally — including in India — tumbled on news of fresh geopolitical tensions arising between the US and Iran. “Both the key stock indices faltered...although the broader and the medium-term trends of the market are still intact. The short-term trend of the market is disturbed and the sentiment may remain weak.”

Brokers feel that since US-Iran tensions were already high owing to US sanctions on Iran, the attack on Saudi oil facilities last year and various incidents in the Middle East, the day’s development will further intensify problems between the two countries in the short term. However, the market reaction may subside if there is no retaliatory move by Iran or no major exchange of words between Tehran and Washington, traders said. Since rising crude prices and a weak rupee could spark inflation, which in turn could keep the rate of inflation at an elevated level, banking and financial services stocks were sold aggressively. In Friday’s session, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and SBI contributed most to sensex’s slide, while TCS, Infosys and HCL Tech cushioned the fall to some extent.

CLEARED SKHER

Kolhapur: Uneasiness in Shiv Sena showed in the zilla parishad elections in western Maharashtra . Some Sena leaders helped BJP win key posts in Solapur and Sangli ZPs.

All eyes are now on a meeting called by Anil Babar, Sena’s Khanapur MLA in Sangli district. Babar’s supporters voted in favour of BJP in the election on Thursday.

Babar told the media that the meeting has been called as all parties, setting aside their differences, helped him win assembly election. “There is some confusion about current political situation, which I want to clear,” he said.

He said Sena had an alliance with BJP in Sangli for two-and-half years. “Leaders of Mahavaikas Aaghadi contacted us too late. Even Sena did not issue any specific directive about Sangli election,” he said.

Sources said Babar’s strained ties with NCP minister Jayant Patil played key role in the development. Ajit Ghorpade, Sena candidate in Kavthe Mahankar, also supported BJP.

In neighbouring Solapur district, four Sena MLAs joined hands with BJP, which offered the president post to the party. Solapur incident has hurt NCP as party was keen to capture power following defeat in Madha Lok Sabha constituency and defection of Mohite-Patil family.

Chennai: Brewing US-Iran geopolitical tensions after one of Iran’s generals was killed by an airstrike pushed international gold prices on the spot market to a four-month high of $1,538 per ounce on Friday. Considered a safe haven of investment in times of uncertainty, gold rates in the international markets are now inching towards the record peak of $1,560 per ounce, recorded in September last year.

The global surge in prices of the yellow metal, combined with the weakness of the rupee, also pushed prices higher in the local markets. In Delhi and Mumbai, spot prices jumped nearly 2.5% to Rs 39,950 per 10 grams, while here it rallied to Rs 41,380. On Friday, the rupee weakened by 44 paise rupee to Rs 71.81 per dollar. On Friday alone, the average jump in gold prices was about Rs 700, while in the last two weeks it has added about Rs 2,000. This spurt has come after a subdued trend in November and early December.

Analysts predict gold prices to rise further since Iran has threatened retaliation. “The immediate resistance is near $1546/ounce. On break of the resistance, the price might move close to the September 2019 highs of $1560/ounce,” said Kotak Securities VP (head, commodity research) Ravindra Rao.

However, some analysts feel the increase could be short-lived and Friday’s spike was a kneejerk reaction. Motilal Oswal associate director & head (commodities & currencies business) Kishore Narne, said the high prices would prevail for a week and soften if the US-Iran tensions don’t escalate.Among other precious metals, price of silver in the domestic market too rose by Rs 750 on Friday to touch Rs 49,344 per kilogram.

Work in progress to widen Saguna Mor-Danapur Road in Patna

PATNA: Bihar State Road Development Corporation (BSRDC) has targeted to convert Saguna Mor-Danapur Road into an eight-lane road by August this year.

The 4.05km-long road extends from divisional railway manager (DRM) office in Danapur to Saguna Mor. Apart from the eight-lane road, an elevated 20km road is also being constructed between Danapur railway station and Bihta airbase.

State road construction minister Nand Kishor Yadav said vehicular movement will increase between Patna and Bihta after commencement of commercial flight operations from Bihta airbase of the Indian Air Force.

“Danapur-Saguna Mor road will not just ease vehicular traffic, but also improve connectivity of the state capital with Bihta via the elevated 20km road,” Yadav said.

A BSRDC official said the road between DRM office and Saguna Mor is being widened with an estimated expenditure of Rs 72 crore. “Encroachments at some places on the road will be removed for its widening. Two service lanes will also be constructed on each side,” the official added.

He, however, said the BSRDC was facing problems in relocating the trees coming on the alignment of the road. “The trees located on the widened stretch of Saguna Mor- Danapur DRM office road have been identified. They will be translocated at other locations without any damage after the state government’s nod,” he said.

Meanwhile, residents of several localities, including Khagaul, Danapur, Bailey Road and Saguna Mor said they face frequent traffic jams due to damage or absence of road dividers on the stretch between DRM office and Saguna Mor. They blamed the poor management of road for traffic jams and accidents.

Amit Kumar, a resident of Saguna Mor, said, “Movement of vehicles on Danapur-Saguna Mor is very difficult and dangerous as well. I avoid using the road at night.”

BSRDC managing director Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said Saguna Mor-Danapur road is one of the most accident-prone roads in the city. “According to a survey conducted in 2019, the road comes under 110 identified black spots in the state. The road is being widened to avoid accidents,” he said.

Agarwal said vehicular traffic on the road will increase in the days to come. “No unauthorized cuts will be kept on this road in order to avoid accidents,” he added.

74,['4/01/2020'],Gujarat: Diamond broker cheated of diamonds worth Rs 26.32 lakh,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Representative image

SURAT: One person was booked at Varachha police station for cheating a diamond broker of polished diamonds worth Rs26.32 lakh here on Friday. Accused Anil Padghal, who runs a shop in Mini Bazaar of Varachha , took two packets of polished diamonds from Ashvin Patel for confirming their genuineness before buying, but replaced them with fake diamonds. The packets contained 41.21 and 27.73 carats of polished diamonds worth Rs 26,32,430.

Ashvin had met Anil in his shop at minibazaar Varachha on December 7, 2019 to convince him to buy the diamonds from him. The accused smooth talked the victim to hand over the diamond packets to him for some time to assess their genuineness but very cleverly replaced them with duplicate ones.

Ashvin later realized that he was cheated. He went to Surat diamond Association (SDA) where a group of people checked the two packets and found fake diamonds in them.

PATNA: The human chain scheduled to be organised by the state government on January 19 is likely to be at least 16,200km-long. The human chain, aimed at promoting the state government’s Jal-Jivan-Hariyali campaign, prohibition and garnering people’s support for eradication of social evils like child marriage and dowry, will be organised across the state from 11.30am to 12 noon.

A senior government official said this year’s human chain will be 20% longer than the previous one organised in January 2018, which was 13,660km-long.

This is for the third time that the state government will be organising human chain. The state government has approved Rs 19.40 crore from Bihar contingency fund for human chain formation this year. The epicentre of the human chain will be Gandhi Maidan in Patna, from where four branches will move in four directions to touch borders of the state.

In 2018, the human chain was formed against dowry and child marriage and though it was targeted to be 13,660km, the government had announced it touched 13,660km mark. The first human chain was formed in 2017 in favour of prohibition and its length was around 11,285km.

Kumar Ramuj, director at mass education directorate, told TOI on Friday that efforts were on to make the human chain formation a big success. “All districts have fixed the length of the human chain to be covered by them and are working on it. District magistrates and district programme officers have been asked to look after necessary arrangements,” he said.

Another official of mass education directorate said so far seven lakh slogans on Jal-Jivan-Hariyali mission have been made. “Kala jathha artists have started performing street plays at panchayat level to make people aware about the upcoming human chain and its purpose,” the official added.

Awareness programmes in schools: The state education department has started organising several activities in government as well as private schools, such as essay, painting and singing competitions, to aware children about the purpose of proposed human chain formation on January 19.

Ramesh Chandra, assistant director at mass education directorate, said students from only Class V and above will take part in the human chain. “We have included government as well as private schools in this awareness programme for better outreach,” Chandra added.

PATNA: A multi-state right-wing fringe group’s Bihar unit president is on the police’s radar for his alleged involvement in the killing of the 18-year-old youth Amir Hanjla, who had gone missing after taking part in an anti-CAA protest march at Phulwarisharif ’s Tamtam Padaw area in Patna on December 21.

Amir’s body was fished out from a water body inside the Phulwarisharif block office premises on December 31. Altogether five people have been arrested in the case, including three history-sheeters, Chaitu Kumar, Deepak Mahto and Sanoj Kumar.

Police said after violence broke out during the protest march on December 21, Amir had entered the Uttari Sangat locality where he was attacked and beaten to death.

Phulwarisharif SHO Rafique-ur-Rahman, while refusing to disclose the name of the group’s state unit president, said his role in inciting the violence surfaced during the march organised on the day RJD called a statewide bandh.

“He was the key conspirator in Amir’s killing. He had even told the killers to dispose of the body and that he will take care of the rest,” the SHO said, quoting the confessions of those arrested in connection with the murder and rioting.

Rahman said all five arrested so far are members of the fringe outfit. “The group’s district president, involved in the killing, is still evading arrest,” the SHO said, adding, those arrested have criminal cases including murders.

He also said that police moved court on Friday to seek proclamation notices for property attachment against 32 accused, including the district president of the outfit, named in the FIR lodged in connection with the December 21 rioting.

“Several of these accused, against whom police moved court, are also involved in Amir’s murder,” Rahamn said, adding, attachment of their properties would begin soon.

The SHO said altogether 60 named accused have been arrested till now in connection with the rioting in which two constables and 10 people were injured. Of the 10, six had suffered gunshot injuries.

Ram Vilas Paswan

PATNA: LJP founder and Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Friday reiterated that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act was aimed at granting citizenship and not taking it away.

In a flurry of tweets made on Friday morning, Paswan said minorities, dalits, tribals and backwards will not be unnecessarily hassled to prove their citizenship. He also said that even the Muslims of the country need not worry. “Leave apart citizenship, no government can question their rights,” he said.

Sharing his views on the proposed National Register of Citizens ( NRC ), Paswan, who is a member of the Rajya Sabha said that there has been no discussion on it till date and it does not discriminate against any religion

. “No one can be devoid of citizenship based on their religion,” he said.About the National Population Register (NPR), which has recently received a nod from the Union cabinet, the Union minister said that it is primarily a census exercise. “Census started in 1887 and it is updated after every 10 years. It does not talk about citizenship. It only covers aspects such as number of members in a family among others,” he tweeted.

Attacking the Congress-led opposition for misleading people over NRC, Paswan in another tweet said that Citizenship Act was amended in 2003, which envisaged the concept of NRC. “The UPA government was formed in 2004, which could have repealed it. However, rather than repealing it, the then union home minister P Chidambaram had said on May 7, 2010 that NRC will be a subset of NPR,” Paswan tweeted.

He also stated that rumours are being spread that people belonging to SC/ST and other deprived section of the society, who will not be able to furnish documents related will be put in a suspicion list, is completely false. “Any person applying for citizenship registration with the competent authority will be granted the same on the basis of evidences, witnesses or locals,” he tweeted.

In another tweet, Paswan stated that CAA is against infiltrators. That is why it was passed by both the Houses of the Parliament, including the Rajya Sabha, where the NDA is not in a majority..

Madurai: Madras high court has directed the secretary of Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board (TNUSRB) to peruse the medical records of a candidate who claimed to have sustained fracture injuries on his left leg, and take a decision on permitting him to attend the second stage of physical tests on an alternate date.

K Manikandan, an undergraduate and resident of Virudhunagar district, stated in his petition that he had cleared the written examination for the post of grade II constable, grade II jail warden/ firemen by securing 56 marks and subsequently become eligible to attend the first stage of physical test.

He attended the physical test which includes height, weight and chest measurement at a stadium on the Ramanathapuram district collectorate campus on November 6.

After completing the 1,500 metres running, he said he fell down and sustained fracture in his left leg. He stated that he was admitted to the Ramanathapuram government hospital for treatment. Due to this he was unable to attend the second stage of physical test which includes rope climbing, long jump and 400 metres running.

He submitted a representation to the authorities explaining that he would not be able to attend the second stage on November 9. Saying that joining the police force was his childhood ambition, he prayed that an alternate date be allowed for him to attend the second stage of physical test.

Since the representation was not considered, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench which heard his petition on Friday.

Justice M S Ramesh observed that since the petitioner had cleared the first stage of physical test and was unable to attend the second stage as he claims to have sustained fracture injuries, a sympathetic view can be taken in this regard.

Hence the judge directed the petitioner to submit his medical records to the secretary of TNUSRB and it was open to them to take a decision on permitting him to participate in the second stage of physical test.

HYDERABAD: The inter-linking of Godavari and Krishna rivers to benefit drought-prone areas in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh has been shelved. The much-hyped plan fell apart following the AP government’s reluctance to take up the project owing to huge costs involved and its focus shifting to linking of Godavari and Penna rivers on its soil, highly-placed sources said.Sources said irrigation experts’ opinion on how diversion of Godavari water was not desirable at this stage and how it could lead to inter-state disputes also had a bearing on the decision to not proceed with the plan. With no meetings and no reports filed, senior officials said it’s curtains for the mega plan Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and his AP counterpart YS Jaganmohan Reddy had worked out in June last year.“Since meetings of both the states have not been happening in the past few months, there were no reports either,” Telangana chief engineer (irrigation, inter-state issues) S Narasimha Rao told TOI. Rao is one of the key members of a high-level committee constituted by both the governments to work out the plan for effective utilisation of Godavari water.Senior officials also cited high costs. As per an initial estimate, at least Rs 2 lakh crore to divert 4 tmcft daily and Rs 1.5 lakh crore to divert 2 tmcft daily would be required. “Even if both states were to share 50% each, the project cost will swell to Rs 50,000 crore to Rs 1 lakh crore in next 4-5 years, which is huge. The present financial condition of both the states is not conducive to take up such a project,” a senior irrigation official said.Also, the AP government wants to focus on linking of Godavari and Penna rivers first. “Detailed project reports have already been worked out to take up this plan,” an official said. Sources said AP backtracked after farmers’ bodies and political parties there raised concerns over the probability of AP farmers losing their land, while Telangana benefiting from the project.Sources said the Institution of Engineers (India) compiled a report of irrigation engineers’ opinions after the round-table conference in July 2019 and sent it to the Telangana government. “The report clearly mentioned that any diversion of Godavari water to other basins should be done only after meeting the requirements of existing, ongoing and contemplated irrigation schemes and also considering future requirements of industries and drinking water,” a source said.Experts also observed that the project cannot be designed based on flood-flow water, but on assured water. Though Telangana government claimed that 2,000 tmcft was available and it was wasted as it flowed into the sea, experts dismissed this theory, arguing that availability of water was less than the projected quantity if all the existing projects were completed. “We are keen on completing other irrigation projects such as Kaleshwaram, Tupakulagudem and Dummugudem,” Narasimha Rao said.Sources said KCR was unhappy as inter-linking of rivers was his brainchild and the latest development could have an impact on future ties between both Telugu states.While the two chief ministers harp on harmonious relations, irrigation officials of both states have been at loggerheads during the recent meetings of Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) and Godavari River Management Board. In the previous KRMB meetings, Telangana officials charged AP with using more water than allocated water from Krishna. AP also made no bones about its opposition to various projects taken up by Telangana, especially Palamuru-Rangareddy Lift Irrigation Project.In Video: Andhra and Telangana quietly bury river-linking plan",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73093069,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1007039,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ap-t-quietly-bury-plan-to-link-godavari-krishna/articleshow/73091622.cms

CLEARED SKHER

SLUG: Kalammawadi Pipeline

Kolhapur: The Kalammawadi direct pipeline project is set to be delayed by another year, nearly four years longer than the original deadline .

The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) launched the Rs 488 crore water supply project in December 2013 and was expected to be completed by 2016. However, the project has not been completed yet.

According to the project, a pipeline has to be led along 52-km to bring water to the city. Officials claimed that 65% of the work has been done. The private firm executing the project was granted an extension to complete the project till December 31, 2019.

“The contractor has sought an extension of one year to complete the work. The firm has cited reasons such as heavy rains during monsoon and local opposition to lay the pipelines as the reason for the delay in the work. We are going to present the details of the project before the steering committee under mayor Surmanjiri Latkar and seek permission for the extension of the deadline,” said a senior KMC official, requesting anonymity.

The officials are going to visit the various sites of the project before the meeting. The contractor firm has claimed that dewatering at the dam site has not yet been completed and the Kalammawadi dam is filled completely.

According to the officials, the release of the water from March may give the company the scope to carry out the work of jack-well and pumping station. The locals from Solankur village had stopped the work of laying down the pipeline, alleging that it would damage their houses and have demanded to change the route of the pipeline.

“We have talked to the villagers several times. They are not ready to accept. The change in the route of the pipeline is not possible at this stage since all other things such as estimates of the project will change. We have left the task to convince the villagers to the public representatives,” said the official.

Speaking about the project, minister of state Satej Patil said he would ensure that the two officers are appointed to monitor the project. “It will help speed up the work,” said Patil.

Madurai: DMK has performed well at both the panchayat union and district panchayat levels in the recent rural local body elections in the district. In fact, the AIADMK has ended up conceding the post of district panchayat chairman to the DMK as it could secure only nine seats in the district panchayat wards.

Ashok Kumar of DMK was the district panchayat chairman in 2011 which was wrested by the AIADMK in the next election. This time the post has been reserved for a female candidate whose name will be officially declared by the DMK president on Saturday. The DMK has sprung a surprise by performing well in the strongholds of local minister R B Udaykumar — Thiruparankundram and Thirumangalam. This was despite the minister’s impressive ground work in these unions and intensive campaigning.

Madurai district has 13 panchayat unions and a total of 214 panchayat union wards. Two members were elected unopposed and elections were held to the remaining 212 posts. The DMK secured 92 panchayat union ward members, and the AIADMK 89. In Thiruparankundram union, 15 ward members were elected from the DMK and only six from the AIADMK. In Thirumangalam union, the AIADMK secured 10 ward members against the DMK’s three. The AMMK which emerged the third largest party in Madurai secured seven panchayat union ward member posts including one from Thiruparankundram union. Congress got four panchayat union ward members, BJP three and DMDK three.

In the district panchayat council, only DMK and AIADMK managed to secure seats, with one independent candidate getting elected from Chellampatti. Neither Congress nor BJP was able to win a district panchayat ward seat.

Hyderabad: Those protesting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) are not begging for citizenship but claiming their right, said Faizan Mustafa, vice-chancellor (VC) of Nalsar University of Law.

Delivering a speech on “the state of the citizen” organised by Manthan, a forum for public discourse at Vidyaranya School on Friday, the Nalsar VC spoke of citizenship and the anxiety among people over the topic.

“Those protesting in Delhi under extreme cold weather conditions are not fighting for citizenship but for the values that the Republic holds. Every person protesting the CAA or NRC is not seeking or begging for the citizenship but claiming his/her social rights,” said Mustafa, adding that the government is trying to grant what already belongs to the members of this country who are committed to the Preamble.

The VC, elaborating on citizenship laws in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, said: “No country has religion as a condition to claim citizenship. If India is wanting to go below these countries, I don’t know what to say.”

The Nalsar VC reacted on the external ministry’s statement on NRC that it was an internal matter. “The external minister recently made a statement that NRC was an internal matter. Subsequently, he said that they have briefed the diplomats from other countries about the same. If it is an internal matter, then what is the need to brief diplomats from other countries?” questioned Mustafa.

The official admitted that the water treatment plants are old. At present, disinfection is carried out by chlorination and turbidity is removed by settling and sedimentation at the treatment plants. “Based on the results from the laboratory, we will make changes in the plants and clear the basins of the sediments,” the official added.

According to the officials, the equipment such as flash mixers, air blower, washpumps, tank mixers and clariflocculators installed at these pumping stations need to be changed or repaired.

“We have drafted the estimate of Rs 65 lakh to repair some of these equipments. A separate estimate regarding the new components to be fixed at these pumping stations will be submitted for approval,” said the official.

Meanwhile, a meeting has been called to discuss all the drinking water issues on Saturday. Standing committee chairman Sharangdhar Deshmukh is going to chair the meeting. Deshmukh had led the delegation to the WTPs in December 2019 and had made suggestions to the officials to ensure clean water is supplied to the citizens.

91,['4/01/2020'],Row over village panel hits Avaniapuram jallikattu preps,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Madurai: The Avaniapuram jallikattu, the event that heralds the season of the bull-taming sport in Tamil Nadu from Pongal day, has run into trouble again with a village committee staking claim to conduct the game this year and most communities demanding representation on it.

Last year, the game witnessed a dispute over who should conduct the game — the Avaniapuram village committee or the Thenkal Pasana Vivasayigal Sangam. The court had then constituted a committee headed by a former judge and advocates to ensure fair conduct of the game. Since receptions and fanfare are a part of the celebrations and money is collected from the donors and public, the court ordered that all donations be accounted for in detail with receipts. The organizing committee was authorized to collect the donations.

This year too disagreements have cropped up and peace committees were convened twice by the Madurai south tahsildar. It was first decided that the village committee would conduct the games this year but in a subsequent meeting it was resolved that only a committee having representatives of all communities should conduct the game. Village leader Kannan told TOI that earlier it had been a village committee of eight people including president, secretary and treasurer which conducted the event successfully. There were about 15 different communities living in Avaniapuram but some like chettiars and Sourashtrians did not seek representation.

District administration sources said that preparations for the game this year would start only after the people of Avaniapuram came to a settlement on who would conduct it. Collector T G Vinay convened a meeting of the villagers and revenue officials on Friday evening and asked them to ensure that people from all communities had representation on the village committee.

Among southern districts, the ruling party bagged majority of district panchayat councillors in four districts... Read More

MADURAI: This will be the first time that the opposition has outperformed the ruling party in a local body poll in the state as political commentators attribute AIADMK downfall to its support to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Among southern districts, the ruling party bagged majority of district panchayat councillors in four districts while DMK in three. In Sivaganga, both parties share eight seats each which will make electing the chairman for district panchayat a tough task.

In Madurai, DMK won 13 of 23 district panchayat councillor seats, AIADMK nine and one by an independent. The DMK also secured 15 wards Thiruparankundram panchayat union against AIADMK’s six. Thiruparankundram has been an AIADMK fortress where local minister R B Udayakumar has done a lot of groundwork.

AIADMK rural local body election in-charge for Madurai, M S Pandian says that the performance in rural local body elections should not be linked with anti-incumbency. “People in local bodies know their representatives well and always vote for them, based on the candidate’s previous performance and outreach,” he said, adding that the party had performed well in the region.

On why they conceded Thiruparankundram, he said that it could be due to ‘false propaganda’ of the opposition parties against the CAA. “It could have been a reason because people tend to believe false news when it is reinforced many times, but a person who goes through the act carefully will realise that true citizens of India would not be affected,” he said, adding that Sri Lankan refugees had never asked for Indian citizenship and that their party was only in favour of providing dual citizenship to them.

Former DMK Madurai district secretary V Velusamy is happy with his party’s performance. “People are watching the rulers and are taking note of how the AIADMK government is blindly doing everything that the BJP at the centre is telling them, though it is against the welfare of the people of the state,” he said.

“BJP on the other hand is taking away government jobs from the people of Tamil Nadu . The state government had done nothing in terms of infrastructure development. Nothing was done to develop the Tamil language, which are some of the reasons for AIADMK’s poor performance in Madurai,” he added.

“The people have realised after 40 years that only DMK president M K Stalin can bring about real development in the villages and voted in favour of the DMK and its allies in the rural local body polls,” said former DMK minister I Periyasamy, after celebrating their victory in 16 out of 23 district council wards in Dindigul. The AIADMK won seven seats. According to him Stalin’s Namakku Namae programme and village connect activities had helped them register a big victory.

In Theni district panchayat, the AIADMK emerged the winner with 8 out of the 10 seats. Virudhunagar, went in favour of the AIADMK with 13 out of 20 and seven for the DMK. However, the DMK alliance performed well in Virudhunagar panchayat unions winning nine out of the 11 unions.

Tuticorin district panchayat was secured by the AIADMK and its allies with 12 seats in its favour and DMK just five out of the total 17 seats. Kanyakumari district council was also bagged by the AIADMK along with its allies, winning 6 out of the 11 seats.

MADURAI: Thousands of doctors across India are set to write their National Eligibility cum Entrance Test-Post Graduate (Neet-PG) exam 2020 on Sunday for a seat in the specialty MD, MS and PG diploma courses available at various government and private colleges in the country. In Madurai too, after months of preparation, medicos are set to appear for this exam.

“Notably, Tamil Nadu students have performed really well in Neet-PG exams in stark contrast to Neet-UG exams. Even last year, a girl from Madurai had secured the ninth rank in the all India ranking. We are positive. We have around 250-300 students this year in a batch from Madurai, Theni and Sivagangai,” said Tamilselvam, co-ordinator from one of the biggest Neet-PG coaching centres in Madurai.

On January 5, Neet-PG candidates will be writing a 3 hour 30 minute-computer-based exam answering 300 multiple-choice questions under three parts, with the first part for 50 marks, second part for 100 marks and the third part for 150 marks. “This is my first time attempting Neet-PG exam. Even if we prepare our best and revise properly, questions are always unpredictable. The exam also has negative marking, which means we have to be careful about what we choose to answer or we’ll be losing marks unnecessarily,” said a Neet-PG aspirant, who aims to get a seat for MD general surgery course.

While some are first-timers, there others who are repeating the exam . “It is not uncommon for students to repeat the Neet-PG exam. I’ve also seen some students who repeat the exam just to get their seat of choice. Some seats are very difficult to get and requires a second or even a third attempt. Every year, we have at least 20-25 students like that,” added Tamilselvam.

This year, five Neet-PG examination centres have been allotted in Madurai namely, Senthamarai College of Arts and Science, KLN College of Engineering, Vickram Teacher Training College, PTR College of Engineering and Technology, and Thanapandiyan Polytechnic College.

On the day of the exam, candidates must bring a printed copy of admit card with their photo pasted on it, photocopy of their SMC or MCI registration, and any one of their authorized photo IDs, either PAN card, driving license, Voter ID, Passport or Aadhaar card with photo. Security checks involving ID verification, capturing thumb prints and digital image and frisking to check for possession of electronic items, jewellery, stationery items or even food will also be done.

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Raja Singh

HYDERABAD: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Raja Singh , on Friday, reiteritated his threat to kill the Owaisi brothers and said that he will ensure “the end of people” opposing Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

“Why do people have a problem with CAA and NRC? It is not a threat to Indian Muslims. While CAA and NRC will clean infiltrators, I will clear the ones supporting them,” said Singh.

Muslim groups protested on Friday against a controversial interview by Singh to a local channel a few weeks ago, where he threatened to kill Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi and his MLA brother Akbaruddin Owaisi .

“Just leave us (Owaisi brothers and me) for five minutes, you decide the place. I am telling both of you, Akbaruddin Owaisi and Asaduddin Owaisi. It’s two versus one, you guys leave your security and I will also leave my security. In five minutes vaalani paiki pampiyakapote (if I don’t kill them), I will change my name,” Singh had said in an interview weeks ago, which went viral on Friday.

“I am not secular, I am Hindutva wadi and India will be a Hindu Rashtra,” he claimed.

On Friday, Singh justified his interview and said it was in response to a hate speech by Akbaruddin in 2013, where he threatened to eliminate a community. Owaisi was booked by the N Kiran Kumar Reddy Congress government and sent to jail.“Akbaruddin threatened to kill all Hindus, addressing the crowd in Nirmal. My statement is a reply to his comment,” Singh told TOI. “In self-defence, I can kill him back, as I am also a Hindu.”

AIMIM demanded the state government take serious note of public representatives disturbing peace in Hyderabad. “Public representatives who fail to deliver often resort to communalise issues to win over public,” said Syed Taraq Quadripartite, president of AIMIM. “Instead of MLA Raja Singh, inviting Owaisi brothers for a fight in an akhara, it will be in the state’s interest that both MLAs compete in their respective jurisdiction and not fool citizens.”

97,['4/01/2020'],GRID code may give Hyderabad ITs mojo back,"Cyber tower

HYDERABAD: Move over LEAP (Look East Policy), the Telangana government is now giving finishing touches to a new policy, the Hyderabad GRID (Growth In Dispersion) policy for ensuring better distribution of the IT industry across the city as part of efforts to ease congestion in the saturated western parts that have seen unbridled growth due to the IT/ITeS explosion.So, if LEAP was designed to woo developers and IT players to set up shop in east Hyderabad, the proposed GRID policy will be tailored to incentivise them to put up IT parks, malls and hotels in the northern and southern parts of the city as well, sources with knowledge of the matter said.“Earlier the government was looking at only fast-tracking IT development in east Hyderabad . But now the focus is on dispersion of the sector across the city to correct the lopsided development of the past few years. Most of these incentives and benefits will be tailored in such a manner that they don’t pinch the government and at the same time benefit developers and IT units,” said a source.The idea is to offer financial and flexibility-related incentives across four categories – developers, IT units (companies leasing space), star hotels (developers and operators) as well as supermalls (developers and retailers) willing to set up projects in eastern, northern and southern parts of the city, sources pointed out.According to sources, to sweeten the deal, the government is considering financial sops such as reduction/waiver of development fee, impact fee and state GST for those setting up projects in areas other than west Hyderabad. In terms of flexibility, a relaxation in the minimum IT processing area requirement of 60:40 ratio for projects planned on government allotted land is one of the key benefits. Currently, developers putting up projects on government allotted land in west Hyderabad have to utilise at least 60% of the area only for IT processing.“The economics of the thing is that if someone wants to develop an IT park or lease space, the government will make it much more lucrative for them to set up shop in the northern, eastern or southern parts of the city than on the western side,” said the source, adding that focus would be on promoting areas such as Uppal, Pocharam, Adibatla, Shamshabad, Kollur, Usmannagar, Bachupally, Kompally and the Budwel cluster by also improving physical and social infrastructure in these areas.When contacted, Jayesh Ranjan, principal secretary, IT and industries departments, confirmed to TOI that the GRID policy was indeed in the works. “The proposed policy has already been approved by the IT minister and is now awaiting approval of other departments such as municipal administration & urban development (MA&UD), energy, revenue and finance after which it will be sent to the cabinet for final approval,” Ranjan said. He, however, refused to divulge any details about the proposed policy.“The proposed policy has already been approved by the IT minister and is now awaiting approval of other departments such as municipal administration & urban development (MA&UD), energy, revenue and finance after which it will be sent to the cabinet for final approval,” Ranjan said.

Kottayam: Governor Arif Mohammed Khan urged vice-chancellors of universities in the state to act according to their varsities’ laws and statutes and not to succumb to any external pressure.

Addressing the members of syndicate and faculty of MG University (MGU) in the varsity campus here on Friday, the governor, who is also the chancellor of the university, hinted about the interference of the state government and political parties in the matters related to varsities.

Without mentioning the recent controversies involving MGU like the mark donation row, the governor asked the gathering whether recent issues will help in making MGU into a nationally acclaimed varsity or will it downgrade its reputation. “How come this has happened in this university,” he asked.

“My feeling is that vice-chancellors are not allowed to act freely. There is too much undesirable pressure on them. And, I have told all vice-chancellors that their duty is to conduct the affairs of their universities in accordance with the law and statutes. And, if anyone from the varsity tries to put pressure on you to do something, which is a departure from the law and statutes, then make it clear to them that you are not going to act and refer the matter to me. And, I the chancellor will take the responsibility. Succumbing to pressure not only brings bad name, it leads to erosion of the autonomy of the academic institutions,” he said.

“I had discussed the issue (mark donation row) with Rajan Gurukkal, the former VC of MGU, who is the vice-chairperson of the state higher education council. After studying a lot of materials, he is fully convinced that he has rightly understood the issue. He says constitutionally and legally speaking the state government cannot issue any directives to them. The bylaws of the universities have protected them from interference from the state government. And, they are accountable to the chancellor. However, most of the time, the chancellor has acted more as the governor than chancellor. They have kept away from the responsibilities of the varsity,” said Khan.

MADURAI: A counter case registered against a postgraduate (PG) doctor by the two women who assaulted the doctor at a labour ward in Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) was closed by the police on Friday.

On December 14, a patient’s kin attacked a PG doctor, Dr Malathi in the maternity ward after they were denied entry into a sterile ward with her footwear on. The doctors and hospital staff staged a protest in the campus after this incident.

In response, an FIR was registered against the accused Raja Rajeshwari and Murugeshwari under the Tamil Nadu Hospital Protection Act 2008 based on the PG doctor’s complaint. The accused were also later arrested.

Reportedly at the same time, an FIR was also registered against Dr Malathi based on the complaint given by the two women.

“However, nobody had any knowledge of it including the GRH authorities till now. The police had not consulted with anyone before registering the FIR. This in fact suggests a loophole in the Tamil Nadu Hospital Protection Act 2008 putting doctors at risk of having counter cases filed against them. Immediately, we convened a meeting and demanded the police to close the case,” said one of the PG doctors at GRH.

On the other hand, police sources said that the counter-FIR was registered as per due process but the counter case has been closed now after talks with GRH dean Dr Sangumani J as well. “There was no evidence found to substantiate the two women’s complaints, according to the investigating officer. The accused were also not admitted to hospital. So, the counter case has been closed now,” said a police source.

The AMC has already drawn a budget of over Rs 31 crore for the project.Stretches such as the Sindhu Bhavan Road — especially the Maple County to Ornet-3 stretch — and roads leading to Sola Science City, and roads behind the Avalon hotel stretch in Thaltej are among those undergoing repairs. Also being revamped are Arise Icon Road near SG Highway, the Shilaj-Rancharda village road, the SP Ring Road to Shilaj Bridge stretch, the International Global School to Tragad stretch, Vishesh Residency Road in Gota area, and the Doctor House to CK Patel Party Plot stretch.Realtors said that much of the area enclosed between SP Ring Road and SG Highway was in R2 residential zone, where only lowrise ‘G plus 2’ (10m buildings) were allowed initially. “This changed a few years ago and 45m buildings were allowed on 18m wide roads,” said Rajiv Patel, a realtor and entrepreneur. “This allowed builders to go beyond 1.2 FSI (for lowrises) to 4 FSI after purchasing TDRs of 2.2 FSI on certain road stretches.”Past president of GIHED-CREDAI Dipak Patel said: “The jump in commercial development in the areas between SP Ring Road and SG Highway will be compensated by affordable housing coming up in Shela, Ghuma, and parts of Bopal. This balance was missing on the western side of SG Highway.”Deputy municipal commissioner, northwest zone, Mukesh Gadhvi, said: “The northwest zone will see roads worth Rs 117 crore coming up in the 2020-21 period.”",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/citys-emerging-realty-hub/articleshow/73091927.cms

CLEARED SKHER

Kolhapur: Over 60,000 farmers from the Kolhapur district are likely to get benefits of the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule farmer loan waiver scheme of the state government.

District collector Daulat Desai said the total loan waiver amount could go up to Rs 410.59 crore from the district.

Desai said as many as 60,401 farmers’ loan was due from April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2019 in the district. Of this, around 35,893 farmers owed Rs 189 crore to the district bank and nationalized and private banks had given loans to 24,508 farmers of Rs 221.41 crore in all.

The preliminary list of beneficiaries suggested that around 8,472 farmers are yet to link their Aadhaar with their respective bank account. Desai said the farmers have been instructed to comply with the formality by January 21. The final list of beneficiaries, according to the district collector, will be announced on January 31.

He further said that from February 1, the list of beneficiaries will be uploaded online and the whole process will continue till March 31. The loan waiver will be deposited in the respective beneficiary’s account between March 15 to April 15, he said.

He added that as per the scheme, loan up to Rs two lakh taken between April 1, 2015, and March 31, 2019, and which has not been repaid till September 30, 2019, will be eligible for the waiver.

The state government had last week issued a resolution, which stated that farmers, whose crop loan and restructured loan is more than Rs two lakh will not be eligible for any benefit under the scheme.

It added that a district-level committee of the finance and cooperation department will take a decision on whether to include the (non-performing assets) accounts of farmers in nationalised, private and rural banks in the loan waiver scheme.

109,['4/01/2020'],SP Marg in eye of storm over new parking charges,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Allahabad: Civil Lines’ Sardar Patel (SP) Marg is in news again because of its parking problems. Visitors to the market are irked over Prayagraj Municipal Corporation (PMC) introducing higher parking rates at the new parking lot constructed in SP Marg ’s third lane.

One would have to pay Rs 30 and Rs 15 per hour for parking four-wheelers and two-wheelers respectively at the lot. They would have to cough up Rs 20 and Rs 10 respectively for every extra hour.

The resentment over parking charges is not restricted to just visitors, but shopkeepers too. Members of the Civil Lines Vyapaar Mandal have also urged PMC to reduce the charges and increase the number of hours for which a vehicle could be parked. The parking charges at the multi-level parking in Civil Lines and Purva Mahila Polytechnic are lower when compared to the parking facility at SP Marg’s third lane.

At Purva Mahila polytechnic ground, commuters pay Rs 20 for parking a four-wheeler and Rs 10 for a two-wheeler for the first two hours. After two hours, they pay an additional Rs 10 and Rs 5 per hour for the two and four-wheelers respectively.

However, municipal officials have a completely different rationale for the differential parking charges.

Additional municipal commissioner Mushir Ahmad said, “The higher parking charges at SP Marg’s third lane were so fixed to discourage people from using two-wheelers and four-wheelers and thereby remove traffic bottlenecks in the area.”

One of the visitors to the parking stand, Ajay Tripathi said, “The new parking facility might help visitors relax and shop, but the parking rates are too high.”

A shopkeeper on SP Marg said that the parking facility on Purva Mahila Polytechnic Ground might have helped them shore up their businesses, but most customers preferred to park their vehicles along SP Marg’s third lane out of sheer convenience.

Kolhapur: The last rites of Sandeep Sawant—the 25-year-old soldier who lost his life while fighting infiltrators in Jammu and Kashmir—were performed with full state honours at his native place in Mundhe on Friday.

The district administration received Sawant’s mortal remains kept in a coffin wrapped in the tricolour in Karad on Friday morning. Soldiers took out a procession from Karad’s Vijay Chowk to Shahu Chowk via Kolhapur Naka to Munde village, where thousands of residents congregated for the last rites.

Thousands of citizens gathered at national highway 4 to get a last glimpse of the martyr , who had visited his village just a fortnight ago to see his two-month infant. Chants of “Sandeep Sawant Amar Rahe” reverberated the air when the procession began from Vijay Chowk.

The roads leading up to the village were decorated with flowers in the tricolour and rangoli. Emotions ran high among the villagers when the Maratha Light Infantry offered respects by opening two rounds of fire and blew the bugle. Sawant’s elder brother Sagar, who in an emotionally vulnerable state, lit the pyre.

MP Srinivas Patil and MLA Prithviraj Chavan were among a host of political leaders present for the last rites. Satara district collector Shweta Singhal and superintendent of police Tejaswi Satpute offered their condolences to the slain soldier’s family.

Sawant lost his life on Wednesday morning while fighting infiltrators in Naushera sector, Jammu and Kashmir. He hailed from Mundhe village in Karad taluka of Satara district. He is survived by his father, mother, wife and a two-month-old daughter.

The Maratha Light Infantry Naik spotted a few infiltrators, who were trying to cross the border. Sandeep was accompanied by Arjun Thapa Magar of Gorkha Rifles. Both of them opened fire at the infiltrators. The Indian Army cordoned the area from where the infiltrators were trying to cross the border. However, Sawant and Thapa were seriously injured in the cross firing and later succumbed to their injuries.

112,['4/01/2020'],Don’t overload cane tractors: RTO tells sugar mills,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Kolhapur: The Regional Transport Office ( RTO ), Kolhapur, has asked the farmers as well as the sugar mills in the district to refrain from overloading sugar cane in their transport vehicles this crushing season.

In the rural and semi-urban parts of the district as well as the surrounding region, trailers attached to tractors are often used to transport cane. At times, these transport vehicles are overloaded with cane, thus increasing the risk of road accidents.

The directive of the the RTO comes in the wake of the recent incident in which a truck overloaded with sugar cane lost balance on Thursday at the Ambap phata on National Highway-4, around 10 km from the city. There were no casualties in the incident.

Regional transport officer Steven Alvares said that the RTO is keeping a strict vigil on the sugar cane transport and will take strict action against overloaded cane trucks or tractors and the ones that are found operating without reflectors.

Kolhapur district — known for its sugar industry — has a number of sugar factories located on the outskirts of the city as well as in rural areas. Therefore, cane carrying trucks or tractors often take the highway route at night to reach their destinations. In such cases, if these cane carrying trucks or tractors are overloaded and operate without reflectors, it increases the risk of accidents, said Alvares.

“The capacity of a trolley depends on its size. Most of the trollies carry sugar cane beyond their set capacity. Also, they are not even equipped with reflectors. This could lead to accidents during night. Many accidents take place every year due to the absence of reflectors. Therefore, we have initiated a campaign in association with sugar mills this year. The mills have been asked to keep a check on the reflectors or they will have to share the blame in case of any accident caused,” Alvares said.

Awareness among tractor owners along with sugar factories in the district is something that has been found to be helpful in reducing such incidents, he said.

113,['4/01/2020'],Stuffing of explosives into H2O block to begin today,"This story is from January 4, 2020

A van containing explosives parked on Holy Faith apartment premises on Friday.

KOCHI: Twelve licensed experts will start stuffing explosives into the readied holes in the Holy Faith H2O block at Maradu at 6am on Saturday. Four of the 12 are from South Africa, one a UK national and the rest are Indians. They include shot-firers and blasters.

Edifice Engineering, the company tasked with demolishing H2O, Jains Coral Cove and Golden Kayaloram, received clearance from the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO) on Friday, albeit with 25 conditions. Vijay Steels and Explosives had received permission to raze Alfa Serene earlier.

The explosives will be transported by van from the storage facility to the building site every morning.

The filling of explosives will start at 6am every day and wind up at 6pm. When H2O is half-readied, 10 experts will move to the Coral Cove. However, two will see the work on H2O through. When 50% work on Coral Cove is completed, eight experts will move on to Kayaloram, with the rest remaining at Coral Cove to complete the work. The three buildings are expected to be fully ladden by January 10. Meanwhile, Vijay Steels will start filling Alfa Serene with explosives on January 6.

The technical committee, which met on Friday evening, could not take a decision on the demand of the residents near Alfa Serene on swapping the demolition dates of its twin towers. It is learned that the dates are unlikely to be swapped since this could disrupt the plans of the agency to proceed with the blasting on January 11 and 12.

“We have lined up the explosives keeping in mind the demolition dates. Swapping of dates could disrupt the plan, forcing the demolition agency to rework the schedule. This is difficult, but possible. If the government seeks a change of date, we will ask it to reconsider. But, if they insist, we will abide by the request. But swapping of the dates will not, in anyway, delay the demolition of the buildings,” said a source.

Another source added that there is only 50% chance for the dates being swapped. A decision is expected to be reached at a meeting to be convened by the district collector at Ernakulam Guest House on Saturday evening.

Pre-demolition work on H2O, the first to be pulled down, has been completed. with Coral Cove and Alfa Serene having undergone 90% of the work. However, only 75% work is over on Golden Kayaloram.

This had led to a sharp decline in the number of new schools approved for 2019-20.On Friday, the board decided to relax these rules, reducing the area of land required for the playground. The board had faced flak for introducing a criterion that mandated the ownership of a sizeable plot of land for starting a new school. The board authorities have decided to go back to the earlier rule, which allowed school managements to lease land for schools.“Henceforth, new schools can be set up on land that is leased for 15 years. However, if there is a change in land use purpose during this period, the school will be shut down,” a GSHSEB official said.The board has decided to reduce the area required for the school playground from 1,200 square metres to 800 square metres in urban areas. For rural areas, this has been changed from 2,000 square metres to 1,500 square metres.GSHSEB has also set new rules, including safety measures to be taken at the playgrounds and 400 square feet of dedicated space for science and computer laboratories for the secondary and higher secondary levels. The new rules also mandate 250 square feet of office space for the principal and teaching staff.“The schools must be equipped with CCTV cameras and the authorities must have the necessary BU and NA clearances. If a school is found to have submitted any false documents online for the permission, it will immediately be shut down,” the official said.For 2019-20, only 47 new schools were approved by the board, an 80% decline compared to the 226 new schools approved the previous year.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/board-relaxes-rules-for-setting-up-new-schools/articleshow/73091925.cms

Kochi: UDF on Friday decided to strengthen its protest against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and expressed surprise over chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s continued silence on governor Arif Mohammad Khan’s comments on implementing the Act in Kerala.

A meeting of UDF leaders held at Kochi on Friday said the comments made by the governor on CAA are not suitable for a person holding a constitutional post and does not reflect well with the esteem and honour associated with the the post of governor.

The meeting questioned the chief minister’s silence on the governor’s comments on CAA even when the rights of the legislative assembly are being challenged by the governor. The UDF leaders demanded that the chief minister, being the leader of the House, should meet the governor in person and register protest against the comments.

117,['4/01/2020'],"Bhopal: No expert to deal with lung, kidney disorders &amp; cancer","This story is from January 4, 2020

Bhopal Memorial Hospital & Research Centre, Bhopal

BHOPAL: Whatever data is available on the impact of methyl isocyanate (MIC) on the health of people exposed to the deadly gas in Bhopal and their progeny shows that survivors of the gas disaster have been more prone to disorders related to lungs and kidney .

Prevalence of cancer among gas victims has also been found to be on the higher side. This was the reason why the Group of Ministers on Bhopal, led by then finance minister P Chidambaram in 2010, announced a special package of Rs 10 lakh to each of the seriously ill kidney and cancer patients.

But even a cursory look at the medical facilities available at gas relief hospitals, including Bhopal Memorial Hospital & Research Centre (BMHRC), would show that there is no expert for treatment of renal disorder, cancer and trouble in respiratory system in any of those hospitals.

Purnendu Shukla, member of the Supreme Court Monitoring Committee -- constituted by the apex court to keep a watch on medical facilities being provided to gas victims in the gas relief hospitals including BMHRC -- admitted that there is no specialist to take care of patients of renal failure, lung disorders or cancer in any of the gas relief hospitals of the state government or BMHRC, a super-speciality hospital constructed at the behest of the Supreme Court to “provide best possible treatment to the gas victims”.

Shukla said that Dr Banjare, who holds charge of the nephrology department of Kamla Nehru Super Speciality Hospital of the gas relief department, is trained to take care of patients of renal failure, but he is not a specialist in nephrology. BMHRC, which had employed Dr Dinesh Upadhyay, on contract basis as a specialist in nephrology department, too, has no specialist in the department after he quit the job. He further said that Kamla Nehru Hospital at least has 10 dialysis machines, but BMHRC is facing acute shortage of dialysis machines as well. “BMHRC has only three functional dialysis machines, one of which they keep reserved for HIV+ patients. They have stopped registering new patients for dialysis due to shortage,” Shukla said.

The Rasool Ahmed Siddiqui Pulmonary Centre in Jinsi, started in 1994 with great fanfare for treatment of lung disorders among gas victims, is almost defunct. “No, it is not closed, but can only treat patients of cough and cold,” said Shukla, when asked if the pulmonary centre is closed as it has no specialists to treat patients of lung infection.

The committee — in one of its previous reports — had informed the high court that 42 state-of-the-art machines purchased at the time of the hospital's inauguration have become defunct without being used. “The gas relief department itself admitted that 32 such machines were never used and can’t be used now as they have become outdated,” he said.

No gas relief hospital has an oncologist either for treatment of gas victims suffering from cancer. After Dr Vinay Kumar quit BMHRC and joined AIIMS, Bhopal, oncology department at BMHRC is also shut. The patients are referred to three local private hospitals and usually have to bear expenses of the treatment on their own, which is later reimbursed.

Citing financial problems of the gas victims, the monitoring committee has recommended on several occasions that the gas relief hospital should make arrangement for “cashless” treatment of patients, who are referred to private hospitals, but so far, no such policy has been formed.

Nashik: Mayor Satish Kulkarni has directed the garden department of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) to hire private contractors for maintaining all gardens in the city.

Kulkarni has asked the department to ensure that one contractor is tasked with the maintenance of one garden only.

He also directed the officials to clear all garbage spots in the city at the earliest and ensure that the residents are segregating the waste into dry and wet while handing it over to garbage collection vans.

The directives of the mayor came during a recent meeting with the officials of the garden and health departments.

Presently, there are a total of 520 gardens of the NMC spread across six divisions. Of these, 290 gardens are being maintained by private contractors while the remaining are being maintained by the municipal corporation.

During the meeting, the mayor also asked the concerned officials to put up a board outside every garden with the name of its contractor along with contact numbers.

In addition, he also took review of the complaints filed by citizens about stray animals causing inconvenience to vehicular traffic. Kulkarni instructed the concerned officials to submit a detailed report about the number of stray animals in the city and the measures taken for such issues in the past.

Kulkarni also took the cognizance of the unauthorised meat shops in the city. He told officials to conduct a survey and find out the number of unauthorised meat shops in the city and take action against them.

Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia

NEW DELHI: Fulfilling a budget promise , Delhi government on Friday started distributing tablets to the meritorious students of classes XI and XII . Describing the move as a technical aid to encourage students, education minister Manish Sisodia began the distribution by handing over tablets at School of Excellence, Kalkaji.

Tablets are being provided to all students of classes XI and XII of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalayas and SoEs, and those Class XI students who secured 80% or more in CBSE’s Class X exams. Close to 15,000 students will receive these tablets.

“It is part of the education department’s continued efforts to improve the overall education system of Delhi. After working on the school infrastructure, we have been chasing this noble thought of starting schools of excellence. We started by strengthening the foundation, i.e., getting the principals and teachers trained at world-class institutions like Cambridge University and IIMs,” said Sisodia.

Handing over the tablets, the deputy chief minister said, “Today we are giving these tablets to every student who has shown glimpses of excellence.” Describing each tablet as a portable library connecting the students with their teachers and peers, Sisodia said, “We are open to ideas from students on how they wish to use this tablet for better learning and even better performance.”

He also advised the students to use the device judiciously. “It is in your hand to decide how to use this tablet — whether you want the parents to complain to me that the children have become addicted to the tablets or praise the government for facilitating the learning of their wards. I hope you will prove me right,” the minister said.

Meanwhile, to empower young girls in the field of computer science, DoE launched ‘She Codes’ programme in government schools. The programme aims to provide free and flexible computer science and coding skill programmes for girls.

BHOPAL: Day after Congress party’s frontal organization Seva Dal distributed controversial literature on Hindutva concept formulator Veer Savarkar at its training camp here, the organization said it still stands by contents of the book, “Veer Savarkar Kitne Veer?”. On Friday, Congress party and Seva Dal came under strong criticism from its political ally in Maharashtra -- the Shiv Sena as well as the BJP for contents in the book.

However, Seva Dal national president Lalji Desai maintained, “Whatever has been written is supported with reference from other published books. Nothing in that book is the work of imagination. We stand by the contents of the book.”

Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Friday said the book shows dirt in the minds of those who speak against Savarkar. In reply, Lalji Desai said, “When in the country, the BJP government is proving to be a threat to unity, harmony and brotherhood of the people, then the interest of the nation should be priority. Seva Dal is thinking of the country’s interest. In Maharashtra, also they will think about the nation’s good and not about a certain caste or religion. So far as Savarkar is concerned, his words and action were a threat to the country’s unity.”

Lalji Desai argued that BJP-RSS combine had no connection with the freedom movement. “So, when they were looking for a mascot, they mistakenly chose Savarkar who has apologized to the British 11 times, including nine times in writing,” the Seva Dal chief said.

Speaking to TOI, Lalji Desai explained the reason behind distributing literature on Savarkar in a Seva Dal training camp. “We want our workers to know the connection between Hindu Mahasabha and the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. That Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and Nathuram Godse both belonged to the Hindu Mahasabha,” Desai said. “It is also a fact that Savarkar worked for the British and received a monthly payment of Rs 60 when other teachers were paid a salary of Rs 12. It is time to take-off the mask of patriotism that BJP-RSS wears for their political gains,” he added.

State Congress supported the Seva Dal’s attempt of attacking BJP-RSS with a book on Savarkar. State PCC spokesman Durgesh Sharma said, “For decades, the BJP-RSS spread canards about our leaders from Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru to the leadership today. We have only revealed the truth about Savarkar through a book. If the BJP thinks, the facts mentioned in the book are wrong then let them prove the same.”

aa

Allahabad: Commuters were stuck in a massive jam for over three hours on Allahabad-Lucknow highway near Curzon bridge, Phaphamau on Friday when people who arrived at the Ganga ghats to attend funerals parked their vehicles haphazardly near the bridge.

A long queue of vehicles from both the directions fumed the commuters who trapped in the bottleneck.

The traffic police authorities had to face the wrath of the commuters. Three police teams were dispatched to streamline traffic on the highway.

Traffic Inspector ( Allahabad) RK Singh said,“The footfall at ghats along Ganga was higher than usual. Most of them arrived in their own vehicles and parked them in a zig-zag manner near Curzon bridge, due to which other commuters were left with lesser space to drive and a traffic snarl became unavoidable.”

“Secondly, the commuters, instead of driving in their respective lanes, jumped into other lanes, leading to a gridlock. In fact, many commuters from one direction occupied all the three lanes, leaving no space for vehicles coming from the opposite direction,” he added.

“Traffic policemen had to face unnecessary trouble to clear the route,” said the inspector.

s“I was trapped in the ugly jam on the busy Allahabad-Lucknow route for more than three hours,” said Amit Sinha, a commuter, adding, “If police teams hadn’t arrived at the spot, many of the commuters would have remained stuck till late evening hours, he added..

Sudha, another commuter, said, “I have to travel 20 kilometres daily from Rajapur to Kaurihar for work. I was stuck in my car for more than two hours near Teliyarganj road, Phaphamau due to massive jam.”

Vehicles from both sides were plying at a snail’s pace and commuters had no other option than to wait till the route was cleared.

People who commute daily from city areas to trans-Ganga pockets for work, have demanded that adequate traffic police force should be deployed on both sides of the Ganga bridge to check road jam conditions.

Hyderabad: Emphasising that eco-friendly infrastructure must be cost effective, experts from various industries said sustainability must be at the centre of development .

Calling for inexpensive eco-friendly measures, NVS Reddy, managing director, Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited, said: “Creating mass transit systems costs a lot. Currently, it would cost Rs 300 crore/km to create an elevated form of mass transit and Rs 600-1,000 crore/km for underground transit.” He said that this is why the Metro project was carried out through public-private partnership making it viable for users. Reddy was speaking at a conference on ‘Sustainability in Built Environment’ here on Friday.

Addressing a conglomeration of architects and students, Reddy said that sustainability needs to be at the centre of infrastructure development. Citing an example, he said fly ash was used with concrete almost 35% of the time in the Metro project to make it cost-effective and environmental-friendly.

Experts at the meet said there was a need to focus on simple measures to make buildings more sustainable. “Architects underestimate the value of insulated roofs, shading devices and solar energy options in buildings,” said Kavita Daryani Rao, vice-chancellor, Jawaharlal Nehru Architecture and Fine Arts University, playing down the need for air conditioning in buildings over “indigenous measures”.

Agreeing about the need to use simple techniques before integrating technology and expensive material into building designs, Dubai-based architect, Farid Esmaeil, said: “Passive cooling techniques must be the first priority to cut heat.” He said allowing natural light to penetrate buildings as well as taking wind direction into consideration can considerably cut heat. Giving a different perspective, Bengaluru-based architect, Chitra Vishwanath said that the cost of any project must be evaluated in terms of the damage it does. “We might have saved on cost by going over-ground with Metros in cities, but what about the decades-old trees lost?” she asked. She said reduction in consumption is only way towards being ecologically-sensitive.

ABVP held a support rally for CAA/NRC at Osmania University on Friday.

HYDERABAD: Terming the Citizens (Amendment) Act (CAA) as a ‘humanitarian’ Act, which aims to provide justice to refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan, BJP national secretary Ram Madhav on Friday said that India will remain a secular country.

Delivering a speech on ‘CAA-Break myths, not Bharath’, organised by Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), he said that citizens of the country have nothing to be fear about the CAA.

“CAA is a humanitarian act, to oppose it is most ridiculous,” said Madhav. “India is a secular country, and will continue to be one forever.” He appealed to Muslims to not be deluded by the false propaganda of the opposition, who are intentionally trying to mislead them. He asked why the people of the country are protesting against CAA even without organising talks or completely understanding the Act.

“A majority are blindly opposing CAA do not even know anything about it. They are misled by the Opposition, whose only intention is to tarnish the reputation of the government and the country,” he said. Those in opposition are ‘knowledge-proof’ and can’t see the fact that CAA is not for 130 crore Indians, but for those refugees who are facing challenges in other countries, he said.

He said India has never refused refugees, and even now Muslims from the neighbourhood can become citizens here through marriage, showing proof of residence for 12 years, and other means.

Madhav said CAA was legacy of the past, including the pacts signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru with Pakistan’s Liaqat Ali Khan and Indira Gandhi with Bangladesh’s Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. “For some reason, the then governments did not amend the CAA, and did not sign the UN Convention of Refugees Treaty, leaving refugees stranded,” Madhav said. “CAA is meant for past refugees alone with a cut-off date of December 2014. After that even Hindus will not be allowed to get citizenship through CAA.”

The BJP functionaries claim that leader of opposition in the state assembly Devendra Fadnavis, who was in the city en route to Dhule and Nandurbar, Mahajan and Khadse coming together hours before the election helped the party retain its three-decade-old grip on the Jalgaon ZP.

In the 67–member house, the BJP has 33 and MVA 34 . While BJP’s one member was absent at the time of voting, one member of NCP has been disqualified bringing down the number of members in the house to 65.

Despite the BJP having 32 members, which was one short, it pulled out the victory by ensuring cross voting by NCP’s Rekha Patil and Congress’ Dileep Patil in its favour.

An elated Mahajan claimed that the victory of the BJP candidates was because of the party staying together. “The unity among the candidates and the senior functionaries of the party led to BJP retaining its bastion,” he told reporters.

Khadse, the disgruntled senior functionary of the BJP who has been claiming that Mahajan and Fadnavis were bent upon demolishing his political career, said, “This is Jalgaon. We will not allow MVA to take roots on this soil.”

Earlier in the day, there was a break-fast meeting between Fadnavis, Mahajan and Khadse, during which they discussed several issues. Khadse, however, did not disclose details of the meeting and maintained that the ZP election was the only agenda.

Asked if the differences between him and Khadse were resolved, Mahajan said, “There was nothing between us for being annoyed. When two people work in same party, there is some friction, but that is always sorted out amicably.”

A seer talks on phone on Magh Mela venue in Allahabad on Monday

Allahabad: The Magh Mela authorities are leaving no stone unturned to ensure foolproof safety and security of pilgrims expected to throng the fair from January 10. While police have verified credentials of 1,200-odd people living in the vicinity of the venue, they have for the first time formed a special squad to check begging.

Police said the verification exercise would continue and vigil would be kept against those who had arrived from other parts of the state or district for the 43-day fair. The stringent measures follow the Supreme Court order on Ram temple in Ayodhya and recent protests against the amended citizenship law.

SP (Magh Mela) Puja Yadav said the intelligence wing was compiling security inputs and the fair campus would be turned into a fortress.

“We have a concrete plan in place. Three special teams have been assigned the task of verification of credentials,” Yadav said and added, “For the first time, an anti-begging squad has been mobilised to spare pilgrims harassment. Adequate forces have been deployed at all police stations and outposts.” “We also have a two-tier safety plan for devotees taking the holy dip. Apart from deep-water barricading at all ghats, nets have been installed too,” SP Yadav said. The authorities have already seized six boats for not having life vests while 24 others have been let off with a warning. “Boatmen who are not applying for the mandatory life jackets may lose their licence,” she warned.

done

Nashik: The civic administration is planning to introduce a new project called ‘No more waste’ in municipal schools in order to sensitise students about the need for maintaining cleanliness and segregating garbage.

Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) is already in the process of hiring an NGO from Mumbai for the aforementioned project. The NGO has prepared 15 videos about recycling of garbage, segregation of waste and how to keep one’s school and home clean. The presentation on ‘No more waste’ is to be given to students in their school through videos.

“Students are tomorrow’s citizens and the future of the country. If we properly educate students about the need for maintaining cleanliness and make them aware about the importance of segregating waste, it will go a long way in keeping our city clean and green,” said an official from the NMC’s education department.

“We are already in the process of roping in a Mumbai-based NGO to implement the project in municipal schools. The main aim of the project is to make students aware about cleanliness,” said the official.

He added that there were still a section of erring citizens who dumped filth in the open and made the premises dirty and unhygienic. “There are many black spots in the city which have become home to mounds of garbage due to the incessant dumping of waste by citizens. We can’t make the city free of black spots until and unless we create awareness among citizens,” he said adding that it was important to make children aware about the need for cleanliness while they were still young.

“Imparting awareness on the importance of maintaining cleanliness among school children is the initial step towards making the city free of black spots,” said the official.

Moreover, NMC is also taking efforts to create awareness among citizens for segregating dry and wet waste. Despite imposing fine on erring citizens, the civic administration has not been successful in tackling the menace of mixed waste.

“Segregation of waste is one of the major components in Swacch Survekshan (SS) and citizens’ involvement is important to improve the cleanliness ranking of the city. Hence, we have decided to educate future citizens (students) about cleanliness, recycling of garbage and segregation of dry and wet waste,” said the official.

137,['4/01/2020'],Why is BJP now going to people clarifying CAA: CM,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Jodhpur: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has asked that why the need for the BJP arise to go to the people in entire country with the clarification on the CAA.

Gehlot, who reached Johdpur on Friday on a two-day visit, welcomed the Union home minister Amit Shah in the city and termed the situation post-CAA very serious. “Prime minister does ‘Mann ki Baat’. Why such a need arose for the BJP that today they have been offering clarification on the CAA, NPR and NRC sending their leaders in entire country,” asked Gehlot while talking to media persons here.

He said that the situation was so serious that the people of entire country took to roads along with the new generation because they were worried about their future. He advised the BJP to examine the impact of NRC in Assam, where about 16 lakh Hindu were left out of the NRC and many are in depression. He said that in such a situation, there was no need of CAA and argued that when the first amendment in the act was carried out during Vajpayee government, there was no turmoil in the country despite the act having provisions of NPR and NRC. “But why there was turmoil in the country now. This needed to be understood,” Gehlot stated. He said that if the polarization was not stopped in the country, the country would weaken and break in next 25 years, 50 years.

“Pakistan became a Muslim country after partition. Then it further broke into two nations, both Muslim. A nation could not be built over religion and today they have been talking about Hindu nation,” Gehlot stated.

He warned that if this happened, there would not be any surprise that Jains would separate, Sikhs would separate, Tamils would separate and the country would be in pieces.

“How many pieces of the country would be then, I want to ask Modiji and Shahji,” Gehlot said. He said that the government should reconsider its decision because it was not taken in consultation with the opposition parties and the chief ministers of the states. Referring to the infant’s death in J K Lone Hospital in Kota, Gehlot said that there was no point of visit by the Health minister because an expert team immediately visited the hospital and conducted an inquiry.

“There was negligence, whatsoever, has been found in the treatment of the children”, said Gehlot adding that about 100 infants have kept dying during the rule of BJP and it reduced in Congress’s rule. He admitted that there are always some shortcomings in the hospitals in entire country and advised the media and opposition to visit the hospital to identify the shortcomings and tell the government, who would address them.

AHMEDABAD: The liquidity crunch in the economy, coupled with the anti-CAA protests in several parts of the country, has cast a shadow over Gujarat ’s kite market.The sale of kites and other materials used during the Uttarayan festival is yet to gather steam, and traders say they are staring at a drop of around 30% in the sale of kites this year.This may, however, augur well for kite enthusiasts. The price of kites are not expected to increase this year.Traders say they are presently selling kites at a discount of about 25%, but sales are still not picking up substantially.The spate of protests across the country over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act have only added to the woes of the kite-making industry in the state.Some 3,000 kite artisans from Uttar Pradesh are called by kite makers to Gujarat for a short period every year. Kite makers say that this year, only about 500 have come to Gujarat.Traders say the number of orders from traders in other parts of the county – mainly Kolkata, Mumbai and Bangalore – has also fallen this year.Pappu Patangwala, a leading kite maker in the city, said business is only a third of last year’s. “There are stocks of kites in the market, but very few takers. I expect sales to fall this year,” said Patangwala, who does business of around Rs 35 lakh every Uttarayan. About the prices of kites this year compared to last year, he said, “There will not be any increase in prices. Demand is low. In fact, kites could become cheaper than last year.”Another kite maker, Raju Patangwala, said the effects of the slowdown in the economy are affecting the kite industry as well. “I have been in the industry for more than 30 years, but this year is perhaps the worst in terms of sales. “I have been clocking up a turnover of about Rs 50 lakh for the past few years, but this year business is expected to be about 50%,” the 52-year old businessman said.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73095259,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-247048,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/kite-business-set-to-dip-this-year-prices-unlikely-to-go-up/articleshow/73091921.cms

KOTA: Nine days after the death of children in Kota’s J K Lon Hospital, state health minister Raghu Sharma visited the hospital and held discussions with officials on Friday.

Without naming former chief minister Vasundhara Raje , the health minister, who was accompanied by transport minister and Kota in-charge Pratap Singh Khachariyawas, blamed the previous BJP government for poor health facilities at the hospital where 105 kids died since December.

He claimed that the present Congress government was correcting the legacy of the previous government. Refuting allegations of insensitiveness, Sharma said, “Death of even a single infant is a cause of sorrow for us.” “The hospital management had repeatedly year after year demanded funds (from the previous BJP government) to equip and maintain the hospital,” Sharma said.

“But the then BJP government did not sanction even a singly rupee,” Sharma said.

“We are now taking measures for improving the hospital,” Sharma said, adding that they had held detailed discussions with medical officials here on the shortcomings at the hospital and measures required to improve the same. These issues would be addressed in the upcoming state budget, he said.

“The earlier Congress government had sanctioned a budget of over Rs 5 crore for 120 beds for paediatric wards in 2012, but the government changed and the subsequent BJP government released only Rs 1.7 crore,” Sharma said.

“In 2012, 60 beds were sanctioned for gynaecology and 60 for paediatric wards. But only 45 beds for the gynaecology ward have been set up by the subsequent government. Where have those sanctioned beds gone?” Sharma asked in response to a question on why two kids were given a single bed in the hospital. “The Congress government had sanctioned 60 beds for the children’s ward in the 2012 budget,” he added.

“Those who are questioning us should have done something when they were in power for five years and answer what happened to 60 beds for which we had given financial sanction,” the minister said.

He said the hospital has Rs 6 crore to upgrade all equipment along with the centralised oxygen supply system and ventilators, adding that more funds would be sanctioned if required.

The government has released Rs 1 crore for maintenance and deputed an additional 19 nursing staff over the last five days, he said.

On the question of nine days delay in visiting Kota, the minister claimed that he had been working with officials and the three-member team which went to Kota immediately after the reported deaths on December 26.

Box: Dismiss Cong govt: Ex-NCW chief

Former National Commission for Women (NCW) chairperson Mamta Sharma on Friday held the Ashok Gehlot-led state government responsible for the deaths of kids in Kota's J K Lon Hospital and demanded the dismissal of the Congress government.

Box: Green carpet for min removed

The hospital management, which rolled out a green carpet to welcome health minister Raghu Sharma, had to remove it following protest by attendants of patients. A 15-day-old female infant from nearby Rupaheda village died on Friday morning taking the death toll of infants to 105 in the last 34 days in J K Lon Hospital. However, the doctors at hospital initially termed the cause of death as premature birth.

Bijnor: Three elephants will soon be joining the search for the killer leopardess which so far has claimed five lives and injured a dozen villagers in Bijnor. Once found, the big cat will be tranquillized and captured.

According to forest officials, the elephants are trained to carry out search operations and comb sugarcane fields. Forest personnel atop these elephants will then shoot tranquillizer darts on the leopard.

Giving details, divisional forest officer M Semmaran said, “We are in touch with an NGO, Ahrawat, to hire trained jumbos. Three elephants are to be hired to comb the dense sugarcane fields. We will tranquilize the killer leopard by sitting on the elephants where our staff will be safe.”

Semmaran said, “We are also planning to shift leopard cubs. Last year, we had rescued seven cubs and sent them to the zoo. This time, we will keep a close watch during breeding season -- from February to May – rescue the cubs and shift them to other places.”

Forest authorities have confirmed one big cat has killed three of the five people killed since November 25 on the basis of pugmarks. It is prowling about Mohandiya village for the past eight days. Other rogue leopards are likely to have attacked other humans as many have been sighted over the past few weeks.

The killer leopard has so far eluded capture though the forest authorities have set up camera traps at Mohandiaya village where it killed its last vicitim on December 26 and kept cages with bait to lure it. The forest department is also awaiting nod from principal chief conservator, wildlife, for tranquillizing the killer leopard.

Meanwhile, Abhibhavak Sangh (parents association) met the district magistrate on Friday and demanded that schools in the jungle areas be shifted elsewhere for safety of the students. Its convener Nrapendra Deshwal said, “We met DM Ramakant Pandey and demanded that security arrangement be made for children studying in the schools located in remote areas. Such schools be shifted to safe places temporally till the killer leopardess and other rogue big cats are caught.”

There are around 800 primary and higher primary schools in the district which are located on the outskirt of villages and close to farm lands. These schools do not have boundary walls.

Vadodara: M S University’s Faculty of Science has kicked off a project to restore Bhukhi nullah.

This non-perennial tributary of the Vishwamitri river flows through the middle of the varsity’s main campus too on a stretch of around 2.82 km.

Around 15 students of MSU’s department of Environmental Science have started analyzing the overall biodiversity of the stretch including its plant, microbes, water quality, soil quality and sources of soil and wet waste that is dumped in Bhukhi nullah, as part of their dissertation studies.

“After students complete the analysis, we will conduct workshop with field experts and Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) on what can be done to upgrade the stream,” said department head, Prof Kauresh Vachhrajani.

“Once we have a plan, we will start with the restoration mapping. The complete restoration will be done with the support of VMC and NGOs,” he said, adding that the plan is to make it a pilot project that can act as a model for holistic development of the river.

The faculty showcased its project at an Open House held at the campus on Friday, both the chancellor and vice-chancellor assured their full support to the project.

While the state government has sanctioned some grants to restore Bhukhi nullah, the department of architecture too in the past had submitted restoration plans.

“We will take inputs from all quarters as we move ahead with the restoration project,” said Vachhrajani, adding inputs from Botany department will also be included to understand what plants can be grown here for biodiversity.

149,['4/01/2020'],Ministers fume over denial of state’s tableau,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The decision to leave out state’s tableau from this year’s Republic Day parade invited strong criticism and protest from the state government.

Culture minister A K Balan said that the Centre is going mad even at the utterance of the name of the state and the decision to exclude the state is political. “We don’t understand why there is so much hatred towards art forms like Kathakali, Mohiniyattam and Chenda. Situation has become such that the Centre is going mad hearing the name of Kerala or Malayali. This shows the general state of the country. There is no politics in such matters in displaying the state’s rich culture and heritage before the world. We had cleared till the third round and without any political interference, it would not be rejected,” he said.

He said that same is the case with state’s recommendations for Padma Awards. The list given by the state is not considered. We are sending such lists without any political interests. “When we send names like M T Vasudevan Nair or actor Mammootty, the list is thrown in to the dustbin. Even the resolution passed by the assembly is being opposed,” he said.

Finance minister T M Thomas Isaac said that the state has an exceptional track record in Republic Day parades. In six parades from 2008 to 2013, the state had topped in three. But, ever since BJP government came to power in the Centre, the state was allowed to participate just once. “The Centre is showing a vengeful attitude towards Keralites by excluding the state from portraying its tableau in Republic Day parade,” he said.

General education minister C Raveendranath also criticized the Centre’s decision to deny permission for the state’s tableau. “This is nothing but insulting the state. The deliberate attempt to exclude a state that is in the forefront of administrative and cultural fronts demands protest. It should also be noted that the state had decided to portray its rich cultural heritage through the tableau. It is also the people’s will to portray the cultural heritage of the state,” he said in his Facebook post.

The state’s proposed theme for its tableau for parading it in the Republic Day celebrations this year on the theme “art and architecture of the state” was rejected by a committee constituted by the ministry of defence. This is the second time in a row that the state is being denied opportunity to participate in the tableau on Republic Day.

150,['4/01/2020'],Kamal Nath orders inquiry into Sikhs’ eviction plaint,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Chief minister Kamal Nath

BHOPAL: Chief minister Kamal Nath has ordered an inquiry into allegations that some Sikhs were evicted from land they owned in Sheopur . The district administration says it is tribal land and those evicted were encroachers.

The controversy is over the eviction of farmer Gurmeet Singh from 150 hectares of land in Karhal, a tribal block. His farmhouse, which was allegedly constructed on government land, was demolished. The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) termed it “unjustified and illegal”, and its representatives met the district collector and SP to register their protest.

The administration points out that the Fifth Schedule prohibits sale and purchase of tribal land. The Saharia — one of the most primitive tribes of India — dominate the district.

Collector Pratibha Pal on Friday denied any discrimination, and explained that the action “was not against any one community”. “All the norms were followed before initiating action. It started more than a month ago, when notices were served. In fact, several notices were served to them. We only freed tribal lease land and government land from the habitual offenders,” Pal told TOI, adding that it’s part of a statewide campaign against land encroachment.

Sikh community leaders, however, say they will meet home minister Amit Shah in Delhi. Chairman of DSGMC’s legal cell, Jagdeep Singh, said: “Only Sikh community members were targeted. No other community was targeted in Karhal. Sikh families are uprooted and they have been rendered homeless.”

CM Kamal Nath’s media coordinator Narendra Saluja, who is also convener of a government committee of the Sikh community, said, “The chief minister has ordered an inquiry into the whole episode. A delegation of Sikh community will visit Sheopur to meet those affected by the eviction and district officials, and a report in this regard will be submitted to the CM.”

Ekata Parishad, an NGO that works for tribals across the country, said that former district collector Pannalal Solanki had identified 5,000 hectares of tribal land that has been usurped in Karhal tehesil, where the Fifth Schedule is in force. Tundaram Languria, president of ‘84 Gaon Ki Panchayat’, an orgaisation of 84 tribal villages of Sheopur, said: “This is an old issue of Saharia tribespeople trying to get back our land.”

Mayor Sandip Joshi along with NMC office-bearers, corporators and officials visited ‘khau galli’ on Friday

Nagpur: To facilitate complete recreation for visitors by ending traffic congestion, mayor Sandip Joshi has proposed to prohibit movement of vehicles on the road along ‘khau galli’ and also start a pay and park nearby.

Joshi also announced inauguration of the city’s first unique food joint at 6pm on January 9.

The mayor along with NMC office-bearers, corporators and officials visited ‘khau galli’, developed by the civic body, on the bank of Gandhisagar Lake on Friday. Addressing media persons, Joshi said road from Agyaram Devi Square to Empress Mill T-point will be closed for traffic between 6pm and 11pm.

“Khau galli will remain open throughout the day as well. As a large number of citizens prefer to visit recreational facilities in the evening, it has been proposed to stop traffic after 6pm so as to allow free movement for people on the road,” said Joshi. He also said that vacant space on the nearby Balbhavan premises would be developed into a pay and park and the process to appoint an operator has already begun.

The mayor said directives have also been issued to increase the number of stalls to 40. “At present, there are 32 stalls. In all 78 applications were received and 32 tenants were finalized through a lucky draw. There is some space left where eight more stalls can be accommodated,” he said.

The NMC has installed music system and other types of recreational activities at ‘khau galli’ to increase the footfall.

Joshi, however, ruled out having more such ‘khau gallis’ in other parts of the city. “Instead, I plan to develop Smart Kiosks to rehabilitate hawkers in a systematic manner,” he said.

BJP leader Sudhir ‘Bandu’ Raut had approved Rs80 lakh for ‘khau galli’ project during his tenure as standing committee chairman in 2016-17. However, the project remained a non-starter for various reasons.

During ‘Walk and Talk With Mayor’ initiative, some citizens had urged Joshi to start the project. The mayor had then assured to dedicate it to public by January 1.

Representative image

BHOPAL: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)’s city branch has taken over the probe into a case, where a 16-year-old girl from Uttar Pradesh had gone missing from Bhind district three years ago.

The girl’s relatives had filed a habeas corpus petition at the Gwalior bench of high court. According to them, the girl was in Bhind to visit her relative. On February 14, 2017, she had gone to a local market along with two of her friends. There she was kidnapped by two youths —identified as Arun Pal and Satyendra Pal— they alleged.

A relative, who is one of the complainants, claimed that he had tried to chase the duo, but have up since the accused were armed with pistols. Fearing social stigma, they did not lodged a complaint with the police, and kept searching for her. When they failed to find her, they lodged a complaint, on which, an FIR was registered on February 26, 2017.

When the girl’s family felt that the investigation by Bhind police was going nowhere, they moved court. SP Rudolf Alvares was summoned by the court and a status report was sought on the police complaint. Alvares appeared before the court on November 1 last year, and sought 15 days to furnish the report. He told the court that efforts were being made to trace the missing girl. He was given another 15 days, but to no avail. A warning was then issued that the case may have to be transferred to CBI, if he does not come up with a satisfactory report, said sources.

Thereafter, the hearing was adjourned thrice as the government requested time to file the status report. On December 6, the court observed that the state police had again failed to submit a status report. It then issued an order to handover the investigations to the CBI with immediate effect.

Complying with the order, CBI re-registered the FIR for further probe. Investigations are underway.

Ahmedabad: Karanj police on Friday registered a case for a theft at the Parsi panchayat office in the Khamasa area of the city, where burglars made off with Rs 5,860 cash and an NVR (network video recorder) worth Rs 4,000.

In his FIR with Karanj police, Firoz Dawar, 80, who has been the secretary of the Parsi Agiyari Panchayat for 20 years, said that the president of the panchayat told him that the lock on the panchayat building was opened by some persons who then trespassed into it. When Dawar checked the drawer, he found the cash had been stolen.

After this, the panchayat secretary and others checked CCTV footage but there was a technical error in it. When Dawar went to check the NVR, he found that the NVR was also stolen.

The panchayat members used to hide the keys to the lock near the gate of the building, which might have been used by the burglars.

Silent protest being carried out by activists on Friday

Vadodara: Around 25 activists trying to hold a protest in Sayajigunj area of the city against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) were arrested by police on Friday. The group that included People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) activists had been denied permission to hold the protest earlier.

PUCL and youths opposing CAA had sought permission to hold a silent protest in Sayajigunj on Wednesday. Since the permission was denied, the activists decided to still hold the protest on Friday.

The activists argued that it seemed as if police were working at the behest of the government and denying people right to protest even silently. On Friday, most activists were detained when they started moving towards Dairy Den Circle for the protest. An activist claimed that initially the police had even rounded up persons who were not a part of the protest but bystanders.

156,['4/01/2020'],Karnataka: Migrant students can begin with class 1 Kannada textbook,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Representative image

BENGALURU: Students from other states who join Karnataka schools between class 2 and 9 will get to learn class 1 Kannada textbooks . The board exams for Kannada for such a student will be in sync with the textbook he is studying.

Speaking at a session with Kannada teachers and principals of CBSE and ICSE schools of Bengaluru, commissioner of public instruction KG Jagadeesha said students can request a separate question paper and a circular will be issued in this regard. The teacher can take a call on how to train such a student while his peers learn textbooks of higher grades, he added.

In 2017, Karnataka made it mandatory for all schools in the state regardless of affiliation to teach Kannada either as first or second language. The schools must follow the textbooks prescribed by the education department. This academic year, students of classes 1, 2 and 3 are learning Kannada in accordance with the rule. The first batch of students will appear for class X board exams in 2027.

When teachers asked whether they are free to use ICSE Kannada textbooks for classes 9 and 10 and not what the state prescribes so as to prepare children for the boards, the education department said it will ask ICSE and CBSE by 2026 to align their class 9 and 10 textbooks or question paper to match with that of the syllabus prescribed in the state.

At the session held at Mount Carmel College on Friday, over 200 teachers were given an opportunity to raise concerns and issues they face. They pointed at differential salary packages for Kannada teachers and others, which is in practice in several schools in the city. They also lamented the fewer number of periods allotted to them and their struggles to do justice to the subject.

Some also cited instances of schools reprimanding them for speaking to students in Kannada. The department has asked teachers to write to them on ddpisouth@gmail.com or ddpinorth@gmail.com with names of the school so that they can take action. The teachers also requested the department to ensure textbooks are delivered on time.

A teacher from Delhi Public School said the government must consider making Kannada mandatory for teachers. Primary and secondary education minister S Suresh Kumar said the department will seriously consider the suggestion.

“While several schools claim they follow the rules, they do not. Some do not have Kannada teachers. If they do, the teachers may not be given enough periods. If schools don’t follow rules, we know how to take action,” he warned.

Will discuss Tipu with CM

On the issue of the inclusion of lessons on Tipu Sultan in textbooks, Suresh Kumar said he had received the reports on the matter, adding, “I have to discuss it with the chief minister to take a decision on it.”

157,['4/01/2020'],Gujarat: Applicant to get hearing over ‘missing’ inquiry report,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Gandhi Ashram

GANDHINAGAR: Did Gujarat governor K K Vishwanathan, in February 1975, institute a commission of inquiry to investigate the “missing belongings” of Mahatma Gandhi, which had ostensibly vanished from Sabarmati Ashram (officially called Harijan Ashram Trust) and alleged misappropriation in the affairs of the Ashram-affiliated Gaushala Trust?

The governor’s office had replied to an Right to Information (RTI) applicant in October 2018 that “no such record is available with the governor’s office right now”. This reply did not answer whether such a record existed in the first place if it was not with the governor’s office.

The RTI application, filed by a Nadiad resident, Maulik Shrimali, in 2018, sought a copy of the 1975 inquiry report. In his application, Shrimali referred to a 1975 governor’s office order, GSTR 1087/75, through which Shrimali claims Vishwanathan instituted the inquiry.

On December 27, 2019, the state’s chief information commissioner R R Varsani ordered the governor’s office to take cognisance of the applicant’s request for a hearing before the appellate authority, the principal secretary at the Governor’s office, to check whether the 1975 notification and a copy of the inquiry report was available with the office before any order was passed.

“The governor office reply that the records were not with them ‘right now’ raised interesting questions. This did not answer my question whether such records had existed in the first place. I then began demanding a certified copy of the 1975 order and a copy of the inquiry report. How can such important enquiry commission order and report, if it existed, go missing from the governor’s office?” asked Shrimali. He had sought nine pieces of information relating to the 1975 inquiry report.

Shrimali had filed an application seeking the information in October, 2018, to which the PIO at the governor’s office replied that no such information was available with them then. As Shrimali was not satisfied with the reply, he approached the appellate authority, who had claimed that Shrimali had filed his first appeal after the mandated 30 days. Varsani ordered that as neither Shrimali nor the governor’s office produced documents to prove that the first appeal application was in time or late, a patient hearing be given to Shrimali.

“Delighted that the apparel manufacturing unit of Shoppers Stop will be coming up at Sircilla. Employment opportunities to hundreds of women will be created and a huge step forward for apparel park, Sircilla,” KTR said in a release.

After the MoU signing ceremony, KTR also met textile industry leaders in Mumbai and explained the investment opportunities in Telangana.

KTR also met representatives of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance in Mumbai and pitched investment opportunities in the state’s pharmaceutical and life sciences sector.

“Telangana’s ambitious agenda is to double the size of our life sciences ecosystem from US$ 50 billion in 2020 to US$100 billion by 2030 and create 4,00,000 new jobs,” KTR said in the statement.

They have also been directed to take photos of students while they are being served midday meals and upload them on the app so that the government can keep an eye on the quantity and quality of the food being offered to the children.

The recent directives came days after the state’s education department asked all the teachers to take selfies with school children. The move was meant to curb the teachers’ absenteeism. However, the government order faced opposition from teachers’ groups which asked for better infrastructures in the government-run schools.

“This is to bring to your notice that all the school management committees should upload their contact numbers on the Prerna app to ensure transparency. Not just this, they should also upload pictures of mid-day meals being served at schools,” said Vijay Kiran Anand, UP state project director.

Earlier, the teachers were also asked to take selfies while serving midday meal to students. The school principals were also asked take photos with all teaching and non-teaching staff when the school is about to get over.

Anurag Singh Thakur Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs addressed a press conference relating ... Read More

Nagpur: Union minister of state for finance Anurag Singh Thakur on Friday said that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was fulfilment of Mahatma Gandhi’s promise made to minorities of undivided Pakistan that they would be given shelter if persecuted. “Jawaharlal Nehru and Rajendra Prasad had also given similar assurances,” he said while addressing a press conference in Patrakar Club.

According to the MoS, there was nothing wrong in giving citizenship to only non-Muslims of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. “Pakistan and Bangladesh have persecuted non-Muslims. At the time of partition, their percentage in Pakistan was 23% while today it is 3%. Against this, the percentage of Muslims in India was 9% while now it is 14.5%. This shows that non-Muslims in these three countries need protection. Congress, too, has given citizenship on limited basis to refugees from Bangladesh, Uganda and Sri Lanka. I challenge Congress president Sonia Gandhi and ex-president Rahul Gandhi to answer this,” said Thakur.

“Non-Muslim women are being raped and abducted in Pakistan. They are being forced to convert to Islam. What should they do? Would Sonia, Rahul and Uddhav Thackeray have stayed in Pakistan if they were in their place? And where will such people go if not to India. Over 80% of Hindu refugees from these countries are Dalits? Congress is therefore anti-Dalit because it wants to deny citizenship to them,” said Thakur.

The BJP leader alleged that Congress and other opposition parties were opposing CAA just for the sake of Muslim votes. “They are misleading Muslims to polarize the country. There is no threat to their citizenship due to CAA. I appeal to them not to be misled by the Congress,” he claimed.

Thakur said that there were no immediate plans for implementing the national register of citizenship (NRC). “As for the national population register (NPR), it has been implemented several times and I fail to understand why Congress is opposing it. Its just like census,” he added.

The MoS further said that there was no mass support to anti-CAA agitations. “Out of the 400 odd universities in the country, students of only a handful of universities participated in the protests. I appeal to the students to concentrate on their studies,” he added.

165,['4/01/2020'],FGG reminds govt of decision to shift polluting industries,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Hyderabad: The Forum for Good Governance (FGG) has addressed a letter to the chief secretary asking that polluting industries be shifted outside the city in accordance with the assurances given by the government.

Reminding the government of its decision in 2013 of shifting polluting industries within ORR limits to outside, the letter said that 1,160 industries, constituting 803 in the red category and 357 in orange, were to be shifted.

The letter lamented that “since the past seven years there is (sic) no progress in the matter and industries continue to pollute the environment causing severe health problems to millions of people residing in Hyderabad”.

A government appointed-committee had in 2012 identified polluting industries as those which are into pharmaceuticals, chemicals, tannery, rubber products, pesticides, paints and varnishes, among other sectors.

Referring to a reply to an RTI in 2018, the letter said that 8,206 licenses were granted for establishing industries in the four years and out of which 835 were in the red category, 2,315 in orange, and 5,056 in green or white category.

Speaking to TOI, secretary, FGG, M Padmanabha Reddy, said, “Without moving out polluting industries from the city, how can licences be granted to fresh ones?” He demanded that the polluting industries identified by the government be immediately shifted and a time schedule be released.

Supporters take a selfie with a cutout of Arvind Kejriwal at Maharaja Agrasen College in east Delhi on Friday ... Read More

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said the central government and the entire country should reject the Citizenship Amendment Act and focus on employment instead.

“This is not a Hindu-Muslim issue,” Kejriwal said, responding to question at a town hall organised at Maharaja Agrasen College in east Delhi. Commenting on his absence from the protests against CAA and National Register of Citizens in the capital, Kejriwal said he was trying to ensure that there was no violence anywhere and the agitation remained peaceful.

“My job is to maintain peace in Delhi and ensure its development. I was taking all steps necessary to ensure that there was no violence or police excesses,” the CM said.

Questioning the necessity for the citizenship law at this juncture, he said: “It says that even Hindus will have to leave the country if they don’t have identity documents for themselves and their parents... The economy is down and the unemployment rate is high. Our children don’t have jobs and houses. They (Centre) say they will bring in two crore Hindus from Pakistan. Where will they be settled?”

At the fourth of the seven planned town halls, Kejriwal presented the five-year report card of his government and said that if AAP was re-elected, the priority of his government would be to clean up the Yamuna, make Delhi the cleanest city of the world and address air pollution.

“Cleaning up the Yamuna is our priority for the next five years. The river is polluted by sewer and industrial waste from the city. We have identified and planned a waste-management system. I assure you that, in the next five years, we will clean up the river. I will be the first one to take a dip in the river,” Kejriwal said.

Asked whether he was confident about AAP winning the election, he said: “AAP will win in Delhi. We are witnessing different voting patterns in the Lok Sabha and assembly polls.”

Among the audience, Gautam Maya Gupta from Kondli lauded the efforts of Delhi government at improving the living conditions of people in unauthorised colonies. “We have got roads, sewer pipelines, water and power connectivity in the last five years,” she said. Manvi, a Class XII student from School of Excellence in Khichripur, said government schools’ infrastructure and facilities were now at the same level as their private counterparts.

Kejriwal also highlighted the improvement in the performance of students from government schools in board examinations.

An emotional Meenakshi shared her experience of getting a compensation of Rs 1 crore when her policeman husband died in line of duty in 2017. Kejriwal said that, earlier, only a sewing machine was given as compensation to such widows, but now AAP government was not only giving them a compensation of Rs 1 crore but also the title of a martyr.

A mother waiting for her turn with her child at J K Lon Hospital in Kota

JAIPUR: On Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan’s initiative, a Central team reached Jaipur on Friday to study the infants’ deaths at J K Lon Hospital in Kota , and had detailed discussions with the state government officials.

A high-level team despatched by the Centre comprising experts from AIIMS Jodhpur , health finance and regional director, health services Jaipur, held detailed discussions with the officials of the state health department on Friday over the death of 105 infants at JK Lon Hospital in Kota in the last 34 days.

Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union health and family welfare minister, had promised to send a team to study the reasons for the unusually high mortality rate in the hospital in the winter month, after the news made headlines in the media.

The Union minister said in a tweet on Thursday, “The high-level team being despatched by @MoHFW_INDIA incl experts from AIIMS Jodhpur, Health Finance & Regional Director, Health Services Jaipur. It will reach #Kota tomorrow. In my letter too to @ashokgehlot51ji, I’ve offered all possible assistance to prevent any further deaths.”

Sources in the health department said the team members had detailed discussions with the state government officials on Friday and left for Kota in the evening. They will visit the hospital on Saturday morning according to sources. However, officials in the health department were tight-lipped on the discussions with the Central team.

Facing severe criticism over the matter, chief minister Ashok Gehlot had asked the Union minister to visit the hospital to take stock of the situation himself. The minister, promising all co-operation to the state, preferred to send a team of experts.

Chief minister Gehlot, who has been defending the state government, highlighting data on reduction of child mortality in the state in the last few years, had accepted on Friday that there is scope for improvement in healthcare in the state.

Two ministers, health minister Dr Raghu Sharma and transport minister, who is the minister in-charge of Kota district, also visited the hospital on Friday.

cap

Vadodara: The Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) got rapped by the central pollution watchdog over industrial effluent waste discharged by the Vadodara Enviro Channel Limited (VECL).

In its stern directives issued recently, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) pulled up the the state body asking it to ensure that the waste water treatment facility complies with set industrial pollution norms strictly. VECL is responsible for disposal of treated waste water of all major industries in and surrounding Vadodara including Nandesari Industries Association.

In December 2018, GPCB had issued closure notice to VECL after it failed to meet effluent norms but was later given an extension. In its letter sent to the state body on December 17, the CPCB chairman issued directives to the chairman under section 18 (1) (b) of The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974 and stated that CPCB’s monitoring results on September 10, 2019 has found very high pollution levels in the treated waste water.

GPCB has been directed to take stringent action for non-compliance of discharge standards from member industries which may include imposing environmental compensation and termination of MoU for effluent conveyance.

With special reference to VECL, the CPCB letter states that it should take corrective actions on a priority basis to lift the overflowed effluent and conveyance into effluent channel.

“VECL should abandon the existing brick-lined effluent conveyance channel (from Vedach pumping station to J-point) and commission another parallel closed pipeline of adequate capacity as a standby system during the event of operations and management of newly laid pipeline and heavy rainfall condition if any,” it states.

GPCB has also been asked to conduct a detailed assessment of groundwater quality in the area to ascertain contamination and take remedial measures. It has also been told to “submit time-bound action plan” to contain contamination and “ensure compliance to directions within 30 days”.

171,['4/01/2020'],"HC pulls up cops, officials for denying parole to convict","This story is from January 4, 2020

Nagpur: Nagpur bench of Bombay high court recently pulled up the cops for ignoring convicts’ statutory rights like parole recognized by the state government.

Accusing the police of “gross negligence” while deciding the parole application of a murder convict from Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh, HC ordered his immediate release for 30 days to look after ailing wife and asked the government to pay Rs10,000 compensation to him for delay in deciding his application. The government was granted liberty to recover the amount from erring police officers after conducting inquiry.

Petitioner Hariom Pande, lodged in Gadchiroli jail after being awarded life term for a murder, had applied for parole to take care of his wife who was seriously ill at his native place in Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh. He had applied for a parole on July 16, 2018, through Gadchiroli jail superintendent and divisional commissioner here.

The Azamgarh police, however, submitted their report on January 19 and the divisional commissioner rejected the application on June 4, almost a year after application.

“Because of the gross laxity of respondents and concerned officers, the petitioner’s release on parole was unnecessarily delayed. Subsequently, the right of petitioner/convict, as per Rule 19(2)(C) (ii) for release on parole leave is frustrated. Considering the petitioner’s earlier conduct, he should be released on regular parole for 30 days, of course, subject to conditions,” a division bench of Justices Zaka Haq and Shriram Modak held.

While setting aside divisional commissioner’s decision to reject petitioner’s parole, the judges directed government to pay Rs10,000 to the prisoner within two months and jail SP was asked to file a compliance report. “We have noticed that the applications submitted by the convicts for parole are considered mechanically. Later, a sentence is inserted that it shouldn’t be granted as their release may lead to law and order problem or they may abscond. In this case, we find there has been laxity on part of respondents and police officials at every level, which resulted in inordinate delay in deciding petitioner’s application.”

Azamgarh police report mentioned Pande’s claim of wife suffering from serious illness was correct. However, his parole was objected to on the ground there was a possibility of him absconding after the release. When the petitioner was released earlier on furlough in January 2015, August 2018, and September 2019, he had surrendered himself on due date every time. Even when released on parole in 2017, he came back before deadline.

The judges observed the UP cops failed to provide details on their conclusion that the petitioner may flee if released. “Parole leave is recognized as a statutory right as per Rule 19 of Maharashtra Prisons (Mumbai Furlough and Parole) Rules, 1959. It is not convict’s absolute right to seek parole and it is circumscribed by various other considerations, including the objective satisfaction of the jail officials and the authority competent to consider convict’s application. If parole is recommended, it should be supported by proper reasons and the necessary details on the basis of which the recommending officer forms his opinion,” the HC said before allowing petitioner’s application.

Jhansi: A police sub-inspector (SI) was found hanging at his official residence on Kotwali premises in neighbouring Mahoba district on Friday morning.

While circumstantial evidence indicate that Ramakant Sachan committed suicide, it is not immediately clear why the cop who was recently promoted and whose retirement is due in April nurtured a death wish.

According to sources in police, Sachan had served as head constable at Mahoba Kotwali for many years. He was promoted to the rank of SI last year and transferred to Prayagraj.

Sachan had joined his new station in September 2019 and had come to Mahoba to hand over charge. When he did not leave his room on Friday morning, colleagues went to look for him and found him hanging from the ceiling.

Mahoba SP Manilal Patidar said Sachan was promoted and sent to Prayagraj because his family lived there. “Preliminary probe suggests he committed suicide, but the reason behind it is not yet clear. No suicide note has been recovered. We have sent the body for postmortem and are waiting for his family members to arrive,” Patidar added.

Nashik: The anti-corruption bureau’s ( ACB ) Nashik Range conducted as many as 123 traps in the year 2019 — eight more than compared to last year, suggesting marginal rise in number of bribery complaints received by the agency.

A senior ACB official said that more and more people should come forward and lodge complaints with them if any public servant is demanding bribe for doing their job. “More the complaints, more traps will be laid by the ACB,” he said.

The Nashik range of ACB comprises Nashik, Ahmednagar, Jalgaon, Dhule and Nandurbar. Meanwhile, going by the figures, Nashik range conducted the third highest number of traps in the state with Pune being on top with 184 cases. Aurangabad with 124 traps is second on the list.

Meanwhile, this year, the ACB conducted its first trap in Trimbakeshwar where a headmaster of an Ashramshala was caught accepting bribe of Rs 5,000 for forwarding a teacher’s proposal to the Tribal Development Project office.

“We have been appealing to the citizens to contact us fearlessly if there is a demand of bribery from any government official or employee or from any other person demanding bribe on their behalf,” a senior ACB official said.

“We have been spreading awareness about the same among citizens through different programmes. Of the total 123 raids conducted in 2019, 32 were held by the Ahmednagar unit followed by Jalgaon (34), Nashik (26), Dhule (21) and Nandurbar (10),” he added.

Apart from 123 trap cases, the ACB Nashik has also carried out three disproportionate assets (DA) cases along with another case related to corruption. Chargesheets in 41 cases has already been submitted in the court.

While bribery demands are made at many government institutions, very few people approach the anti-corruption watchdog to lodge complaint, fearing that their work in the concerned department or office would never get done or they will be harassed by the employees of that department in the future.

Mayawati

JAIPUR: Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati continued to target chief minister Ashok Gehlot over the deaths of infants at Kota ’s J K Lon Hospital by seeking his resignation on the issue.

The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said that Gehlot was highly “insensitive” while giving statements on children's deaths to camouflage his failures and should be sacked.

In her tweets in Hindi, she said: ""Congress CM Ashok Gehlot of Rajasthan is making insensitive and irresponsible statements on the death 100 innocent children to hide his incompetence and flaws. It is extremely shameful and condemnable.""

Mayawati’s sharp attack on Gehlot is understandable as he was instrumental in the elimination of her party in Rajasthan. He had poached her party MLAs twice during his chief ministership.

She further wrote, “Only expressing displeasure by the Congress party over the incident that devastated hundreds of mothers is not enough. They should immediately sack him and appoint a right person in his place to stop further deaths.”

Gehlot, who had targeted media by saying that some were playing into the hands of BJP to divert attention from CAA agitation, said it is the duty of the media to highlight laxity in the system.

There are various shortcomings in the country and in the state. It is the duty of the media and people to criticize it. It helps us work more diligently, he said.

State BJP president Satish Poonia tweeted on the state government’s defence on child death comparing it with previous years.

“The attitude of the state government on the deaths of children in Kota is surprising. It is shocking and shameful that instead of competing for death statistics it would be better to take immediate action; where the direct needs proof, Gehlot saheb Your Minister is reaching 20 days later. Abhinandan Gulum Sarkar.”

Union minister Smriti Irani said, “It hints at the fact that even after continuous deaths of children, no attention was paid by Rajasthan govt towards it. The govt needs to answer whom would they penalise for this?”

BJP MLA Rajendra Rathore in a tweet alleged that “Just before the minister's visit, cleaning and painting was done in the hospital wards, beds which were covered with dirt till Thursday, was replaced with new sheets. So far, 105 innocent children have died in 34 days. I want to ask why the hospital administration did not show such agility earlier.”

G V L Narasimha Rao (file photo)

NEW DELHI: On a day when the BJP brass, including home minister Amit Shah and working president JP Nadda, held public rallies in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act, the party dug out more evidence to expose what it called Congress’s “double standards” over the new citizenship law and announced an extensive campaign to dispel ‘misplaced’ criticism.

BJP MP and spokesperson G V L Narasimha Rao accused Congress of indulging in “politics of duplicity and expedience” over CAA. He cited the opposition party’s 2018 Rajasthan assembly election manifesto that promised all-round development to refugees from Pakistan, including grant of citizenship and rehabilitation.

“I have in my hand the manifesto of Congress for the Rajasthan assembly elections 2018. Item number 27 of this manifesto relates to governance. They claim citizenship rights in this and there is a promise about which they are lying today,” he said. “Rahul Gandhi was then Congress president,” he added.

He also recalled that in his previous tenure as CM, Ashok Gehlot had written to the then PM Manmohan Singh , seeking citizenship for Hindus and Sikhs displaced from Pakistan. BJP’s Anil Jain said on January 5, as many as 42 BJP functionaries, including the party chief, will take part in “Ghar Ghar Sampark Abhiyan”.

178,['4/01/2020'],BJP trying to implement NRC through NPR: Cong,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Nagpur: PL Punia, national spokesperson of Congress, on Thursday alleged that BJP-led central government was trying to implement national register of citizens (NRC) through national population register (NPR). He also charged Prime Minister Narendra Modi with misleading the nation on NRC.

Addressing a press conference, Punia said while home minister Amit Shah had clearly said in both houses of Parliament that NRC would be implemented, PM Modi claimed at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan that there was no talk on NRC in the government so far. “Who is lying, Modi or Shah? Or is there complete lack of coordination between the two? We are inclined to believe that Modi is lying because Shah does not have the guts to speak on NRC without the PM’s permission,” he added.

Punia further said that BJP had brought in NPR because of vehement protests against the NRC. “The concept of NPR was floated by United Progressive Alliance (UPA) in 2010. BJP is, therefore, trying to mislead people that as NPR was brought by the UPA, there is no problem with it. However, the format of NPR has been completely changed. If the government doesn’t want to bring in NRC then it should use our format,” he added.

Replying to a query, the Congress spokesperson said that he did not support people who raised slogans in favour of Islamic fundamentalism. “Government should take action against people who are trying to create a divide between communities. However, we can’t be held responsible for their slogans just because we participated in the same rally,” he added.

Punia further said that Congress did not support protesters who indulge in violence over the NRC issue. “However, government can’t claim that all those who were killed or beaten up by police during protests were indulging in violence. In Uttar Pradesh alone, 20 people were shot dead by police and the state government claimed these people had not died from police bullets,” he added.

‘He should have met me at least for a minute’

PUNE: The Bharatiya Janata Party ’s (BJP) state unit president Chandrakant Patil on Friday asked chief minister Uddhav Thackeray how long will the Shiv Sena tolerate insults to Veer Savarkar.The BJP has condemned the distribution of a controversial book on Savarkar by the Congress’s Madhya Pradesh unit. Patil said he would appeal to his partymen and citizens across the state to condemn the Congress's attempt to insult Savarkar through agitations. He demanded the immediate withdrawal of the book by the Congress and an apology.“I strongly condemn Congress and Congress Seva Dal (a grass roots organisation of the party) for maligning Savarkar. I do not understand what Congress has against Savarkar. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray must react as he has expressed his respect for Savarkar. He must explain if he accepts such an insult,” Patil told reporters after a meeting in Pune Municipal Corporation on a waste processing project.“Savarkar was held innocent by court on allegations about his role in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi,” Patil said. “Yet the Congress is making perverted attempts to show a relationship between Savarkar and the accused in the Mahatma Gandhi assassination case. The Congress’s action of spreading false information about Savarkar is condemnable.”Patil added that while it was the Congress leadership that had approved Partition, the party was now holding Savarkar responsible for it. Patil said Savarkar had shown extraordinary courage in his fight for the country's freedom and had made great sacrifices.“The sufferings Savarkar and his family endured for the country’s freedom are well known,” he said. “He was also a social reformer who worked for reforms in the Hindu community. Instead of seeking inspiration from Savarkar, the Congress is constantly defaming him.”Ranjeet Savarkar, working president of the Swatantryaveer Savarkar Rashtriya Smarak, reached Mantralaya to meet Thackeray at the CM’s office but was unable to do so.“He left the office without meeting me,” he said. “He should have met me at least for a minute to hear our grievance related to Veer Savarkar.”Ranjeet said the CM should register a criminal case against former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and the Seva Dal.In a letter to Thackeray, Ranjeet said: “I am aware about the three-party Shiv Sena-Congress-NCP government in Maharashtra . The time has come to decide what is an important: remaining in power or stopping insults to nationalists permanently?”Ranjeet said he missed late Shiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray.“I would not have had to come to Mantralaya if Balasaheb would have been alive,” he said. “I have expectations from CM Uddhav Thackeray, as he also has a soft corner towards Veer Savarkar.”He said in the letter to Thackeray that the Congress was plotting to defame Savarkar. The letter said: “The party is conspiring to spread anarchy in the country by making unwarranted accusations on the freedom fighter Savarkar.”BJP president Amit Shah, in Jodhpur to address a rally in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), said the Congress should be ashamed of the remarks. “[T]hey are making such comments about Veer Savarkar only for vote bank politics,” he said at the rally.Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani lashed out at Rahul Gandhi. “Congress is stooping low in its vote-bank politics. If he Rahul Gandhi says he is not Rahul Savarkar and is Rahul Gandhi, there cannot be a worse statement against Veer Savarkar,” he said.Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, campaigning for panchayat elections in Nandurbar, demanded an immediate ban on the book.He tweeted: “We want answers from Shiv Sena which has made an unnatural alliance with Congress, if it will ban this book in Maharashtra by registering strong protest or repeatedly tolerate such insults of our most respected personalities just for the greed of power?”He said Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray would never have tolerated such “dirty” words against Savarkar and would have been the first to react, which he would have done in his trademark style.Recently the BJP had attacked the Shiv Sena over former Congress party president Rahul Gandhi’s statement during the Jharkhand assembly election campaign that he was not a Savarkar to take back his statements.Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, the only one in the Shiv Sena to speak up on the issue, said Savarkar would remain great forever. “A section keeps talking against him, it shows the dirt in their mind, whoever they might be. Brains of the people who are insulting Savarkar should be tested first,” he said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73095809,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-114027,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/how-long-will-shiv-sena-tolerate-insults-to-savarkar-patil-to-cm/articleshow/73091764.cms

Jaipur: The Rajasthan High Court’s principal bench at Jodhpur has asked the Centre to tell the steps to be taken for granting citizenship to oppressed minorities of the neighbouring countries under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). The court has granted four weeks’ time to the Centre to reply while issuing a notice.

While hearing a suo motu Public Interest Litigation (PIL) on the pending cases of citizenship and the way Pakistani Hindu migrants are forced to live in inhuman conditions in Bangladesh and Pakistan on account of social and political discrimination, the bench comprising Judge Vijay Bishnoi and Judge Manoj Kumar Garg the amicus curiae Sajjan Singh Rathore informed the court about the recent amendment to the Citizenship Act. The cognizance was taken in 2017 by the Rajasthan High court.

He said that after amendment of the Act, any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered India on or before 31 December 2014 and those been exempted under the Passports (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or by the provisions of the Foreigners Act-1946 or any rule or order there under, would not be treated as illegal immigrants.

The bench also looked into the provisions of new provision 6 (b), according to which the right to grant citizenship would now vest in the central government or an authority under specified conditions.

At this, the court asked the Central government’s advocate Vipul Singhvi and others to provide details on the efforts being made to give citizenship to the oppressed minorities of neighbouring countries in accordance with the applicable provisions after the amendment. Singhvi and fellow counsels sought time to file the required reply.

The court while granting the time scheduled the next hearing on February 3, asking the central government to give the required details.

AHMEDABAD: The state government recently announced setting up of five new medical colleges, but it seems unlikely that they will be functional in a year’s time. The state will however see four new colleges taking shape before the next academic year, said sources. These colleges will come up in Porbandar , Rajpipla, Navsari and Bharuch.

In all, about nine greenfield medical colleges will see light of the day in the next couple of years, adding 1,400 seats, said sources.

“Most of the permissions are in places and these colleges are likely to get the final approval in next one or two months. In all, there will be an increase of 750 seats in Gujarat for the upcoming 2021-22 academic year,” said a senior government official.

Apart from these four greenfield colleges, each with 150 seats, the Karamsad Medical College will increase its number of seats from 150 to 200, he added. There are 30 medical colleges in Gujarat with 5,500 seats presently. Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel recently announced that the government will seek approval to set up five new medical colleges in Panchmahal, Gir-Somnath, Devbhumi-Dwarka, Botad and Morbi districts under a central government scheme. “These five new colleges will take at least a year’s time to become operational,” sources said.

The total estimated cost for setting up the colleges will be Rs 1,625 crores, of which the Centre’s share will be 60 per cent.

PUNE: The re-carpeting of the city airport’s main runway is expected to begin from June and the Indian Air Force (IAF) is likely to issue a notice regarding the work to the civil enclave and airlines this month or by February.“At least six months before the re-carpeting of the main runway, the IAF will issue an alert to the airport officials and the airlines. It is expected that the work will start by June-end. The alert from the IAF should come this month or February. The IAF will decide how the work will be carried out and the contractor will follow the guidelines,” a source in the know of developments said.Airport director Ajay Kumar said until now they had not received any notice from the IAF pertaining to the schedule. “We haven’t got any notice about the dates. However, work on the re-carpeting is on and that has resulted in some issues related to unavailability of daytime slots. The moment we get the notice and schedule from them, it will be announced,” he said.According to sources, the re-carpeting of the peripheral areas of the runway is under way and the work is progressing rather slowly.Being a defence airport, the runway and the air traffic control of the facility is managed and maintained by the IAF. Back in December 2018, the airport authorities had said the runway re-carpeting work was due for 2019. The length of the runway of the Pune airport is above 2,500 metres.Sources pointed out that the Airports Authority of India (AAI) had sent a proposal to the IAF, requesting them to work on the runway during the daytime and allow normal flight operations during the evening hours. “The reason may be because the airport witnesses heavy flight movements during the evening and late night hours. The work on the runway is expected to happen in phases. This will result in the length of the runway getting shorter and airlines may have to operate smaller aircraft like ATRs to and from the airport for a while. The notice will provide more clarity on the matter,” the source said.At present, the city airport witnesses around 170 flight movements daily. “Once the IAF makes the announcement, the airlines, AAI and Directorate General of Civil Aviation will plan the flight schedule for the airport based on the closure dates and/or closure timings.

185,['4/01/2020'],"NMC officials ‘flout norms’, 96 flat owners face eviction","This story is from January 4, 2020

Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) Fire and Emergency Services Department has declared as unsafe a residential building at Ganeshpeth and directed its 96 flat owners to vacate it, following alleged irregularities committed by the civic officials and the builder.

Interestingly, NMC officials had even approved the revised building plan and issued occupancy certificate (OC) to the building named Garden Enclave without fire NOC and compliance.

The alleged irregularities came to fore after one of the flat owners, Laxmikant Murarka, obtained documents from NMC under the RTI Act. “Fire department on August 10, 2018, issued a notice declaring all flats unsafe and directed occupants to vacate the them immediately. The flat owners’ association requested builder to ensure all permissions from fire department but to no avail,” he said.

According to Murarka, the builder has not installed any fire system. “Also, the builder has done unauthorized construction. Despite the issues being related to builder, the flat owners are collecting money and doing whatever they can to avoid any risk to their families and lessen impact of fire department’s action,” he said.

Additional chief fire officer BP Chandankhede told TOI that as on date the flat scheme lacks fire compliance. “Further action like disconnection of water and power supply or registration of FIR has not been taken as flat owners have assured mandatory fire systems will be installed and compliance of directives,” he said.

Documents obtained under RTI revealed that the NMC Dhantoli Zone issued OC to the flat scheme on May 17, 2012. It’s an irregularity if OC is issued in absence of fire compliance certificate.

A fire department’s letter dated June 12, 2018 — also obtained under RTI Act — to the builder Suhasini Realty revealed that NMC town planning department approved revised building plan without revised NOC from fire department. “Fire NOC was issued to two wings of the scheme on March 29, 2008. Town planning department approved building on July 18, 2009. Revised building plan was approved on April 30, 2012, but without revised fire NOC. It is a very serious issue,” the letter stated.

Murarka said fire department should register FIR against builder like in other cases. “Builder would have installed fire systems and obtained fire compliance had the town planning department and Dhantoli zone made it mandatory as per norms. Fire department is not taking any action against builder. Also, despite complaints NMC higher-ups are not taking any action against officials of town planning department and NMC Dhantoli Zone,” he said.

Earlier, Murarka had exposed some serious irregularities by NMC officials, builder and architect. Following his complaint, Lakadganj zone had registered an offence against 13 NMC officials, representatives of builder and architect on April 11, 2018. The police is investigating the case and yet to submit chargesheet.

Lalitkumar Lohia from Suhasini Realiy has filed criminal application in Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court for quashing the FIR. The HC has scheduled next hearing on January 9.

Lohia denied allegations of irregularities by the firm and NMC. “We have the fire NOC and compliance certificate. OC was issued after getting fire compliance. We formed an association and handed over the scheme to it four years ago. All, except Murarka, have no complaints,” he alleged.

186,['4/01/2020'],State unit or CM didn’t deny Khadse ticket: Mungantiwar,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Nagpur: Hours after senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse came out against former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and former WRD minister Girish Mahajan blaming them for him being denied the ticket to contest assembly polls, senior BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar came to the latter’s rescue stating that neither the state party unit nor the then CM had any role to play in the entire episode.

He also sympathized with Khadse stating disappointment was natural for anyone in his position. “Anyone would be upset if they were denied ticket after serving the party for such a long time and helping it spread its wings in the state. Efforts are on pacify him. I had talked with party president Chandrakant Dada Patil in this regard,” he told TOI from Chandrapur.

Khadse, whose daughter Rohini was fielded in his place but lost the elections, never openly blamed Fadnavis and team all these days but kept on indirectly targeting them at public events. He questioned why OBC leaders like him and Vinod Tawde were being sidelined. He charged senior members of the party with conspiring to deny him the ticket and ensuring defeat of his daughter.

During assembly session in Nagpur last month, Khadse met NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, setting off speculations that he would join the NCP but it didn’t happen. On Thursday, an upset Khadse confirmed he was in touch with the Shiv Sena. Sena leaders too confirmed the development.

Mungantiwar however declared Khadse would never leave BJP as it was in his DNA. “The talk of Fadnavis or any other leader from state conspiring against him is baseless. Khadse had proposed Fadnavis’s name for party’s president in state. He is senior and firebrand leader of the party and we will talk to him. All problems could be sorted out through discussions,” Mungantiwar said.

CM misleading state on debt

Mungantiwar trashed chief minister Uddhav Thackeray government’s claims of state being under huge debt of Rs6.41 lakh crore. “They are adding loans of agencies like MMRDA and CIDCO to inflate the figures. We are in fact revenue surplus state with an income of Rs11,900 crore last year. During our tenure, we actually reduced state’s loan. If the CM has doubts, he should file an RTI with finance secretary, who will provide all information on state’s finances,” Mungantiwar said

No irregularity in CAG report

Mungantiwar has also denied accusation of irregularities of over Rs65,000 crore allegedly pointed out by Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India. “The utilization certificates of 2017-18 expenditure were not submitted by the respective agencies due to various reasons like not getting bills from contractors on time. It doesn’t mean funds were misappropriated. Such things happen every year, if you look at CAG reports of all previous years. All reports would show pendency of utilization certificates,” he said.

Chandrapur: A woman tourist from Pune out on an adventure trip with her friends to Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) in Chandrapur district died at a private resort near Kolara gate on Thursday morning.

The deceased, identified as Dipali Jathar (46), reportedly collapsed while she was in the bathroom of her room. Chimur police suspect it to be a case of heart attack.

GV Bhagat, medical officer of Chimur rural hospital where the woman was taken, said that she was brought dead and so police was formally informed.

According to Bhagat, post mortem needs to be conducted to confirm cause of death. It is pending as the relatives are yet to arrive, he said. No police case has been registered.

Sources informed that Dipali was an adventure enthusiast and often used to go on such trips on her own. She had high blood pressure and used to take pills to keep it in check.

She had come to Tadoba with two women colleagues a couple of days ago and they were staying at a luxury private resort. Thursday was the last day of their trip. Dipali and her friends had returned early from the morning safari as they had a train to catch from Nagpur.

Sources in police informed that after returning from Safari, the trio had breakfast and then Dipali went to her room for a bath. When Deepali did not step out of the room after half an hour, her friends started calling her. On getting no response, the friends summoned the resort staff who broke the door only to find Dipali lying on the bathroom’s floor.

Sources claimed that Dipali was immediately given CPR but when she did not respond, she was rushed to Chimur rural hospital where doctors declared her brought dead.

Police officials claimed that they have contacted her family members in Pune and her husband is yet to arrive in Chimur. Cops said post mortem will be done on Friday only if the family senses foul play.

Amit Shah

JODHPUR: BJP president and Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday attacked Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot for the death of more than 100 infants in a Kota hospital, saying the latter should have focused on that issue rather than opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

""Gehlotji, instead of opposing CAA, first focus on the children who are dying in Kota every day. Show some concern, mothers are cursing you,"" Shah said in the CM’s hometown, Jodhpur , while addressing a pro-CAA rally.

Shah said that despite having his roots in Jodhpur - which has a large number of Hindu refugees from Pakistan – Gehlot has been opposing the new citizenship law. ""Gehlot had himself written to the Centre thrice, advocating citizenship for Hindus from Pakistan. The migrants here should ask him why he is now creating hindrance for them by opposing CAA.""

Talking about the crib deaths in Kota’s J K Lone hospital, Gehlot said there have always been some shortcomings in hospitals in the entire country. The CM, who was also in Jodhpur, advised the media and opposition to visit the Kota hospital to identify the shortcomings and tell the government, who would address them.

Hours after his health minister visited the Kota hospital, Gehlot said there was no need for this as an expert team had immediately visited the hospital and conducted an inquiry. He admitted that negligence was found in the treatment of the children.

The CM said that the number of infants dying in Congress rule was lower than that during the BJP regime.

190,['4/01/2020'],"Five hedgehogs rescued from sale in Halol, 4 held","This story is from January 4, 2020

Forest officials in decoy with cops help nab the four from Waghodiya.

VADODARA: The forest officials on Thursday busted a scam of selling hedgehogs and arrested four persons from Waghodia taluka.

The accused were selling the protected animal for tantric rituals. All the four have been booked under the Wildlife Protection Act as hedgehog is a protected species under Schedule IV.

This is the second incident of hedgehogs being rescued in the city within a month.

“We had received information about accused Ashok Vasava selling hedgehogs. We were on his trail for last two months. Recently we got information about his whereabouts and decided to send in a decoy customer with the help of forest officials,” said Raj Bhavsar of Gujarat Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (GSPCA).

The decoy customer approached Vasava at his home in Devaliyapura village and showed willingness to buy three hedgehogs. Vasava demanded Rs 5 lakh per hedgehog and the decoy agreed,” Bhavsar told TOI.

On Thursday, the decoy met Vasava and demanded to see the hedgehogs before making payment. Vasava called the decoy to his home following which the forest officials raided the spot. They rescued five hedgehogs from the spot.

Apart from Vasava, Dhanu Parmar, Mukesh Nayak and Ishwar Nayak who were involved in the trade were also arrested. Vasava had even made preparations for the tantric rituals at his home. “Vasava said that he had purchased the hedgehogs from someone in Kutch. The forest officials are now investigating the racket,” Bhavsar said.

He added that the trend of using hedgehogs for tantric rituals is very recent. Some people have begun believing that by doing such rituals on hedgehogs, they can get rid of any trouble they are facing. Earlier, tantriks used red sand boa and owls for their rituals.

On December 22, the forest officials had arrested three men and rescued two hedgehogs from the city.

Hedgehogs are usually seen in northern parts of Gujarat, especially in forests. Wildlife experts believe that if such poaching isn’t stopped, the endangered species may soon face extinction.

191,['4/01/2020'],Prestige of top district leaders at stake in Zilla Parishad polls,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Nagpur: The prestige of several top leaders of the districts is at stake in the election of Nagpur Zilla Parishad slated on January 7.

Cabinet ministers Sunil Kedar (Congress) and Anil Deshmukh (NCP), leader of the opposition in the state assembly Devendra Fadnavis, independent MLA Ashish Jaiswal, who backed Sena, are pulling out all stops to ensure victory of their party candidates.

Congress and NCP have struck a pre-poll alliance while BJP and Shiv Sena are contesting independently. Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) and Prahar have fielded candidates in many seats. The fight is triangular in most seats and multi-cornered in some. VBA can upset Congress-NCP candidates while Prahar can dent Sena. All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) had fielded two candidates in Kamptee taluka but they withdrew at the last moment.

There are 58 seats in Zilla Parishad. Before the ZP body was dismissed, BJP had formed the government with the help of the Sena and smaller parties. BJP had 21 members, Sena (8), Congress (19) and NCP (7). Three members belonged to smaller parties.

In the 2014 assembly polls, BJP had won five out of the six assembly seats in Nagpur rural. In 2019, the saffron party won two, NCP one, Congress two while Sena leader Jaiswal won as an independent. This time around, the equations are loaded against the BJP.

As Sena, Congress and NCP are in alliance at the state level, they are expected to form the government in Nagpur ZP if they have the numbers. BJP will have to win 30 seats to form the government, which seems unlikely.

All the six MLAs of Nagpur rural are campaigning for the party candidates in their constituencies. In addition Fadnavis, Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari and former minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule are canvassing for the BJP. Sena MP Krupal Tumane is also working hard to ensure a good show by Sena.

VBA has fielded candidates in 20 seats — Makardhokda, Waigaon, Sirsi, Weltur, Silli, Metpanjra, Chicholi, Dhapewada, Dawlamethi, Besa, Nildoh, Takalghat, Isasani, Gumthala, Koradi, Yerkheda and Wadoda. Prahar has fielded mostly Sena and BJP rebels in thirteen seats. They are Mansar, Kachurwahi, Kandri, Bothia, Wadamba, Karambhad, Mahuli, Vanpuri, Chacher, Tarsa, Asoli and Kelwad.

Elections are also being held in Akola, Washim, Dhule and Nandurbar districts. The prestige of Union minister of state Sanjay Dhotre is at stake in Akola and Washim ZPs. VBA chief Prakash Ambedkar has to ensure good performance of his candidates in Akola ZP to prevent loss of face. Sena MP Bhavana Gawli is also working hard in Washim.

HYDERABAD: PVR Cinemas in Inorbit Mall in Madhapur was booked for delaying a movie show by 12 minutes. Following a complaint from Forum Against Corruption (FAC), Madhapur police on Friday booked a case against PVR under the Telangana Cinema Regulation Act.

The movie was ‘Jumanji: The Next Level.’ Vice-president of FAC K Sai Teja, who filed the complaint, said: “PVR played the movie 12 minutes later than the showtime mentioned on the ticket. Moviegoers’ time was wasted by running advertisements. It is an unfair trade practice and violation of the Telangana Cinema Regulation Act.”

Teja said the movie was supposed to begin at 1.55 pm. “I was at the theatre on December 30 but the advertisements were shown for 15 minutes,” said Teja, who filed a complaint on Hawk Eye, a Hyderabad police mobile App, on the same day.

The complainant also produced the movie ticket as evidence.

BP Singh

PUNE: The top awards at the Pune International Film Festival (PIFF), scheduled from January 9, would be bestowed on television producer and FTII chairman Brijendra Pal Singh, veteran actor Vikram Gokhale and music director Usha Khanna .

A number of film screenings and a few workshops will be hosted at the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) to commemorate the institute’s 60th year since establishment.

Filmmaker Jabbar Patel, who is the festival director, said, “BP Singh and his team revolutionized Indian television by creating a show like CID, which ran for over 20 years. You must also remember that he is also an alumnus of FTII.”

Singh’s ‘CID team’, including Shivaji Satam, Aditya Shrivastava, and Dayanand Shetty, will be present for the inaugural function on January 9 at Balgandharva Rangmandir. Patel said the organizers had asked the FTII to nominate an alumni for the award.

“The PIFF organizers did ask us to nominate a distinguished alumnus, which is why we nominated Singh. His credentials are too powerful to ignore. He passed out from our institute in 1972 and he created a show like CID. Any insinuation of a conflict of interest is wrong,” FTII director Bhupendra Kainthola told TOI.

PIFF organizers on Friday also announced the opening film at the festival, “The Weasel’s Tale” by award-winning Argentinian filmmaker Juan Jose Campanella. The selection for the Marathi film competition section at the festival includes acclaimed films like Anandi Gopal by Sameer Vidhwans and Tujhya Aaila by Sujay Dahake.

Kainthola confirmed that some events scheduled as part of the PIFF Forum had been moved out of FTII to other screening venues. Scheduled screenings and some workshops would still be held at the institute’s main theatre and other facilities.

Patel, speaking at the news conference, said the events were moved out of FTII to avoid any risks.

Pune: The Hadapsar police late on Thursday night registered an attempt to murder charge against the three minors detained for assaulting a 14-year-old boy with sharp weapons on Wednesday at a PMPML bus stop allegedly over an old dispute.

The injured boy is stable. He is undergoing treatment in a private hospital, said senior inspector Raghunath Jadhav of the Hadapsar police.

The police recorded the supplementary statement of the boy’s father and later invoked Section 307 (attempt to murder), along with Section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code, with the relevant sections of the Indian Arms Act and the Maharashtra Police Act against the minors.

Jadhav stressed the attack on the boy was fallout of some old dispute. “Last month, the injured boy had an altercation with the trio. They had beaten him up thereafter. We are investigating the case thoroughly,” Jadhav said.

The boy’s father had said on Thursday his son was attacked barely two days after he gave a complaint application to the Hadapsar police against an outfit.

NEW DELHI: To take suggestions from common people to draft its manifesto for the assembly elections in Delhi, BJP launched Meri Dilli , Mera Sujhav (My Delhi, My Suggestion) on Friday.

Party functionaries flagged off 49 video vans, which will go to the 70 assembly constituencies, covering universities, markets and other important areas, to collect people’s suggestions during the 15-day campaign. BJP also launched a portal and released a mobile number to help people register their suggestions. Around 1,600 special boxes will also be kept across the city for the same purpose.

Union Minister Smriti Irani, along with Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari, election co-in-charge and Union minister Nityanand Rai and poll committee convener Tarun Chugh, launched the campaign at the Delhi BJP office.

Irani termed the campaign as a “meaningful dialogue” of BJP with the people of Delhi to get their feedback on the issues of development, upliftment of poor, respect for women, education and infrastructure, among others. “I appeal to the people of Delhi to take part in the exercise to help BJP draft its Sankalp Patra,” she said.

Delhi BJP chief Tiwari attacked the ruling AAP for “misleading” people to divert their attention from local problems. “We are committed to make Delhi the best city as per the resolve of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said.

Two videos, also launched on Friday, will be played on large LED screens mounted on the video vans. “Fourteen vans have been deployed specially for getting feedback from people visiting malls, universities, metro stations, bus stands, markets, schools, colleges and hospitals,” said campaign convener and Delhi BJP general secretary Rajesh Bhatia.

Each van will cover two constituencies. Twenty suggestion boxes will be carried by party workers door to door to collect suggestions. These boxes will also be kept in the video vans, Bhatia said. “People can also record their suggestions by giving a missed call on 6357171717 or through a dedicated website,” he added.

Several senior functionaries, including Delhi BJP in-charge Shyam Jaju, MPs Vijay Goel, Meenakshi Lekhi, Pravesh Verma and Hansraj Hans, and opposition leader in Delhi assembly Vijender Gupta, took part in the event. Delhi BJP media in-charge Pratyush Kanth, co-in-charge Neelkant Bakshi and media head Ashok Goyal were also present.

Representative image

ALAPPUZHA: If at all you are in Kayamkulam on January 19 in the vicinity of Cheravally Muslim Jamaat mosque , do not be surprised to see a Hindu wedding happening at the Islamic academy near its premises. You are likely to meet Anju Ashok Kumar, her mother Bindu and the groom Sarath Sasi and some good samaritans of the jamaat committee, whose efforts and aid led to the wedding.

The wedding is set to happen after Bindu sought the help of Nujumudeen Alummoottil, secretary of Cheravally Muslim Jamaat Committee and owner of Alummoottil wedding centre in Kayamkulam. He is no stranger to Anju’s family as he had come to their aid when Anju’s father Ashok Kumar died. This was yet another act of kindness for the family.

“Kumar, a goldsmith, died of cardiac arrest aged 49 on March 14, 2018 after he dropped his son Anand at Kayamkulam Boys High School for SSLC exam. His son wrote his exam without knowing about his father’s demise and I read about it in newspapers. I visited his family and extended some help,” Nujumudeen said, adding that the family was facing a lot of hardships when Kumar died.

“We sold our house and land in ward 21 of Kayamkulam municipality 17 years ago. That did not end our problems on the financial front. Since then we have been living in rented houses in various parts of Kayamkulam. My daughters Anju and Amritha stopped studying after completing Plus Two. Their sibling Anand is now pursuing higher secondary education,” said Bindu, adding that Ashok’s demise was a shock.

“I had no idea about our future. Then, I joined a private firm as a cleaner for Rs 7,000/month. I pay Rs 2,500 as house rent. We manage to live somehow,” she said. Then one day, Anju’s marriage proposal came up and she knew one person who would help her family.

In the first week of October 2018, Nujumudeen received an application from Bindu seeking help for Anju’s wedding. “When I shared the application with committee members, they unanimously agreed to arrange her wedding. The rituals will be led by a Hindu priest. We will give Anju 10 sovereigns of gold and Rs 2 lakh as a wedding gift,” said Nujumudeen.

For Bindu, the Jamaat committee decision came as a blessing. “I did not have any other means to conduct her wedding. I met Nujumudeen and he promised to help. Words fail me, but I’m grateful to the persons who came to our aid,” said Bindu.

Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra (Photo: Twitter/@SChopraINC)

NEW DELHI: Rubbishing reports that Congress might enter into a post-poll alliance with AAP in case the city gave a fractured verdict, Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra on Friday asserted that his party would get “clear majority” and form the next government in the capital.

“I would like to make it clear that we are going to have a clear majority and form the next government in Delhi. There is no possibility, whatsoever, of any kind of alliance with any party,” Chopra said when asked if Congress was considering an alliance before or after the assembly polls with AAP.

Congress and AAP were involved in hectic parleys for a pre-poll alliance before the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year, but the two parties failed to reach a seat-sharing arrangement. While a section of Congress functionaries was in favour of a tie up with AAP to give a joint fight to BJP, another section, led by then Delhi chief Sheila Dikshit, vehemently opposed the idea.

The ruling AAP has already rejected the possibility of an alliance with Congress for the assembly polls, with a senior party functionary arguing that the party was not even in competition in the upcoming polls.

AICC in charge of Delhi Congress, PC Chacko, said his party was “fully prepared” to face the coming elections. “Our graph is going up and we are sure Congress will come back to power single-handed,” Chacko said.

Nagpur: A 41-year-old woman surrendered before Ajni police on Thursday night after allegedly bludgeoning her husband to death with a hammer at Jaywant Nagar. The accused has been identified as Mamta Porandwar, a resident of Bhagwan Nagar. She took the drastic step allegedly due to her husband’s drinking habit and relations with other women.

Sources said the deceased Mahesh, a transporter-turned-moneylender, had been living away from Mamta and his son for the last four months and did not give any money to them for daily expenses forcing Mamta to take up a job as a caretaker. She is learnt to have gone to the rented house of Mahesh on Thursday to ask him for money for their son’s college admission.

Mamta’s son Manthan, a BCCA second year student, told TOI, “My father did not used to give any money. Whenever we went to speak with him he would abuse us. Some days back when we had gone to speak with him, he and his neighbours attacked us. My mother had sustained injuries on her face but when we went to the police to file a complaint we saw my father filing a complaint against her for assault.”

Manthan claimed that his mother was suffering from severe depression and migraine. “She was undergoing treatment at GMCH,” he said. It is learnt that Mamta had taken several pills before going to meet Mahesh at his house in Jaywant Nagar. “I later found several empty packets of pills at the home,” Manthan said.

Police said a fight broke out between husband and wife. In the fit of anger Mamta picked up a hammer and hit Mahesh on the head. He fell down. Mamta feared that if he got up, he would beat her up, so she continued to hit him with the hammer.

Mamta later approached Ajni police station and confessed her crime. Cops rushed to the spot and sent the body to GMCH where Mahesh’s post mortem was conducted on Friday. Police registered a case of murder against Mamta and arrested her. She was produced before the court on Friday and remanded to police custody till January 6.

NAGPUR: The Nagpur traffic police fined nearly 52 motorists every hour on city roads in 2019. This roughly translates to penalizing 1,248 errant motorists every day considering cops’ working hours from 9am to 9pm. In 2019, Nagpur witnessed 43.69% increase in overall traffic violations as compared to 2018.According to data compiled by the traffic police, there has been rise in traffic violations such as using mobile phone while driving, jumping signals, triple seat riding, dark glass in four-wheelers etc.From January 1 to December 31 last year, the traffic police booked over 4.55 lakh motorists for violations under various provisions, including the Motor Vehicles Act. This was far higher as compared to the number of cases filed in 2018 which was 3.16 lakh. In 2019, violators were made to cough up Rs8.49 crore as fine.Of the 4.55 lakh cases of 2019, helmetless riding topped the list with 59,692 cases. The other most common violations are: obstruction of traffic (49,116); jumping traffic signal (44,075); not wearing seat belt (22,265) and use of mobile while driving (19,370).Like in 2018, even in 2019, more traffic violations came to fore due to CCTV cameras installed at various intersections and roads, said a senior cop. Actual violations committed are usually higher than caught as the cops’ working hours are from 9am to 9pm.Though overspeeding on city roads has increased manifold, the traffic police — despite having high-tech gadgets — failed to curb the menace. In 2019, only 682 motorists were penalized for driving at breakneck speed, while in 2018 it had penalized 1,680 drivers for the offence.Another violation overlooked by the traffic police was driving wrong side. Almost every road in the city witnessed rampant wrong-side driving, but the traffic police could book only 14,979 motorists while in 2018 they had caught 25,034 violators.The data also revealed that motorists of Sitabuldi zone, comprising areas like Wardha road, Amravati road, Railway station etc, violate rules the most. This can be gauged from the fact that traffic police booked 69,960 motorists from the zone during the period.Motorists in Central Nagpur too have become infamous in terms of violations of traffic rules . The traffic cops of Cotton Market zone have penalized 64,367 motorists. Motorists in North Nagpur, which comes under Indora zone, are not far behind as 55,031 motorists were booked in 2019.Despite rise in cases, Nagpur hasn’t seen change in motorists’ behaviour.

Nagpur: In a first-of-its-kind initiative, the ICAR-CIRCOT on Tuesday set up three new ginning machines which are likely to assure higher prices to cotton farmers than the minimum support price (MSP). The pilot project was launched at Hinganghat APMC yard — the major cotton mandi of Central India.

The concept aims to change the way cotton is traded in the country beside promoting quality enhancement using best varieties.

Presently, the farmers get rates only on the basis of raw cotton which consists of lint and seeds. The lint percentage is around 32 to 37% while the rest is the seed weigh. The lint is priced at Rs115 per kg while seeds fetch around Rs25 per kg by ginners.

Irrespective of the lint percentage, growers get a flat rate which is Rs5,550 per quintal as on date.

The research body has pushed for marketing the lint after processing — that is segregating the lint from the seed before it is weighed for auction. This will enable growers bringing better quality cotton to get more than the MSP per quintal.

The CIRCOT led by its director PG Patil implemented the project at Hinganghat through its regional Ginning Training Centre (GTC) off Amravati Road. A GTC team comprising principal scientists SK Shukla, SV Ghadge, scientists K Pandian and SS Kautkar along with NGO Agro Plus visited the cotton hub to roll out the project.

Shukla said the aim is to increase percentage of saleable lint to not less than 38%. “Countries like US and Australia are marketing cotton at 42% lint. The three lab model ginning machines have been given by CIRCOT free of cost to APMC. This will facilitate ginning per cent (lint out-turn) for growers,” he said.

He said NGO Agro Plus president GH Wairale played a major role in convincing stakeholders, including growers to go for lint-based auction. APMC chairman Om Dalia, director Sudhir Kothari and Prashant Mohta from the industry too appreciated the concept.

Wairale said a couple of samples were processed before them and the lint percentage varied from the 33 to 35. “Cotton traders are purchasing the yield presuming 33 to 34%lint content at a flat rate of Rs5,550 per quintal. But, after ginning they realize 36 to 42% lint. The additional 2 to 6% lint benefit goes into the pocket of the traders instead of the farmers. This is because of lack of awareness among farmers and the pricing authority,” he said.

Wairale said the NGO had been pursuing the Mumbai-based textile commissioner to adopt lint-based marketing.

He said cotton marketing, too, must be done scientifically as for milk and sugar. “Cotton prices are decided on visual method by looking at staple length, micronair, grade etc. Milk prices are decided on fat %, while sugar cane rate on sugar per cent,” he said, adding new concept will add up to Rs500 per quintal of earnings to growers.

TimesView The Pune Municipal Corporation should make concerted efforts to make the city self-sufficient in processing its garbage. It should have started preparations well in advance to meet the January 1deadline for stopping garbage-dumping in Uruli Devachi and Phursungi. The civic body doesn’t seem to be prepared to meet even the revised deadline of January 15 because the performance of its treatment plants in the city is below par. The only way to stop dumping of trash in Uruli Devachi and Phursungi is garbage processing at source, and the civic body can achieve it solely through taking residents into confidence.

PUNE: The civic body’s failure to keep its word of not sending garbage-laden trucks to Uruli Devachi and Phursungi after December 31 has dashed the residents’ hope of ushering in 2020 in a stink-free atmosphere.The residents were mulling over a fresh round of agitation, prompting the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to seek two more weeks to stop dumping tonnes of garbage in the two villages every day. The PMC had earlier assured them to stop garbage dumping in Uruli Devachi and Phursungi from December 31, 2019.Dnyaneshwar Molak, head of the PMC’s solid waste management department, said the garbage trucks would be diverted to the existing plants, instead of dumping the waste at Uruli, from January 15. “The operators of these plants have been told to make arrangements to treat the additional garbage at their units. This temporary arrangement will continue for three months,” he said.“Eight new garbage processing plants will become operational by then. The locations of the new plants have been identified. Some projects were at the tender stage. The eight plants will come up in various areas for treatment of waste within the vicinity,” he said.Uruli resident Bhagwan Bhadale, who was part of a team that discussed the issue with the civic officials, said the villagers were disappointed with the PMC’s failure to stop garbage dumping by 2019.“We waited for almost 18 months. After failing to meet the deadline, the administration approached us with a fresh assurance. The officials sought two more weeks to stop dumping garbage in Uruli. After long deliberations, the villagers accepted the PMC’s offer,” Bhadale said.He said the villagers would decide their future course of action on January 15, if the PMC failed to keep its promise.Anant Bhadale, another local resident, said, “Repeated deadlines and the failures to meet them only prove that the administration is not serious about resolving the problem. The residents have been complaining about health hazards, odour and pollution. They have been staging agitations for many years.”",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73092945,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-163970,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-misses-deadline-no-end-to-uruli-waste-woes/articleshow/73091799.cms

Dashrath

VADODARA: Domestic squabbles led to murder of a small boy in Halol in Panchmahal district. The paternal uncle of the boy threw him in a water tank to kill him as he had frequent quarrels with his elder brother’s wife.

The three-year-old boy Kuldeep Solanki was found dead in the water tank of a factory in Halol on December 31. An autopsy was performed and the last rites of the boy were performed by his family. But Kuldeep’s father Dinesh Solanki grew suspicious when he noticed that his younger brother Dashrath did not come home even after the boy’s death.

Dinesh grew suspicious and it also came to light that early on the morning of December 31, Dashrath was spotted carrying Kuldeep in his arms inside the factory. Dinesh’s employers had seen the CCTV footage of the morning when the boy had gone missing and ascertained this.

When Dinesh discussed the matter with his wife Mayuri, she told him that on the night of December 30, Dashrath was playing Gujarati songs loudly on his phone. She had objected to this telling him that children were getting disturbed. Dashrath got angry at this and even threatened Mayuri. Dinesh approached police with these details on Thursday and an offence of murder was registered by Halol police.

Dashrath was traced by the police and put under arrest. He was presented in a court on Friday which remanded him in police custody for five days. It has come to light that Dashrath was peeved at Mayuri for not giving him food properly and did not wash his clothes. Dashrath believed that she used to instigate his brother against him and cause quarrels between them.

NAGPUR: The Nagpur traffic police fined nearly 52 motorists every hour on city roads in 2019. This roughly translates to penalizing 1,248 errant motorists every day considering cops’ working hours from 9am to 9pm. In 2019, Nagpur witnessed 43.69% increase in overall traffic violations as compared to 2018.According to data compiled by the traffic police, there has been rise in traffic violations such as using mobile phone while driving, jumping signals, triple seat riding, dark glass in four-wheelers etc.From January 1 to December 31 last year, the traffic police booked over 4.55 lakh motorists for violations under various provisions, including the Motor Vehicles Act. This was far higher as compared to the number of cases filed in 2018 which was 3.16 lakh. In 2019, violators were made to cough up Rs8.49 crore as fine.Of the 4.55 lakh cases of 2019, helmetless riding topped the list with 59,692 cases. The other most common violations are: obstruction of traffic (49,116); jumping traffic signal (44,075); not wearing seat belt (22,265) and use of mobile while driving (19,370).Like in 2018, even in 2019, more traffic violations came to fore due to CCTV cameras installed at various intersections and roads, said a senior cop. Actual violations committed are usually higher than caught as the cops’ working hours are from 9am to 9pm.Though overspeeding on city roads has increased manifold, the traffic police — despite having high-tech gadgets — failed to curb the menace. In 2019, only 682 motorists were penalized for driving at breakneck speed, while in 2018 it had penalized 1,680 drivers for the offence.Another violation overlooked by the traffic police was driving wrong side. Almost every road in the city witnessed rampant wrong-side driving, but the traffic police could book only 14,979 motorists while in 2018 they had caught 25,034 violators.The data also revealed that motorists of Sitabuldi zone, comprising areas like Wardha road, Amravati road, Railway station etc, violate rules the most. This can be gauged from the fact that traffic police booked 69,960 motorists from the zone during the period.Motorists in Central Nagpur too have become infamous in terms of violations of traffic rules . The traffic cops of Cotton Market zone have penalized 64,367 motorists. Motorists in North Nagpur, which comes under Indora zone, are not far behind as 55,031 motorists were booked in 2019.Despite rise in cases, Nagpur hasn’t seen change in motorists’ behaviour. A majority of the drivers do not mind paying hefty fines after being caught by traffic police, experts pointed out adding the cops should focus on offences like signal jumping, overspeeding, rash driving, wrong-side driving, talking on mobile phone and driving at night with headlamps on high beam.Traffic experts stress on the need for the department to start penalizing repeat offenders more harshly.",auto,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73103297,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1650968,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//auto/miscellaneous/52-motorists-fined-every-hourfor-flouting-traffic-rules-in-19/articleshow/73103310.cms

AHMEDABAD: When Pandit Jasraj — who is in his 90th year — entered the stage, the audience rose as though awakened by light. His kurta, a hint of gold enmeshed in white, augured the glint of his voice — older than India but carrying the verve of a seeker. As he held court, the rising stars of his Mewati Gharana brightly followed his edicts on Raga Darbari.

“The raga was created by Mian Tansen,” Durga Jasraj , Panditji’s daughter, told TOI. “The majestic raga is believed to have been sung in emperor Akbar’s darbar, or court. And when you hear Pandit Jasraj-ji, you understand the depth of the definition of Darbari, which blends with his brand of music. The audience is left in a pure trance, feeling blissful.”

On Thursday, Day 2 of Saptak, the audience rose for the second time — at the end of Panditji’s performance to present a rare Saptak sight: a standing ovation. It appears the audience had indeed felt bliss.

The day opened with the raga of beginnings — Hamsadhvani — rendered by a Japanese santoor player, Takahiro Arai, a disciple of Pandit Shivkumar Sharma. He was accompanied by a Japanese tabla player, Hironori Yuzawa. Arai made santoor peals flutter like the petals of cherry blossoms, flowers for which his country is renowned. Yuzawa has Zakir Hussain hair, but his flamboyance deferred to Arai’s delicate musings.

The final baithak featured Ustad Shujaat Khan’s sitar recital. “After Pandit Jasraj-ji’s performance, there shouldn’t be another recital. That’s the norm.” Khan-sahab told the audience. “But norms are changing and Panditji himself wanted to finish early.” Khan-sahab thanked the rasikas for staying back for him. That the gratitude was genuine was revealed by the vast banquet of his Jhinjhoti. The raga has a forlorn grandeur. Mohammad Rafi’s “Tum mujhay yun bhula na paaogay borrows Jhinjhoti’s melancholic dazzle. And Khan-sahab laid out the mood in forbidding classical purity.

207,['4/01/2020'],cyrus mistry: Ratan Tata too in SC against Mistry order: ‘He lacked leadership’,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Cyrus Mistry (file photo)

NEW DELHI: Tata Sons chairman emeritus Ratan Tata on Friday moved the Supreme Court seeking “complete setting aside” of the judgment of National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), which had directed Cyrus Mistry ’s reinstatement as executive chairman and termed his removal “illegal”.

On December 18, a two-judge NCLAT restored 51-year-old Mistry to the position he had held for nearly four years, and said that the appointment of N Chandrasekaran as chairman was consequently illegal.

Tata, who holds 65.89% equity in Tata Sons, said NCLAT completely misread and misconstrued documents to illogically and uncharitably conclude that he had scripted a coup to unceremoniously oust Mistry.

This is Tata’s second personal petition in the top court, the first one filed almost a decade ago for protection of right to privacy when the contents of the Niira Radia tapes were published. Tata Sons had moved a separate petition on Thursday challenging the NCLAT judgment.

Tata said Mistry declined the offer to step down honourably on October 24, 2016, leading to his removal as the board of directors was convinced that Mistry had besmirched Tata Sons’ business reputation by showing obstinacy in wrongfully pursuing the DoCoMo litigation.

“A glaring example of Mistry’s lack of leadership skills which brought disrepute to the Tata Group was the way he handled the DoCoMo litigation. It was during his tenure that Tata Sons reneged on its word with DoCoMo under the agreement citing purely legal and technical arguments. Even after an adverse verdict was delivered in the arbitration, Mistry attempted to resist complying with the legal obligations further,” Tata said, revealing for the first time that Tata Group had wronged DoCoMo, which had invested in Tata Teleservices.

He added, “This is not what the Tata Sons brand stands for. Honouring its commitments is one of Tata Sons’ highest virtues it takes great pride in. The spat with DoCoMo, which was widely covered by the press, brought ill-repute to Tata Sons.”

He said Mistry also failed to timely capitalise on business opportunities and Tata Sons’ financial performance under his tenure was “deeply unsatisfactory”. He also cited Mistry’s reluctance to meaningfully disassociate from family business after becoming Tata Sons’ executive chairman, gradual concentration of powers in his hands in Tata Group companies to alienate board members, surreptitious acquisition of assets of Welspun Renewables Energy Ltd and Tata Motors’ rights issue as reasons for the board’s “complete loss of trust in Mistry’s ability to lead from the front and for the future”.

The petition said that NCLAT construed the ouster of Mistry by the board as “some sort of retaliation by Ratan Tata for the purported governance structure Mistry was trying to bring in”.

“In this regard, the impugned judgment has bought the theory of ‘prejudicial interference’ wrongly asserted by Cyrus Investment and Sterling Investment (part of Shapoorji Pallonji Group ) and as a result, unfairly and in an unwarranted manner, made adverse observations against Ratan Tata,” it said, adding, “It is unfortunate and distressing that NCLAT’s judgment, without providing any proper evidence, has passed adverse remarks against Ratan Tata who has spent more than half of his life in building the name of Tata Sons and other Tata operating companies to one of the top global companies.”

“The judgment not only creates a wrong legal precedent which is vulnerable to being misused against several companies, including public sector and government companies, it also grants relief that were never sought,” Tata said.

But the plants are currently generating only 20% of the targeted power, the civic body has said in an official reply to a query filed by Sajag Nagrik Manch under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has said the closure of the treatment plants “is the result of experts’ advices and audits by government authorities”.The Sajag Nagrik Manch had sought details about the electricity and gas generated from the plants between April 1, 2019, and November 30, 2019. The plants came up at an expense of Rs16 crore and were supposed to process 125 tonnes of garbage.“The civic administration had claimed that these plants will not only help deal with garbage but also generate electricity. It will help in reducing the PMC’s expenditure on electricity bills. None of these purposes seems to have been served,” said Vivek Velankar of the Sajag Nagrik Manch.Dnyaneshwar Molak, head of the PMC’s solid waste management department, said people’s participation and responsibility were a must to make the plants run. He said, “Efforts are on to ensure that garbage generated in an area is disposed of at the local level itself. Citizens should come forward and support such initiatives. The main aim of these plants is not to generate electricity, but to get rid of the wet garbage at source. Electricity is a by-product.”Molak added that the PMC had carried out audits and needed assessment of these plants through the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute. “The plants using old technology have been closed following experts’ suggestions.

212,['4/01/2020'],Greens see red as forest cover in 12 tribal dists down,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Nagpur: NGOs and civil society organizations working for tribal rights always claim that it is the tribals who are the real protectors of forests. But, the data in recently released Indian State of Forest Report-2019 states that forest cover in tribal districts have drastically fallen.

As per the ISFR-2019, Maharashtra has lost very dense forest (VDF), moderate dense forest (MDF) and open forest (OF) to the size of 63sqkm, an area half of Tadoba National Park (125sqkm), in recorded forest area (RFA) and 31sqkm outside RFA.

As per the latest report, forest cover in the state is 50,777.56 sqkm. In 2017, the cover was 50,682sqkm. So, even as Maharashtra has gained 95.56sqkm of forest, it lost equal amount of dense forest in 12 tribal districts.

Forests play an important role in the socio-cultural and economic life of the tribal people. Hence, Forest Survey of India (FSI) monitors and analyse the forest cover in tribal districts.

There are 218 tribal districts in 27 states/union territories. As per the report, though there is an overall increase in forest cover in tribal districts by 1,181 sqkm, forest cover inside the RFA in tribal districts shows a decrease of 741 sqkm. RFAs are recorded as forests in government records.

In Maharashtra, there are 12 tribals districts with a geographical area of 1,44,233 sqkm. These districts include Ahmednagar, Amravati, Akola, Aurangabad, Beed, Bhandara, Buldhana, Chandrapur, Dhule, Gadchiroli, Gondia, and Nandurbar.

A comparison with ISFR-2017 shows that Maharashtra lost forest cover in all the three categories in these tribal districts. Forest area of all the three categories was 25,112sqkm in 2017. In 2019, it was recorded as 25,049, a loss of 63sqkm. But 31sqkm was also lost outside RFA.

PCCF (HoFF) Dr N Rambabu said, “We are evaluating the areas where FSI has reported change. Till then it will not be proper to tell the reasons for decline in cover in these districts.”

The VDF was 6,902 sqkm while in 2019 it was 6,891 sqkm, a loss of 11sqkm. Similarly, MDF was 9,850sqkm, which was recorded as 9,813sqkm, a loss of 37sqkm, and open forest, which was 8,360sqkm in 2017, was recorded as 8,345sqkm, a loss of 15sqkm.

Wildlife experts have attributed one of the major reasons to loss of forest in tribal districts to encroachments under individual forest rights (IFRs) of Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006.

“FRA implementation started in 2007. Most of our best quality forests are in tribal districts only. Surprisingly, forest cover has continued to decline in all these districts since 2011 till date,” says wildlife conservationist Kishor Rithe.

“This also reflects in district-wise forest cover in Maharashtra where it has declined in 9 of the 12 tribal districts. Gadchiroli, where most of the CFRs and IFRs have been granted, lost 87sqkm area, followed by Chandrapur (35sqkm),” says Debi Goenka, executive trustee, Conservation Action Trust (CAT).

“I’m not ready to believe forest cover has increased. The loss of cover in tribal districts is apparently due to FRA encroachments. In Tadoba buffer alone, 400 hectare area has been encroached upon by people,” said Gadchiroli honorary wildlife warden Uday Patel.

“Besides FRA, felling of natural forest by FDCM and heavy logging operations are also big reasons. Plantations cannot be a supplement to natural forests. Increase in open forest by 191sqkm, which has a canopy between 10-40%, is not a positive sign,” Patel added.

FRA activist Dilip Gode blamed the forest department for decline in cover in tribal districts. “Why did the forest officials not take any action against encroachments after the cut-off date of December 13, 2005 under FRA? Besides, districts like Gondia, Gadchiroli and Chandrapur are vulnerable to forest fires affecting cover. Officials are never punished for fires. A tripartite committee should inquire evaluate the reasons for decline in forest cover in tribal districts.”

213,['4/01/2020'],"14-year-old boy found dead, family dispute suspected","This story is from January 4, 2020

Bareilly: A 14-year-old boy was found hanging with a muffler inside his house at Natiura village in Banda area of Shahjahanpur district on Thursday night. Police said that the boy had “killed himself”.

Notably, the distraught boy was said to be suffering from acute depression after witnessing frequent fights by his ‘separated’ parents. However, his mother has alleged that her husband is a drug addict and has killed their son after a quarrel with her over the phone.

Police had detained the husband and sent the boy’s body for autopsy. The autopsy was conducted on Friday and its report stated that the boy had died due to strangulation. No other injuries were reportedly found on his body.

According to the police, the Class 8 student was depressed. His mother had left the house after a fight with his father around a month ago. Police said that the boy took the extreme step after his mother refused to return home. He used to cook food himself in his mother’s absence, the police added.

The boy’s parents married nearly 15 years ago and differences in their relationship started after his father developed a habit of returning home under the influence of narcotics substances and often misbehaving with everyone.

“I was in Maqsudapur village when my husband himself told me that he had committed a crime by killing our son. Initially, I thought that my husband was lying as he was under the influence of cannabis, but when I reached home, I saw my son hanging inside the house,” the boy’s mother told TOI on Friday.

Meanwhile, SHO Banda police station, Raj Bahadur Singh, said, “The boy has killed himself as he was under depression because of his parents’ continuous fights. There was no one looking after him and he was often scolded by his father. We have also investigated the allegations levelled by the boy’s mother, but there were no evidences to prove that he was strangulated by his father. Even the autopsy report confirmed death due to strangulation.”

The SHO added, “We also spoke to neighbours who told us that the boy used to often cry for his mother and wanted his family to be reunited. We had detained his father, but we may release him after further questioning.”

214,['4/01/2020'],Home Is Where The Heart Is,"By Bhuvan Gupta

He shuttles across Mumbai, Gurugram and Bengaluru like nobody’s business. His client interactions span five continents, dotting every major global hub one can think of. Eight years after returning to Nagpur for good, Yemanshu Kodwani finds work life more hectic than it was in any ‘bigger’ city.It is a minor price to pay for three tranquil days a week at the only place he ever felt like calling home.Yemanshu is one of the countless working professionals who have renewed their allegiance to Nagpur, after dalliances with megacities. While a sense of hometown belonging runs through as a common thread, the ways in which they are enriching the city makes a few stand out.Jumping headlong into entrepreneurship after graduation, Abheejit K moved to Mumbai in 2013 with an edtech venture. Three start-ups later, Abheejit realized he wanted to be “a somebody in Nagpur rather than a nobody in Mumbai”. Today, he leads a non-profit organization that collaborates with the MSME ministry to seed entrepreneurial ideas in the minds of city students.The ideas need a nest to hatch, and Sukhada Chaudhary — whose own start-up was born out of working remotely for a UK-based firm in Mumbai — provides exactly that, in the form of an affordable co-working space in the heart of Nagpur.Then there are those like the coffee cognoscente Mithilesh Wazalwar, who come armed with craft and experiences. With his coffee roasting venture, Mithilesh has banished the fear of introducing a niche offering in an untapped market, reposing faith in his abilities and Nagpurians’ propensity to acquire new tastes.The success reaped by returnees has helped foster a start-up ecosystem, which lures outsiders like Deependra Solanky. Pained by the farmers’ distress in Vidarbha, moving to Nagpur was a natural choice for Deependra, after devoting 17 years to rural development in Delhi and Kolkata. His agri-ventures have propelled micro-entrepreneurship in over 230 villages, boosting farmers’ digital financial literacy in the process.If start-ups give wings to the city’s economy, the IT sector serves as the backbone that sustains it. Faster commute and a sedate pace of life has brought back scores of technology professionals to their roots, but upon scratching the surface, other, subtler reasons are evident too.“Since Nagpur is a smaller centre, we got a chance to directly interact with the company CEO. Opportunities like this give us a better shot at getting recognition for our work,” says Anagha Raipure, who relocated to Nagpur after working for four years in Pune.A smaller IT landscape also implies that employees think twice before quitting, which works to organizations’ advantage. “The ready availability of talent, coupled with low attrition rates encourages IT companies to start new businesses here,” states Yemanshu.The challenges, nevertheless are immense, ranging from infrastructure to working attitudes. Mandar Pande, an IT professional with prior experience in Mumbai, believes that it “pisses off clients” when they have to switch flights or trains to get to Nagpur. On top of that, there is “a mismatch in the salary expectations and skill sets” of young jobseekers, as per Vyom Shah, a management executive who returned in 2012 to commence an independent strategy consulting venture here.Many feel that the city’s relaxed rhythm indirectly impacts business prospects. “Things move in a slow fashion here, increasing the opportunity costs for business, as it takes longer to convert to sales,” opines Abheejit.In the words of chartered accountant Nikhil Karwa, there is an “inertia due to lack of corporate exposure”. It is this inertia that compelled Nikhil — who moved to Nagpur after plying his trade for 11 years elsewhere — to open a branch in Pune and make up for the loss of professional opportunities.The need to make financial sacrifices (as compared to Tier-1 cities) is a near-unanimous concern for employees and entrepreneurs alike. A relatively less vibrant corporate ecosystem makes business networking opportunities limited, too. Abheejit rarely spots any business leaders he hasn’t already met, at conclaves and industry-level meetups.For Sukhada, though, this translates to “more tightly knit business communities”, wherein one is able to foster better relationships and expand their business through word of mouth recommendations. The same rings true beyond work too for Priyal Tapa, who moved from Delhi for the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) here.“I find myself a lot more connected to people, as against the veritable anonymity I experienced in Delhi. It is easier to form social circles here,” Priyal says.The sentiment is echoed by several others. “The people are so warm and helpful,” gushes Britika Mazumdar, an environmental engineer from Kolkata who didn’t think twice before shifting here for a job. “I have always felt safe here. Women are treated with a lot of respect and dignity,” chimes in Tasneem Akolawala, who has been running an English language coaching centre in the city, ever since she moved from Mumbai in 2001.A city, warts and all, boils down to its people; and that alone seems to be drawing many back. The trend may well continue, because if affability is the tipping factor, there’s plenty more where that came from.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73109475,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-84161,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/home-is-where-the-heart-is/articleshow/73091831.cms

Some of the demonstrators also tied their hands, to mark the Muslim community’s helplessness against the government’s decision to implement CAA.

“This (mode of protest) was decided after discussing it with some senior members of our community. We wanted to demonstrate that we aren’t allowed to express anything and our right (of freedom of speech) has been curtailed. The current regime doesn’t even want us to speak anything against them.

Nashik: The process of making the 7/12 extracts of land in Nashik district available online has touched the 96%-mark.

The tribal taluka of Peth tops the list by uploading 99.94% of the 7/12 extracts online . “The process of bringing online all the record of rights (RoR) of agricultural land is nearing completion and at this point in time 96% of the records across the district have been made available online,” a senior official from the district administration said.

In order to bring in transparency in record of rights, the government has planned to bring the records online for viewing and obtaining digitally signed copies of the same. The RoR is one of the important documents informing which land is owned by whom, since when, who all are the stakeholders along with other information.

There have been incidents in the past where people have sold their land to multiple parties and what follows is a long court battle.

“The new system will now help a person get the ROR at the click of a button without having to go to the talathi office,” the official said. Of the 12.43 lakh RORs across the district, 11.87 lakh RORs are now available online.

In Deola, 99.79% of RORs have been made available online, followed by Dindori (98.43%), Chandwad (97.83%). At the bottom is Nashik taluka with 90.98% records online and majority of the records yet to be uploaded belong to ‘Devasthan’ samiti.

Bareilly: A stray tiger that killed a farmer and injured a 45-year-old man at Budheli Nankar village on Monday is causing sleepless nights among the residents in Hyderabad area of Lakhimpur Kheri district. The tiger has also killed several livestock in a span of a few days.

Forest department has installed camera traps to track the big cat and set up a cage to trap it. Besides, its personnel have been combing the area to control the situation. A drone camera is also being used to track its movement. Experts from Wildlife Trust of India(WTI) are also supporting the forest department but so far, the tiger has evaded capture.

People in the area are in a state of panic as it is adjacent to Maheshpur range of social forestry region, which extends from Dudhwa Tiger Range. Forest department has already confirmed the presence of more than six big cats in the area. The presence of so many tigers in the area has increased the possibility of man –animal conflict.

What is worrying experts is the pattern of killing. According to Dr Daksh Gangwar, a veterinarian from WTI, “The hunting pattern of the tiger suggests that it is a sub adult, probably weaned off from its mother early without being completely trained by it. After killing one man and attacking one man earlier this week, it has killed six goats and one calf in two days. This is not the way a tiger normally hunts. It is yet to mark its territory inside the forest and seems to be attacking every moving object. We have installed a cage to trap it and trying to monitor its movement.”

Amrit Kumar, a local villager, said, “We are not feeling comfortable and are living in constant fear of a tiger attack every time we go to our agricultural fields. The tiger is killing our men and cattle. Now, we can’t live a normal life here. We can’t even protest because an FIR will be registered against us.”

Samir Kumar, divisional forest officer, said, “We are conducting meetings with residents of villages adjacent to Maheshpur forest and have alerted them to be cautious and move in groups. We are combing the area and using drone cameras to look for the stray tiger.”

220,['4/01/2020'],"Syntizen for citizens: The face of new digital BFSI, govt services","This story is from January 4, 2020

Hyderabad: Remember the numerous signatures you had to put on multiple documents for opening a basic savings account? And for opening a demat account or investing in mutual funds, the number of signatures would have increased proportionally. And if there was a slight mismatch in signatures, the entire process would have to be redone.

On-boarding customers for the BFSI sector used to be riddled with regulatory hassles and it is this pain point that city-based startup, Syntizen Technologies , set up by three friends Vamsi Kotte, Siddharth Kukatlapalli and Dinesh Desu, set out to address.

Today, they are at the frontier of tapping facial recognition technology to deliver government services that required citizens to personally visit offices but can now be offered from the comfort of their homes. And this new technology will help them tap not just the Indian market but foreign markets as well.

The genesis was a college project on biometrics that Vamsi had undertaken while pursuing his BTech and this helped him and his friends, Siddharth and Dinesh, deep dive into the world of biometrics and the various opportunities it offered.

“We started with an idea of digitising the process of on-boarding customers for BFSI sector. We did so by using the Aadhaar number as it provided name, address, gender, age and date of birth of a customer at one go, which helps in basic KYC,” says Siddharth.

Their first pilot was with Muthoot Fincorp in 2014 where it used the Aadhaar number of customers to simplify the KYC process and within two months, the startup began to reach out to more BFSI players.

A couple of months into the job, the startup realised that by capturing Aadhaar details, it was only solving 30% of the eKYC task for its clients. “We started digitising application forms. However, we found out that even after digitising the application forms, one would have to take a print out of it and take signatures… at some places they would require signatures horizonally, while at others it was required vertically, depending on the regulators’ requirement.”

It is here the startup started tapping into the Aadhaar eSign facility, where one could sign the document by providing the Aadhaar number along with fingerprints or OTP. “In eSign, one has to provide the Aadhaar number, fingerprint or iris and the document to be signed. Once the details match, a digital signature is instantly generated and that signature is embossed on the document… and this is how we were able to completely digitise the onboarding process of customers for BFSI players,” he adds.

In the first three years, the startup was providing e-KYC, digitised application forms and Aadhaar eSign facilities depending on the requirements of its clients. As it developed competencies in the Aadhaar authentication work, it realised there were many opportunities to be tapped in the government space, where it can use Aadhaar to implement various schemes.

The startup was selected as the technology solution provider for Aadhaar in Telangana in 2017. Currently, Syntizen is working with 14 departments of the Telangana government to carry out nearly 1.5 million transactions daily based on its Aadhaar authentication services.

This includes mid-day meals, Rythu Bandhu and even tracking attendance of teachers in certain tech educational institutions. It is preparing grounds to roll out its services with UP government and has approached many other states with its solutions.

While on the private sector front Syntizen hit a roadblock last year following a Supreme Court judgement stating that private companies cannot ask for Aadhaar details, the ordinance that came later allowed voluntary use of Aadhaar as proof of identity giving it hope that it can start working with private clients soon.

Bareilly: The health department on Friday cancelled the registration of seven pathological laboratories for showing the same pathologist in their records. Health officials said the medical officer concerned was not visiting any of these labs.

According to sources, the health department had received complaints against these seven pathologies on theIntegrated Grievances Redress System (IGRS) that they give wrong reports and flout guidelines on disposal of bio-medical waste. Following the complaints, the health department conducted an inquiry.

Additional chief medical officer (ACMO) Dr Ranjan Gautam said, “All these seven pathologies had showed only one medical officer. However, we later verified that he does not visit these pathologies. A few tests should be done in the presence of a pathologist. The same person cannot be present at seven pathologies and hence, we have cancelled the registration of these labs.”

The pathologies whose registration have been cancelled are situated in Sanjay Nagar, Rampur Garden, Sirauli, Karamchari Nagar, Subhash Nagar, CB Ganj, Aonla, Faridpur Road and Bisalpur Road.

The registration of these pathologies was cancelled on the ground of showing same medical officer in their records and he was not physically present in them. However, officials said they did not investigate whether pathologies “gave wrong test reports”.

Health officials said there are nearly 200 pathologies registered in Bareilly district. “We are monitoring other pathologies in Bareilly district. We will take action against more laboratories in future after it is confirmed that they are flouting rules,” said Dr Gautam.

He added, “If any pathology wants to renew its registration, it will have to reapply with the health department with a new doctor. Registration will be done only after verification that it fulfills all guidelines and also an interview of medical officer concerned will be done.”

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari

NEW DELHI: Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari on Friday challenged chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and his cabinet colleagues to stop the registration process of properties in unauthorised colonies for which DDA was issuing conveyance deeds.

Tiwari said that the ruling AAP was rattled after the Modi government in the Centre started issuing the ownership documents to the residents of such colonies. “Kejriwal has no right to continue in a constitutional position because he is being a hindrance in conferring ownership rights to the people,” Tiwari said.

With 20 residents of unauthorised colonies getting ownership documents of their properties on Friday, Tiwari asserted that the central government had fulfilled the promise it made to over 40 lakh families living in these areas.

“Congress and AAP only see the poor as their vote bank and deprive them of their rights,” said Tiwari while addressing two separate public meetings in west Delhi’s Sagarpur and Mohan Garden South areas.

In a press statement, leader of the Opposition in Delhi assembly, Vijender Gupta, alleged that AAP functionaries were misleading residents by saying that their houses will be sealed by the government even after the registry. He added that the AAP functionaries had conveniently ignored that fact that with urbanisation of 89 villages, the land-use of the agricultural land had automatically changed.

Addressing the public meetings, West Delhi MP Pravesh Sahib Singh said the BJP’s priority was to listen to the problems of the common man and work towards solving them with the “heart and soul”.

224,['4/01/2020'],Uttar Pradesh: Man 'falls' from terrace as police barge into house,"This story is from January 4, 2020

The man suffers multiple fractures.

BAREILLY: A 32-year-old government school teacher, who has a dowry case registered against him, sustained grievous injuries after he allegedly fell from the terrace of his house after police barged into recover Rs 1.25 lakh alimony from him based on a court order.

Doctors said the teacher, identified as Ajay, suffered multiple fractures, including in the backbone, and may not be able to walk again.

“We need to perform surgery in Ajay’s backbone to treat his injuries. Even though the injuries are serious, it is not life-threatening,” said doctor Brijeshwar Singh, Siddhi Vinayak Hospital.

According to family members, Ajay, who was sleeping in his room at that time, ran towards the terrace when police barged into their house on Thursday night and allegedly jumped from there. They claimed that the police exerted pressure on Ajay to pay up the money.

Pradeep Kumar, a family friend of Ajay, told TOI, “Police exerted too much pressure on Ajay, which he couldn’t bear. Amit was not even absconding and was regular to his school. Cops should answer why two police jeeps went to his house at 11.30pm, and why they broke the door. We believe that the police wanted to exert pressure on Amit to pay the money to his wife because the additional district and sessions court may provide a stay against additional chief judicial magistrate’s (ACJM) order next week.”

However, SHO of Quila police station, Manoj Kumar , said, “We had the recovery order and a non-bailable warrant (NBW) against Ajay. He fell from the terrace when we reached his house. Police have the authority to go to the accused’s house anytime if there is a warrant issued against him.”

When TOI asked SSP Bareilly Shailesh Pandey whether the action of the police was appropriate in this case, he replied, “The SHO informed me that the court had issued recovery order and an NBW against the teacher and that they were only following the court’s order. I will look into this matter.”

Ajay was married in 2009 and has two children. The ACJM had given ex parte judgment in favour of Ajay’s wife earlier this year. Later, Ajay filed an appeal in the additional district and sessions judge court to quash the lower court’s order. The judgment is due to be delivered next week.

With citizens vexed with the city’s improper drainage system, TOI asked readers what authorities can do to improve the situation

Should authorities go for a complete overhaul of sewer lines?

Authorities should go for a complete overhaul of sewer lines. While this process may cause inconvenience to citizens, it is important to replace the entire sewerage machinery in the area. As these sewer lines are very old, there is no point in repairing them. The only solution is installation of new sewer lines. The situation will worsen further if we don't have adequate sewage treatment plants. If the sewage lines are not replaced, citizens will have commutation and health problems. I request the authorities to act promptly so we can avoid further instances of inundation.

Nagarjuna Y

The sewer lines in Hyderabad must be close to 100 years old. It could cater well to the needs of the population of that era. However, with the increase in population there is a need to update the sewerage in the city. The sewer lines should be contemporary and customised to suit the requirements of today. The government should invite tenders to overhaul the old and outdated sewer lines across the city. Though this is a tedious task, proper plan of action and support from all stakeholders of the society will help expedite the process. GHMC, SCB,and all major government departments should work together for this important task.

Deepesh Surana

Overflowing drainage and choked sewer systems have been the bane of our twin cities for a long time. The sewer systems built for a population of five lakh, several years ago, cannot cater to a quadrupled population. The issue started when individual houses with five people gave way to apartments with 30 inmates. The pipeline that earlier catered to five people is now catering to six times the population. Authorities have not replaced the old drainage system with larger pipelines and the supporting systems. It is a good sign that HMWSSB is designing a new sewerage master plan and overhauling the sewer systems while addressing the pipeline width issue. I request authorities to do this in phases or else the whole city will be thrown into chaos and squalor. Massive awareness campaigns have to be launched by authorities to educate the citizens of the city. They must be asked to avoid throwing plastic material, vegetables, meat, and other hard material into the drains. Every apartment and gated community should have a person responsible for waste management and immediately bring to the notice of authorities for any problem with disposal of waste. This way, issues such as theft of manhole covers can also be prevented. GHMC also needs to recruit more staff for regular monitoring of potholes, bumps, waterlogging on the roads and clearing of garbage in every locality. Garbage has lying unattended for many days together in several places in twin cities. This has to be avoided. Keep citizens posted on the developments and plans for better sewer systems & waste disposal systems.

Ramesh Vemuganti

I feel that there is no need for new pipelines in the city presently. This will be a waste of money. However, the sewage board should ensure that they do not give permission for new connections or allow illegal connections to come up in the first place. Those using illegal connections must be strictly penalised. The sewage board should conduct awareness camps for people educating them about not throwing food , plastic bags, sanitary napkins and condoms in the drainage pipeline which blocks free flow of sewage water.

T Kailash Ditya

New sewage lines to cater to the ever growing needs of the population is a must. Pipes laid a few decades back without proper planning has led to the present situation. Proper lines should be laid after planning, keeping in mind the requirements of the next 10 to 15 years. Though a new pipeline may solve the problem to a certain extent, permissions for new constructions should be carefully monitored to avoid haphazard growth and prevent overload on the pipelines.

Representative image

PATNA: A 30-year-old undertrial prisoner, accused in a 2017 gold robbery case in Rajasthan’s Jaipur, was shot dead by another inmate inside Hajipur jail in Vaishali district on Friday. A 9mm pistol, used in the crime, was seized from the jail premises, police said.

Manish Singh, a resident of Teliya village under Rajapakar police station in Vaishali district, had earlier survived a murderous attack on the Hajipur civil court premises in May this year. Two police personnel had suffered bullet injuries in the firing, which took place soon after Manish stepped out of the court room.

Police said a fellow inmate, identified as Raja Singh, fired three bullets killing him instantly around 2.30 pm on Friday. The killing led to clashes between two rival groups forcing the jail authorities to baton charge in which five inmates suffered injuries. Sources said all five are undergoing treatment at a hospital and the condition of one of the inmates, Prince Kumar, is stated to be critical.

A group of inmates told police officers that Manish was killed at the behest of another prisoner Anu Singh, considered to be the mastermind of the Jaipur gold loot. The two were at logger heads over the share of the loot.

IG (prisons) Mithilesh Mishra said Anu Singh had given a ‘supari’ of Rs 10 lakh to the shooter Raja for killing Manish. “It’s a matter of concern for us how the weapon was smuggled inside the jail,” Mishra said, admitting security lapse.

An investigating officer, requesting anonymity, said blood stains and traces of explosive were found on the shooter, adding the conspiracy to kill Manish was hatched inside the jail. “Manish had applied for bail in the court. However, hearing on his bail petition was deferred due to winter vacation,” the officer said.

“It is being ascertained how the weapon got inside the jail,” said DM Udita Singh, adding, those found responsible would face disciplinary action.

IG (prisons) has sought a report from the DM and the SP in-charge. SP Gaurav Mangla, who has been transferred from Munger, is yet to assume charge. Police source said Manish and Anu had an altercation a few days ago after which Manish had applied for bail.

NEW DELHI: With no “significant” contribution coming from five members to plan the party’s poll campaign ahead of the crucial assembly polls , the top BJP leadership has “restructured” the core committee by “dropping” them from the 23-member team, sources privy to the development said.

Delhi BJP’s core committee is a key decision-making panel of the organisation, which oversees the party’s preparations for the assembly polls.

Those “dropped” from the panel include three Lok Sabha members and two senior functionaries who have held important positions in the state unit of the party.

At least four members of the committee TOI spoke to confirmed the development. “The dropped members were not called in the last four meetings, which were called by the BJP president and other senior leaders in the past few days,” they said.

“No dropped member has been given any notice or intimation about their removal. The party leadership has simply stopped sending them the intimation about meetings,” said one of the committee members.

Sources, however, said that the dropped members have been accommodated in committees recently formed by BJP to supervise election preparedness, campaigning and administrative work.

230,['4/01/2020'],Fertilizer co fined Rs50L for ‘abuse of court process’,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Nagpur: In an unprecedented and first-of-its-kind order, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday directed petitioner company and intervener to pay a whopping amount of Rs50 lakh to the respondents within four weeks.

While dismissing the plea by Nagarjuna Agro Chemicals, agriculturist Anand Ambadwar’s PIL and Bhagwan Karmenge intervention application, a division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Milind Jadhav observed that all those are “actuated by ulterior motive of having commercial gain by eliminating the competition and creating monopoly using the process of the court”.

“This is nothing but an abuse of court’s process. The litigation is unnecessarily dragged on to spend court’s valuable time for several days,” the judges said while severally censuring the petitioners and intervener.

“The HC has to be intolerant to such situation and practice of filing such frivolous and vexatious litigation, without having any genuine interest and lacking in all bona fides. It needs to be curbed and treated with iron hands, so as to deter the litigants from taking a court for a ride by misusing its process,” they added.

The Indian Council for Agriculture Research (ICAR) and Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI) had jointly developed Soil Testing and Fertilizers Recommendation (STFR) technology. Both Delhi-based agencies commercialized it by issuing licenses to 14 companies/firms, including Nagarjuna. The company however entered into an agreement with Indian Institute of Soil Science (IISS), Bhopal in 2014 for improvement of STFR meter.

When its move was opposed by the ICAI and IARI, the company knocked HC’s doors seeking an inquiry into STFR’s manufacturing and marketing without having facility of testing of two mandatory parameters. It prayed for restraining STFR’s marketing without getting its validation at least in five different agro-climatic zones in the country.

The respondents — ICAR and IARI — through counsel Mugdha Chandurkar contended that Nagarjuna’s move to ink MOU with IISS was a violation of non-disclosure of technology know-how. IARI principal scientist SC Datta, who invented STFR, alleged that the company came out with ‘Mridaparikshak’ on its own by replicating the idea/concept of STFR meter, a programmable digital colorimeter with menu based interactive programme, dedicated to estimation of soil available nutrients.

He said it is a first-of-its-kind in India and is patent protected and can’t be copied. He added ‘Mridaparikshak’ does not display the soil testing technology developed and licensed by ICAR-IARI, but displays name of IISS.

Agreeing with the respondents, the judges said their research work reveals Nagarjuna has been instrumental in misleading and misrepresenting various government departments for commercial profiteering and gain without having any genuine interest in raising such issues. “We hold that the petitioners and intervener failed to make out any case of misrepresentation, mischief, cheating or fraud on the farmers or other beneficiaries in respect of commercialization of STFR Meter,” the judges said.

The judges made it clear that ICAR and IARI are government establishments comprising renowned scientists having expertise in the field and therefore their bona fides are unquestionable. “It’s unfortunate that one of IARI units — IISS, Bhopal — is licensing the promotion of commercial interest of Nagarjuna, which is having hostile attitude towards its parent establishment. We expect the respondent ICAR and IARI to take action for violation agreement against the petitioner and it possible blacklist it,” they said, before dismissing the company’s petitions.

PATNA: A 22-year-old youth was allegedly tortured and killed by his girlfriend’s father and his associates at a village in Purnia district late on Thursday night.

Police said the body, which bore multiple injuries, including cut marks on the neck, was found dumped in a maize field on the outskirts of the village on Friday. The body was sent for autopsy to Purnia sadar hospital.

Dilkhush Yadav, a resident of Leela village under Bhawanipur police station area of the district, had gone missing on Wednesday. He had reportedly told his family members that he would arrive late. But when he did not turn up, the family members informed the local police on Thursday.

The deceased’s uncle, Saurav Kumar, said Dilkhush worked at a cotton mill in Jodhpur and had returned on December 21. “Prima facie it appears to be a case of honour killing. Evidence of the girl’s father and some of his relatives have been found and raids were on to nab the criminals involved in the incident. The body was handed over to the family after post mortem,” Bhawanipur SHO Subash Mandal said, adding, the girl’s father Mithilesh Yadav has been arrested.

“The location of the deceased’s cell phone was traced near the girl’s house, which revealed that he had gone to meet his girlfriend on New Year day. Later he went missing,” the SHO said, adding, that the girl’s interrogation led to her father’s arrest.

Dilkhush’s relatives told the police that he had fallen in love with a 16-year-old girl of the same village. On Wednesday he left his house after receiving his girlfriend’s phone call. “The injury marks on his body suggested that he was subjected to physical torture before being strangulated to death,” a family member said. Investigation revealed that Dilkhush had returned from Jhodhpur on December 31 and had gone to meet his girlfriend the next evening.

232,['4/01/2020'],Bandh complete in capital region as protests continue,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Amaravati: Intensifying the agitation , farmers of the capital city area enforced a bandh on Friday. The farmers and local youth went around offices and educational institutions in the area and made them down the shutters. Except for emergency services in hospitals, the bandh was complete observed as part of ‘Sakala Janula Samme’.

Tension prevailed at Malkapuram junction in Mandadam village when police took women participating in rastaroko into police vans. With the protestors refusing to end the strike on the road leading to the secretariat, the police took them into custody and shifted them into police vehicles. The situation turned volatile when the protestors refused to go into vehicles after repeated appeals made by women police. The police deployed additional forces and pushed the agitators into the vans.

Expressing anger at the police action, the women shouted at them for using force. The women entered into a heated debate with the police for preventing their protests. The women warned the police of serious consequences if they tried to crack down on the farmers’ agitation at the behest of the state government. The protestors raised Jai Amaravati slogans during the scuffle.

Meanwhile, local youth in all the 29 villages of the capital city area formed separate teams to enforce the bandh. They visited offices and schools and appealed them to join their protest. The youth also appealed to the police to cooperate with them as they were staging protests for the sake of farmers of the capital city area. The youth cleaned the shoes of the police seeking their support for their movement.

Farmers staged dharnas in all the villages and demanded that the state government should stop plans to shift the capital city from Amaravati. They said that weakening of Amaravati would not only shatter the dreams of the farmers but the development of the entire state.

Meanwhile, TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu slammed the police for using force against women who were peacefully taking part in agitations. He criticised the government for deploying police forces in the capital city villages. He found fault with the DGP for precipitating the matters by using police force to curb peaceful protests.

Naidu also lashed out at the government for humiliating the farmers who sacrificed their agriculture land for the capital city.

Hyderabad: City-based pharma major Dr Reddy’s Laboratories on Friday informed the bourses that it has received approval of its shareholders and unsecured creditors for the proposed scheme of amalgamation of Dr Reddy’s Holdings Ltd (DRHL) into the company. The voting was held at a meeting conducted by the company on Thursday as per the orders of the Hyderabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal.

The resolution for the amalgamation was approved with 99.98% of the total 13.11 crore votes being cast by equity shareholders in favour of the scheme and only 0.02% (21,026) votes being cast against the resolution, the company said in a regulatory filing.

At the meeting of unsecured creditors, 74 of them voted in favour of the scheme of amalgamation with 12,596,770,778, while the 13,843,506 votes cast by one creditor was declared invalid.

The company’s board had on July 29, 2019, approved the amalgamation of DRHL, a promoter group entity that holds 24.88% stake in Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, into the company.

The scheme would lead to simplification of the shareholding structure and reduction of shareholding tiers, DRL had said in a regulatory filing on July 29. “The Promoter Group cumulatively will continue to hold the same number of shares in the Company, pre and post the amalgamation,” it had said in its filing then.

MANGALURU: South India’s first and the country’s fourth Regional Academy Centre for Space (RAC-S) by Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) was inaugurated at National Institute of Technology Karnataka(NITK), Surathkal, on Friday.

In this context, Isro and NITK signed an MoU. It was signed by P V Venkitakrishnan , director, Capacity Building Programme Office (CBPO), Isro, and K Umamaheshwar Rao , director, NITK, Surathkal. The exclusive centre aims to pursue advanced research in the areas of relevance to the future technological and programme needs of the Indian space programme.

Venkitakrishnan, interacting with the media after signing the MoU, said this centre is one of the ‘bahus’ (daughter-in-law in Hindi) among the many ‘bahus’ of Isro, and expected that it will perform best. “We will give unlimited powers to this centre to carry out activities, and it’s student centric—whereas the other centres are faculty centric. The centre will have the responsibility of incubation and research,” he said.

The other three RAC-S by Isro are located in MNIT Jaipur, Gauhati University and Kurukshetra University.

The RAC-S setup at NITK, Surathkal, will receive an initial funding of Rs 2 crore. Venkitakrishnan said that Isro expects that collaboration with NITK will trigger interest for incubators on space technology.

“Many startups usually perish in a few years due to various reasons. However, Isro plans to help those who come with space technology startups by offering products and help in innovative thinking. There are future plans to help the best startups with funding and other requirements,” he said, adding that the onus on success of RAC-S is with NITK, Surathkal. RAC-S will also help in offering academic degrees related to space technology.

Two more centres in the pipeline: Isro chief

Dr K Sivan, chairman, Isro, and secretary, DoS, government of India, in a video message, during the workshop on space technology applications, said that two more such centres are in the pipeline at NIT, Patna and BHU.

“All these centres are set up in tier-2 cities where space technology is not much talked about. These centres will develop interest among the young generation in rocket and satellite technology and also use it for the betterment of society,” he said.

He added that RAC-S will cover Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Kerala and Puducherry.

“Today Isro is venturing into new arenas like navigation systems, Gaganyaan and others. It is essential to strengthen academic collaboration and also at the same time spread the footprints of space technology to different parts of the country,” he said. He also stressed how RAC-S will play a pivotal role in space technology.

235,['4/01/2020'],Probe Into Firing On Mayor: RFSL miffed with cops for seeking guidance of forensic ‘teachers’,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Nagpur: Controversy has erupted in the case of firing on mayor Sandip Joshi after the Regional Forensic Science Laboratory (RFSL) experts expressed concern with the police department for engaging faculties from Government Institute of Forensic Science (GIFS) to visit the crime spot and seek guidance in detecting the case.

The RFSL authorities have outright refused to provide services in future if the GIFS faculties are involved despite the latter “not having legal authority”.

In a letter dated December 20, 2019, RFSL’s senior officials have alerted city police top brass that there could be legal lapses in cases on involving forensic science faculties for legal guidance and as experts “who do not possess any field experiences”. A circular issued by director general of police, legal and technical services, Hemant Nagrale too has been sent along with the letter in which various norms, methods and procedures of visiting the crime scene, recording and furnishing information in different formats have been provided.

Sources in the police said that the letter was dashed to city police chief BK Upadhyay following the recent fiasco at the crime scene where bullets were fired at Joshi’s car by two unidentified bike-borne sharpshooters on the Outer Ring road-Wardha Road connector shortly after December 17 midnight last year.

The crime scene was visited by RFSL officials and also a senior faculty from GIFS at the same time. While some senior police officials had contacted the senior faculty from GIFS, the others had summoned RFSL leading to major confusion at the spot. Some senior police officers too were not sure which team belonged to which institute and who had the legal sanction to remain present at the spot.

RFSL senior officials have now informed police department that they have the legal power under section 293 of Criminal procedure code (CrPC) to remain present at the crime spot as ‘experts’ and later appear before the court for deposition during the trial.

They have also clearly underlined that their institution cannot be held responsible for any damages done to the merit of the case “if the GIFS faculties are drawn into the probe without any legal authority”.

A GIFS source stated that their visit to the crime scene was requisitioned by senior officers who wanted their opinion as experts. They also lambasted RFSL for having engaged scientists “on contract basis” and engaging scientists “not having adequate academic qualification”.

In another issue that has cropped up in the case, problems are being faced by some cops while interrogating prime suspects who were present at the wedding anniversary party of Joshi. Sources in the police said that the suspects complained to Joshi about their interrogation style and put a brake on the process.

Joshi, refuting allegations of cops, said he is coordinating with the department on a regular basis. “There is a thin line between questioning and harassing. I believe that everyone is under scanner and each one needs to be questioned. But this does not mean that you can summon someone at 11am and hold him back till 3pm,” he said.

Dehradun: State education minister Arvind Pandey on Friday issued an order to ensure that all formalities regarding CBSE/ICSE or Uttarakhand board affiliation of schools are completed within 60 days after an application is filed. The move came days after the audio clip of joint secretary of secondary education allegedly demanding bribe from a school owner, and threatening to withhold the school’s No Objection Certificate (NOC) for CBSE board affiliation if he didn’t pay up, surfaced. The education department will send a proposal to the government to ensure time-bound completion of the process of school affiliations, director of education RK Kunwar said.

He added that the move is intended to streamline the process. “We will be sharing the proposal with the government soon, which will include a clause to finalise the affiliation process in 60 days. Those who are eligible for affiliation will get it in time while those who don’t fulfil the criteria to get CBSE, ICSE or Uttarakhand board affiliation, will be informed about it within the deadline.”

On Tuesday, education secretary R Meenakshi Sundaram had attached Singh to the secretariat after the audio clip of the latter demanding bribe went viral. Sundaram said Singh seemed to have misused his powers and that “such acts tarnish the image of the department and government.” He added that Singh could face suitable departmental action if found guilty.

In Friday’s meeting, the education minister also discussed various issued related to examination and course completion in the ongoing academic sessions. There were also discussions on laptop distribution and the syllabus of government schools.

Cap

Vadodara: Work on over 200 housing blocks in Sayajipura for the economically weaker sections of the society may eventually see completion.

The housing project, along with two other similar projects in Gotri and Tandalja, were awarded to M V Omni Projects in September 2015 by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), which were to be completed by October 20, 2017.

However, citing financial issues, the firm abandoned all the three projects midway.

The Sayajipura project was to come up at a cost of Rs 11.57 crore and, according to a proposal put before the standing committee of the civic body, only 35 per cent of the work on the project was completed. The company was paid Rs 4.06 crore by the civic body before it stopped work. VMC then started looking for other contractors to finish the incomplete projects. But nobody was willing to take up the Sayajipura work. Eventually, the VMC had to tweak the estimates and conditions to encourage contractors. Despite this, only one contractor came forward to complete the project.

The contractor quoted Rs 10.77 crore against VMC estimates of Rs 7.5 crore. Optionless, VMC negotiated with the contractor who agreed to take up the work for Rs 10.46 crore. The Rs 11.57 crore project in 2015 will now cost the civic body Rs 14.53 crore, including the payments made to M V Omni Projects.

A proposal to give the work to this contractor has now been put before the standing committee. With beneficiaries agitating frequently and the delays, the civic body is left with no option but to go ahead with the project.

239,['4/01/2020'],On-the-run Samruddhi subcontractor arrested,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Nagpur: The Wardha local crime branch (LCB) has finally managed to arrest Ashish Daftari, owner of MP Constructions. He was an accused in the case of murrum excavation from the land of Hyderabad-based Cozy Properties without any permission from the owner as well as the district administration. Daftari has been on the run for nearly four months.

MP Constructions was the subcontractor of Mumbai-based Afcons Infrastructure which had bagged the contract for executing the 59km stretch of Samruddhi Mahamarg in Wardha district.

PI Nilesh Bramhane from LCB told TOI that the court on Friday ordered police custody remand (PCR) for Daftari till January 9. “The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court had transferred the case to the LCB. We started investigations three days ago. Learning about Daftari’s presence in Nagpur since a couple of days, we moved in to arrest him. He was in Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and other states after being booked in the case,” he said.

On July 30, Cozy Properties had lodged a complaint with Selu police alleging Afcons and MP Constructions of excavating murrum from its over 103 acres land without permission. Selu police had registered an offence against Anil Kumar Bachu Singh, project officer of Afcons, and Daftari under section 379, 447, 427, 120-B and 34 of IPC (illegally intruding into other’s properties in a group and stealing) on August 22.

Singh and Daftari had sought anticipatory bail from Wardha district court. It was rejected on September 13. Singh had approached HC and then the Supreme Court for anticipatory bail. When it was not granted, Singh surrendered and took bail.

Afcons had also lodged a complaint with Selu police blaming MP Constructions for the murrum excavation. The police is yet to act on this complaint.

Wardha district administration had fixed responsibility on Afcons and slapped a fine of Rs239 crore. The amount has to be paid on or before January 20.

Afcons and its subcontractors had also excavated murrum without any permission from zudpi jungle, hillock, land owned by state government, forest land, lake and excess excavation in Bor river. Wardha district administration is yet to take any action on this.

240,['4/01/2020'],Many MVA MLAs of Vid vying for guardian minister’s posts,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Nagpur: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is not only witnessing tussle among the three partners over allocation of portfolios but also for the post of guardian minister with multiple contenders in most of the districts.

According to activists from the coalition partners — Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress — battle for guardian ministership is also one of the reasons why portfolios of 36 new ministers haven’t been declared even four days after their swearing in on Monday. The dissent by remaining legislators, including seniors who failed to get ministerial berths, was making matters worse for the government.

Unlike the former CM Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP-Sena government, the MVA failed to grant ministership to legislators from Akola, Bhandara, Gondia, Washim, Wardha and Gadchiroli districts in Vidarbha. From the remaining districts of Nagpur, Amravati, Chandrapur and Buldhana, those who have been made ministers are in the fray to become guardian ministers.

In Nagpur, there is a straight fight between two heavyweights, Congress minister Nitin Raut and NCP’s Anil Deshmukh who’s is tipped to get the all important home ministry. Another Congress minister from district, Sunil Kedar, is unlikely to stake a claim being a first-timer in the cabinet. Earlier, he was minister of state for power and transport in the Sena-BJP government under former CM Manohar Joshi (1995-99).

While both Raut and Deshmukh are keen to become the district guardian minister, the former has an upper hand as he had previously held the post during Democratic Front’s tenure from 2009 to 2014.

Similarly in Amravati, there is a battle between Congress’s Yashomati Thakur, who registered a hat-trick of wins from Teosa, and four-time MLA Bacchu Kadu from Achalpur. Having being inducted into the cabinet, Thakur is more likely to become guardian of Amravati as compared to Kadu who was offered minister of state (MoS) berth.

In Chandrapur and Buldhana, there is virtually no contest as four-time MLA Vijay Wadettiwar and five-time MLA Dr Rajendra Shingne are most likely to become guardian ministers respectively.

At places like Yavatmal, there is an opposition to favourite candidate Sanjay Rathod, the Digras MLA. He was guardian minister in the previous government, but was later replaced by Madan Yerawar and given charge of Washim. Now, a group supported by Sena MP from Yavatmal, Bhavana Gawali, is opposing his candidature following their old differences, activists said.

241,['4/01/2020'],Water Users Association at ‘Waghad’ gets national recognition,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Nashik: The Central Board of Irrigation and Power (CBIP), New Delhi, has recognized the potential and achievements of Water Users Associations (WUAs) formed in collaboration with the Water Resources Department’s Waghad project.

The current irrigation of the farm land at Waghad is more than 140% of the targeted area for irrigation.

The collective efforts of 16,958 members of various WUAs formed in collaboration with the Waghad project in Nashik district have not only effectively saved water but also increased the yield. It has also upgraded the lifestyle of the members of these WUAs. Therefore, the CBIP has decided to present its 2020 award to WRD, Govt of Maharashtra, for running the ‘Effective Participatory Irrigation Management’ system.

“This is a major achievement for the WRD as well as the government. The project was constructed on Kolwan River — a tributary of Kadwa River in 1978 with an aim to irrigate 6,750 Ha land through the left and the right bank canal of the project. Since 1991, the WUAs were given ‘measured’ water by the WRD against openly flooded canals. The farmers were also asked to manage the canals. Today, it is one of the finest examples of how the system can run with the farmers at the helm,” Rajesh Gowardhane, executive engineer, Palkhed irrigation division, said.

The project has 24 WUAs with 16,958 members. There are a total of 234 directors for these WUAs who run the system. Of thse 234 directors, 72 are women. The Samaj Parivartan Kendra — an NGO — played a pivotal role with the state government in raising the system.

The WUAs first understand the requirement of farmers as well as the funds required for supplying water to them. The proposal is then presented to the WRD for its approval.

A significant aspect of the system is that the farmers would otherwise fail to get water for crop post monsoon now produce crops even during drought.

243,['4/01/2020'],Nashik get access to Samruddhi exp at Pimpri-Sado,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Nashik: The city motorists going or coming from Mumbai will be able to use the proposed Samruddhi Mahamarg through a new junction at Pimpri-Sado .

The traffic coming from Mumbai will be able to climb the ghat through the tunnel and take an exit at Pimpri-Sado junction to join the Nashik–Mumbai national highway for onward journey.

The project being constructed by the Nagpur Mumbai Super Communication Expressway Ltd will see the Pimpri-Sado junction as an addition to the earlier Sinnar junction, which would help motorists going towards Aurangabad and Nagpur.

This entry and exit points will help all the vehicles coming from Bhopal, Dhule, Nashik towards Mumbai and in even in the return journey. Apart from this, the entry and exit points have been mandated for the major reason that the motorists have the shortest distance in Igatpuri taluka on the Samruddhi Expressway and the NH-3 route.

Further, the transportation going towards and coming from northern India can use this road for direct access to ports. “This arrangement will now cut down the travel time to Mumbai to just above two hours given the eight-lane road is expected to facilitate the movement of vehicles at 120 kmph. This will improve the connectivity between Nashik and Mumbai as well,” said Nashik Member of Parliament, Hemant Godse.

The traffic will be received and dispatched at Pimpri Sadruddin junction which will now have 30-meter wide Vehicular Under Pass (VUP) with 5.5 meters in height which is bigger than the one proposed earlier.

The MSRDC had sought to increase the dimensions of the VUP – sanctioned earlier by the NHAI and which were already under tender processing. The NHAI had therefore sought to know if the MSRDC would bear the additional cost of the construction for the same. “The MSRDC has decided to bear the cost of the construction of the VUP and hence it is likely that there would be seamless transition of the traffic at the junction,” Godse added.

Tulabhara to pattada-devaru of Udupi Adamar Mutt ‘Kaliyamardana Krishna’, in presence of Adamar mutt swamiji I... Read More

Mangaluru: Udupi’s Adamaru Mutt seer Eeshapriya Teertha swamiji who will ascend the paryaya seat on January 18, said the horekanike ritual will be extended for two years.

Horekanike is a practice of devotees making offerings to the mutt during paryaya. This is observed after the pura pravesha rituals till the paryaya celebrations.

Paryaya is a religious ritual which takes place every alternate year in Sri Krishna Mutt. The puja and administration of Krishna Mutt is distributed among the heads of Ashta Mutts for a duration of two years. Devotees offered ‘guruvandana’ and ‘tulabhara’ seva to Eeshapriya Teertha swamiji’s ‘pattada devaru’ kaliyamardhana during his visit to Manju Prasada, the house of Pradeep Kumar Kalkura, president, Kalkura Foundation, on Friday.

On the sidelines of the rituals, the seer told reporters that the purpose of horekanike will be to develop better contact will the people. “Instead of restricting the ritual to a few days before paryaya, we will be extending it to two years. We would like to see the devotees and interact with them. People from surrounding areas must come to the mutt and understand the traditions and practices. We want people to visit the mutt with devotion and listen to the message of the acharya and Sri Krishna’s preachings, and imbibe the same in their lives,” he said.

In this regard, the seer has listed out villages that offer horekanike to the mutt, and these villages will be given a chance to visit the mutt once in 15 days. Art troupes from these villages will be recognised and given an opportunity to perform, the seer said.

The seer further said that all good practices will be continued, and depending on the needs, projects will be implemented. “We have not thought about new programmes, as priority will be given to Krishna puja during my paryaya,” he said.

Stress on water

conservation

Eeshapriya Teertha Swamiji said that the mutt has thought of programmes that will help increase the groundwater table and several measures are likely to be implemented in the coming days in this direction.

The seer believed that if the mutt takes a step forward towards water conservation, people will surely follow the same. On rainwater harvesting, he said that a team had visited Coimbatore. “A scientific study has been done and attempts will be made to implement the same. There will be a continuous effort towards increasing the green cover. Already 2,000 saplings have been distributed,” he said.

About Eeshapriya

The Adamaru seer is the disciple of Shree Vishwapriya teertha swamiji and is an engineering graduate. He will be ascending the paryaya throne for the first time.

Mangaluru visit

The seer visited Mangaluru on Thursday as part of his nationwide tour before ascending the paryaya seat. On Friday he visited various temples in the morning, following which devotees offered guruvandana at Manju Prasada.

Tulabhara in the form of coins was offered to the pattada devaru Kaliyamardhana. The seer first offered the coins followed by devotees from different walks of life. Remembering, Vishwesha Teertha Swamiji of Sri Pejawar Adhokshaja Mutt, he said that the seer will continue to live among us. “His daily schedule will put a 25-year-old youth to shame,” he said. He later attended a public reception at Srinivas College auditorium.

Panaji: Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) has altered its plan to set up a centre showcasing marine life in its Benaulim property, and now plans to have a three-star hotel at the location.

A corporation official said the market feedback and feasibility study were not favourable to a marine life interpretation centre, and hence a starred hotel has been proposed.

The earlier plan was to have a scuba diving centre, gift gallery showcasing life underwater, photo booth and a fish spa. The project was to be undertaken under private partnership, but now stands cancelled.

A total of 20,250sqm area belonging to GTDC in Benaulim was proposed for development, and part of the property was earmarked for parking facilities and wayside amenities under the Swadesh Darshan scheme of the Union ministry of tourism.

“A marine interpretation centre along with allied infrastructure for tourists was planned through private investment, but the feasibility report has not been favourable,” the official said.

The proposal being considered now is to have a starred hotel with a minimum rating of three-stars along with facilities such as a toilet block and drinking water, at an estimated cost of Rs 30 crore, he said. The official also said the applicant for the new project will be free to explore the possibility of setting up a themed hotel, subject to permission from GTDC.

The property will be licensed for 20 years and will be renewed further, subject to compliance. The official also said their experience is that investors are not forthcoming if the license period is short, of ten to 15 years.

“They say it is not possible for them to recover their investment in a short lease period. We are compelled to lease our properties on long lease,” he said.

Panaji: Goa Tourism Development Corporation’s (GTDC) plan to build a hotel at its property in Pernem will be delayed after both the parties mutually decided to cancel the agreement with Valley Meadows Hospitality Pvt Ltd, the agency, selected for the purpose.

The decision was arrived at after the agency cited that area proposed for development under the tender was substantially reduced.

The licensee claimed that the project had become “uneconomical” due to the lessening of area licenced for development and requested to release performance security deposit of Rs 25 lakh, an official said.

“The agency declined to develop the property as it was not connected to the national highway,” the official said. The property is connected by a service road.

The main reason cited by the agency was that a fuel station was built on major part of the property along the access road, the official said.

The fuel station was mentioned in the tender as “way-side facility”. If it was clearly stated in the tender that the facility was a fuel station, it would have given licencee a fair idea, and accordingly, it would have planned the project, he said.

After much deliberations, GTDC decided to release Valley Meadows Hospitality from contractual liability and float a tender to select a new agency for the project, he said..

“The whole process will take at least six months before a new agency is selected and actual work can start,” the official said.

Kambala jockey Shrinivas Gowda in action

MANGALURU: It’s that time of the year when Shrinivas Gowda hangs up his contractor’s hat and breathes races day and night. The 28-year-old Kambala jockey has won 11 medals from four events this season and hopes to beat his own record of 28 medals and clinch the overall championship.

Gowda, from Mijar Ashwathpur, has been taking part in Kambala races since 2013 and was the overall champion in 2017-18 with 28 wins. He will be racing buffaloes at the Mulki Seeme Arasu Kambala on Saturday.

Traditionally, Kambala in Tulunadu is seen as thanksgiving for a good harvest, rain or for the health of the cattle. What began as a ritual running of pairs of buffaloes through slushy paddy fields, barefoot jockeys behind them, is now a fiercely competed rural sport. Nearly 50 races are held between November and March every year and winners take home gold coins and cash prizes.

“When the Kambala Academy introduced training for jockeys in 2013, I enrolled myself. I am among the very few jockeys who after training has been participating in Kambalas regularly,” says Gowda. Currently one of the most sought-after Kambala jockeys, Gowda races buffaloes for Harshavardhan Padiwal (Moodabidri), Mahakalibettu Seetharama Shetty (Bantwal), Iruvail Panila Bada Poojary and Shakti Prasad Shetty of Mijar Prasad Nilaya.

“I have shared a special bond with buffaloes from my childhood. Soon after returning from school, I would run to look after them, massage and help them swim. Much like other pets, the animals respond with love and affection. Padiwal’s buffaloes Kala-Raja and Bolla-Kala listen only to me. I have no fixed practise sessions, but before Kambala races, I take the buffaloes for swimming at the nearby river,” he says.

Gowda works as a part-time contractor and spends most of his time with the buffaloes. He says there are about 30 jockeys who regularly participate in the events. His idols are Kolake Irvathur Anand, Marnad Rajesh, Ravi Kumar Aladangady and Sathish Devadiga among others.

Son of a coolie worker, Gowda hopes to earn money and fame with the traditional sport. “My dream is to bring repute to my town. Kambala has a huge fan following and my job is being appreciated widely. A few jockeys are paid event-wise and it is upwards of Rs 1 lakh,” he says.

“There are around 11 events planned for this season and I am hopeful that my medal tally will go up. I am eyeing the overall championship this season and hope to start cultivating my own land,” says Gowda.

AHMEDABAD: Bad weather in northern India caused a delay in the departures of at least 15 flights from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad. These included flights to Mumbai, Chennai, Jabalpur, Chandigarh, Kishangarh, Hubli, Jodhpur, Delhi, Dehradun, Lucknow, Bhubaneswar, Kochi and Pune. These flights were delayed by between 25 minutes and 2 hours and 30 minutes.

The delayed flights included an international flight, to Dubai, which was delayed by 2 hours. As there was heavy fog in Chennai on Friday morning, a SpiceJet flight from Ahmedabad to Chennai, SG-501, was diverted to Coimbatore.

A SpiceJet spokesperson said, “SpiceJet flight SG-501 operating from Ahmedabad to Chennai was diverted to Coimbatore due to bad weather in Chennai. The flight from Coimbatore was operated when visibility in Chennai improved.”

The city airport also handled one flight diversion. A GoAir flight from Mumbai to Vadodara, G8-567, was diverted to SVPI airport due to bad weather. It arrived in Ahmedabad at 8am and departed after an hour and a half.

257,['4/01/2020'],Opposition’s LKS boycott sent wrong message: CM,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: With the two-day Loka Kerala Sabha (LKS) concluding on Friday, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan criticized oppostion leader Ramesh Chennithala and UDF members for their non-cooperation ‘which sent a wrong message about LKS’ and urged them to take an active participation in the LKS.

“Their support was being sought over several months through letters and personal invitations by the Speaker. An appeal was made in this regard in the Assembly in June and a personal letter was sent to the oppostion leader in November to avoid any differences which could cast a shadow over LKS. If all come together, the LKS will gain more strength. But even if they don’t join, the LKS will go further ahead,” he quipped.

The CM, who said the government policy was not to keep anyone at a distance from the LKS, also urged the LKS members ‘to administer some wisdom’ into the opposition MLAs and bring them on board.

Later, speaker P Sreeramakrishnan told reporters that he would continue with his efforts to ensure the support of the opposition legislators. “I hope this is only a temporary non-cooperation and I will continue with conciliatory talks,” he said.

On the allegation of the extravaganza with regard to conducting LKS and renovation of the R Sankaranarayanan Thampi Hall at the Assembly complex, the speaker said that money was spent for a worthy cause. “Though the project was estimated at Rs 16 crore, the actual cost was only around Rs 8 crore, and the total expenditure was less compared to the first edition of the LKS. The hall will remain as an asset in the state capital and it cannot be termed as an unnecessary expense,” he said.

Meanwhile the oppostion leader, in a statement issued, said the LKS was a total failure. “Several projects announced already during the first LKS were announced again and there was nothing new. All those announcements still remain on paper,” he alleged.

Pointing out that a major chunk of invitees did not turn up for LKS, Chennithala said adequate opportunity or freedom was denied to those who took part. “Though the opposition MLAs and MPs boycotted the summit as announced earlier, a majority of MLAs in the ruling front too kept away from the conference, but without making any public announcement,” he said.

Alleging that there were no efforts to solve the issues being faced by expatriates, Chennithala said the LKS was just a farce. “The UDF took part in the first LKS with great hopes. But the government did not take any steps to implement the decisions taken during the first LKS, forcing the opposition to stay away from this fraud this time,” he pointed out.

258,['4/01/2020'],Mangalagiri MLA dares TDP to prove insider trading charges,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Amaravati: Condemning the TDP allegations, YSRC ’s Mangalagiri legislator Alla Ramakrishna Reddy said he is ready to quit the assembly if the opposition could prove insider trading charges against him.

He alleged that TDP was trying to throw mud at him only to cover up their misdeeds and irregularities in the capital city area. Speaking to media here on Friday, Alla said the TDP functionaries were worried as they have exposed their insider trading practice in Amaravati with the support of documents.

He said that TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu and Nara Lokesh have deployed their followers to make vague allegations against YSRC leaders, including him. “I dare them to come out with evidence to show that I have purchased land in any of the villages in Amaravati either before the announcement of the capital city or after the capital city,” Alla demanded. He said that he would not take even a minute to quit the assembly if TDP could come out with the evidence.

Alla wanted to know as to why Bhuvaneswari did not visit the capital city area when Naidu government had tortured the farmers during the implementation of the LPS. He said that hundreds of farmers were taken to the police stations and harassed them by implicating them in false cases. He demanded Bhuvaneswari to ask Naidu why he had failed to construct even a single permanent structure in the land pooled from the farmers.

Alla alleged that Jana Sena president Pawan Kalyan had dropped his plans to support the non-LPS farmers during the TDP regime after accepting a package from Naidu. He asked why Pawan did not continue his agitation against the forcible implementation of LPS in the capital city area when Naidu was at the helm. “Pawan Kalyan’s deal with TDP is open. He did not field his party candidate in Mangalagiri to help Lokesh. However, people have rejected both of them,” said Alla Ramakrishna Reddy.

Guntur: Former MP Rayapati Sambasiva Rao’s son and TDP functionary Rayapati Rangarao on Friday said he has no links to the tainted Transstroy (India) Limited, which is involved in a multi-crore bank fraud case.

He said he had written to Prime Minister, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and RBI about the suspicious deals of Transstroy managing director Cherukuri Sridhar six months ago.

Responding to the CBI and ED cases filed against his family, Rangarao told the media on Friday that his mother Leela Kumari had served as director in the company.

He said they came to know about the irregularities and misdeeds of Sridhar only after the death of his mother. “My name was not there in the CBI or ED cases,” said Rangarao. He said his father and former MP Sambasiva Rao was unaware of financial irregularities of the company as he never actively associated with the firm.

He said Sridhar secured bank loans with the connivance of bank officials. “I had written to RBI, CBI, finance minister and PM last September about Sridhar’s suspicious deals,” he said.

He said the bank had admitted to the irregularities only after CBI launched the probe last November. He asked why the banks remained silent for nearly two years despite knowing about Sridhar’s alleged misdeeds.

260,['4/01/2020'],Central region votes in favour of DMK,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Representative image

TRICHY: The central region has proved to be successful ground for the DMK as it won a majority of the union and district councillor seats in the eight districts. DMK has fared well in all the eight districts – Trichy, Karur , Ariyalur, Perambalur, Pudukottai, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagappattinam. Its allies, Congress, CPI and CPM were also victorious in some parts of the region.

AIADMK also registered victory in decent numbers of seats in several districts. In Karur, AIADMK won 66 union councillor seats and nine district councillor seats, while in Ariyalur, AIADMK won 8 district councillors seats and DMK won three, but AIADMK fared poor in the union councillor elections.

Politicians say the anti-Citizen Amendment Act (CAA) caused setback to the ruling dispensation as minorities in rural areas avoided the AIADMK for its support to CAA. AIADMK allies BJP and DMDK also opened its account in some places in the region.

Bharatiya Kisan Sangam spokesperson N Veerasekaran said that the absence of a charismatic leader like J Jayalalithaa also reflected in the elections in the rural local body. Politicians also pointed out the lack of coordination among cadres in the AIADMK.

DMK Trichy south district secretary KN Nehru was not surprised with the victory. “DMK and Congress men are always in good touch with the rural people and that rapport converted into votes in favour of them. Above all, the local affinity in terms of relationship and caste played a major role in the rural local body election,” Nehru told TOI, adding that he would like to see the trend continue in the 2021 assembly elections.

The functioning of the rural local body under the guidance of officials since 2016 has also caused disappointment to the locals. “In most of the places in rural areas, officials are least bothered about providing basic amenities since 2016 after the tenure of elected representatives. They had no understanding about the inconvenience to the common man. People reacted in the election to the ruling government negatively,” said Ayilai S Sivasuriyan, Trichy district president of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam affiliated to CPI.

“The anger over lack of work in the local body and farmers fuming over sky rocketing price of fertilizers in the delta region were also visible,” said Sivasuriyan. There was also disappointment over the state government for their response to the rehabilitation work after Cyclone Gaja last year.

AIADMK’s Trichy urban district secretary P Kumar refused to comment on the poor performance of his party in the rural local body election.

All the six Lok Sabha assembly constituencies Trichy central region were won by DMK and its alliance parties CPI, Congress and IJK in May 2019.

261,['4/01/2020'],Chain snatcher from Kerala held in city,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Trichy: Trichy city police arrested a man hailing from Kerala late on Wednesday who was involved in several chain-snatching incidents in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.

N Mohammed Mustafa, 32 from Pulikkaparambil at Malapuram district in Kerala, was nabbed by a team of cops near G corner in Trichy city.

Deputy commissioner of police (crime and traffic) Trichy city R Vetharathinam said that Mustafa was a notorious offender involved in many chain-snatching cases in Kerala, Coimbatore, Erode, Tiruppur, Udamalpet, Pollachi, Avinasi, Palani, Karur, Dindigul, Salem and Trichy.

“Most wanted in several chain-snatching cases in Kerala since 2015, he fled from Kerala to Tamil Nadu in 2017. Since then he operated in many districts here. This is the first time he was caught by the police for his crimes,” DCP Vetharathinam told ToI this morning.

Trichy city police intensified the search for the accused after the city witnessed back-to-back chain-snatching incidents where 6 and 10 sovereign chain was snatched from two women near Jamal Mohammed college and Kajamalai in Trichy city on December 26, 2019.

Covering his face with a cloth and helmet to conceal his identity, Mustafa would ride his bike in full throttle and snatch chain from women before fleeing the scene.

The police managed to trace him by identifying his two-wheeler model and by analyzing his high-speed riding. The police said that his two-wheeler has Kerala registration number on the front and Tamil Nadu registration number on the back.

On being surrounded by the team at G-corner, he was questioned by the police. Preliminary enquiries revealed that he kept the stolen jewelleries in his house in Kerala. The police team took him to Kerala and recovered 103 sovereign gold ornaments worth Rs 31 lakhs from him. The recovered ornaments were snatched from women in Trichy and few other districts. The police also seized an SUV from his house.

DCP Vetharathinam said that he would not stay more than four to five days in one place for his handiwork. “He takes his car where ever he goes and arranges for a bike to indulge in the chain-snatching,” he said.

The police produced him before Trichy court and remanded him in judicial custody.

Artic Skua spotted by birders

MANGALURU: It was a pleasant surprise for birders on an expedition off the Mangaluru coast recently. They spotted a whale shark , which was about 20 feet in length, for more than five minutes. Ten birders from across Karnataka took part in a day-long pelagic birding expedition, organised by the Coastal Bird Watchers Network on December 28.

Shivashankar M from the Coastal Bird Watchers Network said sighting of a whale shark is rare. Sighting them is not easy and we got to shoot footage of the whale shark using our cameras for five minutes, he said.

Sajan John, manager and head, marine projects, Wildlife Trust of India , said, “Whale sharks are not rare to find along the Mangaluru coast, but sightings are definitely rare. Whale sharks are found in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Netrani island off the Karnataka coast. Due to Mangaluru’s proximity to Netrani, the whale shark may have ventured into waters off the Mangaluru coast,” he said.

Coastal Bird Watchers Network has been conducting pelagic birding expeditions for almost a decade. The first expedition was conducted from Malpe, and they gradually shifted to Mangaluru. “Our aim is to organise at least two expeditions a year. This helps us understand the breeding, population, and distribution of sea birds. However, at least 15 days goes into planning such expeditions. Sea birding has its own challenges. It is tough and also depends on participation and the cost of the survey,” he said.

This expedition was held after being postponed for a long time because of frequent cyclones. Some of the prominent birders included Manjula from Bengaluru, Vinay Bhat, a biotechnology postgraduate student who is now into ornithology, Venkatesh Prasad from MRPL, Vijayalakshmi from Mysuru and 9-year-old Shlok. The vessel was provided by the College of Fisheries.

The birders spotted 15 individuals bird species and identified Arctic skua, also known as parasitic jaeger, that breeds in the north of Eurasia and North America, with significant populations as far south as northern Scotland, pomarine skua that breeds in the far north of Eurasia and North America, greater crested tern that occurs in tropical and warm temperate coastal parts of the old world from South Africa around the Indian Ocean to the Pacific and Australia, and several gulls and dolphins. We were expecting sightings of a few more birds, said Shivashankar.

CHENNAI: With the last of the results still trickling in late Friday evening, more than 36 hours after the counting of votes began, the DMK front edged past the AIADMK alliance, winning 2,338 panchayat union wards and 272 district panchayat wards. The ruling AIADMK alliance won 2,185 panchayat union wards and 241 district panchayat wards. The results reflect the prevailing mood of voters against key issues, including the Citizenship Amendment Act and the protests that have been playing out across TN as well, and possible anti-incumbency against the AIADMK. Region-specific issues also contributed to the outcome.The AIADMK termed the results of the local body polls as indication of the party winning back people’s confidence, after the debacle in the Lok Sabha elections held in April last year. “The party lost the Lok Sabha polls eight months ago due to various reasons. But, the results of the rural local body polls indicate that we are regaining people’s confidence,” said CM Edappadi K Palaniswami and deputy CM O Panneerselvam in a joint statement, thanking party workers and people for backing the ruling front. The DMK, however, said the results are a prelude to the 2021 assembly polls.But, the opposition DMK said the results were in its favour and a prelude to the outcome of the assembly polls to be held in the summer of 2021. The people have prepared to teach a lesson for AIADMK following the historic win by DMK in the rural local body elections, said DMK president M K Stalin in a statement. “The ruling party created several hurdles with the help of the state election commission to prevent our candidates from winning,” Stalin said.In terms of districts grabbed by the two fronts, based on panchayat union wards won, both DMK and AIADMK fronts got 13 districts each out of the 27 districts, where the polls were held on December 27 and December 30. The two alliances bagged eight district wards each in Sivaganga.Barring Karur, the DMK front swept the core delta districts, hit by Cyclone Gaja and the protests against hydrocarbon projects. Candidates from the DMK alliance won a majority of the district panchayat and panchayat union wards, indicating the central region’s anger against the ruling dispensation’s shoddy relief measures in the eight delta districts.The ruling party, despite the strong presence of its ally PMK in the region, faced a major setback in three of the 10 northern districts where elections were held. The DMK alliance swept nearly two-thirds of the district panchayat wards in Thiruvallur and Thiruvannamalai. While in Thiruvallur, the opposition alliance won 18 of the 24 district panchayat wards, it grabbed 24 out of the 34 wards in Thiruvannamalai. In Cuddalore, the AIADMK won 15 wards, one more than its rivals.In the eight southern districts, the contest was much closer with AIADMK alliance winning four districts against DMK front’s three, with Sivaganga district ending up in a tie. Members of both parties, believe that the AIADMK support for the Citizenship Amendment Act, is a reason for its poor performance in its strongholds.

Trichy: DMK made a clean sweep in Pudukottai district by winning 11 district ward councillor seats out of total 22 and 11 out of 13 panchayat unions.

It has come as a big blow to AIADMK minister C Vijayabaskar whose party lost two panchayat unions in his own constituency. Vijaya Baskar had extensively toured the district while campaigning for party candidates. Viralimalai and Annavasal panchayat unions fall under Viralimalai assembly constituency from where Vijaya Baskar was elected to the assembly.

In both the unions, DMK candidates secured more number of union ward councillor seats. Out of 21 councillor seats in Viralimalai union, DMK managed to win 12 seats whereas AIADMK had to satisfy with just 5. Similarly, DMK won 10 seats out of 20 in Annavasal union, while AIADMK could secure only nine seats.

In this way, a total 11 panchayat unions out of 13 will have DMK union chairman putting them in strong position.

Induction of Bharani E A Karthikeyan by the DMK from AMMK proved vital for DMK. Bharani, whose brother is sitting AIADMK MLA A Rathinasabapathy, gave a boost to DMK’s prospects in Manamelkudi and Aavudaiyarkoil unions. Out of 15 union councillor seats in Manamelkudi, AIADMK could not win even one whereas DMK won 14. In Aavudaiyarkoil union, AIADMK could win only 3 seats and DMK managed to bag 9 seats.

Senior AIADMK leaders from Pudukottai blame it on selection of AIADMK candidates for the poll.

“The party should have focused on the credentials of the local body candidates as a lot depend on the face value and local connect of the candidate, unlike in assembly or parliamentary polls,” said a senior AIADMK leader.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has assured non-resident Keralites (NRKs), who wish to invest or start enterprises in Kerala, that they won’t encounter negative approach from officials concerned.

“Directive in this regard has been given to all officials. But, if you still face difficulties, stray incidents are possible, please alert the government and we will take stringent action against the erring officials,” he said, while addressing the concluding session of the second edition of Loka Kerala Sabha (LKS) on Friday.

Vijayan also urged the expatriate population not to take part in protests in their resident countries which could cost them their job. “Uphold the country’s secular credentials. You can join protests and agitations here. Take care and do not lose your job in the country you reside,” he said.

Global Hackathon in state Announcing a series of initiatives, Vijayan said a ‘Global Hackathon’ will be held in state this year to analyze the challenges faced by Kerala. It will try to outline possible solutions and opportunities. “Government will seriously consider all suggestions put forward by LKS meet and take proactive steps for expatriate welfare,” he said.

Also on the anvil is a ‘Youth Leadership Academy’, ‘which is expected to contribute to skill development of the youth’. The academy will be set up with the help of expats, said the chief minister.

Vijayan added that conferences by various professionals will be held in state to cater to the need of skilled resources in various sectors abroad. “Steps will be taken to prepare a comprehensive register of expatriates. LKS will also take steps to conduct diaspora meetings at various regions. Delegates from the US and Europe have already come forward to organize the meetings,” he said.

In a bid to facilitate trade with Japan, the government is ready to offer land to open office for Japan Trade External Organization, said Vijayan.

Listing out the recommendations of LKS delegates and possible initiatives the government could take, the chief minister said a decision on the demand for various insurance schemes for expatriates will be taken after a consultation with insurance companies and experts.

“Two types of insurance schemes - healthcare insurance for critically ill expats and life-and-property insurance in the wake of natural calamities - are already under our consideration. An expert committee to study the problems faced by NRKs will be formed and it will submit a report by April,” he said, adding that government will continue to take proactive steps in securing the release of falsely-imprisoned expatriates in other countries. Reducing the airfare is another major task.

“The regional meetings, as part of LKS, have brought to the notice of the government, a lot of legal problems that the expatriates face. Government will ask law department to work out a solution,” said the chief minister.

The government has taken steps to promote digital technology, blockchain technology and artificial intelligence . It will also update curriculum according to the changes in the contemporary world after consultation with experts, said Vijayan.

Among other demands and proposals by LKS members included a legal cell for handling property disputes and other cases of expatriates and regular adalats. “Government will entrust Norka secretary to look into these suggestions,” he said.

Trichy: Congress MP from Karur S Jothimani accused the AIADMK government of misusing the poll machinery to declare their candidates winners in Karur district. She staged a sit-in protest along with Aravakurichi DMK MLA V Senthil Balaji in front of the counting centre at K Paramathi panchayat union.

K Paramathi panchayat union has 17 union councillors. Any side having at least nine seats will be able select the chairman. Till late evening on Thursday, DMK was leading in 9 seats and Congress in one, whereas AIADMK was leading in 7.

“Even though counting was over by 8pm on Thursday, announcement came in the early hours at 3:30am on Friday, declaring nine AIADMK candidates winners,” said Jothimani.

“This includes ward 16 where DMK candidate was leading from the beginning and ward 1 which had Congress candidate in the lead,” she said.

Karur superintendent of police R Pandiarajan held talks with them, but they called off their protest after the arrival of the returning officer. Officials maintained that there wasn’t any irregularity in announcing the winning candidates.

However, Jothimani pointed out that only winning AIADMK candidates were given certificates whereas DMK candidates were given certificate only after they protested.

Saying that they have decided to approach the court, Jothimani alleged lapses on the part of election officials. “The CCTV camera feed in the strong room in Karur district where ballot boxes were kept did not have recording facility. This means the data is not stored, hence no mechanism to verify the footage in case of any irregularity,” she said.

Transport Minister M R Vijayabhaskar was unavailable for comments despite repeated attempts.

AHMEDABAD: The killing of home guard jawan Ravi Patel, a resident of Vatva, in Hatkeshwar on Thursday night, was allegedly the fallout of him demanding repayment of Rs 5,000 that he had lent to Sunil Christian alias Macchi, who police say is a bootlegger based in the Hatkeshwar area.

276,['4/01/2020'],It’s a bumper Pongal harvest this time for cane farmers,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Sugarcanes harvested during Pongal are popularly known as sengarumbu but this year all the canes have been of ... Read More

TRICHY: Farmers cultivating sengarumbu or Pongal cane in the delta region are on cloud nine this time as the yield has been good thanks to a good northeast monsoon. However, they are apprehensive whether their produce will fetch good profits and have urged the government to fix a reasonably good price for it as part of its Pongal gift hamper.

Canes harvested during Pongal are popularly known as sengarumbu but this year all the canes have been of good quality with high yield. Farmers said the availability of adequate water has also ensured good juice content in the cane raised in their villages.

The water came not just from the timely rain, but the Cauvery and its supply channels thereby helping farmers to grow cane on about 300 to 400 acres across the delta districts.

Unlike the year goneby, Cyclone Gaja had flattened almost all standing sengarumbu in the delta districts on about 500 acres in November 2018, says V Selvaraj, a farmer from Thiruvalarsolai in Trichy.

“Due to quality yield, traders from various places including Mettupalayam, Karur and Namakkal have been camping in Thiruvalarsolai and Ponnurangapuram to procure sengarumbu. Farmers then had to spend extra money to straighten the canes as a result of which they had to forego considerable sums from their profit”, he added.

This year Selvaraj has begun sales at Rs 24 a cane to a trader from Pachamalai hills unlike last year when he could sell it only for Rs 15. P Subramanian, a farmer from Thirukattupalli in Thanjavur district , said they have altogether raised sengarumbu on about 200 acres while he alone grew it on 5 acres.

“One has to spend Rs 1.50 lakh per acre to raise sugarcane from sowing till harvesting. We need to sell a cane for Rs 20 to make profit,” says he.

“I had raised sengarumbu on 2 acres last year and had a good yield. However, Gaja flattened all of them. I spent Rs 45,000 more to straighten the canes by tying 10 of them together. This year, we have a good yield with quality canes and hope to get better price as the expenditure has not gone beyond a level”, he added.

But the farmers insist that sengarumbu should also be included in the list of crops by the agriculture department.

“It will help farmers get technical assistance, loan from cooperative societies and also better price for their produce”, secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association Swamimalai S Vimalnathan said.

Kannur: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has alleged that the RSS is following the policy of Adolf Hitler and the organization is like Mussolini’s Fascist movement.

Inaugurating the valedictory function of the national conference of the All India Agricultural Workers Union (AIAWU) here on Friday, he said while Hitler saw Jews and Bolsheviks as enemies within Germany, the RSS sees Muslims, Christians and communists as their enemies. “Elimination is their policy and first they targeted Muslims,” he said in the backdrop of the row over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The RSS has its own stand and they have no interest in India remaining a secular nation. They want the country to be based on religion, he alleged. “The first obstacle before them is the Constitution of India, which is the result of the freedom struggle,” said the CM, adding the Constitution was not made in a day.

But the RSS did not want the British to go from India and some of their leaders even negotiated with the Viceroy to release the jailed leaders, he said. Praising other CMs who opposed the CAA, the chief minister also said that he has personally written a letter to them. Responding to the criticism about the Assembly passing a resolution against CAA, he said the Assembly is not a system to approve everything that the centre tells, and sign it. “It has the right to think independently and tell its opinion, which it has got as per the Constitution, but those who challenge the Constitution might also talk against those who use the Constitutional rights as well,” he snubbed. The CM also said those who oppose CAA should protest democratically and never let any extremist elements to exploit the situation.

He also criticized the CPI for blaming him for his speech at the golden jubilee of Land Reform Act, and said those who have no idea about history are blaming him. In response to the criticism raised in CPI mouthpiece ‘Janayugam’ that the chief minister did not mention the role of C Achutha Menon in drafting and implementing the Land Reforms Act, in his address at the inauguration of the Golden Jubilee celebrations of the Act, he said it was because of his sense appropriateness that he did not refer some names, he said without mentioning the name of Achutha Menon.

Though the EMS government introduced the bill, the Centre dismissed the government and the later governments changed many clauses in that in favour of landlords, and it was not implemented, he alleged, indirectly attacking the CPI which switched over to join hands with the Congress. Later, it was AK Gopalan who launched an agitation to implement it, in 1969, after the EMS government, which presented the bill again in 1967, had to resign, he said. TNN

BHUBANESWAR: For the first time, the Odisha State Bureau of Textbook Preparation and Production will publish textbooks for undergraduate (Plus III) students of the state. The bureau has been publishing textbooks for Plus II classes and referral books on a wide range of subjects like history and culture.

Textbook bureau director Sidhartha Dhal said the state government took this decision after implementation of uniform syllabus for the undergraduate courses in the state.

Earlier, every university had its own syllabus for their undergraduate students. The institutions had no such common books for their students. “But the scenario has changed after the state government came up with a uniform syllabus for Plus III students. Now we can publish a book for a subject following the syllabus and it will be helpful for students across the state,” he added.

Dhal said this book will be comprehensive one addressing all points of the syllabus. “A panel of subject writers will sit down and prepare the manuscript of the book keeping the syllabus in mind. We will publish the books in a phased manner,” he added.

He said the books will immensely help the students. They need not refer to several books because the comprehensive book will have all the points and analysis from different books, magazines and research articles. “We will conduct a meeting and discuss about the quantity of books to be published,” he added.

Last year, the bureau had uploaded text books of different streams (arts, commerce and science) of Plus II on its website. Now the students can download the e-books from the website of the textbook bureau without paying any money.

The bureau sells around 17 lakh copies per year. The bureau has sold books worth Rs 4.68 crore in 2018-19. The bureau also plans to digitize its research and referral books for easy access of researchers and students. More than 600 books will be digitized and kept in the library of the bureau.

The high court also directed the state election commission to file an affidavit with the details of the election schedule by the first hour on January 8.

The HC was hearing two public interest litigations (PILs) moved over not conducting elections to panchayats, zilla parishads and municipalities even after their term expired long ago. The petitioners argued that in the absence of elected bodies, development of panchayats was taking a hit. They said the action of the state government was in violation of the Constitution and the Supreme Court judgments.

Earlier, the state government had told the HC that the government was in the process of conducting elections to local bodies and reservations were being worked out. The high court had given time till Friday to submit the details about the elections.

On Friday, the state government requested time till January 10 to complete the reservation process. Rejecting the government’s request, the bench headed by Chief Justice J K Maheswari and Justice M Venkata Ramana said there would be no extension of time as the government had agreed to be ready with the details in the earlier hearing. The HC said conducting elections was a constitutional obligation and seeking extension was contrary to its orders.

G Paneerselvi

TRICHY: A soothsayer from Lalgudi became the second transsexual in the state to win the rural local body election when the result was declared for the ward member of Maruthur village panchayat on Friday. G Paneerselvi, 47, who was among the five candidates to contest from ward 9 in Mela Theru, secured 61 of the 176 votes polled to get elected. A Riya, 30, of Namakkal was the first transsexual to taste victory as panchayat union ward member on Thursday.

Paneerselvi says she is delighted at being recognized by people something, according to her, is very unlikely for a transsexual. Paneerselvi spends most of her time on the premises of the old Mariamman temple at Samayapuram predicting the future of individuals for a living. There are many who regularly visit her seeking her blessings.

Initially hesitant to try her luck in politics, it was her nephews who motivated her to contest. “A familiar face in her locality, she has been voted by people across castes which is very unusual in local body polls. We knew that people will support her for her friendly approach and helping nature,” said G Selvam, her nephew. However, it wasn’t a cakewalk for her either as the other contestants wanted her to withdraw her nomination. Paneerselvi stood firm as many had promised support to her and wanted to give her an opportunity, said S Sankaralingam from Mela theru.

“I could capitalise on the anger among the people against previous ward members who didn’t do much for the people. I want to be the voice of the 100-odd families in my locality and ensure basic amenities which my predecessors failed to ensure,” she said.

283,['4/01/2020'],29.6mm rain makes Friday the wettest January day since 2013,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Kolkata: Lashed by multiple spells of rain since early morning, the city on Friday recorded its wettest January day since 2013. Triggered by a cyclonic circulation over central India that moved into Gangetic Bengal, the rain, however, lost intensity by afternoon even though the Met office predicted clouds to hover above Kolkata till Saturday morning. Once the clouds recede by Monday, the minimum temperature could tumble 2°C-3°C and settle at 12°C-13°C.

Kolkata received 29.6mm rain between 8.30pm on Thursday and 8.30pm on Friday and the minimum temperature stood at 15.8°C.

While some parts of the city had received sporadic showers on Thursday evening, the rain got intense early on Friday. Kolkata woke up to a cloudy morning and frequent drizzles interspersed with heavier spells of shower. As the day progressed, the rain got heavier with southern, central and eastern parts of the city receiving intense spells during the afternoon. The showers, though, lost intensity by 2.30pm.

“Chances of further heavy spells are slim. Even though the circulation persists in south Bengal, it will get progressively weaker and cease to have an impact on the weather . Kolkata and the surroundings may remain cloudy till Saturday but we expect very little rain,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director GK Das.

The city received 9.3mm rain between 8.30pm on Thursday and 8.30am on Friday. Over the next six hours, the showers gained considerable intensity as Kolkata received another 16mm rain till 2.30 in the afternoon. Due to the cloud cover, the minimum temperature — at 15.8°C — remained two degrees higher than normal. It is expected to hover between 14°C and 15°C till Sunday.

“Once the clouds recede, temperature will slide down considerably. It will lead to a sharp chill, similar to the cold spell that we had in the last week of December. But the chill may not last long and the mercury may start rising again from January 8,” said deputy director-general of meteorology Sanjib Bandyopadhyay. Kolkata has recorded a lowest minimum temperature of 11.1°C this season.

Friday was the wettest January day in Kolkata in seven years. In 2012, the city had received 71.2 mm rain on a January day. “January is a dry period in Kolkata unless there is a western disturbance. This season, we have had two such disturbances so far with this one having a considerable impact on the city,” said Das.

The western disturbance impacted the weather in north Bengal as well and once the clouds recede the mercury may plunge there as well, said weathermen. While Sandakphu received snowfall on Friday, more snow has been predicted in the upper reaches of Darjeeling.

Saligao: The Mapusa Municipal Council (MMC) has initiated a patrolling drive to stop the dumping of garbage , especially along the roadside.

BHUBANESWAR: Candidates applying for jobs or seeking admission in various courses don’t need to submit original caste or resident certificates at the time of application. They can apply with a self-declaration about their caste or resident status.

After provisional selection either in jobs or in educational institutions, the applicants will be asked to produce original certificates like caste, resident and others.

The state revenue and disaster management department issued the order in this regard on Thursday, days after chief minister Naveen Patnaik announced it while launching the e-certificate portal.

The move is aimed to save time as collecting various documents like caste, resident, income and others consume a lot of time of both people and revenue officers. Every year, around 5 million applications are received for caste, resident, income and other certificates, said a revenue department official.

Earlier, the applicants had to make several rounds of tehsil offices to collect various certificates like caste, resident or income before applying for any job and colleges for admission. After their provisional selection, the applicants now avail these certificates online through the e-certificate initiative.

In the order, the revenue department has asked the general administration and public grievance department to issue instructions to different recruiting agencies.

Similarly, the higher education, skill development and technical education, school and mass education and health and family welfare departments will issue instructions to the educational institutions under their control to take steps accordingly.

For authentication, the recruiting agencies and educational institutions can verify the digital caste or resident certificates issued by the revenue officers with the help of e-certificate portal or from the Digilocker.

The revenue department order also states that the candidates will face legal action for furnishing wrong/false declaration about their caste or residence , which the recruiting agencies or educational institutions will mention in the application forms.

The revenue department also plans to issue caste certificates to students along with their school leaving certificates (10th standard examination).

The chief minister has announced that the legal heir certificate will not be required for payment of government dues as it will be paid to the legal heirs based on the entry in the service book by the employee. The GA&PG department has been directed to develop a mechanism for updation of the service books of employees on an annual basis.

Vijayawada: The AP high court on Friday directed the Tirumala Tirupati Devasatanam (TTD) to take a call on allowing the Vaikunta dwara darshan for 10 days instead of two. Disposing a public interest litigation (PIL) on Friday, the court said it would not interfere in the decision taken by TTD .

T Raghavan had moved the high court seeking directions to TTD to allow Vaikunta dwara darshan for 10 days starting from Vaikunta Ekadashi in view of huge demand from devotees. He argued that the darshan was allowed in other Vaishnava temples for 10 days but TTD has limited it to two days. TTD said it was following the tradition and explained security and infrastructure issues involved in allowing darshan for an extended period of time.

The high court directed the petitioner to give a written representation to the TTD. Leaving the final decision to the temple body, the court directed TTD to consider the request as it is a popular demand from devotees. The court also asked TTD to seek the opinion of its Agama advisory committee on the matter and present its stand on Monday, which coincides with the Vaikunta Ekadashi day. Meanwhile, following the court’s directive, the TTD has convened an emergency meeting of its trust board on January 5. As per customary practice, the dwaram opens for 48 hours on the auspicious Ekadashi and Dwadashi days every year.

Jaydevsinh Jhala with his father

AHMEDABAD: A PCR van of Ranip police chased an 18-year-old man returning from his friend’s birthday party, hit him and crushed his left foot.

After the cops saw him writhing in pain, they left him there to suffer. This took place in the wee hours of December 14 and an FIR was registered with city traffic police on Thursday.

According to the FIR registered with L division traffic police on Thursday, Jaydevsinh Jhala , 18, a resident of Purushottamnagar Apartments in Ranip, went to celebrate his friend’s birthday with three other friends near GST Crossing at midnight on December 13.

After cutting the birthday cake, Jaydevsinh was walking home in the we hours of December 14. He saw a PCR van coming from Balolnagar towards GST Crossing, scared at seeing the PCR van he started running. The PCR van chased him down and hit, causing him to fall on the road and van crushed his left foot. He also suffered injuries to his thighs.

He then requested the cops to take him home or to a hospital. “Though I requested to them, they did not help me and left from there,” Jaydevsinh states in the FIR.

Jaydevsinh then fell unconscious, and when he regained consciousness he called an ambulance himself.

Jaydevsinh’s father, Rangoonsinh, a retired army jawan, said, “The police saw my son writhing in pain and injured, but did not help him.

The ambulance brought my son home and informed us. We rushed him to Asarwa Civil Hospital first, but there he was not treated properly there. We then took him to a private hospital in Bhuyangdev,” said Rangoonsinh.

He said that his son had undergone reconstructive surgery at the private hospital but he did not recover and doctors suggest that his foot may have to be amputated.

“Had my son suffered injuries to head, he could have died. The cops showed the most inhuman behaviour towards my son,” said Rangoonsinh.

Inspector J L Chauhan of L division traffic police said that the PCR van concerned was attached to Ranip police.

About the persons responsible, he said the driver had not been identified.

L division traffic police registered a case for causing hurt and rash driving and began an investigation.

Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The golden jubilee year of the Land Reforms Act has set off yet another tiff between the CPM and CPI over the lineage in the state’s path breaking act.

Upset over chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan ’s speech during the golden jubilee celebrations here on Wednesday, the CPI mouth piece Janayugam came out with an editorial on Friday questioning the logic and pertinence of the Pinarayi’s refusal to acknowledge the stellar role played by CPI leader and former chief minister C Achutha Menon in the implementation of the act. The CPI reaction, however, elicited a spiteful response from the chief minister who while addressing a public programme in Kannur , on Friday evening, expressed doubts over CPI leaders’ understanding about history. “They seem to be having problems in understanding history. Better they slog through history lessons,” he said.

In his speech at the golden jubilee celebrations of the act, in which CPI leader and revenue minister E Chandrasekharan also took part, Pinarayi lauded the contributions of EMS Namboothirippad and K R Gouri Amma towards the formation and implementation of the act, but chose not to mention the important contributions of Achutha Menon and his government.

The CPI mouth piece said the successive governments since independence could not complete the work of land reforms act, which needed meticulous finesse political resolve.

“It was the C Achutha Menon government that implemented the amended act in 1970. At least a few people still refuse to accept the fact though 50 years have passed since the implementation of act. At a time when national politics is boisterous with attempts to discard truths and distort country’s history, the refusal to accept the recent history of Kerala is not honourable for the left politics. History is not folklore or cooked up stories. They are recorded based on empirical evidences. Modi government in the centre is trying to drive off seasoned historians and replace them with those willing to distort or misinterpret the historical facts. It’s against this refusal of history that country now rise up against. Communist parties organisations are in the forefront in this protest. It’s this resistance that is being questioned by the left themselves in Kerala by pushing half-truths regarding land reforms. Nobody would presume that CM Pinarayi Vijayan has forgotten to mention the name of C Achutha Menon. On the contrary, it’s a plain omission of historical facts. It questions the left’s approach towards history.”

Representative image

KOLKATA: Parents seem to have given the thumbs up to some of the major private schools’ plan to ply their buses so that the rush of private and pooled vehicles ferrying kids to and from home would stop choking the roads during the start and end of school hours and also cut down on pollution. While guardians feel that school buses could be the long-term solution to the perpetual problem of jams officials at some institutes seemed apprehensive.

“It will really help if the schools decide to operate buses. It will spare parents the worry of being dependent on pooled vehicles, a system riddled with trouble, especially for working parents. The vehicles often fail to arrive on time, forcing one of the parents to either skip work altogether or go to office late to drop the child off to school and again, bring him/her back. Also, when these vehicles reach schools late, the child is marked ‘late’ on the school attendance,” said Olibarna Sinha, mother of a Shri Shikshayatan School student.

Both sons of Sukanya Das study in La Martiniere School for Boys, which does not have own school buses. Most kids travel by private vehicles, and some by pooled cars, while others by the public transport system. “My elder son is in Class VII and the younger one in Class III. School buses, like the ones we had when we were young, were much reliable. It will be advantageous if the school plies its own fleet of buses because then, the students’ travel will be the school’s responsibility. Contract carriages are not as trustworthy as that of schools, when it comes to the safety and security of our children,” she said.

A senior official at Birla High School, which has discontinued its own fleet of buses, however, felt reintroducing them would add to the chaos on the road in front. “Our school is on a busy road. Where will the buses be parked? It will only add to the chaos on the road because the buses would make it difficult for other vehicles to ply the stretch,” she said. But Sandeep Jalan, father of a Class-XI student at the school, said the state government’s proposal for school buses was the way forward to easing snarls and leaving less carbon footprints.

Modern High School has increased their fleet by one bus recently. “We will add more if more students opt for school buses,” said an official. “We have noticed apathy among parents in opting for school buses and that becomes a problem as running buses requires a large amount of money. If there are only a few takers, there is no point in introducing new routes.”

Several schools may face the challenge of allocating funds to buy buses. “We will have to introduce them in phases. The facility will be started with those areas, from where a considerable number of kids will opt for the facility,” said a Moulali school principal. “We need parents’ feedback on their interest in the service.”

Anahita Mullick, mother of a Calcutta Girls’ School student, said, “We have to send our kids in pooled cars, many of which do not have CCTV camera or GPS, making it a bit unsafe. If the facility is reintroduced, it will be well received,” she said.

Times View This is good news at the start of the year. Hopefully, onion prices will now go down to their usual level.

KOLKATA: Onion price on Friday dropped below Rs 80/kg for the first time since November 8, when it soared beyond Rs 75/kg. With the steady supply of new crop from Nagpur and Bellary , market experts expect the price to fall further to Rs 60-65 in a day or two.While some retailers continued to sell onion at Rs 90-100/kg to exhaust the costlier old stock, majority of them provided some relief to buyers by selling the vegetable at Rs 70-80/kg on Friday. The wholesale price at Posta and Koley markets (two major wholesale markets in the city) ranged from Rs 2,200/40kg (Rs 55/kg) to Rs 2,600/40kg (Rs 65/kg).“The moment the demand-supply gap is bridged, onion price will nosedive. But a section of retailers refused to toe this market dynamics and stuck to the price of their old stock,” said Kamal De, president of the West Bengal Wholesale Vendors’ Association and member of the government-appointed task force that keeps tabs on vegetable prices. The gap between the wholesale and retail prices shows that traders in the retail market are not behaving the way they should, added Gautam Ghosh of Posta wholesale market.The difference between the wholesale and retail prices did not go unnoticed by the state government. “We know the wholesale price has started normalising, but it is not reflecting in the retail market. The enforcement branch has been keeping a close watch on retail markets. We don’t want to destabilise by intervening hastily. But we take necessary steps to facilitate the stabilisation of retail price,” said a state agri-marketing department officer.“The new crop is bound to cool the price as it cannot be hoarded because of its high perishability. The number of trucks carrying this new crop also improved drastically to 17-18 a day,” said De. He predicted that onion price would be around Rs50/kg by early next week and the government would not need to offer subsidy any more.Currently, the state government is selling onion at a subsidized rate (Rs59/kg) through its network of 960 ration shops and 131 Sufal Bangla stores. “This is a temporary measure to offer some relief to common people. We won’t continue with it the moment there is some price parity,” said an agri-marketing department officer.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73093061,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-462461,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/onion-price-starts-to-ease-expected-to-drop-further/articleshow/73091191.cms

CHINSURAH: With rain lashing potato fields in Hooghly, Bankura, West Midnapore and Burdwan since Thursday night, the supply crunch of the vegetable will intensify further. At present, 456 cold storages in the state have a stock of 35,000 tonnes, which is about two days’ total consumption in Bengal.The supply crunch has pushed up retail price of potato beyond Rs 30/kg. The wholesale price of the jyoti variety from Singur , Chapadanga, Arambag and Kotulpur ranges between Rs 22 and Rs 25. Potato traders — both wholesale and retail — say one must wait till about January 12 for the supplies to meet demand. That’s when prices should start declining.A good percentage of the new crop in fields across Hooghly and regions in the state has been destroyed by the rain. The weather has also been unkind to potato farmers in Punjab’s Jalandhar and UP’s Farukabad, who have been hit by untimely rain. Together, Punjab and UP supply large quantities to Bengal. With this supply in limbo, the supply constraint will have a spiralling effect on prices.The weather has been playing spoilsport for potato farmers ever since cyclone Bulbul. “For many years, the weather hasn’t been this bad. I could not sow my seeds on time as it had rained heavily after cyclone Bulbul. Had we been able I sow on time, the crop would have been ready for harvest by now,” said Shyamal Das, a potato farmer in Hooghly’s Pursura.Tarakeswar potato farmer Keshab Ghosh said, “Though potato growing in highlands should be okay, low-land potato fields have been inundated and the crop will be destroyed. This will lower the yield of potato.”State agricultural marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta said, “For the benefit of consumers, we had retained old crop in cold storages for longer than usual. If prices go beyond a certain level, the state government may sell potato through ration shops and Sufal Bangla stores.”",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73094286,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-440104,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/potato-demand-supply-gap-may-widen-after-showers/articleshow/73091200.cms

The modern police control room is a facility arranged at the control room to alert the control room vehicles and station vehicles about emergency situations. Under the new system, the call, which is currently linked to the centralized control room in Thiruvananthapuram, will be diverted to the modern control room.

“Twenty control room vehicles and 21 station vehicles have been linked to the modern control room with the help of a GPS assisted device ,” said L Surendran, assistant commissioner of police (control room). “Policemen on duty in a particular area will be alerted about emergency situations through the device,” he said, adding that cops have become more accountable to inspect the site and help the callers with the launch of new system. Computers and other equipment with latest technology have been set up for the smooth functioning of the modern control room. Three personnel have been deployed to coordinate the activities.

The chief minister will also open the cyber police station of the city police on Saturday. The new building was constructed on the premises of the office of the district police chief.

18 police personnel led by an inspector of police will be part of the cyber police station. Though the government had planned to open the cyber police station a year ago, it was delayed due to technical reasons.

The chief minister will also inaugurate the regional office of the Kerala Police Cyberdome on Saturday. The Cyberdome is currently functioning from Techno Park in Thiruvananthapuram. Its Kozhikode unit is an extension. Cyberdome will focus on cyber security, cyber forensic, cyber intelligence, incident response, research and development and training and awareness creation. Investigation of online frauds, cheating through text messages, banking fraud and other offences are likely to gain pace with the opening of the cybercrime investigation units.

MLA M K Muneer will preside over the inaugural session. Minister for transport A K Saseendran will be the chief guest.

298,['4/01/2020'],AMC makes completion certificate a must for properties in its jurisdiction,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Aurangabad: Municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey has issued directions to identify all those properties falling under the jurisdiction of the civic administration which do not have completion certificates and ensure they have the necessary documents by March end.

In most cases, individuals and builders initiate constructions with building permission from the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) but don’t bother to obtain the completion certificate after the constructions. When the builders apply for securing completion certificates, officials from the town planning department are required to check the documents and visit the sites to ensure the constructions have been done as per the building permission.

Pandey said on Thursday that if builders and businessmen were constructing buildings in the city, they have to abide by the rules of the civic body. “This is not ‘Jungle Raj’ so the completion certificate will have to be secured,” he said. Pandey has set a deadline of March end to ensure all Class I and Class II properties obtain the completion certificate.

In order to build a database of all the properties in the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation, Pandey has sought the GST data from the GST office, data of commercial electricity consumers from MSEDCL and building permission secured from the AMC in the last 30 years. Based on this data, the AMC will carry out a drive to check if property owners have obtained the completion certificates. If not, they have to obtain one from the civic body.

Pandey said that the properties in the gunthewari areas would be out of the purview of the completion certificate drive. The regularisation of properties in the gunthewari areas would be dealt separately.

AHMEDABAD: A 25-year-old man, under trial in a murder and loot case, committed suicide in the hospital of Sabarmati Central Jail on Friday morning.

The deceased was identified as Mohammed Shehzad Pathan. He was arrested in a case involving the killing of a woman and robbery of articles worth Rs 2.50 lakh from her home in the Vastrapur area of the city in October 2017, jail officials said.

Inspector J B Khambhla of Ranip police station said that Pathan, a resident of Jantanagar in Ramol, hanged himself with his pants at around 10.30am on Friday. A case of accidental death was registered with Ranip police and his body was sent for a postmortem.

ADGP, prisons, KLN Rao, said Pathan was suffering from leprosy and a mental disorder for the past month. “For the last two days, he had been admitted to the jail hospital for treatment. On Friday morning, he went to the bathroom at the jail hospital and committed suicide by hanging himself,” said Rao.

A police official said Pathan had hanged himself from a window grill.

The suicide again raises questions about security at the jail. Last year, a 34-year-old man, Pratap Thakor, a native of Mehsana, who was in jail for killing his wife, committed suicide by throwing himself in front of a moving van on the jail premises on June 20, 2019.

KOLKATA: A Christopher Road resident, who had booked an app cab for a short distance on the evening of December 31 , wrote to the Kolkata traffic police on social media that he was abused and almost assaulted by the driver , whom he found to be different from the one showing on his app.

The incident took place the night an actor lodged a complaint against an app-cab driver for harassing her and ending the trip without completing it.

After Prasenjit Dey wrote on the Kolkata traffic police Facebook page, cops took cognisance of the incident. “We are sending this complaint to the department concerned for necessary action,” the police wrote back.

According to Dey, he booked an Uber cab from Anandapur on Bypass. The driver’s name was shown as Chandra Kishore. “Two minutes before I boarded the cab, my app showed the trip had begun. Asked about it, the driver said it was his wish,” Dey said. “I checked the profile photo and realized the person driving was different from the one showing on the app. Sensing trouble, I got off near Ruby. The driver demanded I must pay. I refused. He abused me and was about to hit me but bystanders rescue me.”

When TOI contacted the aggregator, a spokesperson said, “We have a zero-tolerance policy towards misconduct by driver-partners. We have removed his access to Uber app. We stand ready to assist the law-enforcement agency in any investigation.”

Rahmathunissa

BENGALURU: If you think students from government-run educational institutions are academically weak, Rahmathunnisa, 20, proves you wrong. She’s a student of a Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) college and has topped Bangalore University ’s undergraduate examination in Commerce.

The provisional list released by the varsity to colleges last fortnight says Rahmathunissa secured 91.87 per cent in all semesters during 2016-19. This student of BBMP First Grade College for Women in Cleveland Town (near Fraser Town) on Friday got a congratulatory note from education minister S Suresh Kumar: “She has made BBMP and all of us pround by securing the first rank.” He also congratulated college principal K Anand for her achievement.

BU is expected to release the final rank list by this month-end.

Interestingly, Rahmathunnisa is the first graduate in her family. “I was a topper in Government Urdu School (Nagawara) too,” she said. However, what makes her special is her will to succeed despite difficulties that her family endured after her father passed away when she was just 4 years old. “Soon after his death, we rented out part of our home for Rs 4,000 per month. It was our only source of income. But it was enough to support my studies in government schools. There were difficulties — financial and otherwise— but I focused on studies,” she told TOI. Her two elder sisters discontinued studies after SSLC and PUC while her brother works as an aluminium fabricator to support the family.

“My brother and mother have always been my biggest strengths,” she said, even as some people discouraged her from studying further. “I ignored negative suggestions. If I’d listened to them, I’d be sitting at home without a degree,” she said, adding: “For me, getting educated was precious because I was not in the comfort zone.” She’d concentrate intensely on classroom lectures as studying at home, often crowded with relatives, was at times difficult.

Rahmathunnisa says her journey from a government school to a BBMP college shows what government institutions can do. “I was always supported by teachers in school and college,” she said.

Thiruvananthapuram: The crime branch has decided to probe a petition against DGP Jacob Thomas over his alleged possession of benami properties. The government has assigned SP, crimes, Thiruvananthapuram, to probe into the petition by Congress leader Sathyan Naravoor, who had petitioned the government that Jacob Thomas has been holding benami properties.

ADGP (crimes) had requested the government to authorise a competent officer to investigate the allegations against Thomas and to take cognisance of offences under Section 53 of Prohibition of Benami Property Transaction Act, 1988. The crime branch has been asked to submit a report to the government by January 31.

A judicial first class magistrate, Ernakulam, had earlier made sharp remarks against self-proclaimed anti-corruption crusader Thomas as guilty of holding benami property under Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988.

In its order on February 17, 2018, while considering a petition by T R Vasudevan, an Ernakulam native, contending that the officer who holds undisclosed land in Sethur village in Rajapalayam taluk of Virudhunagar district in Tamil Nadu committed offence under the Act, observed that Thomas is a benamidar as defined under the Section 2(10) of the Act, and the land transaction is a benami transaction as per the Act.

TOI had in a series of expose in March 2017, had brought out how the officer held 50 acres of land in his name in Tamil Nadu using another address posing as a director of a private form. The purchase was also not disclosed in the mandatory immovable property returns statement to be made every year before the ministry of home affairs. The court also had made sharp remarks against the officer, citing that the officer who is not legally permitted to become the director of a private limited company used a fictitious address to purchase the land. “The address of Jacob Thomas mentioned in the said sale deed is a fictitious one for the reason that the private limited company named Isra Agrotech Systems Private Limited has no director named Jacob Thomas,” the court had observed. Thomas, who had been on suspension for more than a year, is currently the managing director of Metal Industries Limited, Shoranur, a PSU under the industries department, on the basis of a favourable order from Central Administrative Tribunal.

Bicholim: The Goa Convention of Workers has decided to hold a rally in Panaji on January 8 to voice their disatisfaction over the government’s functioning and the need to immediately form a mining corporation.

The Goa Convention of Workers is a joint platform of trade unions and mass organisations. The rally will begin from the KTC bus stand at 10am.

Convention convener Suhash Naik said that there are many issues in the country but no one is bothered about unemployment and the government is trying to sideline it. “The problem of unemployment has become grave, secondly inflation has put the common people in acute distress. There is almost double rise in petrol rates, economy has degraded and hence we are coming on to the roads to tell the government about our issues,” Naik said.

He added that there will be several organisations who will partake in the rally. Union functionary Ajitsingh Rane asked if the Centre is that of capitalists or of the common people. “GDP is going down, currency is also going down and the government is claiming there is development which is totally baseless,” Rane said.

He said that mining is not starting because of faulty planning on the part of the government.

The convention has put forward four demands, including the formation of a state-owned mining corporation in the name of Goa Mineral Development Corporation Ltd (GMDCL), all mining workers who have lost jobs due to closure should be re-employed, all transport vehicles must be pooled in under the corporation and the corporation must be managed by a board of directors.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the 107th Indian Science Congress in Bengaluru on Friday

BENGALURU: Reiterating his goal of making India a $5 trillion economy this decade, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday stressed that science and technology (S&T) will play a major role in fulfilling the dream.

Delivering the inaugural address at ISC-2020, Modi said India’s growth story depends on achievements in the sector, adding there’s a need to revolutionise the S&T and innovation landscape.

“Innovation must be by the people and for the people,” he said, urging scientists to lead India on the path of innovation and prosperity. He said his motto for young scientists is to ‘innovate, patent, produce and prosper’. The PM had conveyed the same message while addressing students at a hackathon in 2018.

“New India needs technology and a logical temperament, so that we can give a new direction to our social and economic sectors. S&T provides a level-playing field in making opportunities accessible to all,” Modi said.

He said developments in information and communication technology have led to cheaper smartphones and data, which has made them accessible to everyone. This, he said, has made the common man believe his voice is heard.

Referring to the theme of ISC-2020 — Science and Technology: Rural Development — the PM said it’s only because of S&T that government programmes have reached the needy. He urged young scientists to work in the field of rural development, which has several opportunities for cheaper and better innovations.

“Yesterday our government was able to release an instalment under the PM-KISAN programme to six crore beneficiaries in one go because of Aadhaar-enabled technology. Similarly, it was technology which helped in building toilets and providing electricity to the poor...,” he said.

Emphasising that digitalisation, e-commerce, internet and mobile banking services are helping the rural population significantly, he said technology can be harnessed for several initiatives, particularly in the areas of cost-effective agriculture and farm-to-consumer supply chain network.

Urging scientists to find technological solutions to issues like stubble burning, depleting groundwater table, prevention of communicable diseases, eradication of TB and environment-friendly transportation, he stressed the need for them to innovate for the sake of India’s people.

He congratulated the scientific community for putting India in the third position in terms of peer-reviewed publications.

Every innovator wants to be in B’luru

The City of Gardens (Bengaluru) is now a wonderful hub for startups. The world is coming here to innovate. It’s the dream of every engineer and innovator to be in this city. But this dream is not just for personal gain but also for the nation. When we start 2020 with the positivity of science, we’ll be able to transform India

Representative image

GANDHINAGAR: Despite tall claims of being a gatisheel (fast moving) government, the Vijay Rupani government has been unable to spend more than 60% of its allocated funds in three quarters of the financial year. Many departments have shown spending below 50% of the budget estimate, while departments such as climate change have spent below 5% of their budget.

A senior officer privy to the developments said, “Departments are not able to meet their budgetary spending targets. Some have shown extremely poor performance. Despite clear guidelines from the government to not park budgetary allocations at Gujarat State Financial Services Limited (GSFSL), most departments have parked major portions of the funds they claim to have used, so even the 59% budget spending figure does not reflect the true picture. There is a need for greater financial discipline.”

Nitin Patel, deputy chief minister and finance minister said, “Due to the model code of conduct in place ahead of the Lok Sabha elections and the extended monsoon , many works were delayed even and budget spending has been good considering these factors. All development work is now on in full swing and we will be able to meet budget estimate targets.”

Chandigarh: Punjab Governor-cum-UT administrator V P Singh Badnore on Friday gave his approval to renaming different areas of the city, including Manimajra as Sector 13.

Recently, the subcommittee of UT administrator’s advisory council in its meeting had made the recommendations.

While French architect Le Corbusier had not kept Sector 13 in city, the administration had planned to rename Manimajra as Sector 13. The administration had issued a public notice seeking objections and suggestions from residents for renaming many areas not covered under the sectoral grid. Residents were asked to submit their suggestions and objections. According to the UT proposal, the Sarangpur institutional area would be called Sector 12 (West), Dhanas and Milk Colony area as Sector 14 (West), Maloya and Dadumajra as Sector 39 (West), pocket number 8 below Vikas Marg as Sector 56 (West) and Industrial Area, Phase I, II and III as the Business and Industrial Park, Phase I, II and III, respectively.

The administration had received around 60 objections and suggestions. Thereafter, the UT officials had considered these suggestions and objections and accordingly a final report was prepared and submitted before the UT administrator on Friday.

A senior UT official said they would issue a final notification soon. The UT in the past had received various representations for renaming certain areas.

In January last year, Resident Welfare Association of Modern Housing Complex had proposed to rechristen Manimajra as Sector 13. After getting the status of a sector, the authorities would be more concerned about providing basic facilities to Manimajra, which otherwise is neglected, according to the residents.

The delegation that went to meet the UT administrator had stated that Modern Housing Complex residents have no objection to the complex getting Sector 13 status. They had also referred to a proposal tabled three years ago, proposing that the area be rechristened as Sector 26 (East), but the architect department had rejected the proposal last year, saying it would be an expensive exercise.

Kannur: The principal of a private college near Koothuparamba in the district has come up with the allegation that he has been denied entry into the college following the threat of the SFI, and he is being ostracized.

According to N Yousef, the principal of MES College at Naravoor, the SFI launched the agitation raising false allegation that he did not permit them to appear for the fifth semester examination.

“Since December 9 I have been denied entry into the college and the SFI has also raised threats on my life,” he said.

According to him, the issue began in November, when 14 students, all SFI leaders, were initially denied permission to appear for the semester examination, as they had attendance shortage. However, later, they were permitted to appear for the examination provisionally. They were also given permission to provisionally attend the sixth semester on the condition that there would not be any indiscipline on their part, he added.

However, when they were part of the clashes in the college on November 21, the entire staffers suggested that they should not be given permission to attend the class, he said.

“Now they have raised baseless allegations against me and are threatening me,” said Yousef, who joined here two years ago after retiring from service as principal in Govt Brennen College, Thalassery.

The students were given permission to appear for the examination on the condition that they should get the required documents from the respective department heads but they did not get it, he said.

Later, even the college got a threatening letter following which he filed a police complaint, said Yousef.

However, the SFI denied the allegations and said that they have not threatened him or denied him entry in the college. It was the college management that acted against him and asked him to keep away from the college for a few days and the students have no role in it, said SFI district secretary Shibin Kanayi.

The college management also said the principal was asked to go on leave for the time being in the wake of the row and the MES is looking into the issue.

Though the principal also agreed that it was the management that suggested him to keep away from the college for a while, it was because of the threat from the SFI, he said.

He said he would approach the Human Rights Commission and Kerala Governor if the SFI did not withdraw their complaint.

Representative image

BENGALURU: Two techies set to tie the knot this month broke up after the US-based woman said her fiancé’s nose was ‘ long and warped’, insisting that he undergo a plastic surgery to correct it.

Seeking justice, the groom-to-be approached a court , which ordered registration of a criminal case against the woman, her sister and father.

In his statement, Ramesh (name changed), 35, software engineer from Koramangala 6th Block, said he met Rashmi (name changed), 35, through a matrimonial website in first week of August. A resident of HSR Layout, she worked in the US.

Ramesh said he was in touch with Rashmi online and after some time, they decided to get married.

“On August 13, she arrived in the city. After lunch at a star hotel on MG Road, we decided to fix things. As requested by Rashmi, I met her elder sister Lakshmi and got her consent. On August 26, my parents met Rashmi’s parents at their HSR Layout residence. On September 9, we got engaged at her house,” the complaint read.

According to Ramesh, on the day of engagement, Rashmi told his father the wedding should be held at Tirumala temple in Tirupati. “My father requested her to change the venue to Bengaluru since most of our relatives stay here but Rashmi insisted the ceremony be held at the temple. Finally, we agreed,” he said.

Accordingly, the wedding was fixed on January 30, 2020. “I visited Tirumala to book rooms and make other arrangements. I paid Rs 1 lakh advance for 70 rooms and catering. I spent Rs 4 lakh on purchasing clothes and gifts,” Ramesh said.

Rashmi flew back to the US to join work. However, she changed her mind during October and decided to call off the wedding, Ramesh said.

“Sometime in October, Lakshmi called my father saying Rashmi wanted to cancel the wedding. I was shocked. On October 23, I called Rashmi. She received the call and sarcastically said my nose was long and warped. She said I should get a plastic surgery,” he said.

Ramesh called Rashmi again. “Her answer was the same. She would hurt me every time I phoned her. Finally, she blocked my number. Now, none of her family members is receiving our calls,” Ramesh said in the complaint.

Accusing her of cheating him and suspecting that she’d duped other men in a similar way, Ramesh approached the court and filed a private complaint report (PCR). On the court’s direction, Koramangala police on December 31 registered a criminal case against Rashmi, Lakshmi and their father under IPC sections 417 and 420 for cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property.

A senior police officer said they need evidence to prove Ramesh’s allegations. “Ramesh has to establish the fact that Rashmi called off the wedding with an intention to cheat him. Only then we can file a chargesheet accusing her of cheating and causing damage to Ramesh and his family,” he added.

“But if Rashmi confirms that she indeed cancelled the wedding because of Ramesh’s nose, we can’t do much in the case,” he said.

BENGALURU: While it took the humble telephone over 75 years to reach 50 million users, for electricity it was 46 years, mobile phone 12 years, internet seven years, Facebook four years and WeChat around one year. Pokemon Go, meanwhile, touched 50 million customers in just 19 days. This shows the pace at which technology is being adopted in Industry 4.0 , said Subra Suresh, material scientist and president of Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University.

Speaking at a public lecture on ‘Science Across Disciplines and some Consequences for Industry 4.0’ on the inaugural day of the 107th Indian Science Congress , Suresh said the pace of technology adoption is one of the three unique features of Industry 4.0.

The other features, according to the scientist, include individuals being a part of cutting-edge industrial revolution and emergence of questions about humanity changing because of technology.

“Today, we can fabricate nanostructures to the precision of thickness of the human hair and we can also image it — this gives us unprecedented power in looking at the world. Nature behaves very differently at the nanoscale. With the power of computational material science and engineering, deep machine learning and data analytics, we can design new materials which we earlier thought was impossible,” he said.

“Industry 4.0 is the convergence of the physical, digital and biological worlds. With the unprecedented convergence of science across disciplines, nanoscience inspires design of engineering of materials, strain engineering and machine learning, and discovery of new material properties and performance. This has vast applications in autoelectronics, energy research and microelectronics,” he explained.

Outlining the four major issues associated with Industry 4.0 , he said, “The number of jobs created-versus-the number of jobs lost in the fourth industrial revolution will define whether there will be development or inequality . Every previous industrial revolution created more jobs than it destroyed. Other critical questions that will surface include the definition of ‘being human’ at a time when machines are making many decisions and the definition of an ‘educated person’. Does a college degree really prepare you for the next 50 years? There’s also the question of the truth and beauty of an imperfect world being lost — will technology push us to be less human?”

313,['4/01/2020'],"Finally, all cops will be seen in uniform shade of khaki","This story is from January 4, 2020

Aurangabad: Soon, police personnel across the state will no longer be seen in various shades of khaki. Maharashtra police have finally set a universal colour code —Pantone 18-1022 TCX—as the standard shade for all khaki uniforms. To ensure its ready availability in the market, the code has already been shared with all leading cloth manufacturers.

A communication issued by additional director general (planning and coordination) S Jaganathan states: “Khaki is the prestige of the police department. While serving, it is essential for policemen to have uniformity in the uniform they wear. It has been noticed that policemen wear different shades of khaki because they purchase cloth from different places.”

The state police headquarters has instructed all superintendents and commissioners of police to ensure the communication is not only passed on to their subordinates, but also to ensure they stitch new uniforms using khaki cloth of the defined universal colour code only.

Since 2014, policemen of the rank of constable to assistant sub-inspector have been paid Rs 5,167 every year for purchasing the uniform that comprises 25 articles, including cap, belt, whistle, lanyard, socks, shoes and the khaki dress.

A resolution of the state home department issued last year states IPS officers serving in the Maharashtra cadre have started getting a higher clothing allowance of Rs 20,000 a year, up from Rs 14,000 earlier. It has been also linked with the dearness allowance of these officers and will proportionally rise with every hike.

Of all the men serving the state police department, officers of the rank of police sub-inspectors to superintendents of police (state services) are entitled to a meagre Rs 1,250 per year, which is Rs 6,000 every four years for a uniform.

The authorities maintained it was in the mid-1800s that British soldiers in India, while trying to blend in with the local conditions and natural colours, began dyeing their white uniforms into dusty colours, “anywhere from muddy water to tea”. Since then, khaki has continued to be a part of the police uniform in Maharashtra.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, has not constituted any committee to investigate whether a poem by Faiz Ahmed Faiz is communal, institute director Abhay Karandikar has said, emphasising the issue has been wrongly reported in the media.

Lines from the poem “Hum Dekhenge”, which is at the heart of the controversy, was recited at a protest by some 300 students at IIT-Kanpur showing solidarity with students of Jamia Milia Islamia on December 17. A complaint was filed on December 20 by a temporary faculty member and about 16 others, including teachers and students, which stated that some words hurt sentiments of Hindus. A committee was constituted on December 21.

“We have received a number of complaints on the December 17 protest. But the committee was never asked to find whether the said poem by Faiz is anti-Hindu. This was reported without speaking to the administration. The mandate of the committee was never to investigate the poem, but to investigate complaints of using inflammatory language by a section of students during a gathering,” said Karandikar.

Deputy director of IIT-Kanpur Manindra Agarwal, who heads the five-member inquiry committee, said that the institute is not sitting in judgement on whether Faiz’s poem is communal.

Requesting the media not to sensationalise the issue, Agarwal said: “A committee has been constituted to address several complaints received from multiple groups of students as well as a faculty member regarding the protest march taken out on December 17 in the institute premises and the subsequent social media posts.”

He said the mandate of the committee is to ‘investigate the complaints of using inflammatory, abusive and intimidating language by a section of students during a gathering as well as on some social media posts, articles and blogs’. The terms of reference of the committee do not include investigating the issue of whether the said poem by Faiz Ahmed Faiz is communal.

315,['4/01/2020'],CPM wins Iduvai panchayat president poll after 16 years,"This story is from January 4, 2020

K Ganesan

TIRUPUR: After three terms of Makkal Munnani alliance’s dominance, a CPM-backed candidate has emerged victorious in Iduvai panchayat presidential election.

Makkal Munnani was an informal alliance formed by political parties including AIADMK and DMK opposing CPM in the backdrop of the demise of former panchayat president and CPM local leader K Rathinasamy, who was brutally murdered by some people from a dominant community. They opposed him mainly for supporting dalits.

The 38-year-old Rathinasamy was panchayat president for the second time in 2002 when he was stabbed to death and hanged from a tree. Following the incident, police arrested some people from a dominant caste.

As it was presumed that the case was a conspiracy against the particular community, despite Rathinasamy also belonged to the same community, all political parties including AIADMK and DMK formed the informal alliance. They fielded common candidates for the last three local body elections, including byelection held after the demise of Rathinasamy, and won all of them.

Though there were efforts to form the Makkal Munnani alliance again this election, it failed as DMK demanded that one of its functionaries should be the presidential candidate, unlike the last three polls, when the common candidates were from AIADMK.

Aligning with the state-level politics, DMK this time had gone with its ally CPM in Tirupur also. In Iduvai panchayat president election, CPM fielded K Ganesan in support of DMK. Ganesan won the election with a good margin of 1,008 votes than AIADMK candidate R Chenniyappan, who obtained 1,239 votes.

“Rathinasamy’s murderers felt that CPM would be gone with his demise. But CPM, after its candidates lost the last three presidential elections in Iduvai marginally, regained the post left by Rathinasamy,” said K Karuppasamy, younger brother of Rathinasamy and a CPM functionary.

He was confident that he would win the election, said Ganesan. “But we thought the difference would be only 300-400 votes. But I won with the margin of 1,008 votes. The votes were polled for me even from unexpected wards. It was possible because the earlier panchayat presidents failed to impress the villagers as the basic amenities were not brought properly to the panchayat. People believe that I would carry on the legacy of Rathinasamy, which I am committed to,” he said.

Aurangabad: City police have arrested a Nanded resident on charges of blackmailing a woman and forcing her to marry him.

According to police, the suspect was earlier engaged to the complainant and during courtship they had clicked some intimate photographs. Using those photographs the suspect was blackmailing the woman.

“They got engaged on February 26, 2018. After that their relationship turned sour and the woman decided not to marry the suspect. The suspect, however, did not like the idea and started threatening the woman. She then informed her parents who then decided to lodge a complaint,” he said.

“After we booked the suspect, he started threatening the complainant. On December 11, he waylaid her and abused her on the road before threatening to make the pictures viral. He asked her to withdraw the complaint and even slapped her publicly,” he added.

The suspect has been booked under sections 341, 323, 504, 506 and 507 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) along with sections of the Information Technology Act.

KOLKATA: The sharp rise in prosecution for violating road rules , including drink-driving, could bring down the number of the accidents on city roads in 2019. Kolkata Police’s most effective step ostensibly was suspending licences of repeat offenders and those driving drunk. This year, police plan to extend the same punishment to bus drivers as well.As many as 2,533 driving licences were suspended for three weeks to six months on recommendation of traffic police in 2018, while the numbers shot up to 5,729—more than double—in 2019. Police said the total prosecution stood at an all-time high of 88,806, while the number of drunk drivers and two-wheeler riders, who were caught with breathalyzer tests, rose from 5,039 in 2018 to 8,571 in 2019. “We ensured we let motorists feel the pinch. They often get away with paying a certain amount. But once the practice of suspending licences and seizing vehicles started, a check was put on rash driving. Vehicle seizures have also risen three times than that of last year, most of them being bikes. From just 377 vehicles being seized in 2018, 1,585 vehicles were seized last year,” said Santosh Pandey, joint CP (crime).Now, police said, they planned to include bus drivers on their list of those whose licences would be revoked partially if they were found to be repeat offenders of violating rules. “Dangerous driving will not be tolerated at any cost. We are taking all measures for training bus drivers and bus owners have been approached for their inputs,” said a senior police officer.The Lalbazar brass’s message has been terse and to the point: catch those who have grossly flouted rules, produce the evidence and write to the RTO , asking them to suspend the licences temporarily. Not unusually, most of those whose licences were temporarily suspended were from the young age bracket. “We have been asked to show no leniency. If required, we can recommend cancellation of licences permanently by approaching court after a grave accident . We have been set three priority areas—speeding, jumping signals and drink driving—for suspending licences,” said an officer from a central Kolkata traffic guard.Police usually send a list of drunk and rash drivers and other traffic violators to the respective regional transport offices, recommending temporary suspension of licenses. The RTOs then, at the least, issue a show-cause notice to the offenders. Licences can be temporarily suspended for jumping signals, overloading goods carriages, ferrying people on goods carriages, driving or riding drunk or under the influence of drugs and using mobiles while driving.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73093092,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-555605,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suspending-licences-put-brakes-on-accidents-in-2019/articleshow/73091248.cms

CHANDIGARH: The UT electricity department has refused to implement monthly billing system under which nearly 2.40 lakh power consumers residents could have ended up paying less in the city.Shortage of staff and software requirements were cited as the reasons for the rejection. This after the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC) had directed the department to shift to the new billing system. “It has been observed that despite repeated directions of the commission, the petitioner (UT electricity department) has not yet moved to monthly billing from bi-monthly billing for domestic and commercial/non-residential category consumers. The commission takes serious note of this and directs the petitioner to implement monthly billing for all category of consumers (except agriculture) with immediate effect in accordance with the Supply Code Regulations, 2018 and submit the quarterly progress of the same to the commission,” the JERC had said in its previous order.The department, however, in its latest petition submitted before the JERC, stated, “At present, more than 85% consumers (domestic and commercial) are being billed bi-monthly. The conversion of meter reading from bi-monthly to monthly basis will lead to various problems, as there is an acute shortage of staff. Further, software is also required to be amended for monthly billing”.The department further said the work for installation of smart meters is in progress and far from completion — a step that will help in monthly billing.In the petition, the department had also not proposed any hike in power tariff for 2020-21. The department submitted before the JERC as there would be a total surplus of Rs 7.23 crore with the department, it has not proposed any power tariff hike.According to the last orders of the JERC, the new tariff would be applicable from June 1, 2019 and remain valid till further orders of the commission.Last time, there was hike in power tariff for 2018-19 financial year. At that time, the JERC had marginally increased rates in domestic and commercial categories and reduced them in the industrial category.In the domestic category, rates were increased in 2018-19 from Rs 2.55 to Rs 2.75 in the slab of 0-150 units, while there was no change in the rate of Rs 4.80 in the slab of 151-400 unit. In the slab of above 400 units, the rate was increased from Rs 5 to Rs 5.20 per unit.Along similar lines, a small increase in the commercial consumer category was also made in 2018-19. In the commercial category, there was no change in the rate of Rs 5 in the slab between 0-150, while in slab of 151-400, the rate was increased from Rs 5.20 to Rs 5.30 per unit. In above 400 slab, the rate was increased from Rs 5.45 to Rs 5.60 per unit.",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73093197,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-122239,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/city-not-to-get-chance-to-save-on-power-bills/articleshow/73091235.cms

MUMBAI/PUNE: In a scathing attack on its friend-turned-foe Shiv Sena , the BJP on Friday asked why it was silent on the vilification of Veer Savarkar by its new ally Congress .A BJP press release demanded that the Maha Vikas Aghadi government of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress should ban a booklet distributed by the Seva Dal , a Congress subsidiary, in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, on Wednesday.Titled ‘Veer Savarkar Kitne Veer?’, the booklet speaks of a physical relationship between Savarkar and Nathuram Godse, the man who assassinated Mahatma Gandhi.Virtually the entire Shiv Sena leadership made no comment on the booklet; only MP Sanjay Raut praised Savarkar and sharply criticised attacks on the freedom fighter, albeit without naming the Congress.Meanwhile, Savarkar’s grandnephew Ranjeet Savarkar tried to meet the CM at Mantralaya, but in vain. He later said if the government did nothing, one could always resort to legal options or campaigning on streets and social media.BJP president Amit Shah, in Jodhpur to address a rally in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), said the Congress should be ashamed of the remarks. “[T]hey are making such comments about Veer Savarkar only for vote bank politics,” he said at the rally.BJP state unit president Chandrakant Patil at an event in Pune on Friday asked chief minister Uddhav Thackeray how long would the Shiv Sena tolerate “insults” to Veer Savarkar.Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, campaigning for panchayat elections in Nandurbar, demanded an immediate ban on the book.He tweeted: “We want answers from Shiv Sena which has made an unnatural alliance with Congress, if it will ban this book in Maharashtra by registering strong protest or repeatedly tolerate such insults of our most respected personalities just for the greed of power?”He said Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray would never have tolerated such “dirty” words against Savarkar and would have been the first to react, which he would have done in his trademark style.The BJP condemned the distribution of the booklet on Savarkar by the Madhya Pradesh unit of the Congress. Recently the BJP had attacked the Shiv Sena over former Congress party president Rahul Gandhi’s statement during the Jharkhand assembly election campaign that he was not a Savarkar to take back his statements.“Savarkar was held innocent by court on allegations about his role in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi,” Patil said. “Yet the Congress is making perverted attempts to show a relationship between Savarkar and the accused in the Mahatma Gandhi assassination case. The Congress’s action of spreading false information about Savarkar is condemnable.”Patil said he would appeal to his party members and citizens across the state to condemn the Congress attempt to insult Savarkar through agitations. He demanded the immediate withdrawal of the book by the Congress and an apology.“I strongly condemn Congress and Seva Dal (a grassroot organisation of the party) for maligning Savarkar,” he said. “I do not understand what Congress has against Savarkar. CM Thackeray must react as he has expressed his respect for Savarkar. He must explain if he accepts such an insult.”Patil said that while it was the Congress leadership that had approved Partition, the party was now holding Savarkar responsible for it.

MUMBAI/PUNE: In a scathing attack on its friend-turned-foe Shiv Sena , the BJP on Friday asked why it was silent on the vilification of Veer Savarkar by its new ally Congress .A BJP press release demanded that the Maha Vikas Aghadi government of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress should ban a booklet distributed by the Seva Dal , a Congress subsidiary, in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, on Wednesday.Titled ‘Veer Savarkar Kitne Veer?’, the booklet speaks of a physical relationship between Savarkar and Nathuram Godse, the man who assassinated Mahatma Gandhi.Virtually the entire Shiv Sena leadership made no comment on the booklet; only MP Sanjay Raut praised Savarkar and sharply criticised attacks on the freedom fighter, albeit without naming the Congress.Meanwhile, Savarkar’s grandnephew Ranjeet Savarkar tried to meet the CM at Mantralaya, but in vain. He later said if the government did nothing, one could always resort to legal options or campaigning on streets and social media.BJP president Amit Shah, in Jodhpur to address a rally in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), said the Congress should be ashamed of the remarks. “[T]hey are making such comments about Veer Savarkar only for vote bank politics,” he said at the rally.BJP state unit president Chandrakant Patil at an event in Pune on Friday asked chief minister Uddhav Thackeray how long would the Shiv Sena tolerate “insults” to Veer Savarkar.Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, campaigning for panchayat elections in Nandurbar, demanded an immediate ban on the book.He tweeted: “We want answers from Shiv Sena which has made an unnatural alliance with Congress, if it will ban this book in Maharashtra by registering strong protest or repeatedly tolerate such insults of our most respected personalities just for the greed of power?”He said Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray would never have tolerated such “dirty” words against Savarkar and would have been the first to react, which he would have done in his trademark style.The BJP condemned the distribution of the booklet on Savarkar by the Madhya Pradesh unit of the Congress. Recently the BJP had attacked the Shiv Sena over former Congress party president Rahul Gandhi’s statement during the Jharkhand assembly election campaign that he was not a Savarkar to take back his statements.“Savarkar was held innocent by court on allegations about his role in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi,” Patil said. “Yet the Congress is making perverted attempts to show a relationship between Savarkar and the accused in the Mahatma Gandhi assassination case. The Congress’s action of spreading false information about Savarkar is condemnable.”Patil said he would appeal to his party members and citizens across the state to condemn the Congress attempt to insult Savarkar through agitations. He demanded the immediate withdrawal of the book by the Congress and an apology.“I strongly condemn Congress and Seva Dal (a grassroot organisation of the party) for maligning Savarkar,” he said. “I do not understand what Congress has against Savarkar. CM Thackeray must react as he has expressed his respect for Savarkar. He must explain if he accepts such an insult.”Patil said that while it was the Congress leadership that had approved Partition, the party was now holding Savarkar responsible for it. Patil said Savarkar had shown extraordinary courage in his fight for the country's freedom and had made great sacrifices.“The sufferings Savarkar and his family endured for the country’s freedom are well known,” he said. “He was also a social reformer who worked for reforms in the Hindu community.

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: Gold continued its upward rally because of various factors, to touch the highest ever mark on Friday. It breached the Rs 41,000-mark to touch Rs 41,200 per 10 gram on Friday, rising by Rs 900 in a day. On Thursday, gold price in Ahmedabad market stood at Rs 40,300 per 10 gram. Analysts said that price of gold went up in the international market following the US air strike in Baghdad , that killed a top Iranian general.

“Mounting tensions between Iran and the US led to increase in gold price in international market from $1,420 per ounce to $1,448 per ounce. Since the Indian rupee depreciated against the US dollar, gold price in the Indian market further escalated,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA).

The last time gold price was at a record high was on December 31, when price stood at Rs 40,400 per 10g.

Analysts believe that gold prices are further expected to rise in the international market to breach $,1600 per ounce. “Gold prices in the international market are expected to increase further owing to geopolitical uncertainties. It may go up to $1,625 per ounce by March this year. If we look at the price trend over the last couple of years, gold has delivered 7-10% returns over a six-month period, if one invests on January 1,” said Sudheesh Nambiath, head, India Gold Policy Centre (IGPC) – Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A).

“Despite knowing that gold prices are expected to go up, the Indian gold demand is expected to remain muted. Indian investors may not be able to encash on the gains, owing to severe liquidity and cashflow crisis in India,” he added.

Increase in gold price is likely to impact demand for physical gold significantly and industry stakeholders are pinning their hopes on reduction in basic customs duty on gold in the upcoming Union budget. “In the wake of the recessionary trend that is seen in the gems and jewellery sector, the government is expected to make necessary policy changes in the upcoming Union budget. We are expecting a cut in the basic customs duty on gold imports,” Acharya said.

If gold prices do not come down any further, it will adversely impact gold jewellery sales. “Even though consumers have begun accepting gold price hovering around Rs 39,500 per 10g, rising prices will only dent demand,” said Manoj Soni, an Ahmedabad-based jeweller. Currently, more than 70% of the total gold purchases take place by exchanging old gold.

Talekhol has three stone quarries and four crushing units

KERI: Villagers of Talekhol in Maharashtra’s Dodamarg taluka, along Goa’s border, on Friday visited all stone quarries and crusher units in the area along with government officials and urged them to shut down the polluting industry.

On December 19, the villagers had launched on an indefinite hunger strike in protest. “For more than a decade we have been facing air, water and noise pollution. Streams and rivulets originating in the hills have been destroyed. Our crops have been seriously affected,” sarpanch of Talekhol, Suresh Sawant, told TOI.

Environmental activist from Goa, Abhijit Prabhudesai, who was present in Talekhol, said, “The hills and forests of Talekhol are part and parcel of the Western Ghats. These are ecologically sensitive areas. Without obtaining environment and other mandatory clearances the stone crushers and quarries have succeeded in not only destroying natural beauty, but perennial sources of water, like springs, streams and lakes, and affecting the biodiversity of the area.”

Tahsildar of Dodamarg, Moreshwar Hadke said that there are three stone quarries and four crushing units in Talekhol.

When villagers asked owners of the quarries and crushing units for Environment Impact Assessment plan duly approved by the state pollution control board, details of precautionary measures adopted to suppress pollution and methodology adopted for periodical monitoring of dust, sound and water pollution, they failed to produce them.

“Not a single unit has constructed the required wind-breaking walls nor have they installed sprinklers for wetting the ground. Garland drains have not been constructed along the periphery of the units to avoid siltation of stone dust into seasonal streams and agricultural land,” a villager from Haddwada in Talekhol, Nilesh Shetkar, said.

Sawantwadi MLA Deepak Kesarkar assured villagers that steps would be taken to close down the quarries and units and asked them to withdraw their indefinite fast. The Talekhol locals agreed to do so, but said they would resume their protest from January 26 if no action was taken by then.

Deputy collector of Sindhudurg, Mangesh Joshi, Kesarkar, officer with the department of mines and geology, Amar Delekar, and Hadke, and other concerned government officials were part of the government team that inspected the quarries.

Tirupur: A 46-year-old man has managed to defeat his elder brother in an intense contest in Sadayapalayam panchayat presidential election in the district on Thursday.

The poll witnessed the contest not only between the brothers, but the elder brother’s wife was also in the fray.

P Periyasamy, 53, of Semiyagoundenpalayam, was the former panchayat president of Sadayapalayam, which was one of largest panchayats in Kundadam block. Since 2001 local body polls, Periyasamy had influence in the panchayat as candidates including a dalit woman and his wife emerged victorious in presidential election in 2001 (when the post was reserved for scheduled caste woman) and 2006 polls respectively.

Periyasamy could not contest in the 2006 polls because of a criminal case pending against him. However, he fielded his wife Lakshmi instead. But he contested in 2011 and won the election. For the last four years, Periyasamy and Lakshmi were living separately as their relationship got strained, and both of their sons were also living along with Lakshmi.

When the election for president post was announced this time, Periyasamy and Lakshmi pitted against each other while Periysamy’s younger brother P Eswaran who unsuccessfully contested in the 2011 poll also filed nominations. Four other candidates were too in the fray. Earlier, Periyasamy alleged that Eswaran persuaded Lakshmi to contest in the election to divide his votes.

As expected, there was neck and neck contest between Periyasamy and Eswaran in the poll. In the end, Eswaran won it by getting 2,142 votes, 156 votes higher than Periyasamy. Lakshmi ended up losing obtaining 177 votes.

Participants at the rally that started from Shahid Minar in Esplanade and went till Keshab Bhavan in Maniktala

KOLKATA: Colour and courage was the hallmark of the mass rally on Friday evening by transgender community , women and queer persons to protest Citizenship Amendment Act, National Register for Citizens, police brutalities in Uttar Pradesh and the lockdown in Kashmir.

Members of organisations fighting for rights of different sections of the society braved rain and cold weather to participate in the rally with their colourful flags in vibrant outfits. More than 1,000 activists and ordinary citizens participated in the rally. It started from Shahid Minar in Esplanade and went till Keshab Bhavan in Maniktala which is the RSS headquarters in West Bengal.

Social activist Ratnabali Roy said the “minorities within the minorities” will be the worst affected by any legislation that excludes citizens. “Women, physically disabled and mentally challenged persons and transgenders will be the worst affected by anti-citizen legislations like CAA and NRC . Nobody is talking about them. There are people who are mentally challenged and have no documents. Many transgenders face difficulty in getting documents because they are unable to prove they belong to the third sex. Several women from marginalised societies don’t have half of their documents. How will they prove they are Indian citizens? Today’s protest rally is to highlight the plight of these sections of the society,” said Roy.

Rallyists demanded the government should roll back CAA and police brutalities in Uttar Pradesh must be stopped immediately. “Laws are for citizens and not vice versa. Governments elected by the people cannot impose legislations on them and push them into uncertainty. This is about the future of millions of people. The police are plundering homes in UP and firing on citizens protesting CAA. This must be stopped at once,” Sweta Roy, a student from Jadavpur University and a LGBTQ activist.

There was massive cop deployment with even women police personnel providing security to protestors as they walked down CR Avenue shouting ‘azadi’ slogans. “The central government has failed on all frontiers of development and security for citizens. While economy has nosedived, women have become more vulnerable. To conceal their failures, they are dividing the people with CAA, NRC and NPR,” said Raima Ghosh, who took part in the rally. Some of the groups that participated were Durbar, Pratyay Trust, Ambedkar University Queer Collective, Feminists in Resistance, Waqif, Chitrangada and Ardhek Akash. Students from Jadavpur University, Presidency University and Aliah University also participated.

COIMBATORE: The Kongu belt where it fared slightly better than the rival DMK has offered a sort of solace to AIADMK. But for the Nilgiris district, the party won more seats of district panchayat ward councillor post as well as panchayat union councillor post.

In Coimbatore, where local administration minister S P Velumani threw his weight, AIADMK managed to bag nine posts of district panchayat ward councillors while DMK got five posts as per the official results declared till 8pm.

In neighbouring Erode , Namakkal, Salem and Krishnagiri also, the ruling party had a good show romping home with more seats.

Not just Velumani, other heavyweights like P Thangamani, K A Sengottaiyan and not to mention chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswamy, also hail from this region traditionally known to back AIADMK

In Salem, out of the 29 district panchayat wards, AIADMK captured 18 wards while DMK managed to get only six. AIADMK alone captured 131 panchayat union wards out of the 288 in Salem district while DMK captured 76 union wards.

Other parties including PMK, DMDK, Congress, Communist, TMK, MDMK and independent candidates captured the rest.

However, Dharmapuri was a mixed bag, where the ruling party bagged more posts of district panchayat councillors while DMK managed to win more posts of panchayat union councillors. This despite the fact that PMK, which is considered strong in the Vanniyar-dominated district, was with the ruling party.

The western region also offered reason for AIADMK allies BJP and PMK to cheer. BJP emerged victorious in two district panchayat wards and PMK won four seats in Salem.

But the AIADMK camp has little to cheer. Though the ruling party fared better in local body polls than the Lok Sabha elections, the results are worse than any other election in the past in the region.

In addition to the fact that DMK has made strong inroads in the gounder-dominated Kongu belt in districts like Tirupur, Coimbatore and Erode, the opposition party managed to oust the ruling party in majority of seats in the Nilgiris. “Some places like Chennmalai, held by us for several decades, have been lost,” said an AIADMK functionary.

AIADMK men said that intra party feud and poor strategising cost the party in the Kongu region. “There were rebel candidates in some places. In Sulur, a rebel candidate eventually won,” the functionary said.

Former AIADMK minister K C Palaniswami said that the party fared well in the western region because DMK was weak. “It is high time that the party sorted out the issues plaguing it and come up with a winning strategy,” he said.

Dehradun: Light to moderate snowfall was witnessed in high-altitude places in Uttarakhand, especially the hills of Kumaon, in past 24 hours with cold conditions continued to prevail in the hilly areas on Friday.

In Pithoragarh district, Pithoragarh city, Munsyari and Dharchula received snowfall, while the district’s low lying areas were lashed by over 17mm rainfall. Similarly, Auli in Chamoli district and other high altitude areas in Uttarkashi and Rudraprayag districts received light to moderate snowfall.

Bikram Singh, director of regional meteorological centre told TOI, “Higher reaches, especially area located 2500metres and above, received light to moderate snowfall since January 2. More snow activity is likely in high-altitude places of both Kumaon and Garhwal regions in the next 24 hours.”

Cold conditions also continued to prevail in the hills as both maximum and minimum temperatures are settling below normal since the beginning of the New Year. Muktehwar remained the coldest place in Uttarakhand with mercury settling at -0.2 degrees Celsius.

New Tehri also remained cold with minimum temperature recorded at 1.2 degrees Celsius, while it was 2.9 degrees Celsius in Mussoorie. However, minimum temperature in Dehradun, which touched record low level in the beginning of the week, started rising and remained at 6 degrees Celsius.

Significantly, the Met office has predicted that weather will start getting clear from January 4 onwards and dry weather is likely to prevail for the next 48 hours.

Singh added, “Another western disturbance is going to hit Uttarakhand from January 6 evening. Light to moderate snowfall is likely to take place at mid and high hills during the period. Temperatures will once again drop after January 7.”

Meanwhile, following good spell of snowfall in Auli, Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam (GMVN) started a ski course for domestic and international skiers. A three-day Ski Carnival also began in Munsyari on Thursday.

The basic aim of this carnival is to promote skiing in Munsyari and to attract tourists, said Amit Lohni, district tourist officer. He added, “Tourists in large numbers from Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Gurugram are reaching Betulidhar and Pathalthod in Munsyari where the carnival is being held.”

Tirupati: A team of Tamil Nadu police reached Kuppam on Friday to resolve the mystery of a 40-year-old man missing from Chennai since December.

According to cops from Shankar Nagar police station in Chennai, Karthikeyan was killed by a couple, Shiva and Madeswari, in Adivi Buduguru village in Kuppam and buried the body near their home.

The cops said Shiva and Madeswari worked as daily wagers for Karthikeyan in Chennai for the last six months. Karthikeyan had a relationship with Madeswari. Shiva warned his wife to end to her relationship with Karthikeyan and the couple returned to Kuppam.

The TN police said Shiva wanted to kill Karthikeyan. On December 18, Shiva forced Madeswari to ask Karthikeyan to come to their village at Adivi Buduguru.

Following a missing complaint lodged by Karthikeyan’s family, the TN police suspect that Shiva and Madeswari murdered Karthikeyan.

Kuppam urban police inspector GT Naidu said no action could be taken against the couple for lack of evidence. “The Shankar Nagar police could not furnish anything more than the FIR copy of the missing case. They did not share any information relating the investigation. There was no communication to us from the TN police to support the investigation. We cannot dig up the premises of the couple alleged based on oral information by the TN police. We have asked them to come back with documents to substantiate their claims,” said Naidu.

Panaji: Daily commuters and office-goers using public transportation to get home after work were affected by the pro-CAA rally on Friday as several public buses were set aside for those who had attended the rally.

Pamela Dias, an office-goer and daily Panaji-Margao commuter, reached home only at 9pm after waiting for an hour in a queue to get on to a KTC shuttle bus. “There were no buses for passengers, but at the same time, we could see stationary KTC buses with numbers and banners pasted on them. People from the rally boarded them directly and they left for their destinations even if they were not filled. The rest of us only watched hopelessly,” she said.

Passengers who questioned KTC officials were told there was nothing they could do as the buses were used for attendees of the rally. “There was a queue, so I skipped it and squeezed into a bus,” another passenger said.

Kozhikode: A leopard which fell into a well inside the compound of a house at Vythiri in Wayanad, was rescued after a three-hour operation by forest department officials, fire and rescue services personnel and locals on Friday.

The three-year-old male leopard fell into the well attached to the house of Gopi of Sobha Nivas at Vattavayal, late Wednesday night.

Gopi said that he heard a loud sound of something falling into the well late at night but did not venture out of the house fearing stray elephants.

Family members spotted the leopard inside the well at around 7am and informed the forest department officials.

South Wayanad divisional forest officer P Renjith Kumar said that as the 10m well had two metres of water, a wooden plank and tree branches were lowered to help the animal stay afloat.

Later, a net trap was lowered into the well and the leopard was trapped in it.

“As there was a chance of the animal leaping outside when the net was pulled out of the well, we sedated it by firing a tranquillizer dart after lifting the net above the water. The leopard was lifted out of the well after a while ensuring that the animal was sedated,” Dr Arun Zachariah, forest veterinary surgeon said.

He said that the leopard was in good health and has not suffered any injuries.

The leopard was taken to the animal rescue centre of the forest department at Pookode where it is kept under observation.

Kumar said that the decision on whether to release it back to the wild will be taken after getting directions from the state chief wildlife warden.

The well in which the leopard fell into was around 4km away from the forest boundary. TNN

335,['4/01/2020'],7 teams formed to inspect ‘private forest’ properties,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Panaji: The state government has constituted seven inspection teams to carry out site inspection of properties identified as private forests by the review committee. Each inspection team will be headed by the respective inspector of settlement and land records (ISLR) of the taluka and include the respective range forest officer and talathi.

The review committee had submitted its report to the government in June 2016. However, after affected parties, whose properties were clubbed as ‘private forests’, filed objections that the standards followed for identifying private forests were not appropriate, a new committee was appointed to examine the report. This committee is in the process of finalising its report, which mostly likely will be submitted to the government next week.

Meanwhile, each inspection team has been ordered to submit their respective reports to the joint secretary revenue and the chairman of the review committee by January 6 to enable the committee to finalise the June 2016 review committee report. This, in turn, will need to be submitted to the government on or before January 10.

Over 1,000 objections had been raised after the review committee had submitted its report in 2016. However, the new committee wasn’t permitted to hear all the objections, and even if these were heard, these can’t be part of the final report, a committee member said speaking on condition of anonymity.

He said their task was rendered difficult due to lack of clarity in the report pertaining survey numbers of areas which are identified as private forests. For instance, in the case of some villages, additional private forests that were identified have been clubbed and shown as one total area, he said, adding, “The review committee’s report ought to have mentioned survey numbers of each property. This has led to confusion. The vexed issue that has been dragging on for the last 25 years is unlikely to be resolved any time soon.”

As per the demarcation carried by the forest department, 41.2 sq km was marked as private forests. In 2008, however, this was challenged in the high court by Goa Foundation stating there was a reduction in areas as referred to by both the Sawant and Karapurkar committees, and that demarcated by the forest department team.

In 2016, National Green Tribunal ( NGT ) had directed the state government to constitute a committee and evolve an internal mechanism to demarcate private forest areas in each parcel of land that was recognised as private forest by the Sawant and Karapurkar committees.

Mayor Kulwant Singh others during the municipal corporation house meeting in Mohali on Friday

Mohali: Parks would be maintained under public private partnership (PPP) mode in a move that will help the municipal corporation (MC) save Rs 5.5 crore to Rs 6 crore annually. The decision was taken in the MC house meeting held on Friday.

Resident welfare associations (RWAs) were maintaining the parks earlier, but after implementation of ‘adopting the parks’ policy, they will be deprived of the activity. Mohali has 569 smalls and big parks under the MC jurisdiction out of which 140 were maintained by RWAs and the rest by the civic body.

The MC used to pay Rs 7 lakh per month to RWAs for maintaining the parks, handing out Rs 85 lakh to Rs 90 lakh annually for the 140 parks. The rest of the parks’ maintenance was outsourced, which used to cost the MC Rs 4.5 crore to Rs 5 crore annually.

MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said, “We have decided to give the maintenance of parks under the PPP mode in which the eligible company will be allowed to use the space for advertising apart from maintaining the allotted park. Secondly, parks’ maintenance can also be given under CSR. As far as RWAs are concerned, the parks which are not opted either under PPP mode or CSR will be allotted to them. This has been done after adopting the parks policy.”

However, the policy also allows RWAs to get 20% increase in the existing rates for the maintenance of parks, which are to be billed by the MC.

BOX

Animal bylaws deferred

The municipal corporation house on Friday deferred the adoption of animal bylaws proposing Rs 2 lakh compensation in death caused due to stray animal. The reason cited was that the bylaws needed to be studied. Stray animals committee chairman Kuljit Singh Bedi raised objection that the Rs 2 lakh compensation is too less and must be increased. He also said restrictions of three animals per family must be reviewed. Other councillors said three pets must be reduced to two as most residents have dogs as pets and keeping three dogs at a house is not advisable

In another decision, the MC house approved the agenda to re-appropriate the budget to balance the funds. The MC commissioner said under some heads the budget is in deficit and in surplus a few others. “So, we have to re-appropriate the budget so that developmental works could be undertaken. A total of Rs 8.92 crore has been adjusted,” he said.

Thanks-giving row at MC house meet

A row erupted owing to the mention of thanksgiving for the construction of Phase 3B1 community centre after councillor Kuljit Singh Bedi raised objections. He questioned when the agenda point was neither tabled nor brought in house for approval, how does the thanksgiving come in favour of the MC. The mayor pacified the councilors, calling it a collective effort.

In Salem, out of the 29 district panchayat wards, AIADMK captured 18 wards while DMK managed to get only six

COIMBATORE: The Kongu belt where it fared slightly better than the rival DMK has offered a sort of solace to AIADMK. But for the Nilgiris district, the party won more seats of district panchayat ward councillor post as well as panchayat union councillor post.

In Coimbatore, where local administration minister S P Velumani threw his weight, AIADMK managed to bag nine posts of district panchayat ward councillors while DMK got five posts as per the official results declared till 8pm.

In neighbouring Erode , Namakkal, Salem and Krishnagiri also, the ruling party had a good show romping home with more seats.

Not just Velumani, other heavyweights like P Thangamani, K A Sengottaiyan and not to mention chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswamy, also hail from this region traditionally known to back AIADMK

In Salem, out of the 29 district panchayat wards, AIADMK captured 18 wards while DMK managed to get only six. AIADMK alone captured 131 panchayat union wards out of the 288 in Salem district while DMK captured 76 union wards.

Other parties including PMK, DMDK, Congress, Communist, TMK, MDMK and independent candidates captured the rest.

However, Dharmapuri was a mixed bag, where the ruling party bagged more posts of district panchayat councillors while DMK managed to win more posts of panchayat union councillors. This despite the fact that PMK, which is considered strong in the Vanniyar-dominated district, was with the ruling party.

The western region also offered reason for AIADMK allies BJP and PMK to cheer. BJP emerged victorious in two district panchayat wards and PMK won four seats in Salem.

But the AIADMK camp has little to cheer. Though the ruling party fared better in local body polls than the Lok Sabha elections, the results are worse than any other election in the past in the region.

In addition to the fact that DMK has made strong inroads in the gounder-dominated Kongu belt in districts like Tirupur, Coimbatore and Erode, the opposition party managed to oust the ruling party in majority of seats in the Nilgiris. “Some places like Chennmalai, held by us for several decades, have been lost,” said an AIADMK functionary.

AIADMK men said that intra party feud and poor strategising cost the party in the Kongu region. “There were rebel candidates in some places. In Sulur, a rebel candidate eventually won,” the functionary said.

Former AIADMK minister K C Palaniswami said that the party fared well in the western region because DMK was weak. “It is high time that the party sorted out the issues plaguing it and come up with a winning strategy,” he said.

COIMBATORE: Customs officials seized 715 cartons of cigarettes worth Rs 21.45 lakh from two air passengers from Singapore on Thursday.

Sleuths of the air intelligence unit and air customs had seized two bags containing 114 cartons each of Marlboro Red and another containing 84 cartons of Marlboro Red as well as 43 cartons of Esse from Abeesh, son of Thaha Yoonas of Kaipamangalam, Kalamuri in Thrissur , Kerala, who had arrived on a Scoot flight at the city airport.

Abeesh did not file customs declaration slip or declare dutiable goods and tried to pass through the green channel. The officials, who scanned his baggage, found the cartons. They seized them under Section 110 of the Customs Act, 1962.

“He had left for Singapore a few days ago on tourist visa and was planning to earn a profit by selling the cigarettes in India,” an official said. “The market value of one carton of Marlboro Red and Esse is Rs 3,000. The total seizure value is Rs 10.65 lakh. Abeesh will be served a show-cause notice.”

The team later checked the luggage carried by Fredin Anto, son of Jusa Antony of Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, who had also arrived on the same flight and found 360 cartons of cigarettes worth Rs 10.80 lakh. He was let off after inquiry and has been asked to appear before the officials whenever needed.

As per the rules, an air passenger is permitted to bring 200 cigarettes from foreign countries for personal use.

339,['4/01/2020'],"After decades of wait for HSVP plots, buyers to get a refund","This story is from January 4, 2020

GURUGRAM: Around 255 people who didn’t get possession of land they bought from Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran ( HSVP ) and are waiting for alternative plots for two to three decades, or even more, are unlikely to get the promised slice of land any time soon as Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) is considering giving them monetary compensation instead.

The refund amount will be the original cost of the land along with interest.

During his first visit to Gurugram on Friday, chief administrator of HSVP, Pankaj Yadav, announced this and directed urban development officials to scrutinise the case of each plot holder, and prepare a report on the sum to be refunded.

People had bought land 20 to 30 years back, but because of pending litigation and other reasons, are yet to get possession of the same from the urban development authority. After decades of appreciation, each of these plots, for which they paid just a few lakhs of rupees, would now be valued in crores.

Naturally, compensation calculated on the original price of the land, and after so many years of delay, will not leave the buyers happy. They demand alternative plots and to ensure this, many owners have filed cases against the HSVP for delay in handing over the same.

“We have been waiting for alternative plots for decades and making rounds of the HSVP office. How can they deny us alternative plot now? Refunding money with interest will be unfair. People who got their plots in time, constructed houses. Even those who have not built anything on these lands, can now sell off the plots for crores. We will get just a few lakhs with interest and it would not be sufficient to buy any plot in Gurgaon today,” said Amit Kumar, who has been waiting for an alternative plot for the last 40 years.

Bu there’s hope for ‘oustees’ — whose lands were taken over by HSVP — and as per the policy of the urban planning body have to be allotted an alternative plot in addition to the monetary compensation that they have received. Under this quota, 822 applications are pending with the HSVP.

The policy, which has brought about to ensure that the locals are not uprooted from their birthplace, mandates that a land owner who had to give up 75% or more of his land to HSVP is eligible to get a plot at market rate, the location of which will be decided through a lucky draw.

The HSVP chief has ordered the draw to be conducted within 15 days, informed estate officer Vivek Kalia.

HSVP chief Yadav also expressed his concern over encroachment of authority land. He noted that large chunks of HSVP land in Gurgaon have been unlawfully taken over, and estate officers have been asked to make field visits and deal with the squatters.

Along with this, HSVP Gurgaon was directed to auction its land to raise fund. “Earlier, we had managed to sell land to MNCs for Rs 800 crore. We are hoping to make some big ticket land deal this time too,” said Kalia, adding that a re-planning for Sector 29 was also proposed.

Panaji: His research project proved that goat skin was the next best alternative to the banned monitor lizard membrane for the traditional Goan mud percussion instrument, the ghumot . Now, Ashley Fernandes is on the lookout for the perfect synthetic membrane for the much-loved instrument.

Not satisfied with the government merely declaring the ghumot as a heritage Goan folk music instrument, he wants the instrument to reach the world music platform.

“Only a few potters still make the ghumot today. Unless there is enough demand for the instrument as well as enough of people to teach it, the ghumot could become extinct,” Fernandes said.

On Friday Fernandes gifted the ghumot to Kuljit Bhamra, British composer, record producer and tabla player famed for pioneering the British bhangra sound.

“Most drums have a sealed bottom. But the ghumot is an unusual instrument. It produces a rich sound where the resonance and pitch change when you cover the hole,” Bhamra said after playing it for the first time in Divar.

Bhamra told TOI that not only will be take the ghumot back home with him to the UK, but will be using it in his next project.

Fernandes’ father, Marius, said the popularity of the ghumot dipped after the monitor lizard was declared a protected species under the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 and has been revived only recently at various cultural festivals organised by him.

“Besides being completely organic, the ghumot is also one of the oldest secular instruments played by both Hindus and Catholics,” Marius says.

Further, he said that the instrument may vanish if not promoted enough and taught to the younger generation.

Seventeen district panchayat ward member posts include two each in Avinashi, Uthukuli, Palladam, Gudimangalam, and Udumalpet panchayat unions, and each one in Tirupur, Pongalur, Kundadam, Kangeyam, Moolanur, Dharapuram and Madathukulam panchayat unions.

AIADMK contested in all the 17 seats, and it has 13 seats which is lesser than four seats which it won in the last local polls, when it had won all the 17 seats. In case of DMK alliance, it won 4 seats including DMK 3 and Congress 1. In terms of votes difference, Congress candidate G Janarthanan who contested in ward 17 (Udumalpet panchayat union) won it in least difference. Janarthanan defeated AIADMK candidate RG Jaganathan by 66 votes.

In Avinashi panchayat union, AIADMK candidate A Sithalakshmi defeated DMK candidate M Lalitha by 8,166 votes in ward 1, which is highest vote difference in the district.

Among 170 panchayat union ward councillor posts, DMK alliance emerged victorious in 88 seats including DMK 75, Congress 9, CPI 2, MDMK 1 and CPM 1. AIADMK alliance won 64 seats including AIADMK 57, DMDK 4 and BJP 3. Independent candidates have won 18 seats.

The vote counting process lasted till 4am in the district as Udumalpet panchayat union was the last among 13 unions to report the results. To maintain law and order, special tahsildars were in duty in counting centres of each union.

Meanwhile, the counting of votes was withheld in panchayat ward member number 11 in Periyakottai panchayat in Udumalpet panchayat union. The decision was taken after a candidate’s name was found deleted in secondary electoral roll. A report was sent to the state election commission on the issue.

So, among 2,747 total posts including 2,295 panchayat ward members, 265 panchayat presidents, 170 panchayat union ward councillors, and 17 district panchayat ward members, three panchayat ward members including two in which no nominations filed and the one in Periyakottai panchayat were at stake. Hence, the elected candidates in 2,744 posts will take oath in respective places on December 6.

PANAJI: After delaying security clearance to Pakistan-born Australian citizen of Goan origin , Marco Monteiro, the ministry of home affairs has given him a no-objection certificate (NOC) for granting a conference visa to attend the 12th Know Goa Programme beginning Saturday.

“He has received an NOC from the ministry of home affairs. With this NOC, the embassy will now able to consider his application for a conference visa. He can join the group later,” director for NRI affairs Anthony D'Souza told TOI.

Monteiro will, however, not join the rest of the seven diaspora youth from Canada, UK and Portugal who have already arrived for the 12-day programme specially formulated for the benefit of the Goan Diaspora youth who haven’t had an opportunity to discover their roots.

The issue arose for Monteiro because he was born in Karachi, although his roots are Goan.

Monteiro has an BSE in biology and biochemistry and is currently working as a research assistant, D'Souza said.

The group will be taken to educational, cultural and historical places in the state and interact with local Goans and elected representatives at all levels and government dignitaries before proceeding to Agra and Delhi as part of the itinerary.

Michael Lobo

SALIGAO: Ports minister and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo has accused his government of failing to improve power supply in the coastal belt and added that in the last eight days there have been nearly 40-50 power cuts daily in his constituency.

“Every government only gives assurances of improving electricity supply, but all have failed to provide a solution,” Lobo said at an interaction with reporters in Mapusa. He added that it is not just his constituency, but the neighbouring ones of Mapusa and Siolim too that are facing similar problems of interrupted power supply.

This situation, he said, is causing the hotel industry along the coastal belt to bleed as they are forced to use generators for nearly six to seven hours a day. “This is very expensive and adds to pollution,” Lobo added.

Stressing on the seriousness of uninterrupted power supply to boost the tourism industry, Lobo said that the Rs 180 crore worth Saligao sub-station must be completed to resolve the issue.

“I don’t know why the project is being delayed when the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) is ready to provide a loan for the same, which can be recovered in just five years,” he said, adding that he will soon meet chief minister Pramod Sawant and get an assurance from him on an urgent resolution for the problem.

“There are no two ways about it, the sub-station has to happen,” he said, pointing out that in case the existing power situation continues, Bardez taluka will suffer badly.

“The (power) minister (Nilesh Cabral) has taken a review and I have had meetings with him,” Lobo said.

Stating that tourism is going down, Lobo, who also has a stake in the tourism sector, said that it is important to focus on the reasons for the grim situation. As power is one of the main issues affecting the entire tourist belt, the ports minister said if the state wants to revive tourism, the power sector has to be improved.

Further, he said that there is a strong need to analyse the reasons for the state going through a bad patch in the tourism sector.

Referring to reports that foreign tourists go to other destinations giving Goa a miss, the minister said it is important to know “why is it happening”.

He added that the tourism industry, on which a large number of youth are dependant, needs a revival too. “If required, new rules need to be framed as tourism is a major source of employment and the state cannot ignore the current situation,” the Calangute MLA said.

Visakhapatnam: Pakistan will release the 22 Indian fishermen hailing from north Andhra on January 6, said YSRC MP V Vijayasai Reddy on Friday.

“The Pakistan ministry of foreign affairs has informed the Indian high commission in Islamabad that Pakistan has decided to repatriate the fishermen to India via Wagha border on January 6,” a press release from Reddy’s office said.

On January 1, TOI reported that the 22 Andhra fishermen would return home before Sankranti (January 15) as Pakistan had agreed to release them as a part of a prisoners exchange programme.

Pakistan Maritime Security Agency had arrested 22 fishermen who hailed from Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts off the Gujarat coast in November 2018. The fishermen were hired by a fishing company in Veraval, near Porbandar.

“Along with the family members of the captured fishermen, I had met former external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj who assured that she would try through diplomatic channels to get the fishermen released”, the MP said.

The 22 fishermen from Andhra Pradesh are from among the 483 Indian fishermen captured by Pakistan.

345,['4/01/2020'],"Khaki gets universal colour code, finally","This story is from January 4, 2020

Aurangabad: Police personnel across the state will no more be found wearing different shades of uniform as the Maharashtra Police has defined universal colour code for the khaki cloth used by them.

The colour code, PANTONE 18-1022 TCX, has been set as the standard shade and to ensure that it remains readily available in the market, the code has been shared with all the leading cloth manufacturers.

A communication issued by additional director general (planning and coordination) S Jaganathan states, “Khaki is the prestige of the police department. While serving, it is essential for policemen to have uniformity in the uniform they wear. It has been noticed that policemen wear different shades of khaki because they purchase cloth from different places.”

The state police headquarters has instructed all the superintendents and commissioners of police to ensure that the communication is not only passed on to their subordinates, but also to ensure that they stitch new uniforms using khaki cloth of the defined universal colour code only.

Since 2014, policemen of the rank of constable to assistant sub-inspector, have been paid Rs 5,167 every year for purchasing the uniform, comprising 25 articles and the khaki dress.

As per a GR issued by the state home department last year, the IPS officers serving in the Maharashtra cadre have started getting higher clothing allowance of Rs 20,000 per year from the earlier of Rs 14,000 per year. This allowance has also been linked with the dearness allowance of these officers and would proportionally increase with each hike.

Of all the men serving with the state police department, officers of the rank of police sub-inspectors to superintendents of police (state services) are entitled to a meagre Rs 1,250 per year, which is Rs 6,000 every four years for the uniform.

The authorities maintained that it was in the mid-1800 that British soldiers in India, while trying to match with the local conditions and natural colours, began dyeing their white uniforms with dusty colour, using anything from muddy water to tea. Since then, khaki has continued to be a part of police uniform in Maharashtra.

NAIHATI/BARUIPUR/MIDNAPORE: The blast in Naihati’s Masjidpara firecracker factory was the third such incident in the past couple of years. At least four people were killed in the two other incidents in the same Mamudpur gram panchayat area , under which Masjidpara also falls. But the administration never launched a crackdown on illegal fire-cracker factories that continue to thrive in Naihati.“There are nearly 100 such factories running illegally inside residential houses at Masjidpara and Debak villages. Three workers had died in a similar manner in the area last year. Two of them were child labourers and another a middle-aged woman, all of whom were burnt to death,” said a local. In 2017, an elderly man was killed in another blast at a firecracker unit at Mamudpur near Debak.Locals alleged that panchayat authorities and police hardly take action against such illegal firecracker factories run in crowded localities despite of several deaths in such explosions. “The factory at Masjidpara was also illegal, as the government has banned such units in the state. But this firecracker unit was being run for over two decades. Despite our repeated appeals, the panchayat and police are yet to take any action,” a local woman said.Locals said that such was the intensity of Friday’s blast that tremors were felt in houses located at least four to five kilometres from the spot.Villagers on Friday afternoon gathered at the spot and staged an agitation, claiming that there are several such illegal units in the Debak-Mamudpur area where women, children and teenagers are employed. Some agitators turned violent and attacked a portion of the factory godown that remained unscathed. Others demanded that the factory owner pay proper compensation to the victims’ families.Police are looking for owner Sheikh Nur Hossain, a Masjidpara resident who is absconding. “We were not aware of such units operating in the panchayat area. After the blast, we have sent a large force to conduct raids in the area,” said Dhrubajyoti Dey, joint commissioner of Barrackpore police .South 24 Parganas has also witnessed blasts in fire cracker factories at least once a year since 2017.

PANAJI: During a month when temperatures are expected to drop, December 2019 turned out to be one of the hottest in five decades. The mercury usually drops below 20 degrees celsius at night and stays low. This season, however, it didn’t dip below 21C even once but rose to 26C, making nights during the last month the warmest on record.The mercury hovered over the 24C-mark for five days during Christmas week—peak winter period—from December 26 to 30.Meteorologists crunching figures from 1969 to 2018 say that December 2019 will go down in climate history – at least for Goa – as a remarkable one. “In the last five decades, we experienced the warmest nights this December,” Krishnamurty Padgalwar, director, India meteorological department ( IMD ), Panaji , said.While minimum temperatures were on the higher side in November, with an average minimum of 23.7C, the mercury continued to rise during the peak winter month. December 2 was the warmest night, recording a minimum temperature of 26C in the Panaji.The local meteorological centre recorded minimum temperatures of over 22C on nine days, over 24C on eight days and over 23C on seven days. This yielded a mean minimum temperature that will make climate change experts shake their head.“The mean minimum temperature in December 2019 was 23.2C,” Padgalwar said.The wind direction had a major role in keeping the mercury soaring throughout December. Northeasterly winds which bring in the chill from the north were missing.

Goa CM Pramod Sawant

PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant recently held a meeting with Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) officials and has tasked the agency to oversee the construction of the convention centre at Dona Paula, which will also be used to host the International Film Festival of India ( Iffi ). The centre was earlier slated to be a public private partnership (PPP) project.

Sources said that concerns over the PPP model convinced the state government to hand over the ambitious project to GSIDC. The convention centre will be built along with the Iffi complex.

“A note has been moved to hand over the project to GSIDC after which GSIDC will put it up for board approval,” an official said.

The convention centre, which was earlier conceptualised at the cost of Rs 1,400 crore, is likely to be taken up in a phased manner with the state government funding the project with some help from the Centre.

“PPP model has not been successful. Most probably the convention centre will be taken up in phases. It may go into two or three phases,” a GSIDC officer said.

In a written reply tabled on the floor of the House to a question by Congress MLA Ravi Naik during the ongoing assembly session, Sawant said that the project would be on PPP basis. Till now, the Economic Development Corporation (EDC) was spearheading the project and had even held a consultation with 25 reputed business houses to construct the convention centre on a 52-acre plot.

Along with the convention centre, an exhibition centre, indoor film shooting shed, ESG and Iffi office, Smart City centre of excellence and commercial enterprises, like hotels, apartments, malls and a multiplex were planned.

Officials said the new proposal will be scaled down due to paucity of funds. Officials with the department of information and publicity said that transfer of land will be another challenge for the state government.

“Land has to be transferred from the department of information and technology to the department of information and publicity, and this will take some months,” the official said.

Former chief minister Manohar Parrikar had said that a convention centre with a 5,000 seating capacity would be ready for the 50th anniversary of Iffi. EDC had even appointed Knight Frank (India) Pvt Ltd as the transaction advisor for the multi-crore project.

COIMBATORE: Air India is all set to resume operation of its red-eye flight to New Delhi from the city on all seven days of the week from January 15, helping city residents easily access connection flights to European destinations. The flight, which used to operate on all days of the week, was reduced to thrice a week from November 1. The red-eye flights are those which depart at night and arrive at the destination in the morning.

The airline is also working on introducing an additional morning direct flight to the national capital.

The red-eye flight, AI 548, will depart from the city at 1.10am and reach New Delhi at 4.10am. This will allow passengers to board flights to European destinations such as Frankfurt, Rome, Milan, Copenhagen, London and Vienna etc. Girija Ramesh, Air India station manager, said, “Most of the Air India flights to Europe from New Delhi are scheduled in the afternoon from 12.30pm to 3pm.” Many private airlines also have morning flights from the national capital to Europe.

The airline’s afternoon flight to New Delhi, AI 539, which departs from the city at 3.05pm and reaches the destination at 6.05pm, connects passengers to its flights to destinations such as New York, Chicago and Washington in the USA and Toronto in Canada. “All these flights depart from 10.30pm to 2.30am. So, the fliers needn’t hurry to the respective terminal to board their flights,” Girija said.

Besides this, the airline, which has shifted its ticketing office to Arts College Road, is also working on introducing a flight that will depart from the city at 8am and reach Delhi at 11am. “This will help a lot of business and leisure travellers to board their flight at a normal hour and reach the destination at the beginning of business hours,” said Kajal A, an independent travel agent.

Air India officials, meanwhile, said they were keen on introducing a flight that would depart from New Delhi at 5am and reach the city at 8am. “The flight will again leave for New Delhi immediately.”

Hyderabad: Within hours of kidnap of a private contractor in Sultan Bazar on Thursday, five of his business associates were arrested in Saroornagar. A kidnapping case was registered against the five accused.

The accused took away the contractor, Raji Reddy, of Ramanthapur from a lodge at around 5.45 pm. “We arrested the five accused and rescued Reddy,” Sultan Bazar inspector K Subbarami Reddy said.

Police said the issue was over Reddy refusing to pay money for a work the accused had done. Reddy, who got a cable-laying contract of a private telecom firm, sub-contracted the work to Koteswar Rao who, in turn, gave the work to Venkata Krishna and his associates of Vijayawada. “The accused did not make any written agreement with Reddy for the work. They said Raji Reddy had to pay Rs 50 lakh to them for the finished work. However, Reddy refused to pay any money saying he did not owe them anything,” the inspector said. The accused have been identified as L Venkata Krishna, Prakash, Naresh, Ganesh and Sunil. Based on a complaint by Reddy’s friend Narender Swamy through Dial 100, Sultan Bazar police swung into action and rescued him.

A mediator, Srinivas called Reddy, Koteswar Rao and the accused to Haridwar lodge in Sultan Bazar to discuss the matter. “Reddy told the accused that they did not have proper experience in dealing with financial matters of contract works and should consult a senior contractor before coming for discussion. Reddy also refused to pay them any amount and left the lodge,” the inspector said.

Upset over this, the accused forced Reddy get into their car and drove away towards Saroornagar. They insisted that Reddy clear their dues. Cops tracked their movements following Swamy’s alert and arrested the accused, the inspector said.

The accused were produced before a magistrate and remanded in judicial custody.

Police escort Shiv Sena’s Devyani Dongaonkar to the meeting hall

AURANGABAD: The election to the Aurangabad Zilla Parishad president ’s post was postponed to Saturday after clashes over the number of votes both key candidates had received. One member had raised her hand twice, once in favour of each candidate.

Returning officer and additional collector Bhanudas Palwe said it had become difficult to count votes amid the commotion in the meeting hall and the process would be held afresh on Saturday. The election to the ZP vice president post would also be held on Saturday.

To a question whether the three ZP members, who were absent on Friday, would be allowed to cast their votes on Saturday, Palwe said the decision would also be taken on Saturday. There would be no change in the candidates for the president’s post, he said.

Three candidates were in the fray, including outgoing president Devyani Dongaonkar of Shiv Sena. She chose to contest the election putting the Shiv Sena in a fix. The BJP had fielded Anuradha Chavan, while Maha Vikas Aghadi nominee was Meena Shelke of Congress. Dongaonkar rebelled after Sena decided to support Shelke.

The BJP is the largest party in the 61-member ZP with 23 members, followed by Shiv Sena (17), Congress (16) and NCP (3) and a member each of Democratic Republican Party and MNS. On Friday, when the voting began, Dongaokar and Shelke received more than the share of their party’s votes each, indicating there was cross voting. Moreover, one member raised her hand twice leading to confusion, sources said.

Vice president of the state BJP, Bhagwat Karad, who was among those handling the zilla parishad election, claimed they had received a call from “Abdul Sattar (Sena minister) that his group of 14 members and BJP could contest the election together and win. We agreed,’’ he said.

“When the election started, one of ZP member raised her hands twice — for Dongaonkar and Shelke. We sought that either her vote be counted in the favour of our candidate or be declared invalid. We hope to wrest the president’s post from the Maha Vikas Aghadi,” said Karad.

Sena MLC Ambadas Danve, who was handling Sena affairs in the ZP president’s election, admitted that “Sattar’s support group in ZP did not vote in lines with Sena. We still hope to win the election on Saturday,” he said.

Sattar could not be contacted for his comment despite repeated attempts. The ZP premises had huge police deployment and they had to resort to mild lathicharge to rein in the supporters and enthusiasts from both the parties.

PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Friday reiterated that none should be worried about the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), even as he said that no one’s citizenship would be cancelled by the state through CAA . He was addressing the public meet at Azad Maidan, in Panaji.

Claiming that some forces in the state were creating fear among minority communities about the law, Sawant said Friday’s massive meeting showed that Hindus, Muslims and Christians support the CAA. “Do not spread fear among minorities,” he said.

Addressing the issue of Goans who have acquired Portuguese nationality, the chief minister said the CAA doesn’t take away citizenship, but offers it instead. “I want to tell our brothers and sisters who have acquired Portuguese nationality and want to take Indian citizenship that they should not fear. The process to acquire Indian citizenship has not changed,” he said. Transport minister Mauvin Godinho, who was among the speakers at the meeting, echoed the chief minister when he said that the CAA does not affect those who have acquired Portuguese citizenship.

Sawant further lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi for taking various decisions in the interest of the country over the past six months, which include abrogation of Article 370 and criminalisation of triple talaq.

“We have to come together to support Modi and show that we are with him,” the chief minister said. He went on to slam Congress, which had organised an anti-CAA rally in Panaji last month. “Hardly 500 people participated, and only one of five Congress MLAs was present. But today, Goans have come out in support of CAA by gathering in a large number from across the state,” he said.

COIMBATORE: The State government is planning to set up beehive fences along forest borders to deter wild elephants from raiding farmlands.

A pilot project will be implemented in the Coimbatore forest division at a cost of Rs 1.15 crore, district forest officer D Venkatesh said. “We have identified 29 tribal villages at Boluvampatti, Periyanaickenpalayam, Karamadai, Mettupalayam, Sirumugai and Coimbatore forest ranges for the project and have selected 200 tribal families for beekeeping ,” he told TOI.

The department will soon handover 10 beehive boxes to each family. “We have placed orders for 200 beehive boxes, which will be distributed in February. Following this, honeybees will be given to them,” the official said.

Farmers in Kenya in Africa had tried and tested the method. “Elephants are afraid of bees and the buzz of beehives. Presence of the hives will prevent the animals from entering into human habitations and agricultural fields,” he said. “The bee colonies will also help in pollination and will result in increased yield. Moreover, the tribal people can earn additional income by selling honey.”

Officials will monitor the pilot project for one year and assess its efficacy. “If the project is found to prevent crop-raiding elephants in the Coimbatore forest division, the state government will implement it in other districts,” Venkatesh added.

The rally culminated at Azad Maidan in the capital with a public meeting.“Looking at the massive crowd it is clear to me that the Goans are aware about issues of national interest,” he said.Clarifying misunderstandings about the new constitutional law, Nadda said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah had made provisions to give citizenship to those from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan who have fled to India due to religious persecution.The BJP working president said that Modi has taken decisions on issues that have been pending for the last 70 years, including the abrogation of Article 370 .On Congress’ stand on the CAA, Nadda said it was petty thinking on their part. “Rahul Gandhi should speak ten lines on CAA and explain his opposition in two lines,” he said, adding that it was unfortunate that a party like the Indian National Congress, which has a long history, should today have a leader like Gandhi.The opposition is asking what will happen if religious minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh come to India, but the fact is that these people are already in our country, Nadda said. “Now we are giving them citizenship,” he said, adding that the relief was being provided through the act.About extending the same relief to Muslims from these countries, he said that being Muslims in Islamic countries how was it possible that they were among the persecuted.On Article 370, he said that Kashmiris are happy with Modi’s decision and that it was only a few leaders who were unhappy as they will no longer be able to reap benefits of Article 370, among which is the non-applicability of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Now, inquiries will be conducted against the leaders of Jammu and Kashmir for corruption, which could mean that many of them could land in jail, Nadda said.“Also now in Jammu and Kashmir, there will be reservations for tribals.

The two were farm workers. “Farm owner Sakthi Shanmugam had contested the local body polls for the post of village panchayat councillor as an independent. As he was defeated, he, along with farm workers, consumed liquor at his farm. Later, all of them, except Perumalsamy, left for their houses,” the officer said.

Sakthivel, who was in an inebriated condition, called up Perumalsamy to enquire about a missing liquor bottle and scolded him badly. “When Perumalsamy told him that he hadn’t taken the bottle, Sakthivel reached the farmland and a heated argument broke out. In a fit of rage, Perumalsamy attacked Sakthivel with an iron rod, killing him on the spot,” the officer said.

Mamata Banerjee (file photo)

KOLKATA: Taking a dig at Narendra Modi for “talking all the time about Pakistan ”, Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Friday asked the PM if he was “a Pakistani ambassador”. She also questioned BJP’s constant use of Pakistan to silence its critics.

“Why do you always compare our country with Pakistan?” Mamata said, appearing to directly address PM Modi. “Don’t you feel ashamed comparing the world’s largest democracy with Pakistan all the time?”

She said it was time Modi and BJP stopped employing “Pakistan rhetoric” to silence political opponents. “He (Modi) talks about Pakistan all the time. Why? Is he their ambassador? We are interested in Hindustan. When someone asks for jobs, he says 'go to Pakistan'. You are India’s PM, but keep talking of Pakistan.”

Mamata's 4.5km march from Siliguri 's Mallaguri neighbourhood till Baghajatin Park to protest against CAA came 10 days after BJP held a rally here. Another anti-CAA rally in the hills is scheduled for January 22.

“The BJP government has made all of us feel insecure,” the CM said, alluding to the uncertainty among people over ""issues"" like the cut-off year and documents needed as proof of citizenship.

Mamata accused some Union ministers of adding to the confusion. “They are speaking in many voices on CAA, NPR and NRC. The purpose (of such talk) is to spread confusion and scare the people.”

On CAA, she said it was an attempt by the BJP government to “fool people who are already Indian citizens”.

“Haven’t you voted for so many years?” she asked the multi-ethnic and multi-religious gathering. “The Bengal government has already given legal recognition to refugee colonies. You already have an address. Now, the Union government wants you to produce your parents’ documents. Are you going to accept that?”

The CM then referred to the host of documents (voter’s ID, PAN, Aadhaar) that a citizen is required to link with bank accounts and mobile phone numbers. “They are now saying Aadhaar will not do, PAN will not do. What does the government want from us, a BJP amulet?” she said before urging the crowd to take an “anti-CAA-NRC pledge”.

360,['4/01/2020'],Nilgiris to face ‘blocks’ on going fully organic,"This story is from January 4, 2020

The ‘red’ and ‘blue’ labels denote that the chemical combinations are highly toxic

UDHAGAMANDALAM: Members of Nilgiri Potato and Vegetable Growers’ Association (NPVGA) on Friday unveiled their plans to hold a rally on Tuesday (January 7), opposing the district administration’s decision to impose ban on pesticides and weedicides bearing ‘red’ and ‘blue’ labels with effective from March 31, 2020, as part of its efforts to make the Nilgiris an organic district. The ‘red’ and ‘blue’ labels denote that the chemical combinations are highly toxic.

C Gopal, joint secretary, NPVGA, said farming would be hit very badly in the Nilgiris if pesticides and weedicides are not used. “There has been no adverse report of using these chemicals in farming. We are using only the pesticides and weedicides permitted by the government.”

He said the government should first prove that organic farming is profitable and sustainable at its farms in the district.

“There has been no adverse report on our farm produces. Considering the interest of the farmers, we will take out a rally in Ooty on January 7, condemning the district administration’s move,” Gopal said.

Shiva Subramaniam Samraj, joint director of Horticulture , told TOI that the decision was taken after conducting a farmers’ meet. “But it is yet to be notified. A draft in this connection has been sent to all the panchayats. Only after they pass resolutions supporting the same, it could be notified at the district level or a proposal will be sent to the government,” he said.

Shivakumar, a resident of Thambatty village and president of Nilgiris Organic Farmers Association, said it was encouraging to see farmers gradually switching to organic farming in the district. “It is not a difficult task. We are just trying to adopt what our grandfathers did.”

According to him, organic farming could be adopted easily by employing biotechnology . The only thing, he said, was the farmland would take some time, say a year, to go organic.

“Pests will be repelled in due course by the farming methodology. Without weeds there is no organic farming. The right way of managing weeds will yield natural manure to the farming land,” Shivakumar said.

Pointing out that there were lots of remedies in organic farming method, he said the farmers should have patience in the initial period.

“A meeting of farmers and dealers of pesticides and weedicides was held recently by the horticulture department and the district administration to discuss the way ahead,” he confirmed.

Hyderabad: Months after the arrest of a couple from New Delhi for duping a sepoy leading to his suicide, police arrested another man in connection with the case.

Kushal Pal Singh, the managing director of Dealsothon Online, the e-commerce website which duped the sepoy, allegedly colluded with the duo to cheat Vilas Madhukar Sundarde of Rs 90,000.

He purchased products through Dealsothon. When he did not receive the products, he contacted the portal and was told that he had won a car in a lottery as also other expensive gifts and was convinced to deposit Rs 90,000 towards registration fees and other charges to claim the prize.

The sepoy, who couldn’t cough up the money on his own, borrowed from friends and family to pay the portal, but received no response from the accused after the transaction was done. Sundarde slumped into depression after repeated attempts in vain to reach out to the accused. TNN

City corporation was placed 31st with 903.3 marks out of 2000 in the first quarter, it’s ranking slipped to 34... Read More

COIMBATORE: The city is gearing up for the annual Swachh Survekshan (cleanliness survey). A team appointed by the Union housing and urban affairs ministry would inspect the city between January 4 and 31 and scrutinize the cleanliness based on various parameters.

Last year, the city had plunged in its cleanliness ranking to 40 from 16 in 2018. Subsequently, the city corporation had taken several initiatives to improve the ranking. In one such initiative, the civic body had appointed more than 100 Swachh Bharath ambassadors across the city to create awareness on source segregation among the public and help achieve 100% source segregation in the city.

But things have not gone as expected for the city corporation and its performance in the first two quarters didn’t offer anything to cheer about. The city falls under greater than 10 lakh population category.

While the city corporation was placed 31st with 903.3 marks out of 2000 in the first quarter, it’s ranking slipped to 34 in the second quarter despite securing 952 marks out of 2000.

“Though the city corporation has implemented door-to-door collection in most of the areas, it could not implement it in a full-fledged manner. For example, if an area has 5,000 households, door-to-door collection is implemented only in three-fourth of the households. It is one of the major challenges,” said a source with the civic body.

C Nithya, a resident of Peelamedu , said, “Garbage carts remain uncleared for days together in most of the areas. As the days pass, garbage would start to overflow and cover the road. The city corporation takes steps to clear the garbage only when the situation becomes worse.”

The central government team has been continuously monitoring the performance of the cities in cleanliness front . The cities are evaluated for 2000 marks in three quarters - April to June, July to September and October to December. The evaluation would be carried out based on monthly updation that is done by city corporation officials and the feedback from the public. The marks obtained in the quarters are crucial because 25% weightage is given to the assessments in the annual survey.

Panaji: MGP on Friday said that electronic dance music festivals should be banned in the state as there is drug consumption during the festival and the government should order an inquiry into drugs.

MGP president Pandurang Dhavalikar further criticised the state government over its failure to resolve the Mhadei issue. “We have not joined the Mhadei agitation, but now we have decided to hold one-day dharna at Satrem,” he said. The protest date will be announced on January 11, he said.

While the regional party has resolved to withdraw support to the BJP government in the state, it has not sent a letter to the governor as it is not required.

The Centre has misguided the people of Goa over the Mhadei issue, the MGP president told reporters. Dhavalikar said that MGP will launch an agitation across the state, especially in the north, to create awareness about the importance of Mhadei for the state. He said BJP is trying to put the Mhadei issue on backseat by raising other issues.

On the state government’s decision to waive off 50% road tax on new vehicles, Dhavalikar said after the exemption of road tax, the government earned a revenue of Rs 52 crore, but in the previous quarter the revenue was Rs 48 crore. “Why did the government take this decision? Only to generate Rs 4 crore more? If there was no exemption then the government would have generated an additional Rs 52 crore,” he said.

Milk prices have gone up, but there is no subsidy for this essential commodity for children, he said. If the government gives subsidy to KTC to make travel affordable, then why not for milk, the MGP president said.

Dhavalikar further said people should support the regional party as national parties have destroyed Goa.

A five-member committee will be constituted on January 11 to review the party constitution and the committee will give a report within two months, the MGP president said.

KERI: Pissurlem residents are attempting to revive agriculture and horticulture, after a prolonged livelihood-struggle brought about by the ban on mining in Goa. Zonal agricultural officer Prakash Raut along with Parag Ranganekar of the Mineral Foundation, recently conducted a field visit to the village to assess the possibility of reviving agriculture here.

Located in Sattari taluka, the area has been affected by pollution due to decades of mining. After the closure of mining for two years (2017 to 2019) some villagers received compensation for the loss of their agriculture from mining activities. However, even as of now, 150 farmers have not received the said compensation.

Drinking water has also been a problem for the villagers. A PIL in the matter was filed before the Goa bench of the Bombay High Court by Hanuman Parab with the help of an NGO called Goa Foundation. Accordingly, the court has given directives for the supply of clean drinking water to villagers.

About 80 acres of agricultural fields are lying vacant in need of irrigation facilities for reviving agriculture. Parab told TOI, “Our village is predominantly agricultural but with the onset of mining activities, the natural sources of drinking as well as irrigation water have been degraded. Streams, nullahs providing water have been silted. Aquifers have been diverted and wells also are affected,” he said.

“The villagers want to revive agriculture and hence we have submitted a memorandum to the chief minister for resolving problems of drinking as well as irrigation water,” he said. In July 2019, the villagers of Pissurlem had submitted memorandum to chief minister Pramod Sawant, who had assured the residents of solving the irrigation issues and other hurdles coming in the way of reviving agriculture and horticulture.

Parab also said that a large quantum of water was available in mining pits. “The government has to release this water for irrigation and for drinking water treatment plant at the earliest,” he said.

Earlier, the mamlatdar of Sattari Anil Rane Sardesai had suggested the setting-up of a water treatment plant in the area, following an enquiry conducted through the talathi of Pissurlem. The enquiry had revealed that the land under survey — Vagurem of Sattari —belonged to Goa government, admeasuring an area of 96,800 sq mtrs out of which 17,000 sq mtrs could be proposed for the water treatment plant, Sardesai had said.

POINGUINIM: As glass waste continues to inconvenience walkers and two-wheeler commuters along the new bypass road from Char Rasta to Mashem, panchayats and municipalities are attempting to take necessary steps to solve this problem.

Authorities have begun to collect glass trash , bottles, cups, saucers, bulbs and tubelights among other waste found on the road.

Morning-walkers told TOI how broken glass bottles pose a daily hazard. According to them, some people are responsible; those in cars who stop in the area to have drinks and leave their bottles behind. The bottles are then broken after being crushed by ongoing vehicles.

“The situation is equally dangerous on beaches, where tourists get drunk and fail to dispose off their bottles properly,” says Krishna Dhuri. Senior citizens say the government should be tough with law breakers to lessen the troubles of the residents.

ERODE: For 37-year-old Sathish Kumar , of Thalakulam Erikkarai panchayat , who contested the councillor post to Bhavani panchayat union ward 3 as an independent, his opponent’s life was more important than the election results.

He didn’t think twice to rush to the rescue of AIADMK candidate Ramalingam as he collapsed at the Bhavani government boys’ higher secondary school, where vote counting was on, in the early hours of Friday. Doctors said it was a case of mild cardiac arrest.

According to a booth official, Sathish Kumar was slightly ahead of Ramalingam at the end of vote counting on Thursday evening. While Ramalingam secured only 1,352 votes, Sathish Kumar had polled 1,359 votes.

Citing the low margin of seven votes, Ramalingam requested the booth officials for recounting. Accepting his plea, the officials commenced recounting the same night. It lasted until Friday morning.

Around 12.30am, Ramalingam, who looked tensed since Thursday evening, suddenly collapsed on the floor. While others were trying to figure out what was happening, Sathish Kumar suddenly gave him first aid. “He also performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on Ramalingam,” T Sivakumar , one of the booth agents, said.

Sathish Kumar and his supporters immediately alerted the 108 ambulance service and rushed him to a nearby government hospital. Doctors, who examined Ramalingam, said his condition was stable.

Supporters of Ramalingam and others, meanwhile, appreciated Sathish Kumar for his timely act to save the life of his opponent candidate.

Home minister Amit Shah , in an interview to a news channel on Thursday, had, while refusing to comment on whether a ban on PFI was on the cards, said that the UP police, Assam police and a few other states had established the role of PFI in the violence that erupted during the recent anti-CAA stir.

Last month, UP police arrested at least 14 PFI activists for allegedly instigating violence in the state while Assam Police picked up PFI state unit chief Aminul Hoque and Mohammad Muzammil Hoque, the press secretary of the outfit, for allegedly fanning violence in Guwahati. PFI has rubbished the police’s allegations linking it to violent anti-CAA protests and argues that the proposed ban was an effort to suppress “one of the largest agitations since Independence.”

Alappuzha: Bharat Dharma Jana Sena ( BDJS ) general secretary Subash Vasu referred to the family of SNDP Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan as ‘ Dracula , who sucked the blood of Ezhava people’. Addressing the media in Kayamkulam on Friday, Vasu claimed that Natesan and his son plundered the funds of SNDP Yogam.

“Natesan has cheated Ezhava community. I cannot treat such a person as a great man. I will try my best to remove Vellappally and his family from the Yogam’s leadership. The source of his income should be examined,” he said.

Vasu claimed that he is the founding president of BDJS and the existing president of BDJS, an ally of NDA. “BDJS is the political arm of SNDP Yogam. Natesan joined hands with CPM for the victory of its candidates in Lok Sabha and assembly byelections,” he said, adding that even Thushar had cheated NDA.

Vasu alleged that members of Natesan’s family were involved in several murders and that the family had a flat in Macau, China. He also claimed that his life is under threat. Vasu added that he will hold a joint press conference with former DGP TP Senkumar at Thiruvananthapuram on January 16 with more revelations against the Vellappally family.

Meanwhile, Thushar said that BDJS state council will seek an explanation from Vasu for indulging in anti-party activities. Thushar claimed that Vasu had cheated SNDP Yogam and BDJS. “Vasu is levelling baseless allegations after his illegal financial activities came out. We have given him 15 days to give an explanation. If it is unsatisfactory, the party will act,” he said. Thushar said Vasu was unfit to continue as the chairman of spices board.

After SNDP Yogam dissolved its Mavelikara Union, Vasu and his supporters have decided to start an agitation against the Yogam’s leadership.

Cricketer Rohit Sharma with members of Heartfulness Institute, Kanha Shantivanam, on the outskirts of Hyderaba... Read More

Hyderabad: Far away from the maddening crowd and nestled amidst luxurious vegetation spread over 1400 acres, the Heartfulness Institute is indeed a getaway from stress and pressures of life. But even amidst the tranquillity there needs to be some recreation and fun. And what better way to have it than to take part in sporting activities.

On Friday, Team India vice-captain Rohit Sharma laid the foundation stone for a cricket stadium and training centre to be used by the students of the Heartfulness Learning Centre at Kanha Shantivanam in Chegur on the outskirts of the city. Though Rohit turned up an hour late for the ceremony, the students and inmates of the Institute waited patiently for him thereby proving that meditation sessions equipped them well to weather the wait.

It was a very short ceremony with the star batsman and his wife Ritika laying the foundation stone in the presence of spiritual master Kamlesh Patel (better known as Daaji). Daaji announced that the stadium — 138 metres in diameter with all modern facilities — would be called the Rohit Stadium.

“It’s a great honour to have Rohit in our midst. Any other star player would have asked us how much we can pay him for laying the foundation stone but Rohit was more than glad to come down and spend time with us,” Daaji said. Rohit, who has been rested from the Sri Lanka series, flew down to the city in the morning to spend time at the Institute and learn about Heartfulness Meditation practices from Daaji. The star batsman took part in a meditation session conducted by Daaji.

“As soon as I entered Kanha Shantivanam I felt an environment of positivity. It’s very true when you are close to nature there is so much positivity and meditation is more impactful. My experience with heartfulness meditation has been amazing. I felt so light and so positive. There is so much negativity around and we need to increase positivity and meditation can certainly help,” Rohit said after the session.

“I want to bring some of my teammates to this place — one as a pristine getaway — and two as a place for meditation. With meditation one can stay in the game and make the right decision. It is very important to be in the zone. That’s the message that I want to send across,” he said.

“Rohit, like all great achievers in the world, is an example of what the human mind is capable of doing when it becomes focussed. I am confident that some of students of Heartfulness Learning Centre would one day emulate his feats,” Daaji said. The Kanha Shantivanam focuses on research and learning.

Repair works underway at a section of Flower Range in New Market

KOLKATA: Acting promptly on a mishap that occurred four days ago at Gol Ghar in New Market , Kolkata Municipal Corporation ( KMC ) on Friday served notices to illegal occupants of the heritage market, asking them to vacate its terrace without any delay.

On December 30, a seven-year-old girl had fallen through the ceiling from the market’s terrace and landed on the ground floor of Gol Ghar, a space inside the old complex of New Market. The girl, however, survived the accident.

A TOI report on Friday highlighted the sorry state of maintenance in several blocks of the century-old market. The report also focussed on the danger being posed by illegal occupants who stay in huts constructed on the terrace. A senior official in KMC market department said an inspection by a group of civic officials from civil engineering and market departments revealed that the makeshift shelters constructed illegally are posing a threat to the 145-year-old heritage structure.

“What we saw there during the inspection made us nervous. A large portion of the terrace has been taken over by illegal occupants who built makeshift shelters for them and their pets. We are frightened as extra load will make the entire structure of the century-old market building vulnerable. We have issued notices to the occupants to vacate the terrace at the earliest,” said the the civic official.

The KMC market department has decided to fence the damaged ceiling with permanent nets to prevent untoward accidents in the future. Besides, the civic body will conduct a massive repair work in the blocks, which have been vulnerable so far as the structural safety is concerned.

“We have started repairing the meat corner and a portion of flower range. The rest of the portion of the flower range and its adjacent block need to be repaired without delay,” said a KMC market department official.

However, final restoration of the entire market will depend on a detailed survey to be conducted by a firm, added the civic official. Uday Sahoo, general-secretary of S S Hogg Market Traders Association, said it was imperative for the KMC to adopt a permanent maintenance policy for the heritage market.

GURUGRAM: The body of a nine-year-old boy, naked and with injury marks on the head and other parts, was found in Manesar ’s Naharpur village on Friday evening, around 24 hours after he had gone missing from his house.

“Prima facie, there is no sign of the sexual assault but it can be ruled out only after the post-mortem,” said DCP (Manesar) Rajesh Singh. The nature of the injuries suggests the boy might have been put through a black magic ritual, a police officer said.

The body lay in a vacant plot, barely 300 metres from the house of the victim. It was found during a combing operation of the area after police mounted a search. The boy had gone missing on Thursday evening. His parents thought he might have gone to a relative’s place.

“Relatives of the family live in the same locality and he would often go to their houses. On Thursday, he was seen playing near the house of his uncle. The parents started a search late night and informed police around 1am on Friday,” said the police officer.

Police have found CCTV footage from a camera installed on a premises near the boy’s house that shows him walking with a man. “The face of this person is not clear. But it seems the child was familiar with him and the person was familiar with the area,” said Singh.

Police have formed two teams to investigate. A case has been registered on the complaint of the boy’s father under Section 302 (murder) at Manesar police station.

Indian Civil Liberties Union members provide legal help to people in Assam

LUCKNOW: His attire grabbed everyone’s attention on his wedding on Friday evening. But for Yusuf Safwi — a young lawyer at Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court — duty comes first. Throughout the ceremony, his phone kept buzzing with calls from families in distress. Safwi is a member of the Indian Civil Liberties Union (ICLU), a network of lawyers and paralegals who are helping families of those detained and arrested following violence during protests against the new citizenship law in Uttar Pradesh , including Lucknow, and across the country.

“Since December 19, we have not been able to keep track of calls from families in anguish,” Safwi told TOI. “People have no idea how to proceed legally. Everything’s blur for them. We started with giving free legal advice to those who wants us to represent them in courts,” he added.

A fifth year student of the Dr Ram Manohar Lohia National Law University (RMLNLU) in Lucknow, Mayanak Gaurav has also been a busy volunteer giving legal aid.

“Poor families, which are uneducated and have no legal knowledge, have been calling us everyday for help. Providing best information possible, I am then relaying them to practising advocates,” he said. “A number of students have volunteered in their personal capacity to provide legal help to such families,” he added.

With a network of young lawyers in an average age of mid-twenties, Supreme Court lawyer from Lucknow Anas Tanwir has also been streamlining legal aid for these families. “Arrest with no information given to families along with internet shutdown compounded their woes,” he said.

“A woman came to us one day claiming her son-in-law was picked up by police on December 19. When her son went to inquire about him, he too was arrested. She wanted a legal help, but then developed a cold feet due to fear. Finally, she did go for a bail application but the fear factor is still very high in poor uneducated families,” Anas added.

381,['4/01/2020'],Gorewada’s daily wagers go on ‘strike’ over contract,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Nagpur: Staffers at the Gorewada Rescue Centre were overburdened on Friday as they had to take on the workload of almost 40 daily wagers, who went on an impromptu strike over the new contract system being implemented there.

These daily wagers handle work such as clearing grass, weeds, patrolling, feeding animals, fire fighting etc and are opposing the shift of their employment terms to a new contract system under a private firm. TOI had reported about trouble brewing over the contract issue at Gorewada on January 1 itself as the Bhartiya Janta Kamgar Mahasangh (BJKM) strongly objected to the new system.

RS Kanojia, secretary of BJKM, said, “Though forest officials may call this a strike, it is more of a case of these labourers being prevented from working. To start work today, they were asked to submit various documents and come under the fold of a new contract system which will harm them in the long run. It is sad that forest officials are not ready to discuss the issue further, which has led to a stalemate now.”

He added that the only way forward was to keep the existing pool of labourers out of the new contract system. “Let them hire as many new people as possible under the contract system, we have no objection. But for the current daily wagers, maintain status quo,” said Kanojia.

Despite the shortage of daily wagers, forest officials were able to complete most of the routine work by redistributing tasks. But even they know that this can’t be dragged on for a prolonged period.

Nandkishore Kale, divisional manager of Gorewada International Zoo, said his department is ready for talks with all stakeholders. “We want them to come back to work as this contract system is beneficial in more ways than one. First, their salary increases by over 10%, they get a minimum 11 month employment stint as compared to the existing three, there is also a possible year-end bonus along with branded uniforms,” said Kale.

He said the fears in the minds of daily wagers were unfounded. “We want them to have a more stable employment and higher pay scale, which is why the contract system was introduced. Already four or five daily wagers have resumed work and I am confident that the others will come around too,” said Kanojia.

In the meantime, members of Congress-affiliated Unorganized Workers’ Congress, too, approached forest officials seeking priority to locals for all jobs. Dr Mangesh Mendhe, who had accompanied the delegation, said, “Vidarbha candidates must be given preference in all job openings at Gorewada,” said Dr Mendhe.

According to Kathiroor SI Dileep Balakkandi, they conducted the raid on the basis of a tip-off and the bombs were found inside the bush near Kunduchira dam . “The bombs were kept in such a manner that nobody would suspect it,” said the police.

In recent times, the political tension have come down considerably and hence the recovery of the bombs is taken very seriously by the police.

Kozhikode: Unlawful Activities Prevention Act was amended to pave the way for the formation of Hindu Rashtra, said social activist and writer Azad. He was speaking at a dharna organised by the mothers of Allan Shuhaib and Thwaha Fasal against the arrest of the two over alleged Maoist links.

“The word urban Naxalites was coined to silence the activists and writers who would speak against the anti-Muslim actions such as the abrogation of the Article 370 and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA),” he said.

He added that neither the police nor the government gave any explanation on the crime committed by the two youths. “There was no Maoist action in Kozhikode prior to the arrest. Supreme Court and high courts have made it amply clear that sharing an ideology does not constitute a crime,” he said adding that more mothers wanted to join the protest but they were dissuaded by the atmosphere of fear created by the police. Writer and activist P Geetha, who also took part in the protest, said the LDF government was not for the CPM alone and it owes an explanation to all the mothers in Kerala on why Allan and Thwaha were arrested.

“CM Pinarayi Vijayan knows the experience of staying in jail as he was a prisoner during Emergency. He knows very well how one’s freedom will be curtailed in a prison. We are supporters of the LDF government and we would like to know who put pressure on the government to arrest the youths,” she said.

Lucknow University

LUCKNOW: Lucknow University authorities on Friday accepted that sanctity of examinations was compromised due to leakage of LLB (semester III) question papers and cancelled all four examinations held on or before December 11.

LU also announced the fresh examination schedule which has been uploaded on the university’s website. Papers will be held between January 9 and 24.

The decision was based on the report of three-member inquiry committee which probed the leak after audio clips of two law teachers with a woman student went viral on December 11.

LU spokesman Sanjay Medhavi said after threadbare discussion on findings and recommendations of the inquiry committee report on Friday, it was decided that all examinations of LLB (semester III) held on and before December 11 should be cancelled.

“During inquiry, we found over 40% questions matched with the original paper which amounted to compromising with the sanctity of examinations. Hence, we recommended cancellation of examinations,” a member of probe committee said.

INDORE: Aiming to boost air quality by keeping a lid on air pollutants, oil companies have geared up to roll out Bharat Stage (BS) VI compliant fuel in the state from March 1, a month in advance of the government fixed deadline of April 2020.

Oil companies have already started building stocks of the upgraded fuel that has low Sulphur content ahead of the fast-approaching countrywide deadline while many fuel stations will start getting supplies from February depending upon the stocks and requirement.

A senior official from an oil company at a depot at Indore wishing not to be quoted said, “We have already started building up stocks of the upgraded fuel and exhausting old stocks to completely switch to the upgraded version of fuel that has significantly low Sulphur content. We have one tank full of new fuel while others are getting exhausted.”

In Indore, four major oil companies including Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, Indian Oil Corporation Limited and Essar Oil LTD supplies fuel to pump stations across Indore division including Dewas and Ujjain.

Another senior executive from an oil company posted at Indore said, “We are in the process of ending BSIV stocks and hoping to clear old stocks by the end of January. Most likely we will be in a position to supply to fuel stations in February itself.”

Once the dispatch of upgraded fuel will start, oil companies will commence sampling and testing of fuel products at pump stations as a pilot run to check the purity and availability of product in the market for consumers.

Supply of BS-VI has already commenced in phases across many Indian states with Delhi switching to the clean fuel long back in 2018.

Dr DK Wagela, chief chemist and lab head at the Regional Pollution Control Board said, “We hope to see a major reduction in pollution levels with the usage of upgraded fuel as these emission norms are set to get stricter. Non-BS VI compliant vehicles will also get result but car’s tailpipe emissions will match BS6 standards only if both the engine and fuel meet BS6 standards.”

With the roll out of upgraded fuel, numbers of PUC centers will also be increased for better checks and monitoring, according to the Pollution Control Board.

Indore has close to 265 fuel stations of which just about 10 have the PUC check centers while the rest 54 PUC’s are mobile that roams in the city throughout the day, according to data from the Regional Transport Office and district administration.

387,['4/01/2020'],No exclusions at this anti-CAA protest,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Protest march from Mandi House to Jantar Mantar against CAA, NRC and NPR in New Delhi.

NEW DELHI: Shabnam Khan, Khushboo Devi, Bhaguni Devi and Lakshay formed a motley group, the first a teenaged student, the second a social worker, the third a senior citizen and the fourth an 18-year-old who identifies as a queer person. The common impetus to their taking to the street on Friday morning was their feeling of insecurity and disquiet engendered by the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register for Citizens.

The march in central Delhi, from Mandi House to Jantar Mantar, saw the participation of women, trans people and members of the sexual minorities. Friday was particularly significant, being the 189th birth anniversary of social reformer and educationist Savitribai Phule, whose name the marchers invoked.

Khan, 18, arrived for the march from Jaitpur in south Delhi. She held on to a huge red banner that bore poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s emblematic words in bright yellow: “Bol, ke lab aazad hai tere (Speak, for your lips are free)”. The youngster said, “It is not just about us, but about the Constitution of India. I did not understand things earlier, but this government and CAA has taught us about politics.”

Khusboo Devi, 32, a resident of Malkaganj in north Delhi, feared that the fabric of the country was tearing apart. “We will worry about the citizenship documents if the time comes,” she said combatively, “but now is time for everyone to realise that the government is trying to divide us. They are trying to provoke a Hindu-Muslim fight.” She described Friday’s march as a statement of harmony and unity.

Bhaguni Devi, 60, had a more personal ground for anxiety. The Malviya Nagar resident asked, “Us zamane mein kaun birth certificate banata tha (Who got birth certificates made in those days)?” She migrated to Delhi from a Varanasi village decades ago and quelled her fears by loudly shouting, “Inquilab ki naro se” in response to the slogan “Chappa chappa gunj uthega”.

Lakshay, who bunked his class to be there, was glad for the opportunity to speak against inequality. “We are never ever treated equally anyway,” the teenager began. “But now everyone has stopped feeling safe and equal in this country.”

For Lakshay and others of his ilk, for instance Pavel, who likes to be identified as non-binary female, CAA had brought up the sensitive issue of identity. Pavel, a Manipuri who lives in south Delhi’s Khirki, said, “Queer people face violent non-acceptance in their families and frequently leave home without documents. Our identity is different and we don’t have papers.”

Under the banner of Northeast Unites for Justice and Peace, students of north-east India also marched in protest. Reena N, a JNU student, reasoned, “Indigenous identities and rights have to be highlighted in the protest against CAA.”

Indore: As many as 375 senior doctors and faculty of Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College submitted their resignations to dean through office of head of department on the call of Madhya Pradesh State Medical Teachers Association. The doctors also threatened to go on strike from January 9 if their demands are not fulfilled.

The doctors gave mass resignation to protest against delay in implementation of 7th central pay commission and time-bound promotions to medical fraternity.

Dean in charge Dr KK Arora said, “We have received resignations of senior doctors and faculty from HoDs of more than a dozen departments.” There are 19 departments in the MGMMC.

“The doctors will go on strike from January 9 if government fails to fulfil their demands. Even if they go on strike, emergency services will continue. We are also in touch with CMHO and joint director for health services for temporary arrangement to run the medical college in case of strike,” said Arora.

Junior and senior resident doctors and medical officer of health department will remain on work even in case of strike, Arora said.

Two days ago, the senior doctors and faculty submitted their resignation to head of department in MGMMC.

MP Medical teachers association secretary Dr Rahul Rokade said, “All other departments are getting benefits of seventh pay commission from 2016, except medical education department.”

In its ‘Vachan Patra’, Congress had promised to extend benefits of seventh pay commission within three months of forming government. But nothing has happened even after a year, he added.

On Friday, Indore chapter of MP State Medical Teachers association demanded time from CM Kamal Nath to discuss the issue with him. But, the CM told it meet chief secretary.

There are 3300 senior doctors in 13 medical colleges in the state and they will go on strike from January 9.

Delhi police commissioner Amulya Patnaik

NEW DELHI: With Delhi elections likely to be announced next week, police commissioner Amulya Patnaik is expected to be given an extension till the polls are over , sources said.

Patnaik’s term is set to end on January 31, around the time elections will be held in Delhi. As there will be a code of conduct in force at that time, a police chief is not likely to be replaced without the permission of the Election Commission of India .

If a nod for the extension is given by the Union ministry of home affairs, the file will be forwarded to the appointments committee of the cabinet for approval. The extension can range from one to three months, said a source at Police Headquarters adding that the decision is likely to go in favour of Patnaik as he has been heading the force for the past three years and a new person would take some time to take stock of the situation.

The Election Commission has already started meetings with Delhi Police about the security arrangements during the election especially in the wake of anti-CAA riots.

Among the frontrunners to replace Patnaik are 1987-batch officer Mohammed Taj Hasan, S B K Singh (1988), Balaji Shrivastav (1988) and Sandeep Goyal from the 1989 batch.

391,['4/01/2020'],"‘Ignored’ by Indore officials, Vijayvargiya erupts in anger","This story is from January 4, 2020

Indore: BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya on Friday took strong exception to local officers allegedly ‘ignoring’ a meeting called by BJP leaders over the ongoing crackdown on illegal structures in Indore.

“We will not tolerate this. Our Sangh functionaries are here (in Indore), otherwise aaj main Indore me aag laga deta,” a furious Vijayvargiya is heard telling additional district magistrate BBS Tomar on video.

Vijayvargiya, along with local MP Shankar Lalwani, three MLAs and hundreds of BJP workers gathered at Residency Kothi to protest against demolitions being carried out as part of a statewide clean-up operation ordered by CM Kamal Nath.

BJP alleges that the drive is targeted at its leaders, while Congress counterparts are being spared by officials.

The BJP local unit had written to divisional commissioner Akash Tripathi, district collector Lokesh Jatav, DIG Ruchi Vardhan Mishra and Indore Municipal Corporation’s Asheesh Singh for a meeting over the demolitions. While the municipal commissioner replied to the BJP request and excused himself from the meeting.

The rest did not respond, claimed Vijayvargiya, adding that officers should keep in mind that they are public servants and should follow protocol. “Officials don’t have time to meet us. They have grown so big? Is this their stature? We had asked for the meeting in writing. Are they public servants or working for Kamal Nath?” he said.

The senior BJP leader later told reporters that it was not a good thing for democracy. “Today, I am returning after tying a knot (taking a pledge). In my life, I have never borne disrespect. It’s disrespect of BJP by the officials and we will answer it at an appropriate time,” he warned.

ADM Tomar said, “A gathering of more than five persons without permission here is banned under Section 144 CrPC and BJP had not taken permission to stage a dharna outside the divisional commissioner’s residence. We have asked senior officials, who were present on the spot, to register a case under Section 188 IPC against everyone who violated the order. This includes senior leaders.”

Congress reacted sharply, with PCC media coordinator Narendra Saluja saying, “BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya’s statement ‘to put Indore on fire’ is objectionable and condemnable, and the party should take action against him. By saying this, Vijayvargiya has shown his party’s ideology. There is, however, the ‘Singham’ Kamal Nath government and nobody can put this city on fire.”

“Vijayvargiya is BJP in-charge of West Bengal and whenever he visits that state, violence is reported there. Now, we can understand this from his statement,” he added.

Nearly 5,000 cows and 1 ,500 bulls were caught over the past year and taken to shelters, but rest are still roaming free.Residents complain 1,500-odd stray cows and bulls are causing traffic jams and accidents and are littering roads and attacking people. In 2019, six people died in conflict with stray bovine animals while there were 19 cases when cows and bulls caused injuries. On May 27, for instance, 12 mourners sustained grievous injuries when a bull ran amok in Saadatganj, targeting a procession commemorating the martyrdom of Hazrat Ali.TOI on Friday found stray cattle in Gomtinagar, Jankipuram, Chowk, Thakurganj, Mahanagar, Raqabganj and Nishtaganj, and faced a volley of complaints against LMC.“I was attacked by bull the other day. My bag acted as a buffer and I was spared injuries,” said Isha Singh, a student from Vineet Khand, Gomtinagar. At Raqabganj, homemaker Madhu Singh said, “We don’t allow our kids to play on road or ride bicycles. There have been a couple of stray cattle attacks on children in the past.” Rajesh Singh of Nishatganj complained that the stray animals defecated on the road or foraged for food in garbage piles to create an unhygienic environment.Amit Sehgal of Jeev Ashraya pointed out that constant man-animal conflict was not healthy for the cattle either. “Stray cattle often gather around garbage vats in Rani Laxmi Bai Marg area to look for food,” Sehgal said, adding that feeding on plastic remains could be fatal for the animals too.Chief veterinary officer of LMC Arvind Rao said their cattle squads were active. “Around 5,000 cows were caught in 2019.

File photo of Andhra Pradesh CM YS Jaganmohan Reddy

Hyderabad: Principal Special Judge BR Madhusudan Rao of CBI courts on Friday directed Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy and YSRC MP Vijayasai Reddy to appear before the court on January 10 in the quid pro quo case filed by CBI against them. The judge gave this order while resuming hearing in the 11 chargesheets filed in the case.

While Jaganmohan Reddy was shown as accused number one, his auditor Vijayasai was shown as accused number 2 in all the cases. Though they have been appearing before the court every Friday, the frequency of their appearances reduced in the run up to the AP assembly polls from March 2019. In fact, after their political party rose to power in AP after the elections in May 2019, Jagan did not appear before the court. He has been citing his preoccupation with his work as chief minister of AP, and has been urging the court to dispense with his appearance.

The judge, too, was allowing his pleas all these weeks. When similar applications were filed on this Friday too, the judge, while allowing them for this week, however, made it clear that they have to appear before the court for the next hearing that is slated to be held on January 10. If they fail to appear on that day, then this court would pass appropriate orders, the judge warned.

It can be recalled that both the CBI court and the high court had earlier refused to accord blanket exemption to Jaganmohan from court appearances, when he sought the permission to allow his advocate to represent him. The HC at that time said that Jaganmohan can file application whenever he finds it difficult to appear before the court, and the trial court will consider them on merits.

However, it has become extremely difficult for him to spare time to appear before a Hyderabad court due to his busy schedule as AP CM, his counsel said in the past while urging the court to allow him to be represented by a counsel under Section 205 of CrPC. The court however rejected it.

The case of the CBI in all the 11 chargesheets is that former AP CM YS Rajasekhara Reddy was influenced by his son Jaganmohan to favour certain industrial houses and businessmen with liberal allotments of land, mines and concessions during the former’s regime between 2004 and 2009.

NEW DELHI: With vibrant street art, community singing sessions, witty placards and a massive march to Shaheen Bagh, the “Jamia protest” entered its 22nd day on Friday. And there were no signs of it losing any steam.

Despite Thursday’s rumours about the protest at Shaheen Bagh being called off, more than a thousand people took part in a candle march to express their solidarity with the local residents, a large number of them being women. They have been staying in pitched tents on the carriageway from Sarita Vihar to Noida for over a fortnight now.

Even as the slogans of aazadi and inquilab rent the air, more residents kept on joining the students’ march, which reached the protest site at 8.15pm.

The women’s protest at Shaheen Bagh against the Citizenship Amendment Act, which started on December 15 with 50 local residents blocking the traffic, has attracted nationwide attention.

“We citizens have elected this government with our voter ID cards. If they can’t accept our identity then why should we accept them as our government?” asked Tahira, a protester.

On the half a kilometre-long stretch from Holy Family Hospital up to the mausoleum of Dr Zakir Hussain, vendors can now be seen selling “protest merchandise” with themes of the tricolour and the Constitution.

Mohammad Hammad (17) said that he was selling national flags for the last six days. “From a simple paper placard to inflated balloons, I have everything but the tricolour is all what people want,” he added.

Meanwhile, the cordoned-off section of the “protest street” near Jamia Millia Islamia witnessed peaceful gatherings after the jumma payers.

Imam Suleman Nadwi appealed for peaceful expression of dissent while delivering his Friday afternoon sermon from a mosque near Jamia.

Intekhab Alam, a Batla House resident, said that while protests have become increasingly peaceful he is worried about the news coming from Uttar Pradesh . “Innocent poor people are being given penalty notices. Have there been no protests earlier in India during which public property was damaged?” he asked.

Around 3.15pm, arguments could be heard over the use of religious slogans at Shaheen Bagh. “The attack is being carried out on our citizenship and it is not an attack on Islam. Let’s not use such slogans and placards,” one of the speakers appealed and the crowd cooperated.

The Namaz-e-janaza, or funeral prayers, was read for the people who had passed away during the anti-CAA protests.

Mohammad Raees Idris, a participant, said that it is shameful for democracy that even after so many days no one from the government has tried to approach the protesters.

Meanwhile, the road between Gate 1 and Gate 7 of Jamia witnesses a riot of colours with 21 life-sized anti-CAA and anti-NRC graffiti painted on it. From questioning the government on its commitment to Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam to modifying ‘raising the flag on Iwo Jima’—each of the 21 artistic impression finds a new way to critique the new law.

Jamia students have also set up an open air library and a gallery of 100 pictures depicting life and times of Mahatma Gandhi . Naina Arora, a resident of Kalkaji, said that she had come to be a part of this large movement. “Everyone should visit it at least once,” she added.

“There are also cases where people who come to procure blood are neither fit for donation nor have a donor with them. Such people become easy prey for touts who forge signature of the transfusion medicine department head on fake forms to get blood,” said a KGMU official.

Kannur: Veteran singer K J Yesudas, who turned 80 on Friday, visited Kollur Mookambika temple in Karnataka, and paid obeisance there, which is a tradition he has been following for decades.

The singer, who reached the temple in the morning, took part in Chandikahomam and recited a keerthana before the deity though he was suffering from fever. He was also accompanied by his wife Prabha, his three sons and other family members.

When he reached Kollur on the night of January 9, he was received by the temple management.

Yesudas, who has sung thousands of songs in over 14 Indian languages, and also a couple of foreign languages, has been visiting the temple for many decades on the occasion of his birthday, and every year a musical tribute is also organized.

This musical tribute was introduced by Mookambika Sangeetharadhana Samithi in 2000 on the occasion of the 60th birthday of Yesudas, and they religiously organize this musical tribute on January 10.

This time well-known musicians, including Kanhangad Ramachandran and upcoming artists, took part in the programme, which began around 6am to commemorate the occasion, and lasted till late evening.

Thousands of people, mostly Yesudas fans, had thronged the temple premises in the small town to witness the visit of the musical legend right since morning. Though the temple authorities and police had made security arrangements, they had a tough time in managing the crowd.

The sixth edition of Souparnikamritham award was also presented at the daylong function to musician TS Radhakrishnan.

397,['4/01/2020'],Flight of passengers: Belagavi’s gain is Hubballi airport’s loss,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Passenger traffic at the Belagavi airport has declined at the cost of the Hubballi airport

BENGALURU: The passenger traffic at Hubballi airport fell year-on-year by 26% in November 2019, while at Belagavi airport , it grew by over 400%, says data available with the Airports Authority of India (AAI).

In November 2018, 50,253 passengers travelled through the Hubballi airport and the number fell to 37,762 in November 2019. In the same period, the corresponding numbers at the Belagavi airport were 5,047 and 29,640.

The drop in the number of passengers at Hubballi airport and the sudden spurt at the Belagavi airport is due to a decrease and increase in the number of routes operationalised under the UDAN scheme at these airports, respectively. The two cities are about 100 km apart.

The number of aircraft movements in Hubballi fell from 684 in November 2018 to 585 in November 2019. While in Belagavi, aircraft movements went up from just 62 in November 2018 to 586.

Spicejet, Alliance Air and Star Air began operations from Belagavi in February this year. Bengaluru-headquartered Star Air is also expected to kick off a direct service between Belagavi and Indore in January 2020. Several routes that were earlier operational at Hubballi have also been diverted to Belagavi.

Between April and November in 2019, 3.2 lakh and 1.5 lakh passengers travelled through the Hubballi and Belagavi airports, respectively. The corresponding numbers for 2018 is 2.7 lakh and 54,000, respectively.

According to a statement issued by the ministry of civil aviation last week, 34.7 lakh passengers have travelled under the UDAN scheme across the country till date. A total of 134 routes were commissioned between January 1, 2019 and December 10, 2019, while 10 airports were operationalised till December 7 in 2019. Of these airports, four are underserved and six unserved.

Lucknow: Cyber thieves are terrorising residents of Lucknow like never before. In seven cases reported between Thursday and Friday, a sum of Rs 1.48 lakh was withdrawn from ATMs in various parts of the city and country using cloned bank cards while the victims were either at home or office.

The bewildered citizens want police not just to get their money back, but also to bust cloning gangs and dissect the modus operandi.

Nirmal Vishwa, a secretariat employee and resident of Bangla Bazaar, lost Rs 75,000 in three equal instalments. The withdrawals were made from an ATM in Mumbai, while he was working in Lucknow.

“I received three text alerts one after another. The money just vanished from my bank account while I have my debit card on person,” Vishwa said in his FIR at Aashiana police station on Thursday.

Anil Kumar Singh, a senior research fellow at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), lost Rs 20,000. The cash was withdrawn in two instalments of Rs 10,000 from an ATM on Kursi Road.

“The bank and police have assured me that they will get back my money by withholding/reversing transactions. But, the goons should be arrested and their modus operandi should be cracked, they will continue to target others like me,” said Singh who too lodged a complaint on Thursday.

Five other victims, including an assistant professor of BBAU together lost Rs 53,000 through illegal withdrawals from their bank accounts. Three of the five FIRs were lodged on Friday. None of them is sure how their “secure” debit/credit card details were stolen.

Police cyber cell nodal officer Abhay Mishra said “We have requested banks to provide CCTV camera footage of the ATMs from where money has been withdrawn to identify the miscreants.”

Andhra CM Jaganmohan Reddy

HYDERABAD: In a development which raised eyebrows in legal circles, the CBI court, Hyderabad, on Friday declared that hearing in the Penna Cements episode of the YS Jaganmohan Reddy quid pro quo case will be in-camera.

Announcing the new arrangement, principal special judge B V Madhusudan Rao directed that only lawyers representing Penna Cements, CBI and Jaganmohan Reddy be present in the court.

Other lawyers and representatives of various accused entities then left the court hall. The doors of the court were then closed and the case was heard in-camera.

Penna Cements has been opposing the supplementary charge sheet filed by CBI in its case on the ground that there was no new material in it other than what was stated in the first charge sheet. It also urged the court not to take cognisance of the the supplementary charge. On the other hand, CBI has been arguing that they added seven new accused to the case and the law allows them to do so.

Courts usually order in-camera proceedings while hearing sensitive cases like rape and cases of national security etc. It is rare to keep cases of corruption involving public servants away from public gaze.

In fact, previous judge M Venkata Ramana had restrained the media from reporting hearings in the case, but he never made it an in-camera. Media personnel too used to cover all important developments whenever such orders were pronounced.

Jawaharlal Nehru University

NEW DELHI: The Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) administration issued a statement on Friday alleging that agitating students had “crossed all boundaries of decency and discipline”.

The administration alleged that at 1pm on January 3, a few students — wearing masks — forcibly entered the centre for information system, switched off the power supply, forcibly evicted the technical staff and made the servers dysfunctional.

In a statement, JNU registrar Pramod Kumar said that the act affected the ongoing registration process — of which Friday was the third day.

The JNU Students Union had called a boycott of the registration process till complete withdrawal of hostel fee hike, against which students have been protesting since October 28. “They appear determined to cause as much damage to the academic interests of their fellow students as possible,” said Kumar.

A video of the same had been released by some teachers.

JNUSU did not respond to queries on the matter. Its office bearers claimed that they were not aware of any such incident.

401,['4/01/2020'],"Country facing global isolation, says ex-NSA","This story is from January 4, 2020

New Delhi: India was not only facing an internal revolt due to the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) and National Register of Citizens ( NRC ), but also international criticism and isolation, former national security adviser Shiv Shankar Menon said on Friday.

Addressing a meet organised by Constitutional Conduct Group and Karwan e Mohabbat at the Press Club, Menon said: “There has been no international support for this Act and the isolation is increasing. The voices of dissent are growing louder. The UN high commissioner for human rights has called CAA discriminatory in nature and urged for the rights of the people to be restored in J&K. We have only drawn comfort from the support of authoritarian states.”

Among those present at the meet were scholars, writers and former diplomats, such as Harsh Mander, Zoya Hasan, Niraja Jayal, Nitin Desai, Deb Mukharji and Navsharan Singh.

Menon said India’s rating was declining rapidly due to these protests and, for a country whose gross domestic product (GDP) was dependent on the rest of the world too, there was a need for quick action. “Seven countries have issued travel warnings. None of this helps us. What the world thinks about India matters more right now than ever before, as half of our GDP depends on the world. We are, however, isolating ourselves and this can lead to no good,” he said.

Advocate Gautam Bhatia said the problem with the amended citizenship law wasn’t about the communities that were being allowed in, but those that were being excluded. “This law, according to the Centre’s argument, is inclusive. But it also excludes communities that have been persecuted in Myanmar and Sri Lanka. Why are you leaving some out? It distinguishes on the basis of factors beyond the control of a human. This is why it’s an Article 14 issue,” said the advocate stating persecution could be social, caste- or gender-based, but the lines were being draw on religious persecution.

“If you are trying to bring about a reformed law, you should not draw blunt lines. The court has said this in the past. It is not a case of imperfect drafting, but a clear separation of communities and groups,” he said.

Former chief economic adviser to the government, Nitin Desai, said while other countries across the world were looking at amnesty for refugees, India was going in the opposite direction.

Political scientist Zoya Hasan said it was hard to establish that the refugees coming to India were facing religious persecution. “Most come for economic benefits. How has the government come to the conclusion that all those who have illegally entered India are religiously persecuted? Through this Act, everybody gets a free pass now, except Muslims, who can be legally singled out,” Hasan said.

Former high commissioner Deb Mukharji referred to the NRC process in Assam, stating there had been a tremendous human cost to it.

Two tiger attack deaths were reported in Kalagarh Tier Reserve and one in Ramnagar Tiger Reserve.The number of bear attacks was higher than those of leopard attacks in the state last year.

Bear attacks hurt 76 people and leopard attacks injured 61 others. Notably, the data doesn’t include the number of those hurt (or killed) in monkey attacks.Also, out of all the 32 forest divisions, wildlife sanctuaries, and tiger reserves in the state, 16 didn't record any death in man-animal conflict incidents in 2019.The number of deaths was marginally lower in 2018 than the count in 2019.

In the latest Good Governance Index, state agriculture department has been ranked 7th out of 11 states in terms of performance in agriculture and allied sectors.Data of the agriculture department for 2018-19, accessed by TOI also indicates that agricultural area in the state has declined from 4.63 lakh hectares in 2017-18 to 4.49 lakh hectares in 2018-19 as far as khareef crops are concerned, while for rabi crops, it has dipped from 4.49 lakh hectares in 2017-18 to 3.68 lakh hectares in 2018-19.Veteran agriculturist and founder of Beej Bachao Andolan, a movement to preserve seeds among farmers of Uttarakhand, told TOI, “The award comes as a surprise as our farms are being constantly devastated by wild animals and muck dumping is continuing for the construction of Char Dham Road. Also, villages in several hill districts, especially Pauri, are being abandoned and virtually all agricultural activity has come to a standstill but even then the government is being awarded for agricultural performance.”Environmentalist Anil Joshi added that the state government needs to re-align its strategy and come up with large scale innovative methodologies to resolve the problems. “Uttarakhand needs to change its way of farming by shifting to orchard economy just like Himachal Pradesh. Migration also needs to be addressed by developing orchards in the hills in order to attract villagers.”He added that merging both agriculture and horticulture departments is the need of the hour for Uttarakhand. ‘A comprehensive department can serve the farmers in a better way,” Joshi said.Meanwhile, agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal, said that the state has received the award because of the efforts of the agricultural department. “In the past three years, we have taken 70 major decisions in favour of farmers like having the country’s first Nursery Act and implementing innovative measures like identifying correct markets for farmers as per their commodity, and setting up standard prices of their produce. Hence, the award doesn’t come as a surprise. ”",dehradun,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73090781,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-78501,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-getting-top-agri-award-surprising-experts/articleshow/73090718.cms

Agra: Even though the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) administration has extended the winter vacations indefinitely, the student leaders at the university have announced that they will take out a ‘ tiranga march ’ on the campus on Monday as part of the anti-CAA protests.

According to the student leaders, the march would be taken out as a mark of protest against CAA and NRC. Former students’ union president Faizul Hasan said that the tricolour would be distributed during the march.

According to a statement issued by former AMU students’ union members, the march would be part of the students’ civil resistance against the new citizenship law. They called the police action against the students as state aggression. It reads, “We have released a detailed 32-page document explaining the entire episode of brutal police action against peacefully protesting AMU students. Three advocates, Fazal Abdali, Mohd Aman Khan and Maha Prasad, have filed a petition in the Allahabad high court seeking registration of FIRs against the UP Police and para-military forces. They have also sought an SIT probe under officers not below the rank of DGP.”

Former president of students’ union Salman Imtiaz said that he has also petitioned the Allahabad high court challenging the forced entry of police into the university campus.

The students further said that they have boycotted the biased magisterial enquiry instituted by Aligarh Muslim University and updated the court about the same. “The jury heard our petitions with patience. The judge also added a word that he has read the statement of AMU VC in the newspaper regretting the use of force on students thus making the inquiry necessary and reasonable. The court has reserved its order for January 7. We are hopeful that all farcical charges against students will be withdrawn and police will be made accountable for the violence,” added the statement.

The statement further adds, “We strongly condemn the forcible closure of the university and call it an anti-student policy by the AMU administration.”

LUCKNOW: Two days after controversial sex tapes allegedly featuring SSP Noida went viral, Uttar Pradesh Director General of Police OP Singh said the police officer violated service rules by releasing documents to the media.

“I have asked inspector general of police (Meerut range) Alok Singh to ask the SSP for an explanation,” said DGP , while speaking to reporters.

Narrating the sequence of events, the top cop said, five fake journalists were booked under the Gangsters Act in August 2019. “A case was registered and a detailed report was filed by SSP Noida. They were blackmailing officers in the garb of media. Four are in jail, while one is on the run. SSP Noida had given his report to the UP home department and we gave out a detailed report to ADG Meerut Zone, Prashant Kumar, and sought a detailed inquiry,” said the DGP.

A video clip and WhatsApp chats went viral and SSP Noida has got a case filed in the Sector 20 police station in Noida, he said.

The DGP also said the computer emergency response team and special task force have been asked to assist in probe even as the name of a former officer on special duty to SP national president Akhilesh Yadav, Manoj Bhadauriya, has also surfaced in an audio leak.

“We transferred the case to another district for impartiality and asked superintendent of police, Hapur, Sanjiv Suman to investigate. On December 26, the additional director general (Meerut zone) sought 15 more days to conduct a probe. It was alleged these people bagged tenders illegally and two of them have been arrested.

408,['4/01/2020'],AMC councillors plan postcard drive to focus on irregularities in door-to-door garbage collection,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Agra: Councilors of Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) plan to launch a postcard campaign to highlight irregularities in the door-to-door garbage collection in the city. The councillors will request residents to send a postcard to chief minister Yogi Adityanath, telling him how the door-to-door garbage collection facility is not working properly.

AMC councillors decided to launch the postcard campaign as the civic body is yet to release an investigation report on door-to-door garbage collection in the city.

Earlier the councillors had alleged irregularities in payment to the companies hired for conducting doo-to-door garbage collection. It was alleged that the companies did not collect garbage from a majority of the houses but full payment was made to them. In this regard, mayor Naveen Jain had ordered an investigation in September. After much delay, the civic body administration has not been able to complete the investigation. In this context, mayor Jain, on demand of the councilors, has called for a special house session on January 6.

Five private companies were given the contract to collect garbage from house to house across 100 wards by AMC.Recently, one company quit. Three months ago, councilors raised the issue of malpractices in the door-to-door garbage collection work. Taking cognizance of the documents made available by the councilors in support of their allegations, the mayor had ordered an investigation of the matter. A three-member committee, headed by municipal commissioner Vinod Kumar, was constituted to conduct the investigation. The investigation was required to be conducted within 10 days. However, the committee is yet to compile an investigation report.

Senior councillor (Peepal Mandi) Ravi Mathur said, “The AMC administration must file a FIR against the door-to-door garbage collection companies. They have caused major revenue loss to the civic body. Some officials are also involved in the entire scam”.

Motiganj councillor Rakesh Jain said, “Even after much delay, the civic body administration has not been able to complete the probe into waste collection. Some officials are trying to divert and settle the entire matter. We have decided to run a postcard campaign. In this, people of all the 100 wards in the city will be encouraged to write postcards to the chief minister, highlighting the real facts about door-to-door garbage collection took place only on papers”.

Additional municipal commissioner KB Singh said, “The investigation of the door-to-door garbage collection is in progress. It is taking time as there are 3.5 lakh houses in 100 wards of the city. Status of garbage collection is verified from each house. Tax inspectors and supervisors have also been involved in the investigation. The outcome of the investigation will be made public very soon”.

409,['4/01/2020'],Number of extrapulmonary TB cases nearly doubles in 3 yrs,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Pune: The steady rise in extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) cases may jeopardize India’s TB elimination goal, experts said on Friday, while citing the doubling of such cases in PMC limits in the last three years.

Public and private hospitals in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits had recorded 1,334 extrapulmonary TB cases in 2017, which almost doubled to 2,600 in 2019 (see box). “Identifying, diagnosing, notifying and treating patients with extrapulmonary TB is among the challenges to attain the TB elimination goal by 2025,” a medical expert said.

“Tuberculosis bacterium enters the body through the inhalation of infectious droplet. The disease-focus from the lungs then breaks and spreads through the blood and lymphatic nodes to other bodily organs leading to extra-pulmonary TB,” senior chest physician Sanjay Gaikwad, head of the pulmonary medicine at state-run BJ Medical College and Sassoon Hospital, said.

The TB bacterium causing extra-pulmonary TB is more often a drug-resistant organism. “That means the drug-resistant forms of TB bacterium are mainly behind most of the cases of extrapulmonary TB seen in India today,” Gaikwad said.

Since the drug-resistant TB bacterium is air-borne, any infected person’s sneeze or cough can transmit it. “In previous national programmes, there was no specific drug regimen and inadequate drug supply led to poor treatment. Besides, poor quality of diagnosis and monitoring led to increased disease burden, resulting in high-mortality rate and drug-resistant forms of the disease.”

In the revised national TB control programme, focus was laid on quality of diagnosis and directly observed treatment (DOTS). “The DOTS was thrice-a-week treatment (every alternate day) and led to missing doses. India switched to daily regimen only two years ago,” Gaikwad said.

People with HIV/AIDS fall in high-risk category. “Other factors responsible for high prevalence of extrapulmonary TB include chronic illness and associated co-morbid conditions like diabetes,” Vaishali Jadhav, assistant medical officer of health at PMC, said.

PUNE: Wadgaonsheri MLA Sunil Tingre has proposed a slew of infrastructure measures aimed at easing traffic woes in Vishrantwadi and around the airport this year.At a meeting with Pune MP Girish Bapat and civic officials on Thursday, Tingre laid out a plan that includes the construction of at least four underpasses and grade separators.It was stated at the meeting that underpasses from Alandi to Vishrantwadi chowk, Ambedkar chowk, Gunjan Chowk and Shadalbaba Road will ensure that the flow of traffic to Ahmednagar Road, Vishrantwadi-Lohegaon road and the airport will be streamlined.Severe traffic congestion is a regular feature on these thoroughfares, and a study commissioned by Tingre suggested that grade separators and underpasses would go a long way towards easing the situation.If it comes to fruition, the plan would benefit residents of Dhanori, Kalas, Dighi, Vishrantwadi, Tingrenagar and Lohegaon. Twitter is flooded with complaints by many residents about traffic snarls on the Alandi-Vishrantwadi road, Vishrantwadi-509 Chowk road, Dighi-Vishrantwadi road, among others.“According to our survey, a combination of grade separators and underpasses at all these chowks would ease traffic congestion by 80%,” Tingre said. “The Vishrantwadi Chowk in particular, will have a Y-shaped underpass in combination with a flyover from Alandi Road towards Lohegaon,” the MLA said, adding that he would soon call a special meeting with civic officials in this regard.Some residents have welcomed the plan.“I have been a resident of Vishrantwadi for more than 20 years, and the situation has just been worsening — more people are moving to this area with new construction schemes cropping up here. The volume of traffic passing through Vishrantwadi chowk has multiplied at least fourfold over the past decade. A grade separator will definitely help ease the traffic flow,” Vivek Satav, a resident of the area, said.“The situation around Vishrantwadi police chowkey is so bad, that any hour of any given day, one must prepare the house at least 10 minutes in advance just to avoid getting caught in traffic congestion and getting late to work,” Lohegaon resident Rashmi Lahoti said.She further said the police too need to play an active role in managing traffic. “Traffic police are usually just spectators and don’t bother controlling traffic. They simply sit and watch and, on many occasions, are busy on their smartphones,” Lahoti added.The Vishrantwadi Chowk is a four-arm junction, with traffic moving in eight directions — to and from Alandi, Lohegaon, Yerawada and Dhanori. The junction is a chaotic mess, especially in the peak hours. Many traders and vendors have set up shop in the area and attract a large number of customers, who park on the road. Further, a nearby foot overbridge remains underutilized, with people jaywalking instead. Add to this the large number of vehicles passing through the area, and traffic becomes difficult to manage, authorities said.The study has proposed an improvement in the design of the junction to streamline traffic flow, including shortening the duration of traffic signals, banning roadside parking, removing encroachments and maintaining the foot overbridge to ensure maximum utilization.“With a traffic growth rate of 8% per annum, the intersection will experience a greater number of vehicles in the coming years. Hence, it is required to build a grade separator to isolate the intersecting lanes,” the study stated.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73092968,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-117534,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/underpass-flyover-to-ease-traffic-woes-in-vishrantwadi/articleshow/73091466.cms

PUNE: The civic body will have to recover property tax of around Rs1,000 crore in the next three months to meet its target for the current fiscal.

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) collected Rs1,100 crore in property tac in the first three quarters of the 2019-20 financial year, ending December 31, 2019. The civic body had set a target of collecting Rs2100crore as property tax for this fiscal.

“A number of initiatives, including legal steps, have been taken for recovery,” said Vilas Kanade, the head of the PMC’s property tax department. He added that the civic administration had started a drive to play brass bands in front of properties whose owners had not paid the tax.

Owners of around 7.8 lakh properties have paid the tax. Owners of nearly 2.4 lakh properties are yet to make the payment. The civic officials said the PMC’s revenue was likely to go up as many new properties, including thse from newly merged villages, had been registered in the past two years in the municipal limits.

Najeeb Jung

NEW DELHI: Former lieutenant governor of Delhi and Jamia Millia Islamia ex-vice-chancellor Najeeb Jung on Friday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to hold a press conference to quell all doubts around the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) and National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) so that people could get some clarity.

Speaking on CAA, NRC and NPR at the Press Club on Friday at a meet organised by Constitutional Conduct Group and Karwan-e-Mohabbat, Jung said there was tremendous confusion among people and the need for the hour was for the government to dispel all rumours and clarify its stand on the issues.

The event was attended by speakers like Shiv Shankar Menon, Harsh Mander , Zoya Hasan , Niraja Jayal and Navsharan Singh.

“The PM and home minister should voice their intention because things cannot go on like this. Students and youngsters are on the streets right now, which is not good for the country,” Jung told TOI.

The former LG said India’s international image was getting affected due to the protests, which would only grow in the coming days. “The government has admitted that there is misinformation around CAA and NRC, so they should clarify the process and dispel all rumours surrounding it.”

Jung said police had never entered the Jamia Millia campus before and could only do so at the request of the VC or under extreme circumstances. “I have clarified this in the past. It is extremely sad (police entering Jamia). Students have shown extreme restraint and continue to do so. However, the protests will affect their studies, so it is important that everyone sit together and find a solution,” he added.

PUNE: The present groundwater situation in Maharashtra is critical, said senior geologist Shrinivas Vadagbalkar at the inauguration of the 14th Kirloskar Vasundhara International Film Festival (KVIFF).

“In states like Gujarat, Assam, Kerala and Maharashtra, land is rocky and the water holding capacity is low. Only 1%-4% water gets through the rock bed to recharge groundwater. Even though high rainfall levels are recorded, rainwater harvesting systems are not sufficiently available,” he said. The geologist, who was conferred the Vasundhara Green Teacher Award at the event, said the only solution was to store rain water. “Storage ponds are the need of the hour. Our ancestors had great knowledge on this front and we still see water reservoirs on fortresses or pilgrimage sites.”

The three environmental activists from Ladakh — Shan-e-Shan — were conferred the Vasundhara Mitra Activists Award. Renowned environmental filmmaker Vijay Bedi was conferred the Vasundhara Mitra Filmmaker award. Bedi also delivered the Vasundhara talk on ‘Camera as a Tool for Conservation’.

Delivering the welcome address at the event, Atul Kirloskar, executive chairman of Kirloskar group, said, “Greta Thunberg said the only way to get the message of saving the environment through is to incessantly repeat until it gets through to people and translates into action. In its 14th year, the KVIFF is working on the same lines of endeavouring to spread the message of environment protection.”

416,['4/01/2020'],"Cancer patient, who suffered multiple fractures in police action during anti-CAA stir, taken to hospital","This story is from January 4, 2020

Agra: Ahmad Nabi, 52, a stage-II oral cancer patient , who has been lying in Firozabad jail’s medical ward with a fracture in his left arm and one each in his legs since December 20, was finally escorted to Agra’s S N Medical College late on Thursday. But it took two reminders from the court and multiple reports in the media for the administration to do that. Nabi was badly injured in the alleged police action during the anti-CAA protests in the district and was later arrested.

On Thursday, additional district judge Keshav Goyal had issued a second order to district jail administration to immediately shift Nabi to government hospital for medical aid.

At SN Medical College, a team of doctors examined his fractures to assess his medical condition and started the pre-surgery procedures.

“For the past two weeks, I am on a liquid diet, as it’s difficult for me to pass stool with fractured limbs. In jail, I was using discarded plastic water bottles to urinate,” Nabi told TOI on Friday.

Speaking about the December 20 incident and his subsequent ordeal, Nabi said, “That afternoon while returning home from my crockery store, I was caught in the clashes between a mob and police. I fell on the road after having been hit by a teargas shell. Later, policemen dragged me away and brutally assaulted me, that left me with multiple fractures. On the night of December 21, I was shifted to the jail, but it took them another day to provide me the first-aid. On December 23, a doctor at Firozabad government hospital had told policemen to admit me for surgery on my injuries, but the cops refused.”

Dr C P Paul, head of the orthopaedic department, S N Medical College, said, “Nabi is currently in a stable condition. But since he is a cancer patient, we have to take medical opinion from our oncologist before we go ahead with the surgery. It will take another five to six days before we conduct the surgery.”

Notably, twice on December 24 and January 2, the district court of Firozabad had ordered the administration to shift Nabi to government hospital to provide him better medical treatment, as he is a stage-II oral cancer patient too.

Meanwhile, Firozabad superintendent of police Sachindra Patel said, “Our escort took him to Agra’s S N Medical College on Thursday evening. We will ensure that every possible medical help is provided to Nabi.”

According to the FIR lodged by Firozabad police, Nabi is the prime accused in December 20 anti-CAA violence.

417,['4/01/2020'],PM Modi ignoring Karnataka to make BSY look bad: Siddaramaiah,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Siddaramaiah

BENGALURU: A day after chief minister BS Yediyurappa, at a public event, expressed his displeasure at the Centre over its delay in releasing funds for flood relief, former chief minister Siddaramaiah of the Congress on Friday looked to rub salt in the septuagenarian’s wounds by alleging the Centre’s indifference is a deliberate ploy to ease Yediyurappa out of the CM’s chair and active politics.

“The evidence for this conspiracy is the delay in releasing central government funds,” the Congressman said soon after Prime Minister Modi left Bengaluru on Friday. “I had presumed the reason the Centre delayed release of funds was because its coffers were empty due to Narendra Modi government’s bad economic policies. Though the CM begged and pleaded with Modi in public for funds, the Prime Minister did not bother to respond. I wonder whether the conspiracy of removing CM Yediyurappa from his chair is gaining traction.”

Siddaramaiah flayed Modi for making a “political speech” in front of “school children” at Siddaganga Mutt on Thursday, wondering why he had to speak against Congress and about Pakistan, CAA and NRC in front of them. “It was a dirty political speech, but for Modi, everywhere it is politics,” the former CM said.

Siddaramaiah called Yediyurappa “a weak CM” and alleged Modi was showing “utmost apathy” to the state. As evidence he said “the PM did not even assure Yediyurappa that his appeal for a Rs 50,000 crore grant will be considered”.

The Congressman accused Modi of “hugely betraying” Karnataka by not announcing any flood relief for the state during his two-day visit. “People expected Modi to announce something to the effect, but he did not utter a word on it. With 25 MPs and with their own chief minister, all we got was Rs 1,200 crore (flood relief),” Siddaramaiah said.

He recalled that during the previous election, Modi had said that if BJP comes to power at both state and the Centre, the doors of good fortune will open for Karnataka. “Forget about opening doors of good fortune, he did not even open doors of his house to the leaders of his own party,” Siddaramaiah said.

PUNE: A 57-year-old officer from the income tax department lost Rs29.37 lakh to fraudsters offering him Rs18 lakh as deposit and a monthly rent of Rs45,000 against space to install a cellphone tower on his plot in Ambegaon .

The fraudsters compelled the officer to purchase insurance policies worth Rs4.57 lakh as a part of the procedure. Later, they made him transfer huge sums to get the refund. After transferring money to different bank accounts for over two years, the officer realised in October last year that he had been duped. He lodged an FIR with the Bharati Vidyapeeth police on Thursday.

Inspector Vishnu Tamhane of the Bharati Vidyapeeth police said a person claiming to be an official from a mobile company contacted the officer, a resident of Ambegaon, over the cellphone in June 2016. He offered the officer handsome returns if he provided space for installing the cellphone tower. “The officer purchased seven policies worth Rs4.57 lakh from four different private insurance companies after he was told to do so to sign off the deal,” Tamhane said.

The self-proclaimed mobile company staffer then told the officer that the amount he had paid for the policies had been invested in the capital market. “He then lured the officer to invest more for bigger profit. Believing him, the complainant invested Rs6.23 lakh more between 2017 and 2018. Thereafter, the first suspect stopped communicating with the officer and two others contacted him. The duo told him that the earlier person was a fraud and promised him refund,” Tamhane said.

He said the duo told the officer to transfer different amounts as return charges, processing fees, and procedure for full and final payment. “In total, the complainant deposited Rs24.8 lakh in different bank accounts,” he said.

Representative image

PUNE: Three men were booked on Thursday on the charges of posing as senior officers of the National Defence Academy (NDA) and duping a 22-year-old youth from Uttar Pradesh of Rs 1.32 lakh by sending him a fake joining letter for the post of an Air Force flying officer.

The youth, Navin Tripathi, has lodged a complaint with the Uttamnagar police in this regard. According to the complaint, while pursuing his studies, Tripathi had appeared for the NDA entrance test in September 2015. In January 2016, he was informed through an email that he needed to come to Gandhinagar in Gujarat for an interview in May that year.

“When Tripathi went for the interview, one of the three suspects, who was posing as a senior officer of the NDA, took his interview,” an officer from the Uttamnagar police said.

After the interview, Tripathi was instantly given a letter for a training, which was to start from July 2017 at NDA in Pune. “After that Tripathi was summoned eight times to Pune for various meetings, which were held at a restaurant near Chandni Chowk,” the officer said.

On July 25, 2017, Tripathi received an email stating that his training had been cancelled due to a fraud by few students during medical tests. On May 25, 2019, Tripathi received another email, asking him to come for a meeting to the same restaurant in Pune on May 29 2019, the officer said.

“About 30 students were present at the meeting. The man posing as the officer from NDA, along with his two accomplices who also claimed to be senior officer of the NDA, told Tripathi that his training will start from January 1, 2020. They then asked him to pay Rs 1.32 lakh via a demand draft in training charges,” the officer said, adding that after Tripathi gave them the demand draft for the said amount, he received a call letter and other documents via post in July last year.

“Tripathi was asked to report to NDA between December 26, 2019, and January 1 this year. On January 1, when Tripathi went to the NDA, an officer checked the letter and other documents and told Tripathi that they were fake,” the officer said, adding, “The officer also told Tripathi that his name was never selected for the course.”

“The suspects were fraudsters and they duped Tripathi by sending a fake joining letter. Our probe is on,” Sunil Pandharkar, senior inspector of the Uttamnagar police told TOI.

The police have registered the offence under sections 420 (cheating), 419 (cheating by personation), 464, 465 (forgery) and 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) of the Indian Penal Code.

The police have received only one complaint in this regard so far.

422,['4/01/2020'],"Delhi unauthorised colonies: Happy with papers, they want amenities too","This story is from January 4, 2020

For many residents, the ownership rights mean they needn’t fear bulldozers any longer.

NEW DELHI: Blocked by tall buildings, the sunlight struggles to illuminate the narrow lane adjacent to 45-year-old Krishan Kumar ’s house . But even in the dim light, one can see Kumar’s bright face as he holds up the conveyance deed and registration papers of his home. The resident of Raja Vihar, an unauthorised colony in north Delhi, received the documents on Friday.

Kumar was one of the 20 residents of unauthorised colonies — 11 from Raja Vihar and nine from nearby Suraj Park — who received conveyance deeds under the Pradhan Mantri Unauthorised Colonies in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojana (PM-UDAY) and property registration papers from Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri. “My children study in Class XII and IX. I don’t have to worry about money for their higher studies because I can now get a loan against my property,” Kumar exulted.

For other residents, ownership rights mean they needn’t fear bulldozers any longer. Asha Devi, wife of a factory worker, smiled as she surveyed her 25 sq yard house, “I can call his house my own now.”

Ashok Kumar Gupta, a grocery shop owner, spent Rs 700 to get the conveyance deed for his 70 sq yard home. “After living here for two decades, I won’t get demolition notices now,” he said. Gupta, like many others, initially found it difficult to apply online for registration online, but the DDA helpdesk came to this aid. “A team came to my residence for geo-tagging and I got a confirmation message the following day,” said Gupta.

Located next to the Badli Industrial Area, Raja Vihar is mostly populated by Poorvanchalis, people hailing from eastern UP and Bihar. The lanes are narrow and the drains are overflowing, but the residents are happy things have improved in the past decade and are hopeful of a better future when the colony is regularised.

In fact better amenities are as important as property rights to the people. “When I arrived here as a young bride 15 years ago, I had to wade through sludge. Then a brick road was laid. Finally, five years ago, we got a concrete road,” recalled Nirmala Devi. “While we are focused on getting ownership rights, it is more important for the colony to be regularised.”

This view was echoed by Sardar Baldev Singh at Suraj Park. “We have every facility in the area and since I won’t sell my house or take a loan, what use are the property papers?” asked Singh, a local since 1981. He added, “The government is conducting this process in a hurry because of the coming elections. The real benefit will only come with the colony’s regularisation.”

At Suraj Park, the roads are wide enough to accommodate three cars. There are many kothis, or bungalows, on large plots, CCTV cameras and even piped cooking gas there. Ashok Kumar Singh, who came here in 2007 from Motihari in Bihar and has a footwear business, was optimistic of life becoming even better with ownership rights, which he got on Friday for his four-storey house on a 114 sq metre plot.

Manoj Bansal, whose brother was out to receive the conveyance deed for the family home, felt property rates in the colony would go up. But the Bansals don’t intend to sell their house even if they can now. “It took us around Rs 5,000 to get the ownership papers,” Bansal said happily.

425,['4/01/2020'],"Focus more on facilities than hike in roadways bus fare, say passengers","This story is from January 4, 2020

Agra: The Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) has implemented its increased fare on all categories of buses on Friday which caused a lot of discontent among the regular passengers. The passengers said that authorities should have focused more on improving facilities before increasing the fare.

The revised rate has been increased by 10 per cent per km. Technical teams, following orders from headquarters, calibrated the electronic ticketing machines (ETM) as per the revised rate. Passengers were charged increased fair in ordinary, Janrath, air-conditioned sleeper, high-end Volvo and Scania buses.

The decision regarding the travel fare increase was taken in the director council meeting of the UPSRTC in Lucknow, recently. According to new fare hike, people travelling 100 km in ordinary bus will have to spend Rs 10 extra on their fare; and Rs 22.11 in Scania bus. The fare for air-conditioned sleeper bus was Rs 1.90 per km. It has been increased to Rs 2.10.

Now passengers going to Noida from Agra in ordinary buses will have to pay increased fare of Rs 282. Earlier, it was 260. Going from Agra to Lucknow via expressway will cost Rs 475 as compared to Rs 401. Similarly, travelling from Agra to Kanpur will cost Rs 370. Earlier, it was Rs 335. Fair from Agra to Dehradun has been increased from Rs 456 to Rs 498.

Using the national highway, the fare from Agra to Delhi has been increased from Rs 237 to Rs 239. The fare to Jaipur has been increased from Rs 267 to Rs 273 for ordinary buses.

The UPSRTC had last increased fare in 2017. Then, the ordinary bus fare was increased by Rs 9 per 100 km.

Mathura resident Ramesh Kushwah said, “The conduction of ordinary buses is poor. With broken glasses, the seats are in wear and tear state in most of the buses. Following poor maintenance, buses make a lot of sound and vibration, causing inconvenience to the passengers. Authorities should have made efforts to ensure safe and comfortable travel for passengers before increasing the fare.”

Agra resident Vinod Verma said, “Increase in the bus fare is highly unreasonable. The UPSRTC administration should have ensured better facilities for the passengers before taking the decision. Buses frequently stop during the journey due to technical problems. Seats are also in poor conduction. UPSRTC’s ordinary buses generally remain untidy.”

Around 95 per cent of the UPSRTC’s total income comes from the bus fare that fetched revenue of Rs 4,500 crore during 2018-19.

According to sources, UPSRTC is among the country’s state transport undertakings (STUs) charging the highest bus fare.

UPSRTC service manager SP Singh said, “The fare hike was required to bear the fuel cost that has gone up over the past two years. All the ETMs have been updated with the revised rate. The operation and maintenance of the buses is constantly improving.”

Lucknow: The Noida SSP’s twin letters to the home department and DGP specifically names at least five IPS officers, who have been found to be hand in glove with criminals and fake journalists.

These letters have been accessed by TOI.

The Noida police chief in his August 23, 2019, letter stated one of the four fake journalists booked under Gangsters Act revealed chats relating to transfer posting of an officer of provincial civil services (PCS) and ward boys to Ayodhya Medical College. In his letter, SSP names an IPS officer who sought a transfer to a west UP district and was ready to pay kickbacks in cash. Also, it names an OSD of former CM leaking details of a project given Uttar Pradesh Rajkiya Nirman Nigam (UPRNN) in Bihar and demanding commission.

In the second letter sent to DGP on the same day, Noida SSP Vaibhav Krishna names a district police chief talking about his transfer to a specific district in lieu of Rs 80 lakh. However, after the middleman’s arrest, the IPS officer asks him to hush up the matter.

Similarly, another SP of a district, also an IPS officer, negotiated for a posting of an inspector in his district, while another IPS officer posted in another district hammered out a deal for delivery of a truck consignment after talking to his inspector in charge.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: Economic slowdown due to demonetisation and introduction of GST cannot be a ground for delaying completion of housing projects by real estate companies, National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission held while directing Noida developer Mahagun to refund over Rs 50 crore to 29 homebuyers.

The homebuyers booked flats in 2013 and the company — Nexgen Infracon Pvt Ltd — had promised to hand over possession by February 2016. It, however, failed to complete the Mahagun Mezzaria project even two years after the stipulated period and the homebuyers, who deposited over Rs 1 crore each, approached the commission in 2018.

The company, however, contended the project was delayed because of various factors, such as demonetisation in 2016 and GST in 2017, beyond its control. It said payment to labourers was also hampered.

But the commission said the homebuyers couldn’t be made to wait indefinitely. Allowing the plea of the homebuyers’ lawyer, Aditya Parolia, it directed the firm to refund the money along with compensation at 12% annual interest.

NCDRC president Justice R K Agrawal said, “Wherever the builder commits a particular date... they must necessarily honour the commitment, though a minor delay may not constitute deficiency in the service.”

An anti-encroachment van checks for illegal hawkers on FC Road on Friday

PUNE: A special squad of the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) took action against around 70 hawkers on MG Road on Thursday and Friday during an anti-encroachment drive.

The squad led by PCB’s deputy chief executive officer Rahul Gajbaye removed 50 hawkers and seized their material on Thursday, and confiscated 20 handcarts on Friday under the Cantonment Act, 2006.

The PCB has also decided to take action against the traders encouraging encroachments by allowing hawkers to operate in front of their shops on the busy roads in the Cantonment area. “We want to address the encroachment issue permanently, and this is one of the moves to send a stern message to violators among the traders in the Cantonment area,” Amit Kumar, the chief executive officer of the PCB, told TOI on Friday.

Kumar said they would continue to take action against the hawkers until they saw the desired results.

The board had received several complaints from residents, visitors and Army officers regarding encroachment on public pavements, particularly on MG Road and East Street. “The pedestrians are forced to walk on the main street, which is risky. Either side of MG Road and East Street is reserved for parking. So, there is limited carriageway available for vehicular movement. In such a situation, chances of accidents are high. Hence, removing hawkers is necessary,” an Army officer said.

A board member said the PCB had carried out similar drives in the past but they were not effective as the hawkers would return in a few days. “The board will not be able to address the problem permanently unless it continues the drive for a substantial period. Neither the traders, nor the residents take the move seriously, as they are under the impression that the drive is temporary,” a board member said.

A resident and activist Sanjay Kawade said adopting a concrete anti-encroachment policy was a must. “To resolve the encroachment issue, the board had created a ‘fashion market’ a few years ago. But the situation remained the same. Active public participation and positive approach of the board is necessary to end this problem,” he said.

Pune airport

PUNE: Passengers will have to wait for a little longer to get more food options at the airport. The lone food court of the facility shut down three months ago but senior airport officials said a new alternative would be in place in a couple of months which would cater to around 30,000 flyers each day.

“Lite Bite Foods, which used to manage the food court, decided to leave us as they didn’t get the kind of response they had expected. Presently, the airport has got quite a few options for passengers when it comes to food. A fresh tender will be floated and we are expecting a new alternative very soon. A new lounge has also been opened recently at the airport,” Pune airport director Ajay Kumar told TOI.

The food court had brands like Subway, KFC, Bakers Street, Steet food by Punjab Grill and a bar. The Punjab Grill outlet, located right outside the arrival gate, was also shut down in addition to the one located in the food court on the first floor of the departure area.

The spokesperson of Lite Bite foods had earlier said, “When we had bid, we had been shown a steady passenger flow. However, the flow of passengers dipped and the airport authorities didn’t provide a clarification. The business dwindled and we had to stop services. There were no issues of late payments,” he said. He added that the company did not intend to come back.

“Being a busy airport, there is an urgent need for more options for passengers,” a frequent flyer said.

NEW DELHI: Firefighting operations continued on Friday at the Peeragarhi battery factory where a fireman was killed and 17 others injured a day before. Another portion of the building collapsed at night and the cooling operation had to be halted and taken up in the morning.

Crime Branch is probing the source of the explosion that was earlier thought to a compressor unit blast. The impact of the explosion was such that it had ripped through the building’s 15-inch thick walls.

Fire officials said they had to move cautiously during the dousing operation as the fire still raged under the concrete slabs. The firemen had to remove the concrete slabs to spray water. The operation might continue till early on Saturday after which the debris would be cleared.

Sources said police will question the building owner, Anil Gupta, a resident of north Delhi, to find out what items had been stored in the basement, which caused a chain of explosions.

Meanwhile, the body of the deceased fireman Amit Balyan was handed over his family after an autopsy. He was given the guard of honour at the Rohini fire training school.

Atul Garg, Delhi Fire Service director said an inspection would be conducted after the cooling operation after which the area would be declared safe for other agencies. A case of causing death due to negligence and causing damage due to fire has been registered.

434,['4/01/2020'],10 districts don’t get rabi crop cover,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Mumbai: Farmers in some of the state’s most vulnerable drought-prone districts still do not have the protection of insurance for the winter crop or rabi season which ends in February. This is because insurance companies have not bid for these “high risk” districts even though tenders were floated eight times. Insurance companies say unseasonal rains led to massive claims in the kharif season and made them reluctant to bid for rabi season.

The districts without rabi cover include Beed and Latur in Marathwada and Solapur in Western Maharashtra which are drought-prone. Others are Hingoli in Marathwada, Washim, Bhandara, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli in Vidarbha, and Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg in Konkan.

The government had begun floating tenders in September last year for 32 districts under Prime Minister’s Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY). Despite tenders being issued eight times, there were no takers for 10 districts. “Initially, these 10 districts were divided into two clusters. Then, we made four clusters in the hope of making it more viable for insurance companies. But there were still no bids until the last date of December 30, 2019,” said a senior official, adding the government hopes to re-issue the tender. The other 22 districts have insurance cover.

Rabi or winter crop in the state covers an average of 53 lakh hectares, a third the size of kharif crop. In 2018-19, 48.6 lakh farmers had applied for rabi cover. Rabi crops include wheat, jowar, maize, harbhara and oilseeds. Through 2019, insurance companies have been reluctant to come forward for crop insurance, say officials. For kharif season, the state had to persuade both public and private insurance companies to participate. Private companies stayed away from rabi fruits cover; it was taken up by public sector Agricultural Insurance Company. For rabi season, insurance companies bid after much persuasion but not for these 10 districts.

At least three private insurance firms opted out of PMFBY nationally last year after facing huge claims in 2018-19. Those that took part in the kharif season in 2019 said they did not want to bid in the rabi season after unseasonal rains in the state destroyed almost 70% of the kharif harvest, leading to massive claims from farmers.

“As it is, we face a major payout for kharif season. Since the risk assessment for these 10 districts is high, both insurance firms and reinsurance companies with whom we share the liability were reluctant to get involved,” said an executive from a private insurance firm. “It’s best if the state has its own crop insurance company,” said Parbhani-based Rajan Kshirsagar, a CPI activist who tracks crop insurance.

He alleged insurance companies made huge profits during good years but wanted to avoid seasons where they would face payouts. “Companies made profits through hefty premiums paid by the government. Now, they are choosing their zones carefully to avoid losses. This means farmers in the most vulnerable districts are being deprived of a cover,” he said .

The play took the audience to the British era where prominent figures like Veer Savarkar, Bhagat Singh and Aruna Asaf Ali were rising to get rid of the alien rule. Children in the age group of 8-14 years portrayed each character with such a force that it appeared as if they were the true freedom fighters. That was the success of the drama.

The play began with the narration of a story about Madam Cama, played by Kanak Chavan. It showcased a small part of her early life and how she used to skip college to attend protest rallies and movement for freedom. She was shown as a calm yet powerful character and how she helped people in slum areas suffering from deadly plague.

Manuja Kavishwar portrayed the character of Aruna Asaf Ali. Dressed in a white sari, Aruna was shown participating in several rallies and protests and how she influenced other women to be part of the movement.

Captain Laxmi Sehgal, played by Gautami Thakur, was a staunch opponent of English medium schools in those days. A fierce critic of the British raj, she emphasized on taking education in Hindi medium schools.

Chandrashekhar Azad, depicted by Nalenj Surpam, caught attention when he would throw stones at British officers if they beat up freedom fighters. His never-say-die attitude was such that he fearlessly chanted ‘Bharat mata ki jai’ when he landed in jail and was badly beaten up.

Characters of Veer Savarkar and Bhagat Singh were portrayed by Mohak Khare and Ratan Ingale, respectively. They boosted the morale of each other and continued fight for independence.

The skit also offered a glimpse of Subhas Chandra Bose’s life, played by Rugved Toal, who was in green dress with a round-framed spectacles, delivering speeches.

The play concluded with the freedom fighters hoisting a national flag and singing patriotic song ‘Sab sukh chain’.

Produced by Madhavi Kavishwar, the play was directed by Ashlesh Jamre. Sayali Pakhmode of Fundoo was the anchor.

The supporting actors were Shyamala Peshkar, Rajdeep Chavan, Shivali Ayyar and Teerth Patel.

Hyderabad: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has instructed officials to construct adequate checkdams on all the streams and asked them to make an estimation of how many checkdams are required and construct 50% of them this year and the rest by next year.

He said tenders for the checkdams should be invited by January 15 and funds would be allocated for them in the budget. He said along with the water supplied from various projects, water is available from rains and natural streams. “Water from the streams crisscross and travel downstream. To store this water, checkdams should be constructed,” the chief minister said during a review meeting here on Friday.

The chief minister asked irrigation officials to take up maintenance of tanks revived under Mission Kakatiya and asked them to examine the proposal to construct a lift irrigation scheme to supply water from Palair in Khammam district to Nagarjunasagar ayacut in Miryalaguda divison.

He said with the construction of projects like Kaleshwaram, Devadula and Seetharama, the government was able to extract the state’s share of water from Godavari. “From Kaleshwaram project, we are drawing over 500 tmc water. Along with Yellampally, Mid Manair and Sriram Sagar Project, the Mallanna Sagar, Konda Pochampally Sagar and Baswapur reservoirs will be filled with water,” he said.

File photograph of women taking rest at a night shelter in the city

JAIPUR: Looking at the overcrowding in the night shelters, the Jaipur Municipal Corporation ( JMC ) has boosted the capacity of three night shelters in the city. With winters getting harsh, hundreds of people have been flocking to the shelters everyday.

As per the authorities, looking at the increase in number of people taking refuge at the night shelters, it was decided that the number of beds must be increased. JMC has decided to increase 50 beds each in the night shelters near JK Lone Hospital, Ram Niwas Bagh and in front of Gatewell. All three are situated at JLN Marg.

However, the move is being criticised as to why the beds at the night shelters at the VIP marg only are being increased. Former BJP councillor Vikas Kothari while talking to TOI said, “Beds in three night shelters have been increased, what about other night shelters? Do the officials think that winters do not affect people in other places.”

Santosh Gupta, manager of the night shelter near Ram Niwas Bagh, said they have been running out of blankets and mattresses in the last couple of days. “These new beds will help us a lot. We are facing space crunch. All the slots get filled by 7pm and we have to ask people to get their own blankets and let them sleep inside. We even ask people to adjust with more people on one mattress or else the extra people have to sleep on carpeted floor,” said Santosh.

The night shelters situated near hospitals have to make arrangements to accommodate more people. Night shelters are divided into two portions — men and women/children. The women’s portion is separated by a temporary wall and a curtain. Most of the women coming to the shelters are accompanied by men.

As per the norms of the shelters, persons with valid identity cards are allowed inside. Their card is taken for the night and given back to them in the morning. “It is better for the security for the people staying here or else there are chances of theft. At least with this, we will be sure who all are staying here,” said Manoj Saini, manager of a night shelter.

A man works on a rangoli portrait of Veer Savarkar

LUCKNOW: Raising the ante over distribution of controversial booklet on Veer Savarkar and Nathuram Godse in training camps of Congress Sewa Dal in Madhya Pradesh, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) on Friday said the Congress was targeting leaders who strengthened the country.

VHP said Savarkar was a great nationalist leader who was being deliberately targeted by Congress leadership.

The booklet makes derogatory remark against Savarkar claiming that he had a physical relationship with Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi.

VHP joint general secretary Surendra Jain said he wished that Chanakya, jurist and councillor of 3rd century BC king Chandra Gupta Maurya, was there when former PM Rajiv Gandhi married Sonia Gandhi.

“Helen (a queen of Maurya) ke liye banaye niyam tab bhi zaroori they,” Jain said in a tweet, tagging Indian National Congress and its president Sonia Gandhi.

According to historians, Chanakya had advised Maurya not to pass on the throne to his children from Helen since the queen was a foreigner. “This applies to Congress leadership since Sonia draws her lineage from an Italian family,” VHP spokesman Vinod Bansal told TOI.

He said attempts to malign Savarkar would adversely affect political prospects of Congress.

“Congress has clearly forgotten freedom-fighters. It needs to introspect where it is heading by targeting freedom-fighters like Savarkar. The party should mend its ways otherwise the words of Mahatma Gandhi that Congress should meet its end after Independence would come true,” he said.

The booklet has raised a political storm by referring to the book ‘Freedom at Midnight’ by Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins which claims that before adopting brahmacharya (celibacy), there is only one mention of Nathuram Godse’s physical relationship. “His partner was his political guru Savarkar,” the book claims.

Hyderabad: Swachh Survekshan 2020, the biggest survey conducted by the Central government to declare the cleanest and dirtiest cities across the country, will begin from January 4 and end on January 31. A team will visit the city on Saturday to inspect the sanitation.

On Friday, GHMC joint commissioner N Sudhamsh was assigned the task of improving the city’s sanitation and monitoring of sanitation activities ahead of the survey. The move comes after the sudden resignation of Sujata Gupta, former Indian Defence Estates Services officer, who was roped in to improve the city’s score.

The theme this year is ‘My city’s cleanliness is my responsibility’. “Door-to-door collection of garbage and citizen’s feedback are the two focus areas,” said Sudhamsh.

Cities will be evaluated on a score of 6,000, as against 5,000 the previous years. Hyderabad’s rank slipped to 35 in 2019 from 27 in 2018 as it performed poorly in certification categories of door-to-door garbage collection, among others. tnn

Representative image

JAIPUR: Two persons were arrested by forest department officials for hunting peacock and grey partridges (teeter) in Jaipur’s Amber area on Thursday evening. Officials recovered carcasses of the birds which included one peacock and four teeters. The accused, identified as Ibrahim Khan and Jahid Khan, were sent to 15 days of judicial custody on Friday.

Kavita Singh, DFO, Jaipur told TOI, “Through a source we received information that the birds had been hunted and killed by unidentified persons in Amber area on Thursday evening. Immediately, barricading was done in the area, following which the accused were nabbed.” According to officials, the accused were first-time offenders.

There were a total of three accused but one managed to escape. The accused were in their car when they were stopped for checking at the check post. They tried to drive past the barricade but their car overturned after officials chased them and were caught. A team has been constituted to track down the third accused who managed to flee. The arrested persons were booked under relevant section of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972.

The peacock, declared as the national bird, is protected under Section 51 (1-A) of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Its hunting and killing is prohibited. However, its feathers and fat, used in the treatment of arthritis, fetch a good amount. The grey partridge is described as a game bird in the pheasant family. The species had been introduced in many parts of the world for shooting. The grey partridge is 28–32 cm long, brown-backed, with grey flanks and chest. The belly is white, usually marked with a large chestnut-brown horse-shoe mark in males, and also in many females. After the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 banned all form of hunting, they were ceased to be called as game birds.

444,['4/01/2020'],"Regularise first, documents are fake: Arvind Kejriwal","This story is from January 4, 2020

Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has described the registry papers and conveyance deeds handed over to 20 residents of unauthorised colonies by Union minister Hardeep Puri on Friday as fake. Kejriwal asked how registry could be done without first regularising the colonies. AAP functionaries said these documents would not prevent sealings and demolitions . These were worthless without a notification for change of land use, they argued.

“Earlier you promised regularisation of colonies. Now you are saying that the colonies will not be regularised. Then how can valid registry be done in illegal colonies? How can houses be registered on agriculture lands? Avoid fake registry. Do not mislead people for votes. Tomorrow you can start sealing drive in these colonies,” Kejriwal stated on Twitter, addressing Puri.

Addressing a press conference, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia earlier launched a scathing attack on BJP over what he described as distribution of “fake certificates”. Sisodia pointed out that clause no 2 of the papers made it clear that all existing laws would prevail and both municipal corporations and DDA had absolute authority to demolish any construction that is in contravention of existing laws or Delhi master plan.

He stressed that without regularisation, the BJP government could not accord permanent ownership to any house built on government or agricultural land and that this was an absolute breach of faith by BJP which will drive 40 lakh families into uncertainty and despair. He also questioned why only 20 of the 40 lakh people had been given registry papers.

“The BJP government has not initiated any measure to regularise these unauthorised colonies despite their bombastic promises in Parliament and to the people of Delhi at public rallies,” said Sisodia.

AAP and BJP have been locked in a confrontation over the illegal colonies. In the absence of ownership rights or regularisation, these people live in fear of their houses being demolished. They also complain of being forced by municipal and police authorities to pay bribes for carrying out any new construction. For decades, the issue of regularisation has dominated politics in Delhi.

“You cannot give property rights or permanent ownership to a family, whose home is built on government or agricultural land, without first regularising these unauthorised colonies,” said Sisodia.

AAP said the certificates would not protect the families when the SHO or local police would harass them over additional construction or alteration. “Can BJP give a guarantee that neither NGT, nor the SC monitoring committee or any other authority will seal residential properties constructed on government or agricultural land?” Sisodia asked.

Kozhikode: A 65-year-old retired teacher was found dead in a well near his residence at Narikkuni in the district on Friday after his documents, including the SSLC certificate, went missing. The person was identified as M V Mohammed Ali.

The suicide note he left says he had lost the documents accidentally. Ali had sold old books and other materials and it is believed that the documents may have been accidentally included in the bundle.

The note says that besides the SSLC certificate, Ali lost ‘old certificates’ of his father. “I have lost some valuable books. That would have been used by some other agencies. I am a big sinner. Will God forgive me. That were lost along with waste papers. You too will be in danger. There is no escape,” says the note.

The police suspect the incident a suicide based on preliminary probe.

Meanwhile, some of the friends and neighbours of the man alleged that the man committed suicide due to his concerns regarding the Citizenship Amendment Act. They said he was disturbed ever since the news of CAA started appearing in the media.

Thiruvananthapuram: The sewerage division of Kerala Water Authority ( KWA ) and the National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) are at loggerheads over a ‘missing’ manhole at Enchakkal Junction.

When a clog was noticed in the sewerage line to localities in Vallakkadavu, KWA approached NHAI seeking permission to dig up the newly widened road. The request was turned down and NHAI asked KWA to employ trenchless technology for the work.

The matter came to a head when sewage lines in Vallakkadavu and adjoining areas started overflowing. Earlier, KWA used to open the manhole at the Enchakkal Junction roundabout to clear the line. But when NHAI removed the roundabout as part of road widening the manhole got buried.

NHAI sources allege that while they spent crores to facilitate the shifting of utilities in the area, KWA did not respond. “KWA is yet to properly restore areas dug up for such works. They should agree to restore the portion. We have also suggested horizontal directional drilling (HDD) to reduce the impact of the work on traffic,” NHAI sources said.

However, KWA officials contend that NHAI removed the roundabout without prior information.

“We need to open manholes whenever a line is blocked. Now, with several areas affected, we are unable to do so. Currently, we draw water from the line using suction pumps, and this water is then taken to the Muttathara sewage treatment plant using tankers to control overflows,” sewerage division officials said.

They said that it was difficult to get HDD contractors for minor work. “Even for HDD, we have to dig trenches on either side of the road and traffic issues cannot be fully avoided. Despite the intervention by MLAs and MP, there has been no positive response from NHAI.”

With areas including Vallakkadavu, Karali and Enchakkal affected, the human rights commission had intervened recently. Commission chairman Justice Antony Dominic had asked NHAI to submit a report within three weeks. Social activist Ragam Rahim, in a petition, alleged that NHAI was denying permission to open the manhole.

Enchakkal Junction, which has direct access to the roads to East Fort and Vallakkadavu, is already one of the most congested junctions on the national highway.

NHAI had earlier planned an underpass here, but the proposal was scrapped following opposition from the public. It was following this that the roundabout was demolished to widen the junction.

Nagpur: Following a representation made by a delegation of students under the aegis of ‘The Platform’, the Sanvaad elocution competition organized by Save Merit Save Nation (SMSN), in association with The Times of India, has been deferred.

It was to held first at the Ambedkar College and then shifted to University Law College. Participating students were to speak on ‘Reservations in New India’.

The students met the principal of Ambedkar College and pro vice chancellor of Nagpur University Vinayak Deshpande opposing the competition. “We will hear out the students and then decide on the event in a couple of days. The event is not cancelled only postponed,” said Deshpande.

According to a release by the students, the topic is “completely against the Constitutional rights of the reserved categories SC, ST, OBC, Marathas and the religious minorities and it may create a feeling of animosity, hatred, and ill-will in the society”.

The students also did not want the event to be held at Ambedkar College as they felt “Deekshabhoomi is not meant for any political activity”.

SMSN Sanvaad convener and principal coordinator Brijesh Segan said the debate was being held to seek the opinion of the youth on ‘Reservations in New India”. “Rather than imposing our opinions, we wanted to understand the views of the youth,” he said.

According to Vijay Upadhyay, the Sanvaad convener, the organization had “recently held ‘Manthan’ where a panel discussion with all caste and community leaders was held to gather views from all segments of society”.

SMSN’s Rashmi Shukla stated that the body was only against divisive vote bank politics. “We are not against Constitutional reservation but oppose excessive reservation which has now led to availability of only approximately 1 open seat out of 10 seats in education and jobs for open category,” she said.

The competition organizers now plan to reach out to the opposing students and university.

A file picture of BS Yediyurappa greeting PM Narendra Modi on his arrival in Bengaluru on Thursday

BENGALURU: With no financial support from the Centre even four months after floods in several parts of the state, chief minister BS Yediyurappa is under pressure and it was quite palpable when he addressed the farmers’ convention in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Tumakuru on Thursday.

Yediyurappa, who is walking a tightrope on finances, is being flayed by the Congress and JD(S) for “not doing enough” to rebuild the lives of flood affected people across 22 districts of the state. The opposition is also going hammer and tongs at the Centre’s “indifference” to the state’s plight.

Officials say the Centre is yet to release about Rs 3,000 crore for flood relief and rehabilitation. So far it has released only Rs 1,200 crore. The Centre is also yet to reimburse about Rs 1,000 crore which the state paid as wages under the MGNREGA scheme. “The dues are pending since the Congress-JD(S) coalition regime,” an official from RDPR said.

When Yediyurappa formed the government by engineering defections from Congress and JD(S), he had justified his actions saying it would benefit Karnataka to have the same party in power at the Centre and state. “But, now that the Centre is not extending a helping hand, Yediyurappa is growing impatient,” said a senior BJP MLA.

“Even the state’s legitimate share of funds from the Centre is not being released on time. This has put the CM under pressure as he is finding it difficult to deliver on promises,” said state finance department officials.

Construction of roads, bridges and houses is the immediate focus in flood-affected regions. About 3 lakh houses were damaged and the government has promised compensation ranging from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. With pressure mounting on Yediyurappa to begin repair and construction of homes, he apparently sensed a perfect opportunity on Thursday to impress upon the PM to release funds, since all his efforts to seek an appointment with the PM in Delhi had failed.

Adding to Yediyurappa’s problem is the squeeze on revenue due to the economic slowdown. The government’s efforts to divert funds for flood relief from various sources including SC/ST funds have been met with severe resistance.

The shortfall in revenue is turning from bad to worse. Collections have been sluggish across three major revenue earning departments — stamps and registration, transport and commercial tax. “This year, only excise department is likely to meet its target of Rs 20,900 crore. Though, commercial tax department showed good growth at the beginning of the fiscal, it is now tapering. The overall revenue growth is likely to be muted,” an official said.

The money was transferred through e-wallet and the Brigadier registered a complaint the cybercrime cell in Jaipur.

The money was transferred on Thursday morning and on realising the fraud , the army officer registered a complaint the same evening.

The Brigadier got emotional and without verifying, transferred the money in two instalments,” said Surendra Pancholi, SHO, cybercrime police station. The officer registered a case when he realised that the number was not being used by his acquaintance anymore.

The complainant transferred Rs 1 lakh first and then again Rs 50, 000 using e-wallet. “The money was transferred using Unified Payments Interface (UPI) which essentially is the various apps which are available for online cash transactions. Fraudsters also use this method to dupe innocent people as it is very difficult to trace,” added the official.

While the complaint has been registered, no one behind the con has been identified yet and Pancholi said, “It takes a long process to trace such conmen as its takes a lot of technical tracing. We are investigating the matter but it will take some time before we can catch the accused.”

LUCKNOW: State medical education department has revised the list of essential drugs for medical colleges while releasing an elaborate drug management guideline on Friday.

The new drug list will have 839 items against 364 in the previous one.

Principal secretary, medical education, Rajnish Dubey said the new guidelines lay emphasis on procurement of generic drugs.

JAIPUR: As the mercury kept dipping in December, liquor consumption by the people of Jaipur increased by 25.3% in last the month of 2019 over the corresponding period in 2018. While in December 2018 the sale of liquor by Rajasthan State Beverages Corporation Limited (RSBCL) was worth Rs 574.59 crore in the whole state, it went up to Rs 705.99 crore in December 2019. In Jaipur, it had gone up from Rs 105.31 crore in December 2018 to Rs 131.93 crore in December 2019.

People in Jaipur woke up to the second coldest morning of December since 1964 as the minimum temperature dipped to 1°C on 30th December, 2019. It is also the time when people bask in the glory of festive season, with Christmas and New Year eve falling in the same month.

""The sale of liquor include Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL), foreign liquor, beer, wine. The country liquor is not included in it. These are the figures of what RSBCL has sold to the retailers in December last year. The retailers don't keep anything in stock. They dispose of to the consumers whatever quantity of liquor is purchased from RSBCL,"" said Sukhveer Saini, executive director, RSBCL.

The figure emerges at a time when the state government has formed a committee of senior officials to visit Bihar and study the impact of liquor ban in the state. Sources in the finance department had denied that the move was a prelude to prohibition of liquor in Rajasthan and said the purpose of the ‘study tour’ was to how better they could regulate the trade. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had also clarified that the state was not mulling over any such idea.

Meanwhile, Delhiites gulped down alcohol worth almost Rs 1,000 crore in December, sources said. According to sources, Delhi's excise department earned Rs 465 crore as duty on liquor in December 2019.

Thiruvananthapuram: The desperate appeal for help made by a city resident on social media to track down the motorist, who knocked down his wife and two-year-old son, injuring them seriously, has gone viral following which minister Kadakampally Surendran, Kerala state human rights commission (KSHRC) and child rights commission intervened. The police also recorded the arrest of the motorist, Saji Mathew (36) of Kottarakkara, who caused the accident .

Reshma, wife of Aravind Sudhakumar, and their son Arush were injured in the accident. They were travelling on a scooter, when they were knocked down by a car driven by Mathew on the state highway stretch at Gandhipuram under Kazhakoottam police station limits on December 28.

Sudhakumar, in his Facebook post, said that the motorist tried to flee without stopping to help. However, two other two-wheeler riders, who witnessed the accident, intercepted him and forced him to take the injured to hospital in his car. But, the accused, who apparently did not like being forced to help the injured, drove the car at a slow pace.

Reshma, who was worried for her son who sustained injuries on his face, had to demand him to stop the car. She then took an autorickshaw to reach the hospital. However, she noted down the registration number of the car before leaving.

Sudhakumar further said in his Facebook post that the accused did not bother to reach out to them and enquire about the condition of the injured.

His Facebook post went viral. The police were forced to track down the accused. Initially, they even directed both parties to turn up at Kazhakkoottam police station to record their statements. Learning about the accident, minister Kadakampally Surendran directed the police to visit the mother and child at their home as it was unjust to summon them to the police station.

On Friday evening the accused turned up at the station and his arrest was recorded. He was charged under sections 279 (rash driving) and 337 (causing hurt or endangering life by rash and negligent act) under IPC and section 134 (a) under Motor Vehicles Act (refusing to take steps to secure medical attention for accident victims).

Meanwhile, the police maintained that Mathew had in fact reported the accident at Kazhakkoottam police station on the same day itself. He stopped by and gave a written statement to the police while on his way to Kottarakkara. The accident occurred while he was returning home after attending the engagement ceremony of his niece.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: Connecting old monument of Azimganj Sarai with the Delhi zoo, from the Sundar Nursery side, may lead to cutting 2,000 trees, including rare sandalwood ones. While referring to this, animal activist Gauri Maulekhi has written to the Union environment and forest ministry that the plan also includes setting up a craft bazaar near the elephant enclosure and the jackal breeding centre at the zoo.

Maulekhi, who is also part of People for Animals, has sought amendments in the design to ensure that no trees are cut. She said Aga Khan Trust had not only requested the Union urban development ministry for several acres of the forest area inside the zoo for the crafts bazaar and other commercial activities but also sought permission to break the connecting wall between the zoo and the nursery to construct a new entrance to the crafts market. The entrance will be used for letting people visit the bazaar or come for orchestra etc at a fee charged by the trust, she has claimed.

This area is adjacent to the jackal breeding centre, which is not even open to public, Maulekhi pointed out in the letter dated January 3. “It is inconceivable to run a breeding centre of such shy animals in the vicinity of a bazaar. The elephant enclosure is also right next to the area,” she added.

She has urged the ministry, which is in charge of the zoo, to take steps to ensure that the zoo premises is kept undisturbed for animals and the ecology is not destroyed. The letter also claimed construction had already begun. Zoo director Suneesh Buxy, however, denied any new tree had been cut and said he was unaware of any construction.

457,['4/01/2020'],Rajasthan: Restaurants without commercial conversion can get liquor licence,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Representative image

JAIPUR: Forget the talk about alcohol prohibition in Rajasthan . Now, restaurants without having commercial conversion approval can now get a liquor licence . As per the government notification on January 1, restaurants will be given licence for six months with the payment of 75% of the existing licensing fee and the period can be extended by paying another 25% of the fees.

Restaurants are allowed to operate without the approval of the commercial conversion but till now, they were not eligible for bar licences.

According to industry, there are large number of such restaurants who are keen to have a licence, in the absence of which, some resort to selling liquor illegally.

The notification said that “restaurant bar licence may also be granted by the licensing authority to any restaurant…The licence under this rule shall be granted in the form and on the conditions as may be determined by the state government.”

A senior official of the finance department said, “We wanted to ensure that if a restaurant wants to sell liquor, let it do that in a transparent way without violating the rules. Restaurants operating without commercial conversion is covered in the amendment. While this will stop illegal sale of liquor in these restaurants, it will also add to the government’s revenue kitty. It’s a win-win proposition for both the government and the restaurants,” said a senior official of the finance department.

But the decision has divided opinion in the industry. While the government retail shop owners said that the increased competition from the resto bars will erode their market share, others said that many restaurants have invested large sums of money, but without liquor licence, they lose clients.

“Jaipur is a tourist town. Over the past few years several restaurants have opened but without liquor licence, their business prospects don’t look bright. This will certainly help the restaurant industry and also the government, which is overstretched financially,” said Rajesh Dukia, a restaurant owner.

But the government-licenced retailers are not enthused. They said new licences will further stiffen the competition, shrinking their market share.

Nilesh Mewara, president of Rajasthan Liquor Welfare Society, said, “If the government is increasing competition for us by giving more licences, they should also remove the target sale criteria as we cannot ensure 10% more sales in that environment. We have invested Rs 30 lakh for a retail shop licence whereas the restaurants pay only Rs 10 lakh as licence fee. The move will hurt our interests.”

In the past, many restaurants and hotel bars were issued penalty notices for not selling 10% more liquor and subsequently, the industry in the state protested.

File photo of Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra

NEW DELHI: With the assembly polls inching closer, the Delhi unit of Congress has set up a war room at its headquarters.

Apart from sharing content on the “failure” of AAP government in Delhi and BJP at the Centre, the volunteers in the war room will provide logistical support to the candidates after their names are announced and the campaign begins. The war room, which has 14 fixed workstations, will also have about 30 volunteers working on laptops to help the state leadership and individual candidates.

Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra said: “There will be a constant exchange of information between the candidates and party workers in the field and state office-bearers and social media experts in the war room, and the entire logistical support will be provided from here.”

For an election that may define the party’s survival in the Capital, Delhi Congress has upped its ante and taken up social media as an important tool. Both AAP and BJP have strong teams working on various social media apps to share creative videos, photos and messages with the electorate. Delhi Congress spokesperson Jitender Kochar said each volunteer would handle five constituencies and be in touch with the candidates and party workers.

“The volunteers in the war room will stay in regular touch with the election teams and provide all kind of information, including voters’ list, copies of the manifesto, report card of AAP and BJP MLAs and authentic information received through RTI applications on various government sectors, among other things, to help them connect with the electorate and convince them to vote for Congress,” Kochar said.

AICC social media head Rohan Gupta, who helped the Delhi unit set up the war room, said another important task of the volunteers would be to keep an eye on any negative publicity against Congress.

459,['4/01/2020'],"Resolution doesn’t violate Constitution, says speaker","This story is from January 4, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan, on Friday, clarified that the resolution passed by the state assembly against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was not in violation of the Indian Constitution, and discarded governor Arif Mohammad Khan’s criticisms as ‘baseless’.

“Nowhere in the Constitution it is stated that a state assembly does not have the right to pass a resolution. In fact, it ensures Parliament and assemblies their own powers and rights. When the Constitution is challenged or violated, the assembly has the responsibility to react, like every other democratic forum,” the Speaker told reporters.

Here, the CAA is in violation of Article 14, which says not to deny any person in the country equality before law or equal protection, and Article 15 which does not allow any sort of discrimination in the name of religion, caste, language or region, Sreeramakrishnan said. “The CAA does not conform to these Articles of the Indian Constitution, and the Assembly and the state government have the responsibility and liability to point out this violation, to amass opinion against it and to inform the central government. We carried out that responsibility”.

When queried, the speaker said he cannot say whether the governor has any political lenience, but criticised him for alleging that the assembly was misused. “I heard him say so. But my conviction is that the assembly should be used for raising such issues. The assembly has to reflect people’s emotions, concerns and opinions. Can we do it on street?” he asked.

“Stating that the assembly does not have the right to react on such matters is like challenging the very federal system in the country. We did not make any legislation against CAA, but was only demanding a rectification in the Act. The Indian Constitution and the federal system allow that,” he said.

Besides, the Preamble of the Indian Constitution also says that India is a secular nation, he said. “There’s no dispute that the governor heads the state. But the assembly has not done anything outside its legal jurisdiction.”

The speaker also cited precedence and said such a resolution against a central act was not new. “The Kerala assembly in 1971 had passed a resolution demanding cancellation of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA), in 2006 against an amendment in Income Tax Act and in 2019 demanding to exempt cooperative sector from the clauses under section 194 in Income Tax Act,” he said adding that Kerala assembly is very proud to have carried out a responsibility.

On the breach of privilege notice issued by the BJP in Rajya Sabha against the Kerala chief minister, the speaker said such notices wouldn’t stand as per norms. “A house does not have the right to issue such a notice against another house. The assembly has legal protection for passing a resolution. Even if such a notice is being served, it cannot be against the CM alone. It has to be issued against the speaker who allowed the resolution, the opposition leader who supported it and all the members who voted,” he added.

Jaipur: A 25-year-old man committed suicide in Samod on Friday by hanging himself from the ceiling though the reason for the same remains unknown. Cops found no suicide note and his family has been unable to give any reasons for this action.

The man was identified as Hukumichand Kumawat who hailed from Nimdi village was found hanging from the ceiling by his family.

“Kumawat was found by his family who informed us. It is still uncertain as to why he took his own life as the family also appeared to have no inkling that he was contemplating taking his own life. We did not recover any suicide note as well,” said an official of Samod police station.

The body was handed over to the family after autopsy while the cops continue to investigate the matter.

Elaborating further, the official said, “The victim was employed, so financial duress does not seem like a reason but at this juncture, we cannot rule out any possibility. We will question the family further to see if anyone of them has any idea as to why he took his own life. At present it’s a blind case in the sense that there are no clues.”

Cops are also looking at a relationship gone wrong which could have been a possible reason and a cop added, “We will check the victim’s mobile as well to see if we could get any leads behind the suicide. Probably messages and call records will also be checked. Although the family claims that the victim was in a relationship with anyone, we still have to follow up on it cause in a lot of suicide cases, relationship gone wrong is the most common reason. Matter is still under investigation.”

Nagpur: Vulnerability to cyber crimes has increased manifold with the incessant use of smartphones and therefore greater awareness should be created to shield women from this malady, said commissioner of police Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay at Nagpur Press Club, Civil Lines, on Friday.

He was speaking at ‘Cyber Safe Women’ campaign launched on the birth anniversary of social reformer and educationist Savitribai Phule. This is a joint initiative of directorate of public relation, Maharashtra Police and Press Club.

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has appealed to everyone to join the campaign that aims at spreading awareness about protection of women and children from cyber crimes. The camps were held across all the districts of the state.

Present at the seminar were divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar and principal of Dhanwate National College Surendra Jichkar.

Upadhyay said, “Recently, we started the initiative of dropping women to their home from 9pm to 5am, the time when they find it difficult to get public transport facility. This service has created goodwill between citizens and police force.”

He said, “Women have always been given immense importance in the deep-rooted system of Indian culture. Brahma, the creator of the universe, needs knowledge and wisdom which is provided to Him by Saraswati. The preserver, Vishnu, requires good fortune to maintain the universe bestowed on him by the goddess of prosperity, Laxmi. Shiva, the destroyer, gets strength from Parvati for dissolving the evil.”

In his address, Kumar said, “The problem lies with our cultural practices in rearing boys and girls differently. We encourage a kind of aggressive behaviour in men and discourage even normal behaviour in women. This is where the foundation of inequality is laid.”

The second concern, he said, is that of lack of sufficient representation to women in Parliament, police, administrative offices and health care sector. “Men themselves create complex problems and claim that it is their responsibility to solve them. It is not because of the benevolence of one section of the community that the society grows. It grows due to the efforts of every individual,” he added.

The programme was followed by a workshop where deputy police commissioner Shweta Khedkar, senior journalist Sarita Kaushik, lawyers Smita Singalkar and Anjali Vitankar, and cyber crime expert Rakesh Makhija shared their perceptions of cyber crime and common security measures.

468,['4/01/2020'],CPM asks guv not to act as BJP state chief,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The ruling CPM on Friday stepped up its attack against governor Arif Mohammed Khan against whom the party has already registered its displeasure. In response to the governor’s criticism that the passing of a resolution by Kerala assembly against the citizenship amendment act is illegal, CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan askhed Khan to clarify which law was violated by the assembly and by which law did he criticise the act of assembly.

The CPM state secretary said the governor has crossed all limits and asked him not to act like BJP state president. The post of BJP state president has been lying vacant for months after P S Sreedharan Pillai was appointed as Mizoram governor. “He is playing third rate political games. If there are any sensible RSS men, they can advise him such games wouldn’t sell in Kerala,” said Balakrishnan in a statement issued here.

“The utterings by the governor is in violation of the spirit of our Constitution. The people of Kerala have the legitimate right to know the legal basis of his criticism”, Balakrishnan said. “In the past too, state assembly passed several resolutions regarding national issued. There had been governors and elected governments in New Delhi then too. Arif Mohammed Khan is behaving in an unprecedented manner”, he said.

The CPM secretary advised the governor to read the Supreme Court judgment in Arunachal Pradesh case delivered in 2016 thoroughly. “Without an iota of doubt, the SC made it clear that the governor has no right to interfere with the business of the assembly”, he said.

On December 29, Kodiyeri Balakrishnan issued a statement criticising governor Khan for his overstepping of constitutional boundaries. The controversy triggered by the governor after the ruckus in the Indian history congress inaugural venue where his speech was obstructed by veteran historian Irfan Habeeb prompted the CPM state secretary to issue a statemen then. “If he can’t realise the greatness of the position he holds, Arif Mohammed Khan may better quit and re-start his career as full-time politician”, Kodiyeri had said then.

SIT is probing whether there was a common link between all the riots. (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The special investigating team probing the violence that occurred during the anti-CAA protests has found that at least 15 criminals , who are Bangladeshis , were involved in the clashes that took place in Seemapuri on December 20.

Sources said all of them were staying illegally in JJ colonies on the city’s borders. The Bangladeshis were earlier arrested for carrying out burglaries. Police sources said they have been identified and will be arrested soon. The SIT will now be probing who funded the protests as it suspects a foreign hand in it. The team will also visit Tihar Jail to interrogate the arrested rioters.

During the Seemapuri riots , a group protesting at the Delhi-Ghaziabad border suddenly turned violent and started pelting stones at parked vehicles. When police tried to intervene, the mob chased after the handful of cops and threw stones and broken bottles at them.

The SIT is probing whether there was a common link between all the riots. They are also trying to find out the source from which such huge gatherings at Seelampur and Daryaganj were mobilised. Some of the WhatsApp groups through which the youths were mobilised are being scanned to identify who motivated them.

It has been found that the riots were spearheaded by a handful of people. Efforts are on to establish whether they were the same set of people involved in sparking all instances of violence at Seelampur, Seemapuri and Daryaganj.

The analysis of the rumours circulated to fan the riots indicated at a well thought out strategy of someone who had been watching the developments from a distance. Police were shocked to find rioters already carrying stones and Molotov cocktails when they had reached the spot.

470,['4/01/2020'],Kochi still unsafe for blind,"Manikandan P

KOCHI: It is two-and-a-half years since Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) introduced tactile blocks, known as the braille for pavements, on select roads and metro stations to help people with limited sight navigate the city safely. But in reality, how safe is the system — a set of raised bumps and ridges — for people with disabilities when even privileged pedestrians with all their senses intact consider it to be unfriendly and dangerous?TOI took the help of Manikandan P, a blind youth from Kannur who is employed with a call centre run by Envision Trust under the Society for Rehabilitation of Visually Challenged (SRVC), to understand the effectiveness of the disabled-friendly infrastructure. Manikandan walked only a short stretch from the bus stop at Padma Junction to MG Road Oppo station, and had assistance of Rashad, who works as project coordinator for SRVC, to ensure safety; but the hardships he had to face ranged from deeply annoying to downright dangerous.The first issue Manikandan faced was the huge gaps in the tactile paving as the footpaths are not contiguous. Tactile blocks were completely absent at the Padma bus stop and the pavement stretch next to it. The slabs were uneven and rough with sloped entry points to allow vehicle access to shop fronts. The pavement from Padma Junction to MG Road station was hazardous, to put it mildly. At one point, thick electric cables lied coiled over the tactile blocks, making it frustrating for 37-year-old Manikandan to move forward.Another major issue he faced was the unfamiliarity with tactile-paving codes. While the raised ridges are pathways, raised domes indicate stop or change. With some guidance, Manikandan, who used a cane, picked the signals once he started walking inside the Metro station, where the blocks are consistent, though the zig-zag manner in which they were laid were confusing.But a major impediment he faced was at the security check at the MG Road station on the High Court side where the tactile blocks were encroached by the metal detector and the desk with baggage X-Ray screen.“The attempt is commendable but it is of little use unless it is consistent. The dotted lines were bit confusing to me but I think it would be fine if one becomes familiar with them. The level difference and poles that are erected on footpaths are a problem,” said Manikandan, who frequently travels to his hometown in Kannur and Tenkasi, where his wife resides.Kudumbasree volunteers who take care of customer facilitation and security guards at metro stations are trained to guide blind people but not many people with limited sight are using the metro. “Many are now comfortable with app-based services like Uber because it’s safe and hassle-free. It is hazardous for them to walk on city roads,” says Rashad.Manikandan took a ride on the Metro to the Maharajas’ Ground station and once he exited, the security gates put him in deep waters. The steps right after the exit gates and the pavement below had no tactile blocks, leaving him at the mercy of others.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73093527,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-664910,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/city-still-unsafe-for-blind/articleshow/73091640.cms

NEW DELHI: There were two cases of people jumping on Delhi Metro tracks and stalling train services on Friday. While one of them died, the other was saved.

In the first incident, a 42-year-old man jumped in front of a metro train at Ghitorni station and was run over by the train. However, a 55-year-old cancer patient, who had jumped in front of a train at Jhilmil metro station, was saved as the driver managed to apply the brakes on time.

According to the police, the first incident took place around 11.55am when the victim, Nitin Chandok, a resident of C Block in Saket, jumped in front of a metro train going towards Gurugram. A probe revealed that Chandok worked at a garment’s company. A few months ago, however, Chandok quit his job and opened a shop with his father and brother at Nehru Place.

Chandok had recently shifted with his family to a rented house in Gurugram. The reason for his taking the extreme step is yet to be known. Police have not recovered a suicide note from him and are questioning the family to establish the cause.

The second incident took place around the same time when Kishan Lal jumped in front of an oncoming train on the Red Line’s Jhilmil station. Eyewitnesses said that Lal had hesitated before jumping on the tracks, which gave the driver enough time to apply the brakes.

Lal was rescued by CISF personnel and taken to a hospital for treatment. It was found that he had been suffering from throat cancer for the past six years due to which he slid into depression. Doctors said Lal would be counselled by a mental health expert before being released.

NEW DELHI: Rating agency ICRA on Friday maintained a 'stable' outlook for the Indian tyre industry.Following a 12.0% and 5.5% growth in FY2018 and FY2019 respectively, domestic tyre demand is estimated to de-grow by 4-6% (volume) in FY2020 affected by sharp contraction in demand from original equipment (OE), ICRA said in a release.Vehicle production levels are currently at multi-year lows following slowdown in economic growth and infrastructure spending, weak consumer demand, tight financing environment and subdued rural demand amongst others. The replacement demand, however, skew in tyre (~67% in tonnage and 56% in volumes) insulates the industry from deep cyclicality to an extent.While the OE tyre demand is likely to de-grow by 12-14% (units) in FY2020 with sustained fall in vehicle production levels, the growth in replacement tyre demand is expected to be flattish. In tonnage terms, tyre demand de-growth is pegged at 5-7% with large contraction in segments like truck and bus (T&B), light commercial vehicle (LCV) and tractors. With expected recovery in demand from FY2021, the five-year demand outlook remains favourable at 6-8% (volume) and 5-7% (tonnage).Exports represent nearly one-fifth of tyre industry revenues and has been growing at a healthy rate of 14% in the last three years (CAGR ending FY2019) aided by favourable demand in overseas markets. However, with the global vehicle sales growth weakening in the current year, tyre exports from India have been flattish in H1 FY2020. Nevertheless, the long-term prospects for domestic tyre exporters remain favourable. Tyre imports continue to fall for the third straight year with falling demand and the impact of anti-dumping duty (ADD) on Chinese truck and bus radial (TBR) tyres, countervailing duty (CVD) and customs duty on TBR tyres and CVD on passenger vehicle (PV) tyres.On the supply front, the industry has spent capital expenditure (capex) of Rs 34,500 crore in the last ten years (ending FY2019), largely towards greenfield radial capacities in Truck and Bus, particularly over the last few years.

476,['4/01/2020'],"Security tightened at US, Israel embassies","This story is from January 4, 2020

Police and Special Cell have been asked to deploy personnel in plainclothes in Chanakyapuri and Humayun Road.

NEW DELHI: Security at the embassies of Israel and USA is being reviewed and additional intelligence officials are going to be deployed to monitor and secure the movements of diplomats in the aftermath of the assassination of Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) commander Qasem Soleimani in a US strike.

The development unfolded on Friday after Israel's defence officials announced a high-security alert for overseas delegations fearing retaliation by the Iranians.

In a closed-door meeting of intelligence and anti-terror unit officials, Delhi Police and Special Cell were asked to to deploy personnel in plainclothes in Chanakyapuri, Humayun Road and Vasant Vihar. Patrolling is also being scaled up in these areas, sources confirmed.

Foreign and domestic intelligence agencies of India and Israel are concerned about the safety of officials, particularly in the capital, because of an assassination attempt on an Israeli diplomat in Delhi in 2012. On February 13 that year, a biker tailed an Israeli embassy vehicle and placed an IED on the SUV's rear when it stopped at a traffic signal at the intersection of Aurangzeb Road and Safdarjung Road, which is close to the PM's residence.

Seconds later, there was an explosion and the Toyota Innova (registration number 109 CD 35) went up in flames. Three people, including the Israeli defence attache's wife Tal Yehoshua Korene, who was going to pick up her children from the American embassy school, were injured. She received critical injuries suffering serious spinal wounds from shrapnel.

Though the investigation by Indian and Israeli intelligence had pointed towards the role of a group of Iranian men connected with IRGC, Delhi Police's anti-terror wing - which was officially probing the case - didn't come on record blaming the group for the attack. Israel, however, was categorical in blaming Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had said, ""Iran is behind these attacks. It is the largest exporter of terrorism in the world.""

At the time, Delhi Police had ""sought details of six people of Iranian origin suspected to be involved in the conspiracy and execution of the attack"".

Later, they charged journalist Syed Mohammad Kazmi and four Iranians - Houshang Afshar Irani, the main bomber; Mohammad Reza Abolghasemi, Seyed Ali Mahdiansadr and Sedaghatzadeh Masoud. Delhi Police had also written letters rogatory to five countries - Iran, Israel, Thailand, Georgia and Malaysia - for information on the Iranian men as the attack was part of a coordinated attack occurring at multiple locations in south Asia.

477,['4/01/2020'],Exe capital dreams: Call for advanced sports infra in city,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The sports fraternity of Vizag is of the opinion that if the city were to indeed become the executive capital , Vizag’s sports infrastructure could get a significant boost.

Tipped to be a smart city, the city is a popular sporting hub. However, it is yet to have the necessary sports infrastructure. Even though successive governments have proposed many sports projects in the city over the years, most of them have not translated into action.

Speaking to TOI, N Vijay Mohan, director of physical education of Andhra University (AU) said that chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy needs to address the issue of sports infrastructure of the city. “We hope that Vizag gets international standard infrastructure if the city becomes the executive capital of the state,” Mohan added.

“A comprehensive plan is required to address the required sports infrastructure,” he added

According to people from the fraternity, the city needs stadia of high standards with synthetic, poly grass and astro turf with floodlights to organise national and international sporting events. The city also needs air-conditioned indoor stadia for badminton, basketball, volleyball, kabaddi and boxing among other indoor events, they say.

Meanwhile, RK Purushotham, general secretary of Andhra Pradesh Olympics Association (APOA) said, “The lack of sports infrastructure is a major hindrance of sports talent in the state. Vizag has the potential to host national and international events if the city is equipped with international standard grounds and stadia.”

“We expect that the government will develop sports infrastructure in the city if the executive capital proposal becomes a reality,” Purushotham maintained.

Revenue officials in Vizag have begun the exercise to identify suitable land for the proposed badminton academy of PV Sindhu. Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy had assured her of a 5 acre land allotment in Vizag for an academy.

Moreover, officials of the district sports authority said that the state government has planned to set up an integrated sports complex at the Aganampudi area in Vizag. The Visakhapatnam district administration has allotted 80 acres land to the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh (SAAP) which needs 75 acres more. At least Rs 400 crore will be required for the project, officials informed.

Olympian MV Manikyalu said, “Andhra Pradesh’s image has suffered in terms of sports as we do not have sporting icons or great stadia following the bifurcation of the state. The new government has to develop sports infrastructure in Vizag to produce talented sportspersons and to host major events.”

HAVERI: Prices hit an all-time high at Asia’s biggest chilli market in Byadagi as a quintal of the Grade A Dabbi variety sold for Rs 27,111 per quintal on Thursday. The sale broke the record of Rs 26,099, also notched up this season.

Gulappa Kannur , a farmer from Anthur-Bentur village of Gadag district who hit jackpot, was ecstatic. “I never expected this price. Last year, I sold my red chilli produce for Rs 17,500 a quintal. However, the quality of chilli is much better this year. I invested Rs 8,500 per quintal. I will get a bigger quantity in the next harvest,” he said.

Last year, Grade A chilli sold for the highest price of Rs 21,040 a quintal.

“The price of red chilli in Byadagi is likely to remain high this year because the arrival expected is less than in previous years,” said Somashekhar Nyamagouda, joint director of the Byadagi APMC Chilli market. While 54 lakh bags came into the market last year, this time, it could be less than 5 lakh, he said.

Heavy rain and floods have destroyed the chilli crop in several regions and trade has not picked up so far, said market sources. “The market season began in the first week of December but we received only 5,000-6,000 bags in the first two weeks,” said Nyamagouda. “Last week, the market eceived 40,845 bags of red chilli locally and from neighbouring states. We hope we will reach at least 5 lakh bags this year.”

Operators point to other factors too. “Chilli prices have hit an all-time high largely due to strong exports to China, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Besides, a drought last year in most producing states has led to a small carryover stock in cold storages nationally,” said Shivanand Mallanagoudra, a commission agent in the Byadagi market. Demand is also going up, and not just in the food industry. The deep red Byadagi chilli , Mallanagoudra said, is now being grown to extract oleoresin, a red oil, used in nailpaint and lipstick.

BELAGAVI: The Shiv Sena-led government in Maharashtra is “looking to resolve” within a year the border dispute over Belagavi , a close aide of Uddhav Thackeray said on Thursday, amid raging protests over the CM’s recent reference to the district as “Karnataka-occupied Maharashtra”.

Pro-Kannada outfits have accused the Sena and Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES) of raking up the politics of identity to garner votes and said recent statements over Belagavi were part of a calculated campaign.

“The border dispute is one of the top priorities of the Maharashtra government and CM Thackeray is looking at a one-year timeline to resolve the problem,” Sena media in-charge Harshal Pradhan told TOI. The disputed areas must be declared a Union Territory, “free from the clutches of Karnataka”, he said.

Soon after assuming office, Thackeray appointed senior ministers Chhagan Bhujbal and Eknath Shinde to coordinate efforts to resolve the dispute.

Thackeray’s remarks triggered protests by pro-Kannada outfits in the border village, drawing a counter from the Sena and MES. CM Yediyurappa had retorted that “not an inch” would be ceded to the neighbouring state.

Kannada activist Ashok Chandaragi said Sena is looking at regaining lost ground, having ceded the Hindutva space to BJP. “Now, Uddhav and other leaders in the top Sena echelons are feel drifting away from the hardcore Hindutva agenda and re-embracing Maratha unification may help fetch more votes. This is why two veterans have been appointed as border-in-charge ministers by Thackeray,” he said.

Dismissing the charges, Pradhan said the border issue was emotional, not political. “All political parties, including BJP, will support this cause,” he said. “Marathi-speaking people in Belagavi, Nippani, Karwar, Bidar and Balki have been oppressed for long by successive governments in Karnataka and it must end. So this is a priority just like farmers’ issues and unemployment.”

The Maharashtra CM will soon lead an all-party delegation to the central government on the issue, he said.

Contesting claims from both sides are pending before the Supreme Court after the Maharashtra government moved court in 2006 for a solution.

Belagavi district president of Karnataka Rakshana Vedike (KRV) Mahadev Talavar said the Yediyurappa government in Karnataka had failed to counter Maharashtra’s claims. A KRV team is likely to meet the CM in a day or two, he said. KRV youth president Deepak G said the time was right to hold assembly sessions in Belagavi to send out a strong message to Maharashtra.

482,['4/01/2020'],"Plot to assassinate YSRC cadre foiled; 6 held, 3 on the run","This story is from January 4, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Six people were arrested for allegedly hatching a plot to kill Maddallavalasa Chiranjeevi of YSRC in Srikakulam district. Those arrested have been identified as K Prakash, R Kanna Babu, G Rama Raju, A Yesudas, B Paramesh and P Anil Kumar. Moreover, a manhunt is on to catch three more people— Madan, K Ammi Naidu, S Tejeswara Rao.

According to the police , land disputes and political rivalry between Chiranjeevi and Ammi Naidu led to the latter to allegedly plot to kill his rival.

City police commissioner RK Meena told the media on Friday that the gang had been trying to kill Chiranjeevi for a month but did not get an opportunity.

Elaborating on the context, the police said that Chiranjeevi and Ammi Naidu were both active TDP members once. Chiranjeevi is involved several cases, including a case of rioting against him in 2017. The Etcherla police have invoked the PD Act against him.

In 2017 Chiranjeevi joined YSRC and Ammi Naidu and Chiranjeevi became sworn enemies. Police sources say Ammi Naidu had given 40 cents land belonging to Sattar Gopi, a Chiranjeevi loyalist to build a burial ground for the SC community at Fareedupeta exercising his position when the TDP government was in power. This caused tensions to rise and police say that Chiranjeevi’s followers too had tried to kill Ammi Naidu.

Once the YSRC formed the government in 2019, Chiranjeevi allegedly began harassing Ammi Naidu further, say police. A vengeful Ammi Naidu contacted a scribe named Killi Prakash who had a prior dispute with Chiranjeevi.

Prakash put Ammi Reddy in touch with supari killer Rajana Kanna Babu against a supari of Rs 50 lakh. The duo had paid Rs 4 lakh as advance. Prakash had also bought five mobile phones and some knives for the purpose. The gang had even conducted recces to murder Chiranjeevi.

A few days ago, the city task force police led by ACP A Trinad Rao arrested six people from the gang and recovered Rs70,000 cash, five mobile phones and some knives.

484,['4/01/2020'],Mumbai: Rattled BJP MLA’s trust clears Rs 2 crore dues,"Sunil Rane

MUMBAI: BJP MLA Sunil Rane’s Atharva Education Trust at Malad paid its property tax dues of Rs 2.3 crore after BMC threatened to auction its property along with 227 others.On Thursday, the BMC had published the list of defaulters and the pending dues in two newspapers. The name of Atharva trust was also mentioned.BMC officials claimed that the dues add up to Rs 12,000 crore, which are pending because of court cases and other disputes. Another Rs 1,000 crore every year is lost to fraudulent practices, corruption and faulty system of calculation, and officials are now trying to fix the gaps to avoid getting pulled up during audits.For instance, on a 60-storey building in Central Mumbai, the BMC has been charging property tax only up to 25 floors because the occupation certificate (OC) received is up to that floor and is pending for the floors above. The rule says tax must be computed once construction begins and the rate changes once the OC is granted. If a building in incomplete, the BMC needs to charge the rate fixed for residential purposes for the portion that received OC and commercial rate on the pending portion. Officials say that in such cases, the information fed to the computer is manipulated, thereby causing loss to the BMC.The officials came to know about the corrupt practices recently while preparing the list of defaulters and flats under 500 sq ft to grant them exemption in property tax. Officials stated that many defaulters, mainly builders, use their political influence and bribe officials to reduce their property tax burden by manipulating the rule. “When something is mentioned in the rule, which is approved by the Standing Committee and the corporation, then the tax should be calculated according to that. There should be no scope of use of discretionary power to reduce such taxes by changing the method, which happened in the past in many cases and increases scope of corruption,” an official said.The BMC charges educational institutions as per the rates decided for commercial establishment unless it is clarified that underprivileged children are also provided education. The charges are then based on tax fixed for residential buildings.Sunil Rane demanded that the BMC should devise a proper system after consulting experts. “How many properties the BMC had auctioned in the last few years to recover the pending dues? Instead of threatening people, the BMC should correct their rules,” he said. Sangeeta Hasnale, assistant municipal commissioner (assessment and collection) said: “Our intention in not to harass anyone, but to ensure that people should pay their dues on time for public work. In the past we have noticed that whenever we issued auction notices, people either pay up or approach court against auction.”",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73092744,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-89534,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rattled-bjp-mlas-trust-clears-rs-2-crore-dues/articleshow/73092734.cms
485,['4/01/2020'],Edu dept shifts to e-grievance system,"This story is from January 4, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The state department of school education has developed an online public grievance system in order to improve its current grievance redressal mechanism. The new system is expected to help parents and students by dispensing with the need to visit education department offices in mandal/district/state headquarters. The brochure for the online grievance system was released by education minister Adimulapu Suresh on Friday.

The new system will allow the complainant to register a grievance from any corner of the state, in addition to ensuring transparency and speedy disposal of complaints.

The department receives complaints numbering in the thousands every month, and relating to the mid-day meal scheme, infrastructural deficiencies in schools, encroachment of school lands, examinatons, textbooks, syllabus and IT infrastructure.

Speaking to TOI, commissioner of school education, V Chinaveerabhadrudu, said they have made the system formally operational from January 1. “However, we will continue receiving offline and in-person grievances for the next few months and computerise these with the help of a separate computer system and computer assistant. This is aimed at fully discouraging the offline grievance system for ensuring effective monitoring and disposal of grievances in the online mode. We want to see that no person comes all the way to the school education commissionerate, secretariat, or the district education officer’s office from their village or town to file a complaint, but they shift completely to online system,” he said.

Any person or party with a grievance on a related matter may file the grievance at the website of the commissionerate of school education with relevant details. They can also submit the supporting documents/photos in a protected document format (PDF). Once a complaint is filed on the portal, the commissioner will receive an SMS. The grievance will be allocated to the respective officer of the department. The complainant can track the status of the complaint at each stage and will receive SMS updates on its progress.

Visakhapatnam: The Special Investigation Team ( SIT ) probing the alleged tampering of government land records is likely to submit an interim report on January 10.

The SIT chief Vijay Kumar on Friday told media that there were violations in land allotments, issuances of no objection certificates. “Officers ranging from mandal revenue rank, collectorate and higher level officials were involved in some cases. We will name the beneficiaries and the officers in our report,” Vijay Kumar said.

YV Anuradha, member, SIT, said they would recommend criminal action against a few officers for violation of rules. “We will examine whether the officers had followed the procedure or not,’ she said.

The SIT had focused on three subjects – change of classification of land, most probably 22 A, NOC lands given to ex-servicemen and political sufferers and government lands allotted to private institutions and individuals.

Of the 266 petitions on land classification change, 257 were referred to tahsildars and 111 reports reached the SIT. Sixty-one petitions were rejected, 19 cases examined and recommended to the collector to delete 22 A on those lands.

Bhaskara Rao, member, SIT, said they would recommend action against the officers found involved in tampering of records.

“We have identified the officers who were involved in the illegal activity. If necessary, we will go for field verification of land,” he said.

The SIT said it has informed petitioners about the status of their petition, including petitions were rejected or accepted.

The SIT received 43 NOC petitions and examined 68 petitions given to the previous SIT—30 cases were examined and would be part of the interim report.

Visakhapatnam: TDP cadres from Pendurthi in Visakhapatnam staged a protest on Saturday urging authorities to save the local irrigation tank— the Veera Raju Cheruvu from being illegally acquired.

The TDP activists alleged that local YSRC MLA, A Adeep Raj was responsible for the same. Bandaru Appala Naidu, in-charge of TDP in Pendurthi alleged that 8.6 acres of land was being illegally occupied. He added that the tank was the irrigation life-line for some of the villages around such as Saripalli, Rampuram and Golisikottu.

MLA A Adeep Raj rubbished the allegations stating, “This is nothing but plain mudslinging by the local TDP leadership. The land that they are talking about was a clean purchase made decades ago in 1988. We have all the documents in place, all the reports given are in our favour.”

He added that this was being done to make short-term gains in the local body polls.

CHENNAI: The city corporation has urged dog lovers, animal welfare activists and NGOs and anyone involved in feeding community dogs to register with it, saying it had received several complaints from residents’ associations about the activity inconveniencing others.

Corporation officials said some residents had complained of the area where community dogs are fed being littered. “They (animal lovers) are well within their rights to feed these community dogs. We are seeking this information only to add to our database so that we can work together with them in ensuring the welfare of the community animals. Also, we will issue them an advisory to follow while feeding dogs so that there is no conflict with residents,” said Dr Kamal Hussain, city veterinary officer, Chennai corporation.

Another official said that they wanted to get in touch with individuals or groups that feed stray dogs so that some advisory can be given... “Instead of explaining to the residents who complain, it is better to appeal to those who feed the community dogs,” he added.

The veterinary officer said that individuals and NGOs can also help the civic body in identifying stray dogs affected by skin diseases and those that are yet to be neutered. It will help in the civic body’s ‘rabies free city’ campaign. As on date, a total of 62,266 stray dogs have been administered antirabies vaccine, he said.

Officials said that work was pending in only Thiruvottiyur (Zone 1) and Kodambakkam (Zone 10).

In 2019, officials of Greater Chennai Corporation had launched the rabiesfree campaign in Madhavaram (Zone-3), where 8,846 dogs were administered the vaccines. The drive was soon extended to other zones. Madhavaram and Ambattur (Zone 7) together have more than 8,000 community dogs, the most in the city, while the least number of dogs are in Royapuram (Zone 5) — 2,759.

After vaccination, the dogs will be marked with vegetable dye so that the same dog is not caught again. Dog lovers and NGOs have been asked to register with the civic body before January 15 at vetsec59@gmail.com

The northeast monsoon has ended and groundwater in the city has improved in all zones except Tiruvottiyur and Ambattur where there has been a marginal decrease compared to November.Metrowater measures groundwater across the city’s 15 zones every month from shallow observation wells.A Metrowater official said Tiruvottiyur and Ambattur fall in the added areas of Metrowater and they are yet to get piped water. “Work is in progress to supply water through pipelines. Residents in these areas are totally dependent on groundwater. After the monsoon, they have begun drawing the water regularly. This led to a marginal decrease in the groundwater table,” he said.A marginal fall was observed in Teynampet where the groundwater level was at 4.62m in November and went down to 4.66m in December. In Kodambakkam, the water table stood at 5.55m in November and fell to 5.66m in December.Hydrogeologist J Saravanan said Kodambakkam has clayey soil with shale, a fine grained sedimentary rock formation, beneath. “This kind of soil will not face severe depletion. Teynampet has alluvial soil for 60ft followed by hard rock. In this soil too, there will not be alarming depletion of groundwater,” he said.Water table has improved in most areas in south Chennai. Levels have gone up in Alandur, Adyar, Perungudi and Sholinganallur. In Alandur, groundwater was available at 4.63m in November. After the recent spells of rain, it has touched 4.05m. In Adyar, the level has risen to 3.98m from 4.21m. In Perungudi and Sholinganallur, the levels in November 2018 were 3.78m and 3.45m. In December, it touched 3.15m and 2.68m respectively.Despite a 17% monsoon deficit, the groundwater level across the city has risen when compared to December 2018. With the monsoon failing in 2018, the groundwater table began to fall rapidly from February as the demand for water went up. With Metrowater rationing supply, residents switched on their borewells more frequently to pump out groundwater. By May 2019, seawater intrusion was reported from Royapuram, Triplicane and Royapettah. Due to this the bore wells were not used by the residents, added the Metrowater official.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73092761,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-310702,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/monsoon-ends-level-of-groundwater-up-in-chennai/articleshow/73092749.cms

MUMBAI: In yet another incident of violence against medicos, a junior doctor was allegedly slapped and manhandled by the relatives of a patient at the civic-run BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central on Friday. The assault took place soon after the doctor conveyed the news of the 31-year-old woman’s death to her relatives.

Nair dean Dr Ramesh Bharmal said a police complaint was lodged immediately. Senior inspector of Agripada police station Selvaram Agawane said: “After the patient passed away, the accused slapped the doctor and manhandled him. We have registered a case against the deceased’s mother Goramma Kamble, Krishna Kamble, Rajesh Kamble, Sambhu Kamble.” They will be arrested after the woman’s last rites are performed.

In his police statement, resident doctor Navin Jha said the patient was admitted on December 25 with fever and stomach pain. She had also developed kidney failure and neurological complications. Jha said the family was regularly updated about her ‘critical condition’. On Friday, around 8.15am, her heart stopped and doctors tried to revive her but failed.

Jha told cops that when he informed the relatives waiting outside the ward about her death, they hurled abuses. Krishna and others ran towards Jha in an aggressive manner. Though hospital staffers came to Jha’s rescue, Krishna slapped him. Jha, who has been with Nair hospital since 2017, couldn’t be reached for a comment.

Bharmal said the body has been sent to JJ Hospital for autopsy. “We have counselled the doctor and spoke to Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors members. Unfortunately, it’s a behavioural problem and doctors often find them at the receiving end which can’t be tolerated,” he said.

Special development fund to be created, says Puri

NEW DELHI: In a move to woo over 40 lakh residents of 1,731 unauthorised colonies, ahead of the crucial assembly elections in the capital, the BJP government at the Centre started giving ownership rights by handing over conveyance deeds and registry papers to 20 people on Friday.“It’s just a beginning and more people, who have been waiting for it for 11 years, will get the ownership rights of properties in the coming days,” said Union minister for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri at the event held at his office. This will be under Pradhan Mantri Unauthorised Colonies in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojana (PM-UDAY).Taking a swipe at AAP, Puri said the ruling party had earlier doubted if the government would bring a bill on the issue and later exhorted people to insist on registry which had now been given. The money collected by the Centre would go to a ‘special development fund’ to speed up providing of amenities in these colonies. “The local bodies have been asked to budget for this and prepare layout plans,” he said.The BJP, which has been out of power in Delhi for 21 years, has made regularisation of unauthorised colonies and giving ownership rights to residents its main poll plank. The voting pattern of the residents of these colonies will decide the poll outcome in at least half of the 70 assembly constituencies. The elections are due early next month and an announcement is likely to be made soon.Those who got the papers belonged to Raja Vihar, which has come up on agricultural land, and Suraj Park, which is on government land, in Rohini assembly constituency. It is currently represented by the leader of the opposition in the assembly, Vijender Gupta of BJP. Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and senior officers of the ministry of housing and urban affairs and DDA were present on the occasion.Addressing a press conference, Puri said the central government had ensured that the beneficiaries get both conveyance deeds and registration papers. He added that a team of DDA officials had also helped them get the conveyance deeds registered at the sub-registrar office of the Delhi government.While those having properties on government land get conveyance deeds from DDA, those who have houses built on private or agricultural land get an authorisation slip. The minister said the charges of conveyance deeds fixed by the Centre were so less that they saved lakhs of rupees. “One applicant, who has a four-storeyed house on a 41.8 square metre plot, paid just Rs19,400 and saved Rs 24 lakhs, while another person paid Rs 89,100 and saved Rs 60 lakhs,” said Puri.However, when asked if the AAP government had been involved in the process, Puri said “more I deal with them, the more I get amazed at their capacity to derail the process.” A senior DDA official, however, said that with the number of people getting the conveyance deeds likely to increase in the coming days, the Delhi government will be asked through “appropriate channels” to strengthen the capacity of its sub-registrar offices.DDA vice-chairman Tarun Kapoor said more than 57,000 people have so far registered on the portal and over 3,500 applicants have successfully uploaded documents. “For the latter, a verification process will soon be carried out and teams will reach their residences for geo-tagging. They will get conveyance deeds and registry papers after that,” he said.In Video: Delhi: 20 people become owners at illicit colonies",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73092775,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-367752,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-illegal-colonies-20-people-now-owners/articleshow/73092764.cms

07:40Gemopai Astrid Lite electric scooter review

NEW DELHI: We are moving towards an electric revolution, quite literally. The number of electric vehicles I've sampled in the last few months nearly matches internal combustion-powered engines. Here I'm today with the story of Gemopai Astrid Lite, which is trying to take small strides into the competitive world.The stance is athletic, so much so that, I preferred the design over many of its rivals. Sports, you may call it, Astrid Lite sports edgy cuts and creases in the body profile, LED head and tail lamp units and digital instrumentation. Available in five colour combinations, the electric scooter sits on 10-inch alloy wheels and hydraulically suspended. The built quality is decent, however, the bite from the brakes could have been better.The 1.7kWh battery pack powers the 2.4 kW motor, offering a maximum range of 100 kilometers against a full charge. That, however, comes in ECO mode, where your speed is restricted to 40 kmph. Gemopai Astrid Lite gains speeds over 60 kmph in Sports mode at the expense of a lesser range. The battery takes around four hours to fully charge.Astrid Lite is priced at Rs 80,000 (on-road) and is a vital cog in Gemopai's wheel to churn its presence in the market. Take a look at the review to know more about ride quality, handling, aesthetics, and verdict of Astrid Lite.",auto,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73092822,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1387656,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//auto/reviews/gemopai-astrid-lite-electric-scooter-review/articleshow/73092824.cms

The valuables stolen from murder victim Rosina Shaikh’s house

MUMBAI: A 33-year-old bar waitress had been found dead in her rented Dahisar flat, and the autopsy was inconclusive. After her relatives alerted cops that valuables were missing, CCTV footage from the building showed a man entering late at night, but there was nothing to link him to the death.Except, there was a green apple vodka bottle in the flat and a set of keen investigators. The police noted down the bottle’s batch number and zeroed in on the buyer, who turned out to be the man seen in the building’s CCTV footage.Swapan Roidas, 32, a jewellery worker, was tracked down to Kolkata, arrested and brought to Mumbai on Thursday on charges of murdering Rosina Shaikh, 33. He claimed Shaikh was blackmailing him, and that he used cash stolen from her house to buy a flight ticket to Kolkata and fled soon after murdering her.Shaikh was found dead on December 29, and the autopsy could not conclude the cause of death. Hunting for clues, the cops came across glasses and a bottle of green apple vodka. “It was a brand we weren’t familiar with. So we got the batch number and went around wine shops in Dahisar to find out which shop had stocked this batch. We got a confirmation from Smita Wines,” said a police officer.Investigators examined CCTV footage from the shop. “The suspect seen entering Shaikh’s building was the same person who had bought vodka from Smita Wines. We learnt he was engaged in jewellery polishing and lived in Dahisar,” said an officer. The police went through Shaikh’s cellphone records and used technical investigation tools to track down Roidas’ location in Bengal.Roidas and Shaikh were introduced three years ago at the bar where she worked and they grew close. Roidas claimed that whenever he brought her money, she treated him well. But if he failed to pay, she showered profanities. Shaikh also threatened that she would tell his wife about their affair.The police suspect the two had a fight over money, and Roidas strangled her with a pillow and a towel. “He took a shower, dried himself with the same towel, and ransacked the apartment. He left with two mangalsutras, anklets, four rings, gold bracelet, nose pin, four cellphones, Rs 1.2 lakh in cash and even her house keys,” said a cop. His wife and children in Bengal were unaware of the murder.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73092828,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110117,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-green-apple-vodka-bottle-leads-to-murder-accused/articleshow/73092823.cms
