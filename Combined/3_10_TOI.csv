Lactating mothers/females in heat and are not allowed.

Excitable/unsociable/unsocialised dogs to be on leash, always.

In case your dog injures any other dog, you are responsible for all the treatment.

Always take the pet parents’ permission before touching a dog.

Complete all vaccinations for your pet before going on an outing.

All dogs are territorial, so have the first meeting on a neutral ground.

Socialise step by step. Have your pet on a leash, and make him/her walk next to the new peer they are interacting with. Let them sniff each other. Once they are comfortable with each other, let them interact.

Be civic, responsible pet parents. When in a public space, pick up after your pet.

Expose your pet to animals that have not been vaccinated — they run the risk of contracting infections.

l Let your pet run free without monitoring. Seeing other pets or unruly kids at the park might unwittingly make your dog antsy.

If your pet looks uncomfortable, do not push him/her to take part. It is not mandatory for your pet to be a social butterfly.

Consider events held at dog parks, pet festivals or play dates as a chance for you to socialise — your pets are your priority.

When Swati N heard that her neighbourhood café had become pet-friendly, her joy knew no bounds, as she could now take her furry buddy along, as she sipped on her favourite latte and her dog munched on a special doggie treat. But their happiness was short-lived, when other enthusiastic pet parents began showing up and a cacophony ensued. “When we got to the café, there were already a few other pet parents with their dogs in tow. We found ourselves a corner and were enjoying our time out, when one pooch that was off its leash decided to wander over. My dog, Casper, was startled and then began growling, much to the displeasure of others around, as their dogs then joined in for a bark off,” she says.Play dates, trips to the park and pet festivals, designed to keep your furry friend happy, are commonplace now, but here’s the thing, you can’t just introduce your dog to a bunch of other pets and expect everything to be hunky dory. There may be the odd growl or snap, or worse, full-blown fight. In fact, experts say that your pooch should be allowed to socialise only after the requisite emotional preparation. Subhadra Cherukuri, a canine behaviourist, explains that the first four months of a dog’s life define their socialising skills. “The connections dogs form — be it with their four-legged peers, human pals, surroundings or even inanimate objects — are defined be the experiences they have in the first four months. And these experiences, positive or negative, frame their personality for a lifetime,” she explains.At our dog park, we have started a social media hall of shame where we feature irresponsible pet parents who fail to pick up after their pets. Careless pet parents like them can end up ruining the whole experience, not just for themselves but for other participants as well. We have set of guidelines that pet parents need to follow if they wish to attend any of our events held — Priya Chetty-Rajagopal, pet parent, BengaluruEvery puppy learns the fundamentals of socialising from its mother and litter mates. The first 60 days, therefore, are crucial, and the pups should not be taken away from the mother during that time. In their eagerness, pet parents adopt pets too soon, and take them to parks or play dates as soon as possible. Due to the lack of experience among pets and their parents, these interactions often get out of hand, making pets aggressive and fearful. And the resulting phobia or temperament is extremely difficult to resolve— Subhadra Cherukuri, a canine behaviouristBy entering the park, it is assumed that you have read these rules, understand them and are willing to follow them...",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74551804,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-182247/74551804.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/is-your-pooch-etiquette-ready-for-a-public-outing/articleshow/74551804.cms
1,['10/03/2020'],Shoot at Site: Who is Arun Vijay chasing in Sinam?,"It is well past midnight, but the crew of Sinam shows no signs of exhaustion. Arun Vijay and Kaali Venkat — who play cops in the film and are out investigating a case — are sitting inside an autorickshaw, and director GNR Kumaravelan is giving them instructions. He then has an in-depth discussion with cinematographer Gopinath about a scene. Veteran actor Vijayakumar, who has turned producer with this project, is closely monitoring everything. As Kumaravelan calls ‘action’, the rickshaw moves, and the camera crew follows the auto in another vehicle. The filmmaker and cameraman finish the take, but they decide to go for a few more retakes till they are pleased with the output.They then take a short break, only to prep for the next scene. The filmmaker tells us, “It’s an action drama — there’s crime and then, there are various emotions at play. We zeroed in on Sinam as the title because the plot justifies anger at certain situations. We often consider anger as a negative character trait, but this film says that not getting angry at some situations is unfair. Arun plays Paari, a straight forward sub-inspector, and audience will be able to identify with his problems. He lives in a government quarters and has only a bullet with him to save himself and his family. Paari is a perfectionist who yearns for justice. He reacts out of sheer disappointment when something goes wrong in his professional life.”Palak Lalwani and Kaali Venkat essay crucial roles in the movie, which has music by Shabir. “He has composed three songs and a theme,” adds Kumaravelan, “We have shot in and around Chennai, in live locations. We ensured that we didn’t shoot in locations that are familiar to the audience.”I play a constable who worked in the police station before Arun takes charge there. This sequence involves both of us searching for an accused. I have played a cop before, but this one is slightly different in terms of body language and appearance. I play a 45-year-old in it — a well-wisher of the rotagonist.- Kaali Venkat, actorWe have made sure to not include unnecessary elements in the story. The script only has those aspects which the narration requires. I’m quite excited about the way the project has shaped up — I feel a sense of satisfaction now.— Vijayakumar, producerI have known Kumaravelan for more than 20 years. This is my second film with Arun after Thadam. The script of Sinam is such that it has elements which could cater to all sections of audience.

3,['10/03/2020'],Meet the Bengaluru conservationist who is using fish to protect rivers,"In a day and age when the planet’s shrinking green coverage continues to raise alarm, it comes as no surprise that a few enterprising individuals take it upon themselves to make a difference and try and save the earth. One such is namma ooru’s Neethi Mahesh, the recipient of a The Habitats Trust Conservation Hero Grant, for her work on the Mahseer fish river habitat. In fact, Neethi recently collaborated with the The Karnataka Forest Department to publish the Riparian (Interface between land and water) Profile of the Dubare Reserve Forest, a guide meant to restore, protect and enhance the flora found in the stretches falling under the protected area framework.I have been studying river ecology for close to seven years, but wanted to try a different approach that can be used in river conservation. At the time, I wanted to focus on freshwater fish and see whether they can be used as indicator species to come up with conservation measures, because they are not protected by the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. There is a lot of illegal fishing, including the use of dynamite, which has wiped out the freshwater fish population in most of our rivers. The only areas where they are protected are inside wildlife reserves, sanctuaries, national parks or reserve forests, but there also a lot of poaching happens. The Fisheries Department has a conservation act that allows for certain stretches of rivers to be declared fish sanctuaries. So, I wanted to try and use Mahseer fish as an indicator species to try and come up with conservation measures for the river.My first riparian corridor observation was an interaction between a Malabar Giant Squirrel and Mahseer fish from a river in the Western Ghats. I could see the fish feeding on bits of fruit and seeds dropped by the squirrel. This led to various questions, which eventually took shape as a research project highlighting the Mahseer fish river habitat, guarded by a healthy riparian forest in Coorg.My work documenting riparian flora began with a project focused on Mahseer fish and its habitat, called Spatial Ecology and Conservation of Mahseer, in the Western Ghats region, in 2015. The flora documentation was carried out with the help of the Jenu Kuruba (honey collectors) tribals in 2017, using their knowledge to map and document the species of flora along the river bank at Dubare Reserved Forest. This work was recognised by Karnataka Forest Department as an area that requires more attention.There are many varieties of the Mahseer fish, and scientists are still trying to work out the taxonomy of all the different species found in our waters. But knowing the ecology is just as important to figure out where and how they can declare certain stretches of river as fish sanctuaries. So, you can bring in conservation measures using fish sanctuaries for rivers. Unlike forests that get protected as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, not all rivers receive that kind of attention and are pretty much no-man’s land, because they belong to so many different players and there is no single authority you can point fingers at.The use of dynamite and poaching were quite rampant within protected areas earlier. It has reduced now, as the forest department has recognised the need to protect fresh water fish, even though it is not a part of The Wildlife Protection Act.Rivers are largely surrounded by agroforests and cultivated land in non-urban landscapes. The presence of resorts in forests has only strengthened monitoring and, thereby, controlled illegal and unsustainable fishing practices within protected areas in collaboration with the forest department.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74551299,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-308657/74551299.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/meet-the-bengaluru-conservationist-who-is-using-fishes-to-protect-rivers/articleshow/74551299.cms
4,['10/03/2020'],Pandrikku Nandri Solli is about the hunt for a pig statue,"Director Bala Aran is elated with the responses that the trailer of his film Pandrikku Nandri Solli has been getting. “It is a dark comedy centred around a treasure hunt narrated in a non-linear pattern,” says the director and adds that the black humour will remind audiences of films like Soodhu Kavvum and Moodar Koodam.The story, he reveals, revolves around a pig statue believed to have healing powers that is brought to India during the 10th century. “Over the years, it is lost. In the present day, the cops and the villain’s gang are searching for it. Meanwhile, the hero, who aspires to become a director, ends up getting a clue as to its whereabouts. So, the race between these three parties and whether they find the statue are what the plot is all about,” he elaborates.Nishanth, a newcomer, plays the lead in this film which also has Chella of the YouTube channel Nakkalites, Vijay Sathya, Joe Malloori and M Chandrakumar, who wrote the novel (Lock Up) on which Visaaranai was based, in crucial supporting characters.On the intriguing title, he says, “It is a phrase from a riddle. I have heard it when I was young, but it became popular thanks to Vadivelu, who used it in his dialogue in Imsai Arasan 23am Pulikesi. Since the pig is a central element in this film, we decided to go with this title.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74552492,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1132456/74552492.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/pandrikku-nandri-solli-is-about-the-hunt-for-a-pig-statue/articleshow/74552492.cms
5,['10/03/2020'],Motion capture technology brings Teddy alive on screen,"The makers of Rajinikanth-starrer Kochadaiiyaan did it for their CG stereoscopic entertainer. And now, the makers of Arya and Sayyeshaa’s Teddy have done it for their film. What, you ask? Use motion capture (mo-cap) technology. Yes, Teddy, the makers say, is the second film — a Tamil language one, again — to use the technology extensively to bring to life a teddy-like character.In an interview with us, director Shakti Soundar Rajan had revealed that the computer-generated special character will have screen presence of more than an hour in the film. And now, he informs us that he has relied on motion capture technology, which was first experimented within the country by the makers of Kochadaiiyaan. He says, “Unlike the Rajinikanth-starrer, ours isn’t an animated movie. The technology has been used only for one particular character. We roped in an artiste to bring the special character, which will appear for 80 minutes, live on screen.”Shakti adds, “This is the first time that an Indian company has worked to create a special character using computer graphics (CG); the CG work for films like 2.0 happened in foreign studios. Teddy will have more number of CG shots than my previous release, Tik Tik Tik. We are done with 50 per cent of the work.”Mo-cap broadly refers to the process of recording movements of objects or people. And in filmmaking terms, it means, recording actions of actors and using those movements and information to animate digital character models using 2D or 3D computer animation. The actors perform wearing a motion capture suit, which has wires attached to a computer, and technicians use that information to animate the character. There are other forms of motion capture technology, like facial capture and performance capture.Director Shankar had used a basic form of mo-cap and 3D holograph for the song Kannodu Kanbathellam in Jeans, which featured two Aishwarya Rais dancing on the stage. The makers of Maattrraan reportedly used facial capturing for a small sequence.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74552457,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-979362/74552457.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/motion-capture-technology-brings-teddy-alive-on-screen/articleshow/74552457.cms

8,['10/03/2020'],naragunda bandaya: Raksh and Shubha Poonja get chatty about Naragunda Bandaya,"The upcoming Kannada film Naragunda Bandaya turned out to be an eye-opening experience for its lead actors, Raksh and Shubha Poonja . And they tell us that it will prove to be so for the audience as well. The Nagendra Magadi directorial focuses on presenting a slightly fictionalised version of the historic revolt of the farmers of Naragunda. Here, while Raksh plays a farmer called Veerappa Kadlikoppa , who had a pivotal role in the uprising, Shubha is his love interest, Rani. The excitement of portraying such a story on screen and the experiences of interacting with villagers during the shoot, was evident in their conversation with us. Excerpts…We used to wake up at around 5 am every day, and head to the location which was 40 kms away from the hotel we were staying at. We shot in March and April, and the weather was quite hot. There was barely any shade around, and we could not have vanity vans close by, given that there were wide angle shots and the vans could not be seen in the frame.But the good part about shooting there had to do with the people of that village that we got to interact with. For instance, our characters in the film speak the Uttara Karnataka dialect. It became easier for us to speak the dialect on the set, because of our interactions with the localities. We heard their stories and chatted about experiences. We were often invited to eat at their homes.The localites were on the set most of the time, talking to us and watching the shoot as well — so much so that they had even memorised all the dialogues.Yes, there was an incident involving Raksh and a horse. (chuckles)See, there was this horse that would do a dance move every time I mounted it. It was strange. We eventually found out that the horse moved that way out of training and habit — it had been part of many wedding processions. So, as soon as he heard music, he would lift himself up and move his hooves. The script did not demand that sort of talent, so we finally had him replaced.Water scarcity is a real problem. Being in the city, we do not even understand half the struggles people in the villages undergo because of this. Women walk long distances just to be able to get enough water for the survival of their families. At one location that we filmed at, there was a pond with water that seemed contaminated. Yet, left with no other choice, people would dip a white cloth in it, strain the water into a container and use it for drinking and bathing. Incidents like these opened our eyes to the issues people faced.It also made us realise that this film is pivotal in conveying the current state of affairs, and these real stories of farmers and the people who live here, to today’s generation. The title of our film also refers to this. Naragunda is the place in Karanataka where this important Bandaya (protest) took place.While we set out to tell this important story from history, the struggles here have not stopped. Our film team has also decided to set up a relief fund. All returns from this film will be channelized towards building a canal at this village, which is the need of the hour.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74552258,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-171270/74552258.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/raksh-and-shubha-poonja-get-chatty-about-naragunda-bandaya/articleshow/74552258.cms

I wasn’t... mine was a crisis of whether to pursue my dream or take care of my responsibility. For Champak (the character in 'Angrezi Medium') the dilemma is whether to let my daughter chase her dream or not... perhaps it would have been my father’s dilemma if he was alive. The crisis is of the father, not of the child, in this scenario. My mother was sure she wanted me not to chase my dream and stay with her, which, I recall, gave me lot of heartache. The culmination of Champak’s decision is perhaps what I would have wanted my mother to do... Let the child fly!”In 2017, Irrfan had made the point that “A film which does not have songs, which does not make too much of noise, people start calling it an art film; that is the tragedy of our times. This is a new kind of cinema which is emerging, and I think it has to pick up and it has to become bigger before Hollywood actually gulps you.” Would he place projects such as 'Hindi Medium' and 'Angrezi Medium' in that ‘new kind of cinema’? “Yes I would, and this new kind of cinema is evolving and earning money because people are getting the taste of characters and new stories... the actors are getting their due and sticking to their guns. A whole lot of new actors are now on the horizon who are not typical ‘hero’ or ‘heroines’. They are new characters. And this will grow. Hollywood still has power because of their finesse, but Indian content is definitely gaining momentum... it’s there to stay. Though the publicity is the same, just as the older content was publicised. The film is perhaps much fresher than the publicity!” he jests.Like in 'Hindi Medium', his character in 'Angrezi Medium' is not averse to bending rules, though in an endearing manner. Post 'Slumdog Millionaire', Danny Boyle had said that Irrfan had “an instinctive way of finding the moral centre of any character”. From the inspector in 'Slumdog' to the kidnapper in 'Madaari' to the father finding all sort of options to support his daughter in this project, how does he go about understanding what his characters do, even when – especially when – they aren’t always heroic? His nuanced response is what you would have expected. “It’s important to find the moral centre because otherwise one would never be able to relate. To play a character’s inside world it’s important to find his moral fabric. I can’t be judgemental while looking at a character. For the character to work for me, I have to find his emotional world. Even if I played Hitler, I would need to find out what he does, how he does it and when he does what.”“Stories are beyond judgment”, he adds. “They are there to leave you with an impression – sometimes sad, sometimes happy, sometimes touched, to leave you misty-eyed with a smile, or angry. That’s where one explores. There should be always room for the audience to explore beyond judgement. For that I need to connect very strongly with the character.”In his note from London in 2018, Irrfan had said, “People have been wishing me well, praying for me, from all over the world. People I know, people I don’t even know.” Even though he isn’t stepping out to promote his film, his fans have been simultaneously “inside very emotional” about his personal battle, and “outside very happy” at his return to the big screen, just like his character in the trailer. How much do their vibes and messages drive him? “It is a reassurance”, is his simple response. “Their wishes are like guiding angels that keep replenishing me. I had thought out of sight might be out of mind.” That, of course, hasn’t been the case. He explains further that his engagement on social media began on PR advice but served to remind him that his fans hadn’t forgotten him in the least. “As my PR says, ‘sir, Insta mein daalte rahiye, Facebook etc also... bahut important hai...’ I was always kind of amused with social media. But when this (fans wishing and praying for him) happened, I was reassured that I wasn’t out of mind just because I was out of sight. I was always against publicity of a film. But I never knew it will manifest this time in this way!”We had gone across when Irrfan was shooting at Revla Khempur near Udaipur last year. The pain, the fatigue, the physical challenge was visible. Yet, at the same time, Homi and him were posting memes online and laughing incessantly on the set. We ask him, in what frame of mind has he shot this movie? How have the director, the crew, been with him – walking on glass or letting their hair down? “Unfortunately I was in pain sometimes even while shooting”, he recollects, “but Homi has an infectious energy and Dinoo a rare positivity and Anil Mehta (our cameraman) a rare sensitivity. The crew was warm and so, laughing away, we crossed the river.”Now that we’re talking about Homi, let’s remind Irrfan what Homi said about the actor: “He came in like an almost clean slate, wondering whether he’d forgotten acting. But there was never a false beat with him; Irrfan is incredibly organic.” Did he really wonder if he had ‘forgotten’? Did the personal battle make it tougher for him to act, or did it make him even sharper, living in the moment? “I forgot how to act and then I wanted to forget and come clean,” he answers. “My personal battle has made me more sensitive in a good and a bad way. I was a man of few words, and now they’ve become fewer,” responds Irrfan – in few words, of course.When we went across while Irrfan was shooting for 'Angrezi Medium' at Revla Khempur near Udaipur, the pain, the fatigue and the discomfort were visible on his face.

17,['10/03/2020'],Impact corona: Pandemic movies find new audience,"Art often imitates life but it is not very often that the other way round stands true, too. However, amidst the coronavirus outbreak worldwide, one cannot help but spot eerie similarities between movies on pandemics and recent events. A longtime staple of science fiction, outbreaks like coronavirus have long been a recurring theme in movies. When the virus started conquering all headlines in January-February, it led to spike in search for virus-based films online. As per IMDB data, the list of ‘Top 50 outbreak type films/ shows’ got 25% of its all-time view in the first week of February. The search for the 2011 film Contagion was at an all-time high since its release. But what happened in the end of those stories? Did science win or the virus wipe-out humanity? Let’s take a recap:This South Korean disaster film is about the outbreak of a deadly strain of H5N1 that kills its victims within 36 hours. It starts with a group of immigrants who are smuggled inside a shipping container. Inside the container, one of the immigrants is a carrier for a lethal and highly contagious virus. Soon, thousands of people become infected every passing hour by the deadly virus.This movie takes place a little after a pandemic wipes out most of humanity and the last few survivors try to scrape together supplies, get somewhere safe, andquarantine themselves. As survival becomes paramount, laws don’t count. The film shows rampant paranoia and panic, people wearing white surgical masks, wrapping themselves up in plastic and donning full-fledged CDC-issue gas masks.In this thriller, a science teacher, his wife, and a young girl struggle to survive a plague that causes those infected to commit suicide.

The story is set in New York City after a virus, which was created to cure cancer, wipes out most of mankind, leaving Neville as the last human. Neville is immune to the virus and works to develop a cure while defending himself against vampiric cannibalistic mutants.Set in the near future, where a viral outbreak of epic proportions has overtaken the planet and there are more infected than uninfected, a scientist races against time to save the few survivors left. It is shot from a first-person point-of-view.Based on a novel by Michael Crichton, 'The Andromeda Strain' combines the pandemic trope with alien invasion genre. A man tasked with recovering a mysterious satellite that has wiped out a small town discovers a secret alien virus that can kill animal life almost instantly. A classic example of hard ’70s sci-fi, the film cleverly explores whether scientific intervention with diseases could actually make them worse.Terry Gilliam’s '12 Monkeys', set in 2035, shows a world long after a deadly virus has wiped half of humanity. Bruce Willis, who plays a prisoner named Cole, is sent back in time to the ’90s to try and locate a sample of the virus in its early form, so the scientists can create a cure.

As a kid, Holi bahut dhamakedar manate thay. Everyone knows how people in north India celebrate Holi and it was no different for us. We used to wake up early and balloons fula ke freezer mein rakhte thay. It was like a whole preparation that we used to do. Kisi ek ke ghar pe adda banana aur fir gande hoke afternoon mein ghar aana. And then we would gorge on all the food prepared by my mom in those dirty clothes. My mom is a brilliant cook and she would make chole bhature, paneer, daal, gujiya – woh sab khaake, nahaake so jana,” he reminisces. Maniesh adds, “I miss Delhi’s food and Holi. Khane ka toh koi jawab hi nahi hai. I am not very fond of Holi because ya toh main bahut gandi Holi khelta hoon ya fir nahi khelta.

20,['10/03/2020'],Holi’s evergreen characters in every mohalla Holi celebration,"From the over - enthu team and the balloon-pelting gangs to the endless nakhre of those who need a special invite to play Holi, there are some evergreen characters in every mohalla Holi celebration.Mud-slinging (quite literally) and throwing eggs is seen as a ‘fun’ addition to the mix by some. When and how did this even become an acceptable thing? As if just scrubbing off the gulal isn’t enough work, getting rid of the stench of eggs is a whole other game. But that doesn’t stop these revellers from dragging unsuspecting people into mud pits.Like gujiya, bhang too, is an essential part of the revelry. But while you can eat gujiya till you drop, not being able to handle yourself after a few rounds of bhang is not a good look. Yeah it’s the one day when you can get high without anyone looking at you with sheer disappointment, but some people act like kisi ne sach mein hawaa mein bhang mila dia. These people are perhaps best described as the Holi version of drunk uncles doing the naagin dance at weddings.Bura na maano Holi hai is the only defence these people have for coming to your house, without invitation, and dragging you out to play Holi – even while you repeatedly keeping saying no – to ‘share the festive spirit’. From sensitive skin to upcoming exams – no excuse is legit for them to understand that no means no.The snipers usually set up base in their balconies or rooftops. Their speciality – spotting their unsuspecting victims from a distance. From buckets full of water to drums filled with water balloons, the snipers have a wide range of ammo. Whether you are going to work or just taking a stroll, these guys will spare no one.The whole mohalla doesn’t just know this guy’s gym schedule but all his exercises and the number of reps he does, too. And since Delhi doesn’t have any beaches, this dude cannot wait to show off all the work he has put into his body on Holi. After all, think about all the water that will be wasted in taking the stains out of the clothes? He’s not just any stud, he’s an eco-friendly stud.The one mohalla girl who dares to wear white on Holi. Is it a fashion statement, is it a challenge? One shall never know.You know who they are. They start their day by painting themselves with silver or golden colours ( mirgaan) eliminating any chance of others colouring them.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74552438,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-85188/74552438.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/holis-evergreen-characters-in-every-mohalla-holi-celebration/articleshow/74550611.cms
21,['10/03/2020'],"2nd biggest arms importer, India 23rd on exporters' list","NEW DELHI: India continues to languish in the strategically-vulnerable position of being the world’s second-largest arms importer, just behind Saudi Arabia. The only silver lining is that India has clawed its way to the 23rd position among the top 25 weapon exporters, with Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Mauritius being its biggest clients, though it constitutes a negligible 0.2% share of the total global figure.The latest data on international arms transfers released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on Monday shows India accounted for 9.2% of the total global arms imports during 2015-2019, while Saudi Arabia registered 12%. China stood at the fifth position (4.3%), while Pakistan was at 11th (2.6%).“Between 2010-14 and 2015-19, arms imports by India and Pakistan decreased by 32% and 39%, respectively. While both countries have long-standing aims to produce their own major arms, they remain largely dependent on imports and have substantial outstanding orders and plans for imports of all types of major arms,” said the global think-tank.SIPRI, in fact, cited the example of India’s Balakot air strikes and Pakistan’s attempted counter-strike in February last year to show the overwhelming dependence of the two on foreign weapons. If India deployed French (Mirage-2000s) and Russian (Sukhoi-30MKIs and MiG-21s) fighters, along with Israeli precision-guided bombs (Spice-2000s) and Swedish artillery (Bofors), Pakistan used American (F-16s) and Chinese (JF-17s) jets, and Swedish AWACS during the military face-off.Russia remained the largest arms supplier to India in 2010-14 and 2015-19, but deliveries fell by 47% and its share of total Indian imports went down from 76% to 56%. Imports from the US, which became India’s second-largest arms supplier in 2010-14 as part of the growing strategic partnership, also fell by 51% in 2015-19. “In contrast, arms imports from Israel and France increased, by 175% and 715% respectively, making them the second and third-largest suppliers to India in 2015-19,” said SIPRI.While the US figures do not include the Rs 21,000 crore deals inked for Apache and MH-60R helicopters during President Donald Trump’s visit here last month, the huge spike in France’s contribution is primarily due to the Rs 59,000 crore deal inked for 36 Rafales in September 2016.As per SIPRI data, China accounts for 73% of its all-weather ally Pakistan’s arms imports, followed by Russia (6.6%) and Italy (6.1%). The US, which earlier supplied 30% of the arms imported by Pakistan, was down to just 4.1% in 2015-19 after it decided to stop military aid to the country.India’s embarrassing continuance at the very top in the global arms import rankings reinforces the persisting failure to build a strong defence industrial base, with the NDA government’s “Make in India” policy also yet to actually take-off in producing diesel-electric submarines, fighters, light utility helicopters, minesweepers and infantry combat vehicles for the last six years, as was earlier reported by TOI.But India’s arms exports have certainly picked up. Official Indian figures show they jumped from Rs 2,060 crore in 2015-16 to Rs 10,746 crore in 2018-19. The figure for 2019-20 stood at Rs 5,883 crore in December 31 last year. Just last week, defence minister Rajnath Singh said the government had set an arms export target of $5 billion in the next five years.

Already anxious about the coronavirus impact and sliding oil prices, Dalal Street caved in under fears of financial instability in India due to the crisis at Yes Bank, the country's fourth largest private sector lender.Reliance Industries closed an unprecedented 12% lower, resulting in it losing its crown as the most valued company in India to software services major TCS. All 30 sensex stocks closed the day in the red with ICICI Bank, TCS and HDFC Bank also among the top contributors to the index’s loss.The day’s selling was led by foreign funds, which recorded a net outflow of almost Rs 6,600 crore while domestic funds cushioned the crash with net buying of nearly Rs 5,000 crore.The sensex is nearing bear territory, which would be at 33,800 points. Countries like Japan, Singapore and Philippines have already entered the dreaded zone while Australia and Hong Kong are within touching distance of doing so. An index is said be in bear territory if it falls 20% from its peak.For the sensex, the all-time peak of 42,274 was recorded on January 20 this year. It's been just a couple of months since then, but to battered investors, it seems like a long time ago. Around the globe, in early trade the S&P 500 hit its circuit breaker of 7% and trading on Wall Street was stopped for 15 minutes. In the UK FTSE was down 6.6% in late trades while Germany's Dax was down 6.7% and Brazil's Ibovespa was down nearly 9%. Earlier in the day, in Japan, the Nikkei closed 5.1% lower while Hang Seng settled 4.2% lower.According to Deepak Jasani, head, retail research, HDFC Securities, India is facing a deluge of negative triggers while the global markets are plunging after the break of the alliance between Opec and Russia, which combined to result in the worst one-day crash in crude prices (more than 30%) in nearly 30 years, fueling panic among investors across asset classes, with escalation of the coronavirus epidemic adding to the fears. “The panic began after Saudi Arabia shocked oil markets by launching a price war. Italy has placed nearly 16 million people under semi-lockdown and the number of confirmed cases in Europe continues to rise,” said Jasnani.The sell-off on D Street was aggravated by selling by foreign funds which pulled the rupee below 74 against the dollar.

24,['10/03/2020'],ED likely to quiz Priyanka Gandhi over Rana painting,"NEW DELHI: Based on statements recorded by Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor with investigating officers that he was coerced into buying a painting from Priyanka Gandhi for Rs 2 crore, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) will soon summon the Congress general secretary for questioning and is likely to attach her cottage near Shimla.

In his statement recorded at the ED office in Mumbai on Sunday, Kapoor claimed that Congress’s former South Mumbai MP Milind Deora pressured him to buy a portrait of ex-PM Rajiv Gandhi from Priyanka for Rs 2 crore. Under the anti-money laundering law, the money taken from Kapoor, an accused, which Priyanka spent on her cottage near Shimla, qualifies to be treated as “proceeds of crime” and this renders the property vulnerable to prospect of being attached by ED.

Sources said Deora was also likely to be quizzed in connection with the transaction which ED officials believe was inspired by more than Kapoor’s interest in the painting.

Congress has denied there was anything wrong in Priyanka selling off M F Hussain’s portrait of Rajiv to Kapoor. The party had on Sunday said it was a legitimate transaction which Priyanka had disclosed in her income tax returns. Deora did not comment.

ED sources cited text messages recovered from Kapoor’s smartphone and his statement to say that the controversial banker, accused of siphoning off more than Rs 4,000 crore from Yes Bank, may not have bought the portrait of his own volition. Citing email and text messages that Deora sent from his Black-Berry and which Kapoor had preserved for a decade, sources said the transaction was initiated by Deora.

Deora first wrote to Kapoor on May 1, 2010, asking him to write to “Mrs Gandhi” showing his willingness to buy the portrait. He pursued the matter vigorously by sending text messages. Deora wrote on May 29, 2010, “Rana uncle, I received your letter dated May 28th and have sent the same to PG. A meeting with her or her family won’t be possible now but I’ll try and arrange it sometime later. Her mother and she want the cheque by early next week itself. Even my father has been informed by them and he’s also been trying to reach you unsuccessfully. Unfortunately, this has taken really long. Can you pls reply to this SMS and tell me the exact date by when the cheque can be given to her as I MUST communicate the same to my father and her ASAP! I know you are receiving SMSes so I’d really appreciate your reply.” (sic)

Deora’s keenness for early payment to Priyanka comes across in the message he sent to Kapoor on June 2, 2010, in which he said, “Rana uncle, pls let me know when I can collect the cheque. I have been assuring them week after week that it’s happening and they have lost patience at this stage. Pls trust me and don’t delay any further. Tks. Milind.”

The next day, Kapoor issued a cheque for Rs 2 crore to Priyanka from his personal account in HSBC Bank. Probes showed that he got Yes Bank to reimburse himself entirely: something which, as per officials, meets the threshold of “proceeds of crime” under Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

Priyanka acknowledged the payment of Rs 2 crore as “the full and final payment towards subject painting” in a letter to Kapoor the next day. She emphasised that the painting was “presently in her ownership and possession”. ED sources said the agency would also look into Priyanka’s claim of ownership of the painting which Hussain had presented to Rajiv Gandhi at Congress’s centenary celebrations in 1985.

“We have to see whether it was the property of Congress party,” a source said.

26,['10/03/2020'],Yes Bank withdrawals cap could end by this weekend,"Some borrowers can’t repay instalments

MUMBAI: Yes Bank ’s resolution is likely to happen as early as this weekend, according to Reserve Bank of India-appointed administrator Prashant Kumar. The bank’s administrator has made it clear that availability of funds is not an issue at all and full services will be restored when the moratorium is lifted.Speaking to TOI, Kumar said the bank has been assured cash lines from RBI and State Bank of India. Between the two, the bank is assured of enough liquidity to meet withdrawal demand even when the moratorium is lifted. “There will not be any regulation of withdrawals. We will only convince them to retain their deposits. Once people know that SBI is behind us depositors should feel confident,” he said.During the day, there were reports that HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank might also participate in the reconstruction program of the private bank that was placed under moratorium last Thursday with withdrawals being limited to Rs 50,000. “There are many investors who have shown interest in the bank,” said Kumar.According to Kumar, there are unlikely to be any obstacles to the moratorium. Responding to legal measures taken by holders of AT-1 bonds, Kumar said the bank is on solid ground in writing off the bonds as these are in keeping with Basel III norms. Under the moratorium rules, RBI can allow higher withdrawals of up to Rs 5 lakh for customers in case of emergency needs like healthcare, higher education or marriage.“We have prepared a standard operating procedure where the requests and specified documents are collected from the depositors and sent to the RBI for approval. There is no discretion at the branch level,” said Kumar.When asked whether internet banking would be restored before the resolution process, Kumar said the full range of services can be provided only when the moratorium is lifted. “It will all depend on the view taken by RBI. Right now everyone is trying to bring normalcy. Once the moratorium is lifted it will be business as usual,” he said.Many corporate borrowers are unable to repay their loan instalments as the bank is not connected to the Real Time Gross Settlement System. “If the repayment is for smaller amounts, they can send it through NEFT. We will take care to ensure that the rating of borrowers who are not able to repay because of the moratorium, is not adversely impacted,” said Kumar.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74559163,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-3543389,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/yes-bank-withdrawals-cap-could-end-by-this-weekend/articleshow/74559156.cms

28,['10/03/2020'],UP may move SC to challenge HC’s verdict on 'recovery' hoardings,"Lucknow administration put up hoardings with photographs, names, and addresses of 57 people who have been iss... Read More

PRAYAGRAJ: In a setback to the Yogi Adityanath government, the Allahabad high court on Monday ordered immediate removal of hoardings carrying names, address and photographs of anti-CAA protesters against whom recovery notices had earlier been served for allegedly damaging private and public properties.

Calling the Uttar Pradesh government’s action an “unwarranted interference in the privacy of people”, a division bench of Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Ramesh Sinha said: “The same hence is in violation of the Article 21 of the Constitution, which clearly provides that no person shall be deprived of his life and personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.”

The Lucknow divisional commissioner and district magistrate were asked to execute the order and file a compliance report in court by March 16.

Though HC ordered “immediate” removal of hoardings, the Lucknow administration had not taken them off till late Monday evening. ANI quoted government sources as saying that it might challenge the HC order in Supreme Court. When asked why the hoardings had not been removed despite HC order, a government spokesperson told TOI it was yet to receive a copy of the order. “Besides, HC has given time till March 16 for compliance. The government will take a call on the next course of action after Holi,” he said.

In its order, while admitting that the state can always take necessary steps to ensure law and order, the HC said, “But that cannot be by violating fundamental rights of people.”

On Saturday, the HC had taken suo motu cognizance of the hoardings put up on Thursday night by the Lucknow district administration which contained names, photos and addresses of 57 people accused of destroying properties during anti-CAA protest on December 19.

Rejecting the arguments of advocate general Raghvendra Singh, the HC directed UP government on Monday not to place such banners containing personal data of individuals without having authority of law on the roadside.

“Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the power is available to a court to publish a written proclamation requiring the appearance of a person against whom a warrant has been issued and such person is concealing himself to avoid execution of a warrant. No other power is available in the code to police or the executive to display personal records of a person to public at large,” the bench observed.

“So far as legality part is concerned, suffice to state that no law permits the state to place the banners with personal data of the accused from whom compensation is to be charged,” it further said.

Rejecting the government’s pleas that the purpose of putting the hoardings was only to deter people from participating in illegal activities, the bench said, “The advocate general failed to satisfy us as to why the personal data of a few persons have been placed on banners in UP.”

PATNA: An 18-year-old girl died and three others were injured as the boundary wall of government’s circuit house collapsed on Daroga Rai Path under Kotwali police station area in the city on Sunday morning.

The deceased was identified as Arti Kumari. She was ragpicker and lived in a tent erected beside the wall. The incident took place around 7.30am. Among the three injured, Mohammad Azeem (55) received multiple injuries on head and limbs while Amit Kumar Sagar (22) was unable to move his body below waist, police said. Amit’s cousin Abhishek Kumar (19) was also injured in the accident. Police sources said huge amount of sand was stored against the wall, which probably collapsed due to the pressure over a period of time.

Soon after the incident, locals blocked the road for at least an hour before district administration handed over a cheque for Rs4 lakh as ex gratia payment to the kin of the deceased.

Kotwali police station additional SHO Lal Bahadur Yadav said Azeem was undergoing treatment at PMCH while the other two were admitted to a private hospital in Yarpur locality.

Yadav said Arti’s face and few parts of the body were burned as she was sitting near a fire pot when the wall collapsed on her. “At least six tents were erected alongside the wall which collapsed,” he said, adding a case of unnatural death was registered on the statement of Arti’s brother Suraj Kumar.

This is the second such incident in the state capital since Saturday night when eight-year-old Prince Kumar was crushed to death when a dilapidated wall of an old private house collapsed near the flood gate number 88 at Makhdumpur under Digha police station in city. However, non FIR was lodged in that connection as police said none came forward with any written complaint or statement. “Post mortem of the child was also not conducted,” police said.

30,['10/03/2020'],"Yes Bank crisis: Cheque, CTS clearings of 9 banks take a hit","Aurangabad: Transactions, in terms of cheque and CTS (cheque truncation system) clearances of at least nine banks , have taken a hit since the Yes Bank scam surfaced last week.

Some banks in Aurangabad have already issued an internal communication to their employees, asking them to not accept cheque or CTS clearance for these cooperative banks. A copy of one such internal communication — asking the bank employees to abstain from accepting cheques as well as CTS of Yes Bank and nine other cooperative banks, including Aurangabad District Central Cooperative (ADCC) Bank — is with TOI.

At some of the banks, the notice has already been put up at the counters for customers to see.

A banker said the communication was issued after the RBI, on Thursday, imposed a withdrawal limit of Rs 50, 000 on Yes Bank customers. Insiders said all these nine cooperative banks did their transaction through the Yes Bank.

While most of these affected banks refused to comment, Abhijit Deshmukh, one of the ADCC directors, told TOI: “Due to the Yes Bank crisis , we are facing an issue in getting our cheques and CTS cleared.” He said the ADCC is open to considering alternative options.

When contacted, All Indian Bank Employees’ Association (AIBEA) joint secretary Devidas Tuljapurkar said, “The government asking SBI to bail out Yes Bank is aimed at diffusing the situation. The government had done the same thing when IL&FS had collapsed. SBI and LIC, two public sector institutions, were made to rescue it. It doesn’t stop here. Some more private sector banks are in the queue.”

Citing that the government, in the previous budget, had claimed that “public sector banks (PSBs) are inefficient” and the government is asking the same PSBs to bail out private sector banks, Tuljapurkar said that it is not only astonishing but also scary. “The government is merging PSBs with legacy of more than a century, and at the same time, is bailing out a private sector bank with hardly two decades standing. This is more than serious,” said Tuljapurkar.

In 2019, as many as 2 ,900 accidents reported in the 11 police station limits, according to the data compiled by the police department. It is estimated that the mortality in these accidents is at least 10%

The analysis of the accidents revealed that Kuvadva Road and the road from Greenland Chowkdi to Gondal Chowkdi on the city’s outskirts reported maximum number of accidents. While both these roads connect to the GIDCs and other industrial areas, heavy vehicles also use these roads as it merges with the highway.

While FIRs were lodged in just 600 of these 2,900 cases, police obtained data of other accidents from th 108 emergency ambulance service.

In the night time, the 150 ft Ring Road has proved to be dangerous for drivers. Also, majority of the accidents occured during peak evening hours between 7pm to 9pm.

Talking to TOI, deputy commissioner of police, Manoharsinh Jadeja said, “Following instructions of police commissioner, we have decided to deploy more police force in the accident-prone areas. We will start an aggressive drive to penalize traffic offenders, mostly those driving on the wrong side and rash drivers, in these area to minimize the number of accidents.

Kuvadva Road, Bhavnagar Road and Aji Dam Road were declared accident-prone zones in 2018 after a detailed analysis of the accidents then.

According to sources, these roads also lack adequate number of CCTV cameras, making it difficult for the police to issue e-memos to traffic violators.

35,['10/03/2020'],Install waste treatment plant in SCR zone: Officials,"Representative image

HYDERABAD: Demands to install a waste treatment plant in the South Central Railway (SCR) zone have been raised by the railway officials in view of the increasing freight and passenger rail traffic. “We have the Lallaguda carriage workshop, which spans across 14 hectares and produces huge amounts of hazardous waste. It is collected, transported and disposed regularly but there is no treatment plant for metallic and non- metallic scrap,” a senior railway official told TOI.

“With increased number of trains and coaches, LHB coach material and additional items to repair the coaches have also stocked up. Over the years, engineering debris containing reinforced cement concrete (RCC) material has been dumped in vacant areas alongside the workshop,” he added.

After Indian Railways commissioned country’s first governmental waste to energy plant in Bhubaneswar, demands are high for another waste-to-energy plant here.

Officials explain that a waste-to-energy plant can be useful here as it uses a closed loop system and does not emit any hazardous pollutants into the atmosphere. “The combustible, non-condensed gases are re-used for providing energy to the entire system.

In the last 10 days, Jilariya may have met about 40 diamond workers, who lost jobs, in his small office in the crowded diamond hub of Yogi Chowk as they recounted their travails.“This is just tip of the iceberg. These workers were employed in small units and got affected as their units didn’t get enough diamond job work due to outbreak of coronavirus in China. Scores of workers will lose their jobs if this situation persists,” Jilariya said.He said over 3.5 lakh workers are employed in small and medium units. On the whole, Surat’s diamond industry employs about 5.5 lakh diamond workers in over 6,000 big, small and medium diamond units. The annual turnover of the industry is pegged at over Rs1.50 lakh crore.The glitter of the world’s largest diamond cutting and polishing centre in Surat seems to have faded as polished diamond exports to China and Hong Kong, largest export markets for the city after the US, are grappling with coronavirus.Chandu Sheta, owner of a small diamond unit having 15 emery wheels in Varachha, told TOI, “I am doing job work and there is 60% reduction in the work since last fortnight. I plan to reduce workers’ strength from 20 to 15.”According to Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), India’s gems and jewellery exports to Hong Kong and China are pegged at about $11 billion. Exports fell 16% at $1.4 billion between December 2019 and February 2020 compared to $1.6 billion during the same period last year. The GJEPC has predicted that exports to Hong Kong and China are likely to fall by over 60% in March.Jaysukh Sondarva, a diamond worker who lost his job, said, “Unit owner reduced my wages from Rs10,000 to Rs5,000 per month. When I asked him about the wage cut, I was told to leave the unit. I have a family of five member and it is difficult to survive with just Rs5,000 per month.”Surat Diamond Association president Babu Kathiriya said, “A huge amount of payments are stuck in Hong Kong and China due to coronavirus outbreak .

38,['10/03/2020'],A heart of gold is what makes ‘Nagpur Heroes’,"In the highly-competitive and self-centred world that we live in, there are a few souls who stand out, not because they are aces of their industry, but because they are aces of humanity who go the extra mile with a kind and compassionate heart that gives hope and lights up the lives of those of a lesser god.

Every year, TOI makes it a point to salute and honour the unsung heroes of our society through its ‘Nagpur Heroes’ initiative.

With the countdown clock ticking, TOI spoke to a cross section of citizens to know their definition of their ideal ‘Nagpur Hero’.

Vikash Khurana, a renowned theatre artist, said, “Any citizen of Nagpur, who works with utmost sincerity and loyalty for the betterment of the society is a hero. For me, a hero is someone who makes a name, not only for himself but also for the city, at the national or international level.”

Citizens have nominated many deserving candidates from various fields, right from environment to education and health to hygiene. “A ‘Nagpur Hero’ is someone who brings about a positive change in the society despite the odds and hurdles. Our city many heroes and I’m sure the deserving ones will get their due,” said Sandeep Agrawal, a chartered accountant.

Bhavik Mehta, a brand chief and a creative salesman, believes that a ‘Nagpur Hero’ is someone who is consistent and sincere with his good work. “A hero is someone who understands human resource and makes it a priority.” said Mehta.

For homemaker Ayesha Mirza, a ‘Nagpur Hero’ is not someone glamorous who just wears the crown. “The title comes with a lot of responsibilities. ‘Nagpur Heroes’ is a great initiative by TOI. I believe that all the nominees are winners as they have given their blood and sweat to make life a bit better for their fellow citizens,” she said.

Apurva Satokar, vice-principal of Jhulelal Institute of Architecture, believes that a ‘Nagpur Hero’ is someone who educates the society and changes the mindset of people. “In today’s era of advanced technology, my ‘Nagpur Hero’ is a person who is persistent and dedicated, with the ability to transform society in whatever way possible,” she said.

Architect Sandeep Pathe’s definition of a ‘Nagpur Hero’ is all out about inspiration and attitude. “A ‘Nagpur Hero’ is someone who inspires citizens to strengthen their human values. He has qualities like character and compassion to uplift people from the lower rungs of society,” said Pathe.

Home maker Poonam Khatri hit the nail on the head when she said, “The message of ‘Nagpur Heroes’ is loud and clear. It motivates people to work for humanity. I believe a hero is someone who work selflessly, irrespective of the honours or awards.”

39,['10/03/2020'],Work on Pal-Umra bridge to start soon,"HC has directed SMC and affected families to submit land allotment agreement

Surat: There is some good news for over 10 lakh residents of Adajan and Pal areas of the city. The much-awaited construction for approach end of Pal-Umra bridge over Tapi river may start soon with Gujarat high court directing Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) and affected families to submit an agreement on alternative land allotment on March 12.

Official sources said construction work for the approach road connecting the Rs89 crore Pal-Umra bridge was under peril after about 14 families, whose houses obstruct the approach of the bridge, filed a special leave petition in the high court against the civic body’s move to claim their properties in 2017.

During the hearing in high court on Monday, the affected families agreed to the proposal of the civic body to provide them plots at some other place. The high court directed both the parties to submit agreement on the alternative land allotment for final decision on March 12.

Ketan Patel, deputy municipal commissioner (town planning department), told TOI, “The families have finally agreed to shift to an alternative plot of land to pave way for the construction of the approach end of the bridge at Umra. The civic body will be providing them five to six options and the final decision will be taken by the high court.”

This will be the fifth bridge over Tapi river connecting Adajan with different areas of the city including Athwalines, Nanpura, Chowk Bazaar and Umra. The Pal-Umra bridge will help in reducing traffic issues at the cable-stayed bridge and Athwalines bridge.

Patel said, “We have already started widening the road by demolishing compound walls and other encroachments in the vicinity of the approach road to the bridge. It will take another month for the families to shift from their houses.”

Surat: Four new spotted deer have been brought to Digvirendrasinhji Deer Breeding Centre at Vansda National Park from Ahmedabad’s Kankaria Zoo for breeding.

These deer will be ultimately released in the wild.

“Nature Club Surat started the spotted deer breeding project in 2010 in association with the state forest department. The purpose was to restock herbivore population in the forest and restore natural ecosystem. We released 10 spotted deer in 2017 and 12 in 2019. Those released in wild are doing fine,’’ said Snehal Patel, founder, Nature Club Surat.

“As of now, there are 26 deer at the breeding centre. Half of them are ready to be released into their natural habitat. We have sought permission from the forest department in this regard. Besides spotted deer, we have 10 four-horned antelope (chaushinga) of which six are ready to be released into forest,” Patel added.

“Restocking herbivore will help increase prey base in the forests and reduce human-leopard conflicts in and around forests,’’ he said.

The Vansda National Park falls under the Dangs South forest Division. There are around 70 to 100 leopards in forests here.

The forest department is also building a leopard safari park and wildlife rescue centre neat Vaghai Botanical Garden. The new project is estimated to cost over Rs 20 crore.

“The process of setting up a the safari park and rescue Centre has been initiated and it will take at least two years,’’ said Dinesh Rabari, in-charge deputy conservator of forests, Dangs south forest division.

41,['10/03/2020'],Bhiwandi weavers support Surat’s stance on anti-dumping duty on nylon yarn,"Surat: Powerloom weavers in Maharashtra’s Bhiwandi have joined those of their ilk in Surat to protest against the decision taken by Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) to impose anti-dumping duty on nylon filament yarn.

Supporting the protest by Surat’s powerloom weavers, Bhiwandi Textile Manufacturers’ Association has asked Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to abolish anti-dumping duty on imported nylon yarn. It called DGTR decision in a letter as one-sided, favouring yarn spinners in the country.

According to Bhiwandi weavers, nylon yarn spinners have shown a consistent growth of around 26% year on year and majority of them are growing by 16% to 113% per annum. Spinners are in dominant position in domestic market controlling about 85% of market. However, anti-dumping duty on 15% imports of nylon yarn from China and other countries will create monopolistic trade practices.

BTMA president Sarosh Fakih said, “There is no injury to yarn spinners by import of nylon yarn from China. In the last four years, import of yarn has decreased from 25,000 metric tonnes to 21,000 metric tones. At present, yarn spinners are manufacturing over 1.25 lakh metric tonnes per annum.”

Fakih added, “Anti-dumping duty on nylon yarn will result in unemployment of workers due to increase in yarn prices in the domestic market. We have requested the government to reconsider the investigation done by DGTR in the interest of weaving sector in Surat and Bhiwandi.”

Federation of Gujarat Weavers’ Association president Ashok Jirawala said, “We have been approaching all the weaving centres across the country against anti-dumping duty on nylon yarn. If the government fails to reconsider the DGTR decision then the nylon weavers will launch an agitation.”

42,['10/03/2020'],Hyderabad: Four Qutb Shahi-era structures left to decay,"TimesView It is worrying to note that over 300 protected monuments in the state need upkeep and maintenance, but lack of funds and poor staff strength is becoming a hindrance. Worse, there are dozens of heritage structures that are not protected, so it’s time the government forms an expert committee and chalks out a plan to save the structures from further destruction by earmarking some funds to revive them.

HYDERABAD: Cracks, encroachments and garbage mark four Qutb Shahi-era tombs in Shaikpet . An RTI query revealed that since these structures have not been declared as ‘protected’, the state department has washed its hands of them.An RTI response from the Department of Heritage , Telangana states that ‘the four tombs and two masjids constructed during the Qutb Shahi dynasty at Vinayak Nagar in Shaikpet, Golconda are not protected monuments of the department’. The letter further absolves the department of any responsibility stating: “The department will look after and maintains (sic) the protected monuments only.” The reply was to a query by activist Sami Ahmed.In Telangana, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) takes responsibility of six monuments and two sites. Only two of the monuments are located in the city, leaving a large number of heritage structures ‘unprotected’.Milan Kumar Chauley, superintending archaeologist, ASI, said that most heritage structures are divided into three categories: those of national importance that are maintained by the ASI; those of state importance that are maintained by the state; and those which are part of neither, a grey area, that requires the contribution of citizens as well NGOs. “Rather than focusing on monuments that are already protected and have adequate funds, NGOs and heritage groups should step up to help with minor monuments,” said Chauley. He said the state can, however, help save these structures by declaring the land around them to be government land, thereby help in preventing encroachments.Activist Mohammed Habeebuddin, who has for long been demanding the restoration of the Shaikpet tombs, said, “These structures are in a completely run-down state. What is worse is that encroachment is rampant with residential spaces cropping up adjoining the heritage property.”About the loss of heritage over time, Anuradha Reddy, INTACH, Hyderabad, convenor said, “The Hyderabad state archaeology department was established in 1914 by Nizam VII. Its first director was Dr Ghulam Yazdani who did a lot to protect heritage structures. At that time Hyderabad state had over 600 protected monuments including temples, masjids and forts. Today in Telangana, the 300 and odd state protected monuments are in miserable condition due to the lack of staff and funds. If this is the condition of protected monuments, what about the fate of heritage structures that are not protected or documented.”",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74560675,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-340452,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/four-qutb-shahi-era-structures-left-to-decay/articleshow/74558379.cms

48,['10/03/2020'],"Forest dept ‘positive’ about bird census conduct, environmentalists ‘doubt’ the claims","Aurangabad: Amid uproar over no bird census being carried out at Jayakwadi bird sanctuary this year, the forest department has claimed that it has already carried out this edition of the annual activity in “January-February”.

Every year, the department carries out the census at the sanctuary by involving bird experts, volunteers and media professionals among others but some environmentalists raised doubts over the claims.

Deputy conservator of forest (Wildlife) R R Kale on Monday said that the annual bird census in question was carried out a couple of months back. “We carried out the census with the help of staffers. The bird experts and others were not involved in the exercise,” he said.

When questioned about the census details, Kale said no off-hand information was available with him. “We came across satisfactory bird count at Jayakwadi bird sanctuary this year. The migratory birds arrived a bit late, but their population along with those of native birds was good in numbers,” he said.

Nature experts, however, raised doubts over the claims made by the forest department that bird census was actually carried out at Jayakwadi bird sanctuary. “The forest department staffers do not have adequate knowledge about the nomenclature of different bird species and every year invite experts to carry out the census at Jayakwadi sanctuary. We doubt whether the census was actually carried out as not even locals were hinted about the same,” environmentalist Kishor Pathak said.

He also refused to buy the claims made by the forest department that the bird population was found satisfactory at the sanctuary this year. “We have made regular visits to the sanctuary since the beginning of the migratory season that commences post-Diwali season. There is a sharp decline in the bird population this year for varied reasons. The forest department is misleading the public,” Pathak said.

According to experts, the bird population of different cranes, goose, ducks and waders along with flamingos have declined at Jayakwadi sanctuary during current migratory season, which ends by around mid of March.

Illegal wetland farming, unauthorised fishing, and relatively increased level of Jayakwadi dam has attributed to a decline in the bird population at the bird sanctuary.

Officially notified as a bird sanctuary in 1986, Jayakwadi bird sanctuary is spread over 341.05 square kilometre area in Aurangabad and Ahmadnagar districts. Official studies in the past have proved that it is home to around 234 species of resident, migratory birds along with other creatures recorded from the open water stretches at the dam water bodies.

In a memorandum submitted to the Union science and technology minister Harsh Vardhan, Patil has said that the desired facility would gel with the LIGO-India project.

“Aundha-Nagnath is getting national and international attention due to the upcoming LIGO-India project. The project is bound to attract large number of tourists who are least likely to have full access to the project. The flow of such tourists can be directed towards the science and technology park,” Patil said.

Around 173.25 hectare land is required in Hingoli district for the LIGO-India project that has been planned as a collaborative project to establish a gravitational-wave detector in India.

It will be installed, commissioned, and operated by Indian team of scientists in collaboration with the LIGO Laboratory operated by Caltech and MIT and three other institutes in India — Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (Pune), Raja Ramanna Center for Advanced Technology (Indore) and Institute for Plasma Research (Ahmedabad).

Patil said the science and technology park would help in developing interests in the field of science and astronomy. “There is no state-run full-fledged science and technology park anywhere in the state. Aundha-Nagnath can be the ideal place for setting up the facility,” he said.

“Located in Hingoli district, Aundha-Nagnath has one of the 12 Jyotirlingas in India having an ancient temple of Lord Shiva that attracts scores of devotees from different parts of the country. These tourists will also benefit from the Science and technology park,” he added.

HYDERABAD: Hyderabad along with the erstwhile districts of Mahbubnagar, Adilabad and Khammam are vulnerable to drug trafficking, the central government said in the Lok Sabha. Affirming this, social activists said substance abuse in Hyderabad and Vijayawada was rampant among streetchildren, while drug use was going up in school-going children.

Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment Rattan Lal Kataria informed the Lok Sabha last week (on March 3) that the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) under the ministry of home affairs had identified these districts highly prone to drug trafficking. “The Centre has allotted Rs 35 crore to the National Institute of Social Defence to run drug-free campaigns,” he said.

Not just Telangana , neighbouring Andhra Pradesh is also not spared from this menace. Due to ganja cultivation and smuggling in the Agency areas, Visakhapatnam, West Godavari, East Godavari and Krishna districts were also listed among the places most vulnerable to drug trafficking.

Not just this, Telangana and AP have also become hubs with a huge number of people who inject drugs (PWIDs). The ministry of social justice in a 2019 report said Telangana has 64,000 PWIDs, while AP has 69,000 such people.

A national survey by the ministry as part of collating state-wise data on extent and pattern of substance abuse said that there were wide variations in the extent and prevalence of substance abuse in various states. AP was among top five states in India which house the largest populations of people using sedatives, according to the magnitude of use of substance in India 2019 report.

Telangana has 2.4 lakh people addicted to amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS). They refer to a group of drugs whose principal members include amphetamine and methamphetamine. Y Raja Reddy, a social activist who works with streetkids, said: “Substance abuse is high among streetkids in Hyderabad and Vijayawada. Consumption of ganja and other drugs among school and college-going stduents is also increasing.”

The report further revealed that AP was among the states with high prevalence of more than 10% of alcohol abuse. At least 47 lakh people in AP, who were addicted to alcohol, and 3.6 lakh people for opioid need help as per the report. It is said that 7.4 lakh people in AP also use pharmaceutical products as sedatives, of which 1.4 lakh people need help.

SECUNDERABAD: The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation officials are hopeful of numerous proposed and pending projects seeing completion in the Secunderabad assembly constituency after Rs 10,000 crore was allocated to Greater Hyderabad in the state budget.

Nearly Rs 30 crore worth of civic projects are set to get finished in all five GHMC divisions.

“The mammoth budget allocation will not only give us a major boost in the run up to the GHMC polls, but also major relief as many civic issues will get resolved,” coporators told TOI.

Projects, including laying of cement concrete roads, construction of community halls, multi-purpose function halls, widening and remodelling of open nalas, revamping water and sewer lines, have already been sent to GHMC for sanctioning of funds.

Apart from these, proposal to construct ‘rail under bridge’ (RUB) at Tarnaka to facilitate over 50,000 people near Manikeswaranagar, construction of swimming pool at Jai Shankar Stadium and a multipurpose function hall are waiting administrative sanctions.

Constructionof a madrassa Urdu hostel at North Lalaguda and renovation of Idgah are priorities.

“Laying of CC Roads is priority in my division. Funds have already been asked for construction of community halls. Remodelling of open nalas has almost been completed at Addagutta. Revamping of water and sewer lines is going on at brisk pace. The allocated budget is sure to give a boost to the civic body in the ensuing elections,” said corporator of Addagutta Division, S Vijaya Kumari .

“We are hoping for the GHMC to allocate Rs 6 crore for the construction of road under bridges at Manikeswaeanagar, which has been delayed for one and a half years,” said corporator of Tarnaka Division, A Saraswathi.

Corporators also strongly believe that Telangana Rashtra Samithi will unfurl its flag in all five divisions of Secunderabad assembly constituency in the upcoming polls.

CHENNAI: After an easy start, Class XII state board students are now feeling the heat of board exams. While students went confident to the examination centers on Monday, they exited rather dejected. Many said it would be difficult to score more than 75% since questions were ‘creative’.

“The paper was very tough. I spent a lot of time thinking and didn’t have enough time to answer the questions properly,” said T Nivrithi who wrote the maths paper. Nivriti said that the one and five-mark questions were tougher than she expected. “The questions were very creative. I might lose a few marks in these two sections,” she said.

Shiva Ranjani, another student who came out disappointed, said “I had thoroughly prepared from the book banks, but a few were from inside the textbooks, which I couldn’t answer,” she said, adding many of these questions were from the model papers given to them in school. “But since we had a lot to read, I couldn’t glance through these papers. When I came home and compared, many were from them. Had I spent a little more time reading the model paper, I would have scored more,” she said.

Not only mathematics, but students also found the commerce paper difficult. “The compulsory five-mark questions were tough. They were all from inside the books. I didn’t skip that section, but I’ve not written it well either,” said T Lalitha.

Another student claimed that at least two questions in two, three and five mark sections were ‘creative’. “If I score more than 70, it would be a miracle,” said P Nivedita.

However, students who wrote Zoology found the paper simple. “It was a lot easier than expected,” said Gurubharati KR.

N Uma, principal of Ahobila Math Oriental School said they had prepared the students to answer questions asked differently. “The government insists that questions must be framed creatively or unusually so children can learn better. We also used to revise questions differently in model tests, but a few still found it hard in the finals. But we have asked them to take it as a lesson and focus better on the next exam,” she said.

HYDERABAD: With the Jawaharnagar police investigating if the argument between Shri Adithya Hospitals managing director Dr Ravindra Kumar and his wife Dr Smitha had any role in the MD’s alleged suicide, the hospital staff maintained that there were no issues between the couple.

“Ravindra and his wife seemed happy with each other. In fact, they both studied in the same college in Warangal,” one of the hospital staff members told TOI.

Staff members and locals gathered outside Ravindra’s house at Saket Mithila in Jawaharnagar on Monday after the police cordoned off the area. Later in the day after police probe, the body was shifted to Gandhi General Hospital for autopsy.

Police said that they will speak to Ravindra’s neighbours to further investigate into the case and find out if they heard a gun shot or an argument before the doctor shot himself dead.

As Ravindra had not locked the door, the hospital staff members who went to see him on Monday at around 11.30 am, gained entry into the house and alerted Ravindra’s wife and police after finding him lying dead.

Ravindra and Dr Smitha, who oversee functioning of Sri Aditya Hospital, had established the health facility at Dammaiguda seven years ago. Ravindra, according to his hospital staff, had studied at Kakatiya Medical College in Warangal.

56,['10/03/2020'],Telangana: Father of Disha case accused succumbs to accident injuries,"Ch Kurmaiah

HYDERABAD: Disha gangrape accused Ch Chennakeshavulu’s father Ch Kurmaiah, 55, who had suffered severe injuries in a road mishap near Jaklair village in Narayanpet district in December last, succumbed to injuries at his house at Gudigandla on Monday.

Chennakeshavulu and other accused, J Shiva, J Naveen from Gudigandla, and Md Areef, of neighbouring Jaklair village were arrested by Cyberabad police in the Disha gangrape and murder case. Subsequently, the four accused were killed in an alleged police encounter at Chattanpally on December 6, 2019.

Kurmaiah alias Kurmanna, a farmer from Gudigandla in Narayanpet district, had suffered severe injuries when his bike was hit by an Innova vehicle coming from opposite direction near Jaklair on December 26 night.

“Kurmanna was travelling on his bike to Gudigandla, while the Innova was going towards Raichur. The Innova rammed into Kurmanna’s bike from opposite direction. He suffered severe injuries,” Makhtal sub-inspector (SI) Ashok Kumar said.

Kurmanna was initially rushed to Mahbubnagar government hospital and later to NIMS. From NIMS, Kurmanna was shifted to another hospital in the city as the family members found it difficult to pay bills. “The accused provided some monetary relief for treatment. We had to sell one acre agricultural land for the treatment. The total expenditure on the treatment was about 10 lakh, but after the accident Kurmanna did not regain consciousness. Three days ago, on the advice of doctors, we brought Kurmanna home and he succumbed to injuries on Monday afternoon,” Kurmanna’s nephew Lingappa told TOI.

After the accident, police had registered a case under Section 337 (causing injuries due to rash or negligent act) of the IPC against the Innova driver. “We have arrested the man driving the car, Achanna, a farmer from Tankara in Anwada mandal of Mahbubnagar district. The mishap occurred when the accused was driving to shrine in Raichur,” the SI said.

After the death, police altered the case from Section 337 to Section 304-A (causing death by negligence) and shifted the body for post-mortem to Makhtal government hospital. “After the death of Chennakeshavulu and his father, now Chennakeshavulu’s wife, who recently delivered a baby girl, and her mother-in-law are in the house. It has become very difficult for them to run the house without a family member who has regular income,” Lingappa said.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

57,['10/03/2020'],"BJP, mafia trying to destabilise Madhya Pradesh government: Kamal Nath","Kamal Nath

BHOPAL: Late on Monday night, chief minister Kamal Nath issued a statement in which he held the BJP responsible for the political crisis in the state. “I have dedicated my entire public life to the service of people. For me, government is not a means to fulfill hunger for power but public service,” the chief minister said.

“For 15 years, BJP misused power for personal gains and comfort instead of doing public service. They want to destabilize this government,” he alleged.

Chief minister Nath said that politics of horse-trading is an attack on the state’s interest. “During the last 15 years, mafia were running a parallel government in all sectors. People were fed-up and had voted for Congress to end the mafia rule,” CM Nath argued. “On public expectations, I launched a war on the mafia. BJP is trying to destabilize the state government with the help of mafia.”

He said politics of horse-trading does not benefit any political party, state or its people, instead it harms and cripple state’s development. “After taking over as chief minister, I wanted that Madhya Pradesh should get a new identity in the country and the world. This would have benefitted the youth of the state,” he said. He accused the BJP of being “hungry for power” and “least interested in the development” of Madhya Pradesh.

In the statement, the chief minister claimed that his government gave relief to the people from land mafia, drug mafia and those selling adulterated fertilizers and making huge profits. “We launched Shuddha ke liye Yuddha to facilitate availability of unadulterated products to the people,” he said. He alleged that the mafia grew during three terms of BJP rule and under the party’s protection.

“Sand mafia looted Rs 15,000 crore from the state exchequer,” chief minister Nath alleged. “After I took-over as CM, we broke the backbone of sand mafia.” He said the new government reduced the electricity bills of middle-class families, gave farm loan waiver benefit to 23 lakh farmers, improved business confidence in the state.

“I tried that identity of Madhya Pradesh comes out of the Vyapam scam, e-tendering scam, malnutrition and poor child mortality rate and rapes taint and is known as a developed state,” he reasoned. “BJP left the state with empty coffers and no one could run the state in such poor fiscal condition. I ran the loan waiver for farmers and tried to get investments. I have always practiced politics of values and cannot compromise with them. BJP is harming the interest of the state and scuttling the infinite growth and development possibilities,” the chief minister said.

NEW DELHI: The revenue department of Delhi government has asked the transport department to help it identify the vehicles that were torched in communal clashes in northeast Delhi in the last week of February.

On the basis of the data provided by the transport department, said officials, the revenue department will process the compensation forms received by the vehicle owners. Since all vehicles are insured, instead of giving compensation to their owners, the government will facilitate them to claim insurance from the insurer.

“The transport department has yet to send us the report. We will process the compensation forms after the ownership of the vehicle is established. The owners will then be easily able to claim insurance on their damaged vehicles,” said a senior revenue department official.

Apart from the precious lives that were lost and the homes that were charred, the recent northeast Delhi riots have also left behind a trail of 446 torched vehicles. Delhi government is carrying out an exercise of identifying these vehicles and their owners through vehicle chassis numbers.

“All the vehicles are badly damaged and the only way of ascertaining their details and ownership is through locating the chassis number engraved on the vehicles,” a Delhi government official said. “The exercise is on and we have been able to identify 186 out of the total 446 vehicles till now,” he added.

Most of the vehicles targeted during the riots are two-wheelers, 304 of which have been torched, making them 68% of total vehicles burnt. The number of cars torched during the riots is 97, followed by 29 autorickshaws and three e-rickshaws. During the riots, five buses and three trucks were also torched, all of which have been identified. Among the unidentified vehicles are four tractors and an ambulance.

Clashes between the supporters and those who oppose the amended citizenship law led to large-scale communal violence in various parts of northeast Delhi in the last week of February, leaving at least 53 dead and nearly 500 injured. The government has identified about 700 properties—shops and houses—and 446 vehicles completely or partially burnt by the crowd on rampage.

Announcing compensation to the families of those who were killed, injured or lost their properties or vehicles, Delhi government had asked the victims to fill up compensation forms and deposit them at helpdesks set up at the office of the district magistrate as well as at the rescue camps and other parts of the affected area. After it received more than 1,700 forms for compensation, the government formed a team consisting six senior IAS officers assisted by sub-divisional magistrates to verify the applications.

60,['10/03/2020'],"Half-done cement roads causing accidents, hassle to motorists","Nagpur: Incomplete cement road works over 30 busy stretches in the city that were stopped by municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe citing financial crisis have turned into accident-prone spots.

A case in point is the patch between Awasthi Nagar Square to Police Talao. Barring a stretch of 50m over nullah, concretization of one side of the road is complete. “During its construction, one side of the stretch was closed for traffic. Traffic was diverted from other side that led to that side developing huge potholes,” said residents.

“Every day 10 -12 people, mostly two-wheeler riders, are getting injured in road accidents in this particular patch where only single-lane traffic is allowed,” said a traffic policeman from Sadar zone.

NMC had planned to complete Phase-I of cement roads project in 2013 but it is still incomplete and the contractor, Unity Infrastructure, has left midway. Similarly, the civic body is yet to complete all stretches under Phase-II, which was announced by the then CM Devendra Fadnavis in December 2014.

Fadnavis had sanctioned more cement roads for the city under Phase-III with an outlay of Rs300 crore on May 23, 2016. The project was to be executed as per the earlier formula with state, NMC and NIT sharing the expenses equally — Rs100 crore each.

A senior official from NMC’s public works department said that of the 51 packages of 48.804 km under Phase-II, NMC is yet to start work on three packages of 2.06 km, while work is underway on five packages of 4.57 km. Of the 10 packages (or 27 different roads) of 29.305 km, NMC is yet to start construction on 10 measuring 10.220 km over 12 roads, said the official.

Similar is the situation on Borgaon road from Awasthi Nagar Square to Dinshaw Factory T-point. The incomplete work on this busy road has been causing inconvenience to motorists, pedestrians and shop owners. Besides traffic jams, dust on the road has been posing health hazards including breathing problems for people. NMC’s public works department started concretization of this road in March last year. Till today, not even one side of the road has been completed.

“Work on road from Awasthi Nagar to Dinshaw Factory is on at a very slow pace. It appears contractor has stopped the work for several days in between. Drivers face big hardship as one side of major part is incomplete,” said SK Sirajuddin, a resident of the locality.

“Due to bad condition of the road and delayed work, drivers are facing untold hardships,” said Mohammed Farooque, a resident of Anant Nagar. Shopkeepers too pointed out that generation of dust is also causing breathing problem and other complications for most of them. Municipal commissioner Mundhe was not available for comments.

AURANGABAD: The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Aurangabad city police has launched an investigation into six individuals who allegedly handed out Rs 12.17 crore in cheques from a closed bank account.

The cheques were given to the Aurangabad Gymkhana Pvt Ltd company.

Highly-placed sources told TOI that an offence was registered after the suspects gave four cheques to one Mahendra Sampatraj Surana (60) before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). But out of the four cheques, two were dishonoured. The other two are still with Surana.

The City Chowk police station has registered an offence under Indian Penal Code section 406 (criminal breach of trust) and section 420 (cheating).

Authorities said police teams will soon be formed to make arrests.

The complainant, Surana, said he ran a construction business in Mumbai with his brother.

Their firm, that was also registered with the city’s Slum Rehabilitation Authority , got taken over by some other builders and was later registered as a Limited Liability Partnership firm.

Police said Surana claimed that he approached the company law tribunal after differences emerged between partners over defaults on payments. His petition with the National Company Law Tribunal was filed in March last year.

Authorities said that during an National Company Law Tribunal arbitration in August, the suspects promised to pay the dues and handed over four cheques to Surana.

“After two cheques were deposited with banks in November last year and this January, I discovered that the bank accounts mentioned in the cheques had been blocked,” Surana told TOI.

Economic Offences Wing’s senior inspector D S Singare, who is currently investigating the case, could not be reached for comments. But sources from within the specialist department said a case has been registered.

“The suspects named in the complaint are top builders and realtors operating out of the state capital,” an EOW official said.

In the last week alone, on three occasions the Air Quality Index (AQI) — used to monitor pollution in the city — for Hyderabad was higher, in spite of the city getting light drizzle.On Thursday, the AQI in the city was 118 as opposed to 79 in Delhi.

Such factors must be analysed before we reach any conclusion,” said Babu Rao, an air pollution expert.Besides this, the greater awareness may also be a contributing factor, say some experts, adding that Hyderabad needs to do more.As per TSPCB data, the AQI index was the highest in February at IDA Pashamylaram (115), followed by Zoo park (113). The data was based on the levels monitored by Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations.

67,['10/03/2020'],Chennai: K Kamaraj missing in domestic terminal name,"A file photo of the old domestic terminal with the leader’s name (in red)

CHENNAI: Chennai airport is expanding and new terminals are being built, but the name of Tamil Nadu’s charismatic former chief minister K Kamaraj has been forgotten in the naming.

The domestic terminal was originally named after Kamaraj, but the Airports Authority of India (AAI) did not give the new building a name while commissioning it in 2013, as the old one still stood.

Domestic operations moved to the new steel and glass terminal in 2013, but pilots taxiing to the terminal saw the board Kamaraj domestic terminal atop the building and made inflight announcements using the leader's name. That too has vanished when the building was pulled down two years ago for an integrated terminal. Work is set to complete by the end of the year. The airport continues to be called Anna international airport after DMK founder C N Annadurai ’s name was given to the international terminal. There was a confusion over the naming when new international and domestic terminals were commissioned in 2013.

Ministry of civil aviation and the AAI at that time promised Congress leaders that Kamaraj’s name would be restored when the airport work was completed. There is no such move for now.

As per rules, a resolution is to be passed in the assembly requesting for name change of an airport and approved by the Centyre. In 2013, when the new terminals were opened, the TN assembly passed a resolution demanding the Centre name them after AIADMK leader M G Ramachandran. This too is yet to be implemented.

Congress leaders from the state have not forgotten the issue. TNCC president K S Alagiri said: “AAI has given an undertaking that the terminal will be named after Kamaraj after all the ongoing work is completed. We have raised the issue with the ministry. The legacy is not forgotten.”

A Chellakumar, Congress MP, said there should not be any change. “The name has to be restored,” K Kamaraj was two time chief minister of Tamil Nadu and was also national president of Congress and was intrumental in launching many schemes which were later adopted nationally.

The international terminal was named after Annadurai and domestic terminal after Kamarajar after DMK leader M Karunanidhi made a request and then Prime Minister V P Singh announced the name. The move was to pacify two parties in the state. Now, while the international airport is named after Anna, the domestic terminal has no name.

HYDERABAD: Did the man who allegedly bludgeoned a retired police sub-inspector to death in Adilabad on March 6, take a selfie with the bloodied body? The 62-year-old former ASI, T Shivraj, was killed in Telangana ’s Utnoor mandal.

Following the murder , three persons surrendered before cops. On Monday, the selfie of the main accused, Vivek, purportedly taken with the body of the victim, went viral on social media. The photo has been taken from a top angle with Vivek in the frame and a stray dog sniffing around the body of the victim in the background. Sources in the police department said Vivek allegedly took the selfie and sent it to a friend who may have leaked it on social media.

Shivraj was allegedly bludgeoned to death by Vivek, an engineering dropout at their village Gangannapet in Adilabad, on the evening of March 6 over a property dispute. The accused is also Shivraj’s nephew. Utnoor DSP N Uday Reddy said that Shivraj had disputes with his younger brother Jayaraj over ancestral property, for several years.

On March 6, when Shivraj was visiting a prayer hall in their village, Jayaraj’s wife Vanaja and their two sons Vivek and Manoj got into an argument with the retired cop. “During the argument, Vivek attacked Shivraj with a stick. Due to severe head injury, Shivraj collapsed on the spot,” the DSP said.

Shivraj’s family rushed him to a hospital in Utnoor where he was declared dead on arrival. “Following the incident, the accused surrendered before the police,” Adilabad SP Vishnu S Warrier said. “All of them were produced before the court and were sent to judicial remand.”

On Monday, the selfie was broadcast by various Telugu TV channels. “There were several people around when the assault took place. Even after the assault nearly 15 to 20 people from the neighbourhood were present. We are verifying all facts,” the DSP said. The police are planning to seek custody of Vivek and the data in his seized cell phone is being analysed.

71,['10/03/2020'],Muttathara to house multi-purpose cyclone shelter soon,"Thiruvananthapuram: The state government has given administrative sanction for setting up a multi-purpose cyclone shelter at Muttathara . The project will be implemented at a cost of Rs 7 crore.

Earlier, 27 sites were selected for the construction of multi-purpose cyclone shelters in the state. The administrative sanction was issued for the construction of 10 multi-purpose cyclone shelters ( MPCS ) at specified sites in districts namely Ernakulam, Alappuzha, Thrissur, Malappuram and Kozhikode for a total amount of Rs 50 crore.

However, out of the sites which got administrative sanction, two works (Naluchira and Kumarapuram in Alappuzha) were dropped due to objection of the education department in handing over the site and due to the delay in getting hindrance free site and hence, an amount of Rs 8.31 crore was available as savings in this regard.

Project director NDMA-NCRMP then granted permission for taking up the work of one MPCS at Muttathara in Thiruvananthapuram. The government gave administrative sanction for setting up MPCS at Muttathara following the request by state project manager.

The facility at Muttathara will be set up by utilizing savings in the administrative sanction already accorded for the work of Naluchira and Kumarapuram which were dropped.

As per the guidelines issued by GoI-UNDP disaster risk reduction programme, construction of cyclone shelters has been a proven means of preparedness as the vulnerable population can be evacuated to these structures immediately after receiving cyclone warning.

India has a 40-year history of construction and maintenance of cyclone shelters, notably in states such as Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Tamil Nadu. Cyclone shelters constructed in these states proved effective and have become a source of local motivation for preparedness, the report notes.

72,['10/03/2020'],Delhi high court refuses bail to terror accused with Lashkar-e-Taiba links,"Delhi high court

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has dismissed the bail plea of an alleged operative of the terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) saying there was enough material to show he was conspiring to carry out terror attacks in the capital and its neighbouring regions.

Justice Brijesh Sethi found no ground to grant bail to Mohd Rashid, an imam at a mosque in Nuh, Haryana, who was arrested in 2013.

The court noted that the records revealed that Rashid with accused Shahid conspired to carry out terror attacks and also raised funds in the name of jihad. The SIM cards recovered from him also showed he was in touch with a LeT commander, Javed Baluchi, in Pakistan.

Appearing for the prosecution, additional public prosecutor Neelam Sharma told the court that the allegations against Rashid were serious, which was why he had been booked under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.

Delhi Police has claimed that Rashid was in touch with Baluchi through mobile phones and conspiring to carry out terror attacks in Delhi. Both Rashid and Shahid were booked for the offences punishable under provisions of stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and IPC Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy).

Rashid, allegedly a top leader of LeT’s Mewat module, was tasked to build a network in the region and recruit people for carrying out blasts in Delhi and other regions, police had claimed. While working as an imam, he also provided logistic support to members of LeT, they said.

The responsibility entrusted to Shahid by his handlers was to arrange logistics and communication for the attack, police said. In his petition, Rashid sought parity, arguing that Shahid was granted bail already. But the court pointed out there was no evidence to show Shahid was in touch with LeT commander to whom Rashid has been linked.

AHMEDABAD: Meat eaters seem to be refraining of late, as meat sales have fallen by 60% in the past one month across Ahmedabad. According to estimates by meat wholesalers in Ahmedabad, against the 100 tonnes of meat sold every day in the city earlier, sales have fallen to 40 tonnes a day. Traders attribute the decline to rumours linked to the coronavirus outbreak.

“We used to sell 100kg of meat such chicken, lamb and fish every day. Demand has fallen in the past one month, since the COVID-19 outbreak has been reported. While the government advisory only states that meat should be cooked properly, there are rumours being spread about meat consumption. People are thus getting hesitant to buying and eat meat,” said Mohammad Ali Ahmed, owner of a meat wholesale store.

Meat prices have fallen from Rs 160 a kg to Rs 100 in three weeks, poultry dealers say, adding that several hotels that earlier served meat have stopped procurement.

“We have taken all the items that include uncooked meat or cold cuts off the menu, due to the health advisory issued by the government. Procurement is done from verified sources and what is not readily available is not being served temporarily, due to health concerns,” said a city hotelier, on condition of anonymity.

Some hotels have boosted food hygiene measures in meat procurement. “There has been no significant impact on non-vegetarian food consumption at hotels. We have ensured that we procure our meat locally and double check for hygiene and quality in the interest of our guests’ health,” said another hotelier.

CHENNAI: Two men were arrested for posing as food delivery agents and snatching an 11-sovereign gold chain from a woman at J J Nagar on Sunday night. Police arrested Gopi, 35, of Vellore and his associate Sivanesan, 20, of Avadi after checking nearly 50 CCTV footage.

Police said one of the two wore a T-shirt commonly worn by food delivery agents and went looking for their target believing that no one would suspect them. The two were formerly employed with a online food delivery firm.

Police said on February 21, at 7.15pm, they were crossing Mogappair East when they saw a woman walking along wearing a 11-sovereign gold chain. They followed her from behind till her house. When a neighbour questioned the two, they said they had come to deliver food. As soon as the neighbour left, they pushed down Latha and snatched her 11-sovereign gold chain and fled.

“The duo had monitored the victim’s movements in the locality,” said an investigating officer.

Based on her complaint, police launched a hunt for the duo. They had to track footage of nearly 50 CCTV cameras to find the escape routes of the snatchers as the vehicle they used was a stolen one.

Police managed to trace Gopi at Pachaiyyapar Road, Mogappair. He has been residing in city for nearly five years. With the help of Gopi, police nabbed Sivanesan.

Police said Gopi and Sivanesan were employed at a online food delivery firm when they befriended each other. They quit the company six months ago.

This police said it was their first snatching case. They used to run a spa in the locality. When sleuths of Anti Vice Squad (AVS) busted a prostitution racket in the spa the two were arrested.

Police recovered a nine-sovereign gold chain from them. They were remanded in judicial custody.

HYDERABAD: Keeping in mind the increasing footfall at all major stations in the city, Indian Railways has decided to increase patrolling on platforms and add modernised features to the security system at stations.

Indian Railways is aiming at modernizing security at railway premises while providing Railway Protection Force (RPF) with body-worn cameras, night vision devices, facial recognition software in CCTV cameras, topography mapping of railway, drone cameras, baggage scanners etc

“These devices can significantly improve the way RPF covers the field. During festive season which is largely throughout the year the footfall at our railway stations increases. Our operations will be more effective if we are rightly equipped,” a senior RPF official told TOI.

South Central Railway (SCR) officials said that the move can help minimise the risk of unauthorised access to the platforms, stations and trains. “There are scanning gadgets already installed at the entry points of railway stations and they are set for an upgrade. We will also deploy a team of highly trained RPF personnel at key points on the stations,” said an SCR official.

In a recent order issued by Indian Railways, it was mentioned that RPF officers at zonal and divisional levels will have administrative and financial authority to equip themselves with security-related devices.

76,['10/03/2020'],Medavakkam residents upset as complaints about sewage ignored,"Chennai: Sewage being let out into stormwater drains does not surprise residents in Medavakkam anymore. What has upset them is the authorities not taking any action, though the violation is right next to the panchayat office.

At Kakkan street off Mambakkam main road, an open drain runs adjacent to the compound wall of Medavakkam village panchayat office and other government offices. Sewage from residences and commercial enterprises is let into the open drain, which flows into the stormwater drain along Mambakkam main road, say residents.

The sewage eventually reaches waterbodies nearby, polluting them. “There used to be a time when tankers collected sewage from residences and, after parking in the panchayat officer premises, on the sly dumped it in the stormwater drain, drilling holes in the compound wall for the outlet hoses. After repeated complaints, it was stopped,” said a resident requesting anonymity.

When ToI visited the panchayat office, a circular cement patch covering a pipe-sized hole in the compound wall was still visible.

Residents demand that the Chengalpet district authorities take swift action to ensure the water bodies are not polluted. The state highways department has begun constructing stormwater drains along the Mambakkam main road, opposite the panchayat office.

An official with the St Thomas Mount block development office said that they had started plugging sewage lines on the orders of the National Green Tribunal and necessary action will be initiated.

Residents say that though Medavakkam was one of the fast-developing suburbs in the city, with a metro rail project in the pipeline, its classification as a village panchayat had robbed them of funds for civic projects.

77,['10/03/2020'],Ahmedabad: Gold price dips after hitting record high,"Picture used for representational purpose only

AHMEDABAD: The global spread of coronavirus infections, rising concerns of its fallout on global trade, coupled with the Yes Bank crisis had led to a sharp rise in price of gold in the international market till Friday. After touching a record-high of Rs 46,100 per 10g in the Ahmedabad market on Friday, gold prices dropped by Rs 600 to settle at Rs 45,500 per 10g on Monday. According to analysts, increased profit-booking of gold led to the decline in gold prices globally.

“Despite the decline in international gold price due to profit-booking, gold prices continued to remain firm in the local market, due to depreciation of the Indian currency , at Rs 74.38 against the US dollar. Concerned over adverse impact of coronavirus outbreak on trade, investors have been making safe-haven investments in gold. Even Indian investors are increasingly following suit, especially after the Yes Bank crisis,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA).

High prices of gold have propelled a lot of people to sell previously purchased gold, anticipating better returns. “Gold prices breaching the Rs 46,000-mark on Friday led many people to sell gold, which was previously purchased at a lower price. We’re receiving previously purchased coins and bars as well as jewellery from customers, who got better returns,” said Jigar Soni, vice president, Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA).

Jewellers fear that the increase in prices will dent the demand for gold and gold jewellery in the days to come. “Despite the ongoing wedding season, the demand has declined significantly. Our revenues are taking a hit because customers who purchase gold tend to exchange at least 70% of the total volume of purchase. Despite discounts offered on making charges and others, sales are lukewarm,” said a city-based jeweller, on condition of anonymity. “The demand from rural areas has also been impacted due to a crisis situation in agriculture with unseasonal rainfall.”

NEW DELHI: For more than 50 families affected by the riots in north-east Delhi, the search for missing members has taken them to hospitals and mortuaries. For some, there has been closure with 20 bodies having been identified till Monday while the rest are still looking.

For a family of four, the search ended on Monday at GTB Hospital. A 20-year-old woman, along with two daughters, eight months and four years of age, had been desperately looking for her husband since February 25. When she was finally on the verge of giving up, she got a call from GTB Hospital about a new body that had been brought there. It was that of her husband.

“He had left home to get milk for our mother who was unwell,” recalled an inconsolable Mohammed Naseem, brother of the deceased, Mohammed Jameel , 26. “When he had stepped out, things were normal, but in no time, the area turned into a battlefield. There were angry people everywhere who just wanted to kill. I am sure my brother would not have done anything. We got really worried when he didn’t return home. We looked for him everywhere but drew a blank.”

Naseem said they kept on returning to GTB but were repeatedly turned away. “Today, we finally found him at the same hospital. His body was brought here after being fished out of the Sonia Vihar drain. Doctors say his throat has been slit,” said Naseem.

Jameel’s wife was waiting outside the mortuary on Monday, waiting to take the body to their ancestral village in Bihar to conduct the last rites.

Delhi high court had directed hospital authorities and the police to preserve each unidentified body at least till March 11 with the next hearing on the riots being March 12. The high court had also issued directions for video-recording all autopsies and preserving DNA samples of all bodies currently in the mortuaries.

The search for eight other families had similarly ended at Al Hind Hospital where the bodies were stored. One family turned out to be lucky in a way — their man had been arrested. Most of these men went missing on February 25 when they had gone out to buy food items for their family members anticipating a riot-like situation.

Matloon Alam, however, is still looking for his younger brother. A resident of Hussain Vihar locality in northeast Delhi, Alam said his 22-year-old brother, Shahbaaz, a welder, disappeared from Karawal Nagar on February 25 while returning home from a hospital where he had gone for a health check-up.

The violence in northeast Delhi started on February 23 on a 2km stretch connecting Jafrabad and Maujpur and spread to other areas later. Between February 23 and March 2, nine police stations in north-east Delhi — Khajuri Khas, Karawal Nagar, Nand Nagri, Jafrabad, Seelampur, Gokalpuri, Jyoti Nagar, Dayalpur and Bhajanpura — recorded complaints about missing persons.

79,['10/03/2020'],Civic body wins battle over 72 cents worth Rs 100 crore,"Chennai: After a long drawn legal battle, a city civil court has ruled in favour of the city corporation, confirming that 72 cents of land in a prime locality in Shenoy Nagar belongs to the civic body. The market value of the property is said to be more than Rs 100 crore.

The private parties who were in possession of the property since 1952 had constructed two temples on the land and were running them. Meanwhile, the special commissioner of land administration had set aside the patta issued to them in 2004 after finding that the orders of the assistant settlement officer, Tiruvannamalai, was illegal.

When the issue came up before the Madras high court in 2011 challenging the validity of the special commissioner’s orders, the Greater Chennai Corporation submitted that the land in contention was handed over to the civic body by the collector of Madras in 1953 and that the alleged sale deed relied upon by the settlement officer was also fabricated.

“As per the revenue records, the town survey register also stood in the name of Chennai Corporation and therefore the proceedings of the assistant settlement officer were totally erroneous and as such the special commissioner has cancelled on suo motu revision,” the corporation had argued.

The high court had ruled in favour of the civic body after which proceedings were under way in the city civil courts seeking a permanent injunction against the corporation.

Meanwhile, last week, senior civil judge, S Rohini too dismissed the suit filed against the Chennai corporation.

This is the second instance of the civic body regaining possession of its property in Shenoy Nagar in the past six months. In October last year, the civic body had reclaimed 4.3 acres of land from an education trust.

The land was leased to Thiru Vi Ka Dr Mu Va Educational Trust for a period of 33 years, from 1962 until 1995. After the lease period ended, the civic body issued a notice to the trust to handover the land to it. But, the trust contested it legally and after a legal battle, the civic body took possession of the land.

CHENNAI: A local consumer grievances redressal forum has penalised a retail store in Ambattur for selling duplicates of branded air-conditioners.

Petitioner V Lakshmipathi from Thirunindravur bought a one-tonne capacity A/C from Surya Stores in June 2014 for his house for Rs 35,000. But when he installed the device, it didn’t work properly and there was hardly any change in the room temperature even after keeping the system switched on for hours.

When Lakshmipathi approached the store in Ambattur it said it was no way responsible for defects and directed him to approach O-General’s authorised service centre, Lakshmipathi said at Thiruvallur consumer forum .

Service engineers from the manufacturer checked the cooling system and informed Lakshmipathi that the AC was not manufactured by O-General and materials fitted were not original.

The model numbers mentioned in the outdoor unit and indoor models were different. Air-conditioner parts were imported illegally by unscrupulous people and pushed into market through Surya Stores, said O-General in its counter-affidavit.

O-General has complained about this to the Central Board of Excise and Customs and the Central Finance Department. The electronic shop in reply said all products it sold were supplied by manufacturers with the bill and it paid necessary taxes for the same.

In this case, the complainant failed to send a copy of the bill despite repeated requests and approached police and the forum to tarnish its image, the store said. The forum on February 19 directed Surya Stores to replace the duplicate AC with a new and original O-General AC within one month and refund the purchase amount of Rs 35,000 to the complainant.

Besides this, the store was directed to pay Rs 20,000 as compensation for mental agony caused and another Rs 10,000 towards litigation expenses.

NEW DELHI: A consignment of six baby Alexandrine parakeets, who were being trafficked on a Rajdhani Express, was seized at New Delhi Railway Station on Sunday night. The parakeets were concealed in milk cartons.

The birds were rescued after a passenger on board the train heard their sound and alerted the Delhi forest department and railway authorities. “Following directions from the chief wildlife warden and Delhi’s wildlife officer, the parakeets were rescued by the railway police and wildlife authorities at the railway station,” said an official. The birds were later handed over to Wildlife SOS, an NGO, for treatment.

The delicate baby birds were crammed into milk cartons to avoid suspicion and detection. “They will be freed into their natural habitat after they are fit for release,” said Geeta Seshamani, secretary at Wildlife SOS.

Despite being listed as a “near threatened” species, Alexandrine parakeet (Psittaculla eupatria) is one of the most sought after species in the Indian live bird trade. Parakeets that are 3-4 weeks old are captured from the wild and are crammed into tiny containers and transported to bird markets in Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Patna, Lucknow and Kolkata. In most cases, the birds die en route due to stressful conditions.

“It was heartening to see a quick response from the authorities concerned to seize the live birds from the railway station,” said Kartick Satyanarayan of Wildlife SOS.

HYDERABAD: Congress MLA T Jayaprakash Reddy on Monday requested chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to scrap government order 111 ( GO 111 ) and help poor farmers who own land in the 10 kilometre radius of Osmansagar and Himayatsagar reservoirs.

Jagga Reddy said an issue is being made out of GO 111 in connection with the farm house at Janwada that is allegedly owned by TRS leaders and taken on lease by minister KT Rama Rao. “In addition to the farmhouse, there are buildings and other constructions owned by industrialists and leaders in the areas that come under GO 111 purview,” he said.

Reddy’s comments come at a time when his party working president and Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy has been arrested for using drone cameras on KTR’s alleged farm house in GO 111 purview.

85,['10/03/2020'],Gulf workers to protest fund snub in Telangana budget,"HYDERABAD: Workers from Telangana employed in UAE, Qatar and Kuwait are set to stage a protest in front of ministers’ quarters due to the absence of allocations for Gulf workers’ welfare in the state budget. They have planned to carry bodies of deceased workers which were brought back as part of protest.

Founder-president of Gulf Workers Awareness Centre (GWAC) Krishna Donikeni, an IT professional in Dubai , on Monday said pleas of workers to establish a Gulf-NRI policy have been ignored by the state government. “Now the only option is to take the dead bodies to houses of MLAs to make them aware of deaths in Gulf countries,” Krishna said.

The workers have been demanding a policy which includes ex-gratia compensation of Rs 10 lakh to families of those who die in the Gulf. Proper training, jobs to those who return from the Gulf and pensions to those who are unable to work are also part of their demands. They have called for stringent measures to deal with agents who mislead workers and send them to the Gulf without following due procedures.

On February 28, a meeting of nearly 5,000 workers was held in Dubai urging the Telangana government for a Gulf-NRI policy. An estimated 1,500 peopled have died in Gulf countries since 2014. Every month at least 7-10 bodies arrive at the Shamshabad airport. Most of these deaths are due to heart attacks, accidents and some due to suicides.

Gulf workers argue that it should not be a problem for the government to sanction ex-gratia compensation to families of those who die in the Gulf owing to their sizeable remittances. There are an estimated 10 lakh workers from Telangana in the currently and a Gulf-NRI policy, if implemented, is said to benefit at least 40 lakh people.

In the previous budget, Rs 100 crore was allocated towards general administration department (GAD) account for NRIs but this was not specifically for Gulf NRIs.

In Karimagar, families of Gulf workers had staged a dharna demanding that the government should allocate at least Rs 500 crore for the welfare of NRIs in the Gulf.

86,['10/03/2020'],YSRC to reserve decision on mayoral choice till victory,"Guntur: With the mayoral race hotting up, YSRC has decided not to announce the candidate before the elections. Rather, the party heads have directed legislators to focus on ensuring victory of all candidates in Guntur city without promising anyone the top post. With the mayor ’s post reserved for general quota, leaders from Vysya, Kapu and Reddy communities are vying with one another for the post.

In relation with the local body elections, the district in-charge minister Ch Sriranganatha Raju and district party affairs in-charge Alla Ayodhyarami Reddy held a series of meetings with legislators and senior leaders in the last two days and decided not to name anyone as mayoral candidate. In fact, the chief minister and party president YS Jaganmohan Reddy has directed the party affairs in-charges and in-charge ministers to ensure that selection of candidates does not result in infightings.

Sources said YSRC city-wing president Padarthi Ramesh Gandhi is front runner for the mayoral post as Guntur East MLA Mohammed Mustafa and West constituency in-charge Ch Yesurathnam are backing his candidature. Mustafa is reportedly lobbying for Gandhi in return of the Vysya community’s support to the party in the city.

Ramesh Gandhi has been in politics for over 30 years but has not had much success as he missed many opportunities to contest assembly elections in the eleventh-hour. He is gearing up to contest as corporator from Kothapet where he has good network and following among party workers.

Meanwhile, Kapu leader Kavati Manohar Naidu, sources said, is also testing his luck. He is reportedly lobbying through municipal administration minister Botcha Satyanarayana.

However, many leaders in the city are not in favour of Manohar as the mayoral candidate. Moreover, Kapus are likely to get the chance to head civic bodies in East and West Godavari districts prompting the party to look for alternative candidates.

Sources in the party said a few senior leaders have suggested Guntur Lok Sabha constituency party affairs in-charge Lella Appireddy to contest the municipal elections. Appireddy, who lost in the assembly elections in 2014, was denied a ticket in 2019 elections in return of a better position. Although he wanted to enter the legislature through the council, the decision to abolish the Upper House has dashed his hopes. Sources said Appireddy has not taken a call on the issue yet. “There is no surprise if the chief minister picks a dark horse for the top post after the elections,” said a senior leader.

Meanwhile, sources said among other candidates, an owner of a private educational institutions, Bharath Reddy is, in the mayoral race.

88,['10/03/2020'],"Sans prosecution director, Pondy faces setbacks in legal tussles","Puducherry: The Puducherry government has started facing setbacks in legal tussles as the vital post of director of prosecution fell vacant after V Ruthrakumaran retired on January 31. The post of deputy director of prosecution had fallen vacant in 2017.

Presently, Puducherry does not have any eligible candidates for the posts of director and deputy director as the government failed to appoint assistant public prosecutors on a regular basis over the years. As per Criminal procedure code (CrPc), only an assistant public prosecutor appointed on a regular basis with not less than 10 years' experience of practising law can become a deputy director or director of prosecution.

Rutharakumaran regretted that the law department did not initiate any effort to fill up the post of APPs as per the provisions of the CrPc and recruitment rules despite the government passing an order in this regard in August 2009. The law department continues to appoint APPs on temporary/part-time basis. He pointed out that the Madras high court in a 2019-order directed the Puducherry government not to continue appointing temporary/part-time APPs and allowing them to continue for an unspecified period.

""Appointment of such part-time or temporary assistant public prosecutor will hamper the prosecution before the courts. Maintaining integrity is of paramount importance. In order to maintain integrity of the institution, more specifically while prosecuting offenders, the role of public prosecutors are more important and appointing the persons as temporary/part-time APP will certainly affect the very institutional integrity...the State is duty-bound to appoint persons on permanent basis strictly by following the recruitment rules in force,"" said the order.

The Puducherry government without any eligible candidates for director post requested the registrar general of Madras high court to depute a civil judge for the post. However, the move drew flak as legal experts pointed out that a civil judge has only five years’ experience of practising law whereas only those with not less than 10 years’ experience of practising law are eligible to apply for the post as per the CrPc.

Rutharakumaran said appointing a civil judge will be against the provisions of the CrPc and the recruitment rules. ""... the appointment of judicial officers as director of prosecution will be clear contempt of hon'ble high court as in the case of appointment of assistant public prosecutors (on temporary/part-time basis),"" Rutharakumaran said.

Of the 13 sanctioned posts in the directorate, only two - a legal assistant and a stenographer - are working in the directorate and the rest are deputed to other departments including law department thus weakening the directorate.

The sorry state of affair of the directorate of prosecution in Puducherry is mainly because the directorate functions under the law department, which is against the provisions of CrPc. Ruthrakumaran said as per section 25-A (3) of the CrPc, 'the head of the directorate of prosecution shall be the director, who shall function under the administrative control of the head of the home department in the state. He pointed out that in Puducherry, the functioning of directorate of prosecution is weakened by making it a 'wing' of the law department.

Rutharakumaran appealed to the government to strengthen the directorate by bringing it under the administrative control of the home department as in other states and Union territories in the country.

COIMBATORE: The animal husbandry department has started taking preventive steps on the Tamil Nadu– Kerala borders in Coimbatore and Nilgiris in the wake of bird flu outbreak in the neighbouring state.

Animal husbandry officials said they have contacted their counterparts in Kerala to assess the gravity of the situation there. Though Kerala officials said they have decided to cull chicken in the bird flu-affected areas of Kozhikode, Tamil Nadu authorities have decided to step up preventive measures.

As part of the measures, the officials here have started monitoring all poultry farms in Tamil Nadu, particularly in border districts like Coimbatore.

This apart, the officials have instructed teams to be stationed at the check-posts on interstate border and spray disinfectants on all vehicles that enter from Kerala.

93,['10/03/2020'],Water board in a fix over sewerage in GHMC areas,"The network in all the 11 GHMC circles is more than 30 years old

HYDERABAD: The sewage network in GHMC peripheral areas is spread over 3,600 km, but HMWS&SB has no clue on its feasibility. The network in all the 11 GHMC circles is more than 30 years old. Senior officials said that with most of the manholes either damaged or in bad condition, the water board has its task cut out.

A senior official said a detailed survey on the existing sewer network will have to be carried out in operations and maintenance (O&M) divisions on a priority. “We do not have a clue on the present condition of the sewer network,” he told TOI.

It may be recalled the water board had taken over the sewerage network in GHMC periphery circles and begun operations since March 1.

Officials are also concerned over removal of encroachments and unauthorised structures on the sewer lines. Since GHMC does not have a data on encroachments, the Water Board will have to check out all the encroachments on the sewer network, said an official.

There are 3.26 lakh manholes in the GHMC peripheral areas alone, an official said. “To cut down the complaints, we are looking at rejigging the entire network,” he said. There is also a need to change the existing manhole covers having GHMC/MCH logo with HMWS&SB logo, he explained.

As soon as the water board took over the network, it started sending SMS alerts to over four lakh consumers in all the GHMC peripheral circles. Details like name of the officer, his/her mobile number, HMWS&SB call centre (155313) and name of the section (area) to register complaints related to sewer network are being furnished. “Consumers can register their complaints either to officials or to 155313,” an official said.

“We will also be operating 29 air-tech machines and another 66 mini air-tech machines to look into sewer-related complaints,” the official added.

Two fire tenders — from Civil Lines and Trimurti Nagar — were used to douse the fire.

Corporator Sanjay Bangale has told the Dharampeth Zone office to register an FIR against the owner. “The owner of a well-known showroom at Laxmi Bhuvan Square purchased a residential bungalow and converted it into a plastic store. Following protests from residents, the NMC shut it down. However, the owner continued to use it to store goods. Around six workers used to stay in the building,” he said.

In Kalamna, station officer of fire station Anil Barde, said the fire started from one of the shanties at around 11am. “The fire spreads quickly. 10 shanties caught fire. 10 fire tenders were used to control the fire.

96,['10/03/2020'],Vet univ to form team to inspect affected areas,"Thrissur: Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University ( KVASU ) will step up surveillance and containment measures across the state following outbreak of diseases like avian influenza and monkey fever .

A team of experts will visit areas in Kozhikode district where avian influenza was reported, vice chancellor prof M R Saseendranath said.

The team would comprise six to seven senior-level scientists from the university. Suggestions would be submitted based on their requirements and findings to the animal husbandary department.

Dr Chintu Ravisankar of the microbiology department of KVASU said the university has already launched a project to study the role of migratory birds in the spread of respiratory diseases among birds. The project also aims at augmenting surveillance mechanism for such diseases.

The VC said the university has also assured the animal husbandry department officials that it was willing to provide any required support for containing the disease as well as for de-populating the disease affected and susceptible birds. “Currently, carcasses of poultry and animals, suspected to have died due to bird flu or monkey fever, are being brought to the university, for postmortem. This may lead spread of virus during transport and at the university laboratories. To avoid this, the new proposal is to send experts’ team to these sites where the animals or birds have died,” the vice chancellor said.

“Whenever there are reports of diseases like monkey fever, one of the advices that we give to people is to immediately report to veterinary experts, as soon as they see the carcass of a monkey, instead of they handing it on ther own,” he said.

Dr Sanseendranath said, a protocol for veterinarians and para veterinarians who deal with deadly diseases like avian influenza will be developed by the university.

100,['10/03/2020'],"Delhi Coronavirus News: Ensure forms are filled on flight, airlines told","Though additional infrared thermometers have been procured to meet the demand, long queues still remain a conc... Read More

NEW DELHI: Amid the coronavirus scare, over 50 passengers coming from abroad are being screened every minute at Indira Gandhi International Airport.

Airport Health Organisation (APHO) — the nodal body screening passengers — says that managing long queues becomes a problem at times because passengers reach the screening point without filling their self-declaration forms. APHO has asked the airlines to ensure the form is filled in advance, preferably before landing. This is expected to reduce the queues before the immigration counters.

The Customs department, meanwhile, on Monday issued a notice stating that passengers arriving on flights from 12 countries — China, Iran, Italy, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, Nepal, Thailand and Malaysia — will not be able to enter the duty free shopping areas due to “operational limitations and instructions given vide Union ministry of finance.”

At present, APHO has set up thermal screening machines, and is using infrared thermometers to assess and determine the symptoms of coronavirus before a passenger reaches the immigration counter at IGI. The central government has made it mandatory for each passenger to fill a self-declaration form. One copy is provided to APHO, while the second copy is stamped and returned to the passenger, allowing him/her to proceed ahead for the immigration formalities.

A senior official from APHO, on the condition of anonymity, said that they have been catering to thousands of passengers every day. “The exact number of people whom we cater to every hour cannot be ascertained as there are people who do not fill the declaration forms while on the flight,” the official added.

Though additional infrared thermometers have been procured to meet the demand, long queues still remain a concern.

“Each passenger is being thoroughly scanned and equipment is not a problem. No passenger can pass through without being scanned and their self-declaration form being stamped. However, a few people are still reaching us without having their form filled, which is leading to long queues,” said the official.

Till early February, only four countries—China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand—were on the mandatory screening list. This list was expanded to 12 countries last week, including Japan, South Korea, Nepal, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Iran and Italy.

On March 4, however, the central government issued a notice, stating that passengers from all countries arriving into India now needed to be scanned and their information stored in the database. If required, this database may be used to track a passenger later.

101,['10/03/2020'],Central excise to restore old lighthouse at Rs 3.32cr,"Puducherry: If things crystallize as per the plans of the Centre excise, Puducherry, the public and tourists alike can have a panoramic aerial view of the beautiful tourist town and suburbs from the 29m-high 19th-century lighthouse on the Beach Road. The central excise has proposed to restore the lighthouse at a cost of Rs 3.32 crore and open the heritage building for public view.

Commissioner (central excise and GST) G Ravindranath told reporters on Monday that the Union finance ministry, department of revenue, central board of indirect taxes and customs has earmarked Rs 3,32,36,000 for the project, which will commence in March this year and will be completed by March next year.

Central public works department will execute the project under the watchful eyes of the structural consultant - National centre for the safety of heritage structures, department of civil engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras and architectural consultant – Indian trust for art and cultural heritage (Intach).

One of the oldest lighthouses on the coromandel coast, it was built by the French and became operational on July 1, 1836, beaming light visible to the distance of 15 to 17 miles and guide the mariners during the night. It initially had six oil lamps and silver reflectors to guide the light beam. The oil lamps were replaced with a 1KW electric bulb that rotated and beamed light to 28 miles. It took 36 seconds for one full rotation. It was functional until frequent issues with the light sources and a new lighthouse was built at Kirapalayam in 1970.

“Once restored to its past glory, the old lighthouse will be the pride of Puducherry. It will be an added attraction to the beautiful boulevard,” said Ravindranath. The 29m-heritage structure has a wooden staircase (218 steps) inside leading to the terrace and the public and tourists can reach the top to have a panoramic aerial view of the town.

“The visitors will be permitted to reach the top of the lighthouse in batches. We can see Matrimandir in Auroville from the top. We also propose to have a binocular-mounted tripod on the top to enable the visitors to have a greater aerial view,” he said adding that the central excise does not want to make any project out of the project.

“The lighthouse belongs to the people of India in general and people of Puducherry in particular. We are the proud custodian of the people’s property. Our aim is that tourists visiting Puducherry must make it a point to visit the old lighthouse,” he said.

Earlier Intach senior architect Arul gave a presentation on the renovation of the old lighthouse in the presence of Intach co-convener Ashok Panda.

While 132 wards of estate workers got education subsidy to the tune of Rs 29 lakh, 87 wards of schedule caste estate workers were given Rs 11 lakh as scholarships.

A cumulative subsidy amount of Rs 65 crore has been pending with the tea board since 2016. According to Tea Board vice-chairman B Kumaran, Rs 10 crore will be disbursed to the farmers by next month.

The board has several schemes for production of good quality green-leaf tea, maintaining tea gardens, for enhancement of lifestyle of small tea farmers and to encourage orthodox tea production. “The total arrears to the tune of Rs 65 crore will be disbursed completely by June 2020 on instalments. Then the board will start receiving new applications for subsidies for the current year from farmers,” Kumaran said.

According to the official, subsidies will be given for planting tea saplings, replanting, pruning, sprinklers and machines for harvesting tea. “The quality of harvested tea is monitored on periodical basis by the development officers of tea board and the quality of made-tea, too, by the tea manufacturing factories,” said Kumaran. “Teams of tea board officials are monitoring all check-posts in the Nilgiris to restrict inflow of waste tea from other states. Thus, adulteration is curtailed. Tea board is also taking stringent action against tea manufacturing factories indulging in adulteration.”

AHMEDABAD: Three patients — a 12-year-old girl, a 15-year-old girl, and a 17-year-old boy — will be able to lead normal lives after corrective surgeries for kyphoscoliosis (deformed spine) were performed at Civil Hospital .

Dr J V Modi, the head of the orthopaedics department at Civil Hospital, said that all three patients posed specific challenges for surgeons.

“They were suffering from a condition that does not allow them to stand upright and they have extreme discomfort while performing routine tasks,” he said, adding that a team was formed consisting of orthopaedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, and anaesthetists including a foreign teacher. “The patients had more than one corrective surgery,” Modi said.

The first case was of Patan resident Abhi who had a history of corrective surgeries. His spine was already bending and the surgeons had to ensure that they don’t undo the previous corrections.

In the second case, Rinku, 15, from Surendranagar, had developed an S-shaped spine, affecting her posture.

Harshida, 12, was the third case; she has a brain cyst and a history of four surgeries for spinal and brain abnormalities.

“In such surgeries, the primary risk is of developing intravascular coagulation of blood and damage to the nerves,” said Modi.

“In one of the cases, the spine was stuck to the skin and was also protruding a bit. We had to ensure that the surgeries don’t add to the complications.”

Modi went on to say: “All three patients are recovering well and have started moving with the help of a physiotherapy team.”

The doctors said that children with spine abnormalities develop C- or S-shaped spine and have difficulty in moving about. Surgical intervention at an early age can help prevent further deterioration, they said.

108,['10/03/2020'],Civic body collects cess from citizens but fails to deposit it with govt,"Nagpur: Money that was collected under property tax and was to be transferred to the state government was utilized by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation for its own purposes. The amount — Rs158.33 crore — was collected over the last six years.

This violation of norms related to statutory funds came to fore in the recent Comptroller and Auditor General of India’s (CAG) report that was tabled in the ongoing budget session of the state legislature.

According to the CAG report, under the provisions of Sections 4 and 6 (b) of the Maharashtra Education and Employment Guarantee (Cess) Act, 1962, read with Rule 4 of Education (Cess) Tax on Lands and Buildings (Collection and Refund) Rules, 1962, amounts of education cess, employment guarantee cess and penalty collected by any municipal corporation during any calendar week are required to be credited into the government account before the expiry of the following week.

“During scrutiny of the tax collection registers of two Nagpur and Pune Municipal Corporations during July 2017 and December 2017, audit noticed that the corporations had not credited education cess and employment guarantee cess amounting to Rs88.24 crore collected during 2015-16 and 2016-17 into the government account.

“It was brought to notice of concerned corporations in August 2017 and January 2018 and their reply has not been received. The matter was brought to the notice of the government in July 2018 and its reply has not been received till October 2019,” said the report.

A detailed inquiry with NMC revealed it had not deposited education, employment guarantee and also big building cess from 2014-15 to 2019-20. The education cess is Rs131 crore, employment guarantee cess Rs19 crore and big building cess Rs8.53 crore. All these are recovered from property tax.

This has affected works proposed by the state government in education and under employment guarantee scheme.

On March 6, TOI had reported how NMC deducted Rs150.82 crore from salaries of its employees for general provident fund (GPF) and defined contribution pension scheme (DCPS) but used the amount to clear bills of contractors. This amount falls under ‘legal’ funds.

This paper had also reported that the NMC used Rs5.19 crore of employees’ leave encashment and Rs3.5 crore deducted from salaries of employees for repayment of loans in NMC’s Employees Cooperative Bank.

Now, it has come to fore that the NMC has also not deposited Employees Provident Fund of Rs10.93 crore and Rs34.79 crore some dues of MPCB, water resources department and couple of more government agencies. Mismanagement of total funds comes to Rs362.07 crore.

NMC sources told TOI, “This is the result of inflated budgets. Revenue is estimated high in budgets and works are proposed accordingly. But works executed cost much more than the revenue earned in the last six years. The contractors staged agitations when they were not getting paid on time. The NMC then used all the funds for clearing the bills.”

Citing this, the pending bills of over Rs800 crore and future liabilities of over Rs2,000 crore, municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe had stopped execution of works and issuing of new work orders. It irked leaders of ruling party BJP who are up in arms against Mundhe.

BJP corporator Dayashankar Tiwari said, “Office bearers can’t be blamed for this as standing committee chairpersons keep sufficient funds for all statutory, legal and other heads. It is administration’s duty — especially civic chief and chief accounts and finance officer — to ensure due money in all heads. There are no audit objections saying standing committee chairpersons had inflated the budgets,” he said.

109,['10/03/2020'],WHEN MEN DRESS AS WOMEN,"Ahmedabad: In Nikol, the festival holds special significance for local residents. A feature of the Holi period is a 10-day fair in which people of all castes and communities participate. The highlight of the celebration is men dressing up as women. Anilji Thakor, one of the organizers of the event this year, said that it’s not the only ‘vesh’ (attire/role) assumed by men.

“Our ancestors have told us that the tradition is as old as Nikol village itself,” said Thakor. “Legend has it that a shepherd called Neka frequented this place long ago, drawn by the pastoral land and a small pond. As the place fell on a trading route, vanzaras (nomads) had a lake constructed here.” Thakor said the event was celebrated with fanfare and later became an annual programme coinciding with Holi.

The fair starts from the fifth day of the Gujarati month of Phalgun and concludes on the 15th or the full-moon day. The festivities start with drums at the gates of the old Nikol village. The congregation then travels to the temple near the centre of the village. Daily, plays and parades are organized in which the residents take on diverse identities including that of women.

“Our elders had instructed us not to change the ethos of the festival and thus it has remained the same over the decades. We hope to continue the tradition,” said Thakor.

111,['10/03/2020'],Vadodara: Deepak Nitrite Ltd seeks Rs 370 crore in damages from ex-staffer,"Picture used for representational purpose only

VADODARA: Chemical major Deepak Nitrite Ltd has dragged its former manager to court and sought Rs 370 crore damages from her, alleging that she had stolen all confidential data of the company before joining its rival firm in Gurugram .

The Vadodara-based firm has filed a civil suit against the executive, who had resigned on January 10 as the assistant manager of the fine and specialty chemicals business.

The company alleged that she had transferred all confidential data including sales price, reports, products , product recipes, customer database among others from her official email address to her personal email on her last working day. The company learnt about it only after she had left. Her laptop which she used during her tenure and logs of her email address revealed that she had transferred large-sized data running into several giga bytes (GB).

The civil suit states that she was supposed to submit all documents, material and data in any form to the company before leaving. But as she did not follow the procedure, it became evident that she has violated terms and conditions of her appointment letter. The woman was hired as management trainee in May 2016 and later promoted as assistant manager (marketing).

“She and her team was working on two products which would have opened up new line of fine chemicals. Any company which would have entered the market with these products would have made good profit,” said Deepak Nitrite’s advocate Jaideep Verma.

The civil suit mentions that the company is expecting a turnover of Rs 600 crore at the end of financial year 2020-21 from its fine and speciality segment. But due to her act, the company will not be able to achieve the target and incur a loss of Rs 350 crore. “The transmission of data has resulted in financial loss of Rs 10 crore and another Rs 10 crore which were invested for development of the product, the data of which has been stolen,” the suit mentions.

The company has also additional Rs 50 lakh as punitive damages from her.

On Monday, the suit was listed for hearing, but neither the woman nor her lawyer appeared for hearing. The court of additional senior civil judge V R Chaudhary has listed the case for hearing again on March 30.

Verma said that the company has also filed a criminal complaint against the executive at Cyber Crime police station. However, the investigation is underway and the FIR is yet to be lodged.

112,['10/03/2020'],NMC’s Rs97.66Cr stuck in Yes Bank,"Nagpur: Already facing severe cash crunch, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has suffered another blow as its Rs97.66 crore are reportedly stuck in the troubled Yes Bank.

The civic body clears majority of bills of contractors in March-end. However, as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has imposed moratorium on Yes Bank till April 3, the move has aggravated the NMC’s problems.

Sources in the civic body told TOI, “NMC is having a savings account in the Civil Lines branch of Yes Bank, with over Rs95 crore balance as on date. This amount was meant for various works sanctioned by Devendra Fadnavis for South-West constituency during his tenure as chief minister in 2016-17.”

The NMC’s accounts and finance department, however, remained tight-lipped on the issue. It could be not be known whether these funds were parked in the account since 2016-17 or being used for clearing bills of works sanctioned by Fadnavis. Fadnavis had sanctioned over Rs350 crore works for his constituency during his tenure as CM.

An NMC official said, “Fadnavis had sanctioned works and released funds with a condition that the money should be utilized for the respective works only. Therefore, the NMC may have opened the savings account. Also, the civic body will not get interest if it had opened a current account. Otherwise, NMC keeps majority of its funds, which go over Rs2,000 crore per annum, in nationalized banks like Bank of Maharashtra (BoM),” he said.

Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe told TOI, “I have directed officials to verify how many accounts of the civic body are with Yes Bank and how much money is in them. As several accounts of the NMC have been opened in various banks over a period, I will have to review all and plan how to go forward in easing the fund crunch.”

Sources added that NMC’s property tax recovery of Rs2.66 crore has also been stuck in Yes Bank. “The civic body has tied up with Yes Bank and Axis Bank for collection of tax amount from 10 zones everyday. Yes Bank looks after zones 1-5 and Axis Banks zones 6-10. Bank representatives collect money from the zones and deposit it with the respective banks for three days. The amount is deposited in NMC’s main account in BoM on fourth day.

“Yes Bank had collected Rs2.66 crore on March 3, 4 and 5. RBI had imposed moratorium at 6pm on March 5. Therefore, the tax collection of Rs2.66 crore is stuck. No tax collection was done by Yes Bank on March 6. NMC got help from BoM and started tax collection from March 7 on temporary basis,” sources said.

The official added that a plan to hand over the tax collection work to BoM permanently is being considered. “NMC had requested BoM time and again in the past but the bank declined the responsibility citing insufficient staff,” he said.

NMC standing committee chairman Vijay Zalke said the situation is grave for the NMC and will affect its works. “Administration is saying that NMC’s financial condition is serious. Rs97.66 crore is a big amount, especially in March-end. I have sought details about who opened the account in Yes Bank and when. I have also directed the officials to furnish rules for opening of bank accounts,” he said.

Meanwhile, with moratorium in place, NMC can withdraw only Rs50,000 from Yes Bank till April 3. Online remittances including RTGS/NEFT, cheque withdrawal or transfer etc have also been suspended.

In her written complaint filed at Pilibhit Kotwali police station, the woman claimed that she was subjected to domestic violence for failing to meet the dowry demands of her husband and in-laws for Rs 4 lakh cash and gold ornaments.

The victim, Meenakshi Singh, who is now at her parental house in Shivnagar locality in Pilibhit city, said she had been married to one Kishan Singh of Puraniya village under Baheri police station in Bareilly district on November 17, 2011.

From the very first day of her marriage, her husband and in-laws started to torture her for additional dowry and made her life hell. She informed her parents about their demands and her condition. Her parents tried their best to come to an agreement through mediation by relatives but to not avail.

Finally, Meenakshi was thrown out of her house by her husband, who allegedly threatened to kill her if she tried to return.

Shrikant Dwivedi, SHO of Kotwali station, said an FIR was lodged against seven people including the victim’s husband, his parents, elder brother and his wife and one other female relative under IPC section 498 A (subjecting a woman to torture by husband or his relatives), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt, 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC and provisions of the Dowry Act.

114,['10/03/2020'],BJP looks to Ranjit for base in Devi Lal clan’s stronghold,"BJP president J P Nadda with chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Haryana jails minister Ranjit Chautala at ... Read More

CHANDIGARH: Ruling BJP, which has been struggling for a strong base in Sirsa and Fatehabad belt, is seeing a hope in Haryana cabinet minister Ranjit Singh Chautala . It organised a rally at Kharian village of Rania assembly constituency, which is represented by Ranjit, on Sunday to honour BJP president J P Nadda for taking over the party reins. While Nadda was the chief guest, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar presided over the rally and, upbeat over the turnout of locals, announced development works of over Rs 215 crore in the area.

Sirsa and Fatehabad districts are considered to be the stronghold of former deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal’s family. A former Congress leader, Ranjit is the son of Devi Lal, whose another son Om Prakash Chautala, the chief of INLD, has been four-time chief minister of Haryana. With INLD struggling for revival and Ranjit’s grand nephew Dushyant Chautala leading Jannayak Janata Party (JJP), BJP is looking forward to an alternative that it can rely upon for its growth and stability in the area.

Khattar and Nadda joined Ranjit’s programme to build base for the party in the area as, except for Haryana BJP chief Subhash Barala and Ganeshi Lal, the party did not have any a prominent face in Sirsa and Fatehabad.

Ranjit was elected to Haryana assembly in October 2019 as an independent candidate and had announced unconditional support to BJP soon after. Khattar reciprocated by giving him the ministerial berth with two key departments of power and jails.

These days Ranjit has been saying that if BJP wishes, he could contest the next election as party candidate. “The kind of respect I have got in three months of the BJP-JJP coalition government is more than what Congress gave me in 45 years. I am CM’s cabinet colleague and had planned the rally on behalf of the constituency and area residents. So far as Nadda is concerned, I met him during his son’s marriage. The CM and I had requested him to join the rally. We are really obliged and owe it to them. I have already said that if BJP wishes, we are there for them.”

With anti-defection in mind, Ranjit said, “As of now there are no elections for the next five years. One thing is for sure, the future belongs to national parties and that, too, BJP only.”

He recommended that services of two of them be terminated and the third suspended, officials said.

The minister found Surender Singh, a teacher, Shiv Kumar and Ramphal, who was re-employed, absent without having submitted a leave application. He called Chhachhrauli block education officer, who said he did not have any information about the leave applications of the three employees.

Kanwar Pal ordered suspension of Surender and termination of the services of Shiv and Ramphal with immediate effect. “Now that examinations are drawing close, absence of teachers without intimation is gross negligence. It will not be tolerated. I will continue to conduct such surprise inspections in other parts of the state as well,” he said.

When asked when sacked or suspended teachers would be replaced, his private secretary Sukhbir Kaushik said, “As per government policy, there are many professional teachers who remain in the pipeline to provide their services when needed.”

118,['10/03/2020'],Coronavirus has summer camps feeling the heat,"Nagpur: Those in the summer camp and trek businesses are sweating because of the Coronavirus fear. The threat is hurting Nagpur-based operators, who are reporting a sharp fall in bookings as compared to last year.

This business relies mostly on school and college students who are looking for a break not only from a long academic season but also from the blistering Nagpur heat. But coronavirus anxiety is holding back parents from confirming their bookings for these camps, which are based mostly in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

Amol Khante, founder of CAC All Rounder, said, “There’s an almost 70% decline in bookings on a year-to-year basis. Enquires are coming but parents are not willing to book it if the travel itinerary includes New Delhi, which is where coronavirus cases have been detected.”

He added that the fear level is such that even though the touring party is not halting at the capital, parents don’t want to go ahead. “We go directly to Ambala by train but since it passes through New Delhi, parents want to stay out,” said Khante

Avinash Deoskar, director of Adventure Academy, says there is a slowdown but is hopeful of things picking up later. “There is no doubt that bookings have slowed down. And it’s obviously due to coronavirus anxiety in people. I feel that in April things will pick up as board exams get over and there will be more clarity about the virus from the government,” said Deoskar.

Pankhuri Bandelwar, trek leader at Alpha Adventures, said, “Parents are enquiring about this and we explain to them carefully about the situation so that they can make an informed decision.”

Many people are backing out because of the perception that the virus thrives in cooler places. Senior medical practitioner and ENT surgeon Dr Madan Kapre said such fears are not completely unfounded. “In hill stations and other tourist places, it is natural for more people to congregate in small areas which makes it easy for the infection to spread. And of course, the virus can survive longer in cooler temperature,” said Dr Kapre.

The panel added that at their meeting, “representatives from Delhi Development Authority failed to provide proper replies to the queries raised by the committee about the policy being followed in this regard.” It stated that there was some confusion regarding the implications of the regulations with respect to the urban villages.

The committee has directed the vice-chairman of DDA to submit a copy of the policy followed by DDA and types of activities being permitted at urban villages. “An action plan for demolition of unauthorised constructions and retrieval of government land from encroachers in a time-bound manner may also be submitted,” it noted.

Over the last several decades, urban villages have turned into a “no-planning zones” with 6-7-storey buildings cropping up everywhere.

121,['10/03/2020'],Uttar Pradesh: 21 injured in suspected wolf attack in Lakhimpur Kheri,"BAREILLY: As many as 21 villagers were injured in a possible wolf attack in Dhaurahra area of Lakhimpur Kheri district on Sunday night. The attacks took place in a span of a couple of hours after sunset. All the victims belonged to eight villages adjacent to the buffer zone of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve. All are located within a 16-km radius comprising some 20 villages.

Some of the victims claimed that a lone wolf had attacked them. However, forest department officials are yet to ascertain if it was a wolf or a jackal. However, they are certain that the same carnivore attacked all the victims. They are trying to locate the animal that has created panic among the residents of nearly 20 villages in Dhaurahra. They suspect that the animal may have lost its senses after failing to get a mate and is attacking everyone or it may have become rabid.

A recent census by WWF-India had confirmed the presence of 100 Indian wolves in the Dhaurahra forests. The Indian wolf is protected under schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

The attacks have dampened Holi celebrations in some 20 villages in Dhaurahra, including Pareli, Mudiya, Gaudi, Tamolipur, Manjha and Shumali, with terrified residents not knowing when the next attack will take place.

The first attack was reported from Pareva village on Sunday evening when Sree Krishan was attacked in his sugarcane field. The next attack took place at Maharajnagar, where Sulema Bi, 40, was grievously injured by the same animal. The attacks continued for the next couple of hours in the area.

Divisional forest officer Anil Patel told TOI, “The carnivore was continuously on the move, We kept getting reports of attacks from different villages. All the victims were shifted to Khamariya community health centre and administered anti-rabies injections. Later, two of the injured were shifted to the district hospital as their injuries were grave.”

The foresters have been trying to capture the animal by tracking its pugmarks but are yet to spot it. “We have advised all villagers to stay alert and refrain from going to their fields alone. If this carnivore is a wolf, then we will seek permission of the principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) for tranquilizing or killing it,” Patel added.

A local warned, “If the animal attacks again, we will be forced to kill it as a mad wolf cannot be controlled.”

The protesters were demanding immediate action against four cops who allegedly thrashed the counsellor on Sunday night when he had gone to the police station to file an FIR.

Vinod Kumar, nominated by district police administration as a counsellor to settle family issues at the Bisalpur-based family counselling centre, had hone to the police station on Sunday night to file an FIR against some people who had, in an inebriated state, beaten up some of his relatives following an argument over lighting of Holi bonfire.

According to Kumar, a group of drunk villagers in Gopipura had asked his relative, Ramautar, to demolish a portion of the wall of his house so that more people could assemble when the Holi bonfire was lit on the vacant plot adjacent to his house. Kumar said some villagers started abusing and beating when Ramautar refused to heed to their illogical demand.

Ramautar then called his relatives who rushed to his house but they too were assaulted and attacked with sharp-edged weapons, Kumar said.

“I, along with my brother Pramod Kumar and uncle Rameshwar Dayal, then rushed to the Bilsanda police station around 9 pm on Sunday to lodge an FIR against the attackers. When I introduced myself and narrated the reason for my visit to constables Dinesh, Umang Kumar and two of their colleagues, they held us by our collar and dragged us to a room and brutally thrashed us with belts, kicked us and rained punches on us,” Kumar alleged.

Kumar said he later filed a complaint against the erring police personnel before SHO Hari Shankar Verma, and then posted a complaint letter to the superintendent of police, Abhishek Dixit, on Monday morning demanding stern action against the four constables.

Kumar claimed that if the footage of the CCTV camera installed inside the police station was examined, the atrocious acts of the four constables would come to the fore.

Kumar also alleged that three of villagers who were on his side -- Shiv Kumar, Nirankar and Sumiran Lal -- suffered head injuries in the assault on them at the village and were later referred from the Bilsanda community health centre to Pilibhit district government hospital. The Bilsanda police on Monday lodged a non-cognizable report (NCR) in the matter instead of registering an FIR against the attackers, Kumar alleged.

""Police also booked the victim's side in another NCR lodged on a complaint by the assailants,"" Kumar said while raising doubts about the intentions of the police.

Among the protesters on Monday were district president of Lodhi Mahasabha, Haripal Singh, who said their protest was peaceful and urged the SHO with folded hands to take action in the matter within three days after Holi. The protesters, however, warned that they would be forced to launch an agitation against the police if no action was taken against the ""guilty"" policemen.

SHO Hari Shankar Verma said he would examine the CCTV footage of the police station. “I will take necessary action against the accused constables if the allegations against them were found true,” Verma told TOI.

123,['10/03/2020'],YSRC keen to sweep elections in Guntur city,"Many Mayoral Aspirants Are In Fray

Samdani.MN@timesgroup.com

Guntur: With the mayoral race hotting up, YSRC has decided not to announce the candidate before the elections. Rather, the party heads have directed legislators to focus on ensuring victory of all candidates in Guntur city without promising anyone the top post. With the mayor ’s post reserved for general quota, leaders from Vysya, Kapu and Reddy communities are vying with one another for the post.

In relation with the local body elections, the district in-charge minister Ch Sriranganatha Raju and district party affairs in-charge Alla Ayodhyarami Reddy held a series of meetings with legislators and senior leaders in the last two days and decided not to name anyone as mayoral candidate. In fact, the chief minister and party president YS Jaganmohan Reddy has directed the party affairs in-charges and in-charge ministers to ensure that selection of candidates does not result in infightings.

Sources said YSRC city-wing president Padarthi Ramesh Gandhi is front runner for the mayoral post as Guntur East MLA Mohammed Mustafa and West constituency in-charge Ch Yesurathnam are backing his candidature. Mustafa is reportedly lobbying for Gandhi in return of the Vysya community’s support to the party in the city.

Ramesh Gandhi has been in politics for over 30 years but has not had much success as he missed many opportunities to contest assembly elections in the eleventh-hour. He is gearing up to contest as corporator from Kothapet where he has good network and following among party workers.

Meanwhile, Kapu leader Kavati Manohar Naidu, sources said, is also testing his luck. He is reportedly lobbying through municipal administration minister Botcha Satyanarayana.

However, many leaders in the city are not in favour of Manohar as the mayoral candidate. Moreover, Kapus are likely to get the chance to head civic bodies in East and West Godavari districts prompting the party to look for alternative candidates.

Sources in the party said a few senior leaders have suggested Guntur Lok Sabha constituency party affairs in-charge Lella Appireddy to contest the municipal elections. Appireddy, who lost in the assembly elections in 2014, was denied a ticket in 2019 elections in return of a better position. Although he wanted to enter the legislature through the council, the decision to abolish the Upper House has dashed his hopes. Sources said Appireddy has not taken a call on the issue yet. “There is no surprise if the chief minister picks a dark horse for the top post after the elections,” said a senior leader.

Meanwhile, sources said among other candidates, an owner of a private educational institutions, Bharath Reddy is, in the mayoral race.

DIFFERENT FACTORS AT PLAY

YSRC leadership has decided not to announce mayor candidate in advance

*The selection of mayor would be done only after the elections

*The decision was taken to avoid infighting

*Many leaders from dominant Vysya, Kapu and Reddy communities are vying with one another for the post

*Kapu and Vysya communities have considerable population after Muslim minorities in the city

*Since the city has an MLA from the Muslim community, the party might go for other upper-caste groups to consolidate its footprint

124,['10/03/2020'],"US deports man, agents booked for Rs 24L fraud","Kurukshetra: Kurukshetra police on Sunday registered a case of fraud against two Yamunanagar-based travel agents who allegedly duped a retired soldier from Ladwa of Rs 24 lakh by promising to help settle his son in the US through legal means. Bhupinderjit Singh of Niwarsi village in Kurukshetra district lodged a complaint against Gaurav and Pratap alias Bhanu, alleging that they promised to settle his son, Ramandeep Singh (25), in the US, but did not.

Bhupinderjit lodged a complaint wih Kurukshetra SP on November 20, 2019. After an inquiry by the economic offences wing (EOW), the case was registered against the duo under Section 24 of the Immigration Act and for criminal breach of trust, cheating and criminal intimidation at Ladwa police station. “Gaurav came in contact with my son and lured him with a promise of sending him to America. Gaurav and Pratap demanded Rs 24 lakh. They said we would have to pay Rs 3 lakh in advance and also give Ramandeep’s passport for documentation, which we did on September 13, 2019...,” he alleged in the complaint.

On September 14, 2019, the duo called his son to Delhi and kept him at a hotel in Paharganj. “On September 21, 2019, he was given a ticket for a flight to Quito in Ecuador. On his way, Ramandeep received a call from an agent named Sandhu, who asked him to take a flight to Bogota in Colombia. On reaching there, Ramandeep was taken to Cancun, Mexico, where he stayed for seven days at the place of a ‘donker’. “Then the donker started forcing him for giving the pending money and the agent then contacted Gaurav and Pratap in India and asked them for it. On September 24, 2019, I gave Rs 19.5 lakh to Gaurav and Pratap in front of Ashok Kumar at our residence,” he said.

Ramandeep told TOI that after staying in Cancun for seven days, they took away his passport and all the cash he had. “Then, I was asked to stay at a camp for nine days in Tapachula in Mexico. Here I got a country out pass and they then made me cross the US border after climbing a border wall illegally. On the other side, I was caught by US border patrol forces, who kept me in different jails for nearly a year. I last stayed at the ICE processing center in Adelanto, California. On October 23, 2019, I was deported to India.”

Exactly a week after a garment factory located in Meharban area was gutted in fire, yet another fire incident occurred in another factory located in Beantpura near Chandigarh Road on Monday. Though no loss of life has been reported in this fire incident but stock worth lakhs was gutted in this fire, which started in the morning when the factory was operational.

Due to the factory being located in a congested area, the fire department faced huge difficulties in reaching the factory. But eventually the firemen were successful in controlling the fire.

Giving more information about the incident, Rajinder Pal, owner of Ajay Textiles, where the fire incident took place said, “Our factory is located in Beantpura area and we are into manufacturing of shawls and clothes. Around 8.45 am the fire broke out in my factory due to a short circuit. The intensity of the fire was such that even we were not able to control it with fire extinguishers and as it kept spreading, we had to call the fire brigade for help. The factory was running at full capacity and workers were also present and working on machines when the fire broke out, but all were lucky to escape unhurt.”

According to leading fireman Harish Rawat, who was on the spot and oversaw the operation, “This is a two-storey building garment factory in which the fire incident took place. On Monday morning, we got a call from the owner, who reported about the fire in his factory. Within no time our team reached near the factory but due to narrow lanes the fire tenders were unable to reach the gates of the factory. But somehow, our team with the help of extra equipment and manpower were able to get on to the task of dousing fire and it was finally controlled by us. In total four fire tenders were used to control this fire.”

126,['10/03/2020'],Mathura jail inmates prepare herbal edible gulal for Holi,"Over 1,000 packets of edible herbal gulal have been prepared for the first time by 12 inmates.

AGRA: With consumers across the country observing a ban on Chinese products due to the threat of Covid-19, jail authorities in Mathura have decided to make a killing this Holi. The jail authorities will be launching herbal edible gulal made by jail inmates using vegetables, including spinach, carrot and turmeric, grown inside the jail.

Over 1,000 packets of edible herbal gulal have been prepared for the first time by 12 inmates. The medical officer of the jail has approved it and marked it ‘safe’ for use. The gulal, which comes in deep pink, orangish pink, leafy green, light green and yellow colour, is prepared by extracting the juices of beetroot, carrot, spinach, fenugreek and turmeric respectively. These colours are, therefore, skin-friendly and not harmful if consumed.

Talking to TOI, senior superintendent of Mathura prison Shailendra Maitrey said, “Gulal prepared by the inmates is skin-friendly, chemical-free made from vegetable extracts. The vegetables used are organic and grown inside the jail premises.”

“Instead of playing holi without colours due to ban on Chinese colours, herbal gulal can be used this time,” said Shipra Rathi of the Khajani Welfare Society , the NGO engaged in rehabilitation and reforms programme in the jail complex.

Rathi said that a 100 gram packet would cost Rs 20 and the sale proceeds will be directly given to the makers. She said, “We have contacted local shops and some dealers for the sale.”

“Vegetable extract combined with arrowroot powder is mixed with essential oil of lemon or sandalwood for fragrance. After mixing all ingredients with hands, they are passed through a soft cloth before being packed.

Except the north Andhra districts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and East Godavari, all other nine districts in the state will have one night bus service to Visakhapatnam, said Ravi Kumar, executive director of the public transport department for Vizianagaram zone.

Officials are in the process of laying out timings, route map and other facilities for the services.

The department has procured 18 AC Volvo buses for the service and named the fleet ‘Dolphin Cruise’.

Buses from all districts except Kadapa, Kurnool and Anantapur district headquarters will reach Visakhapatnam city before 7.30 am, Ravi Kumar added.

Two buses have been allocated for Krishna district, from Vijayawada to Visakhapatnam, while other districts have been allocated one bus each.

“The buses will reach Visakhapatnam every morning, will be sent to the shed for the day and again be ready for the service from Visakhapatnam to other districts,” Ravi Kumar told TOI.

Buses from Kurnool, Anantapur and Kadapa will start from district headquarters in the afternoon at around 2 pm or 3 pm, while the departure timings for other routes will be after sunset.

A senior RTC official at Dwaraka bus station in the city said that till date, the department plied super-luxury non-AC buses along limited routes from Visakhapatnam. The existing fleet took more hours to reach their destination and passengers did not prefer RTC buses for longer routes, especially towards Kadapa and Anantapur, due to non-AC services.

With the launch of the new fleet, the department hopes to have more patrons in view of the improved buses and reduced travel time, the RTC official said.

“The department is planning to launch the buses from Ugadi if everything is ready by the time. We are yet to take final decision on the launching date as the model code of conduct in force,” said an RTC official.

Besides, the usual morning and evening supply, water will also be supplied for two hours in the afternoon from Sikandra and Jeevani Mandi waterworks stations.

Last year, the Jal Sansthan had not been able to ensure adequate water supply during Holi. The situation is better this year, thanks to a supply of 350 million litres per day (MLD) of Ganga water from Palra head works in Bulandshahr.

Talking with TOI, general manager of Agra Jal Sansthan RS Yadav said, “We have planned to provide extra water supply on Holi. In the afternoon, water will be supplied for two hours from 12 noon. Responsibilities have been assigned in this regard. We have sufficient amount of raw water stored in tanks at the waterworks stations.”

Yadav said in case of disruption of supply in any area due to leakage or some other reason, water tankers will be sent. Directions to the effect have been issued to zonal officers, he added.

At the same time, senior engineer of Jal Sansthan advised people to store some water just in case supply was disrupted due to a power cut, especially in the afternoon.

Welcoming the decision, Madan Agarwal, a resident of Shahganj, said, “Last year, we had to put up with acute water crisis during Holi. It is good that the Jal Sansthan has planned to supply water in the afternoon. However, the authorities must ensure the water is not contaminated or stinks.”

But as she had travelled abroad in the recent past, local health team kept has her in isolation ward of the civil hospital for the time being.”According to the doctor, the woman’s sample has been sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune and the reports are awaited.“But so far, we have no confirmed case in Ludhiana district,” said Dr Bagga, adding that the staff are fully prepared to handle any contingency. “We have have been carrying out mock drills to prepare them to deal with coronavirus patients,” Dr Bagga said.The civil surgeon also said 43 response teams have been set up in Ludhiana district. “They have already visited government and private primary and secondary schools, colleges, government offices, shopping malls, multiplexes, railway station, bus stands and other public places in the district and briefed the public about symptoms, precautionary measures as well as hospitals that they should approach in case they fear they have coronavirus. The symptoms are similar to that of pneumonia and people should report immediately,” added Dr Bagga.According to Dr Bagga, this is doubly crucial if the person has visited China in the last 30 days. “If he or she even has common cold like symptoms, it is best that he or she immediately contact the nearest government hospital for treatment,” he advised.Stating that prevention is better than cure, Dr Bagga listed out things that people can do diligently to stay ahead of the game. “Medical staff is suggesting that while washing hands, one should use an alcohol-based rub or soap and water to kill the pathogen. Also, one should stay at least two metres away from people who are coughing or sneezing. It is best if one avoids visiting public places, and if they have to avoid touching things, one can use a tissue, or bent elbow to open doors, for instance. Make sure to cover while coughing. These should keep one in good stead, said Dr Bagga, adding that at no cost people should indulge in home remedies, no matter what they read or believe.Civil surgeon Dr Bagga said even private hospitals have made arrangements to fight coronavirus, wherein 55 beds and 38 ventilator isolation wards have been set up.

130,['10/03/2020'],2 open fire on Hindu outfit office-bearer,"TNN

Ludhiana: Two men on a motorcycle opened fire on the Punjab Shiv Sena national spokesperson while he was walking back home from a nearby temple in Khanna on Monday morning.

The incident comes three days after Shiv Sena (Hindustan) labour wing head had claimed attack on him in Focal Point.

Mahant Kashmir Giri, 47, a resident of Khatikan Chowk, said in his police complaint, “Like any other day, I went to Pracheen Shiv Diwala Mandir around 5.15am. On reaching there, I realised I had forgotten something home. I soon left and while walking back home, I saw two men on a Pulsar motorcycle making rounds of the area. I was leaving home for the temple when I saw those two bikers driving towards my house between 5.20am and 5.25am.”

Smelling a rat, Giri closed the gate and rushed inside his house. “The two men then opened fire. The first bullet hit the gate and the second was fired in air,” he added.

Though the government has deployed a gunman with him, he was near the temple at the time. “I suspect the two had fired at me when I was at the temple, too. But they missed their mark and temple hymns drowned the gunshot sound,” Giri said.

While the bike driver was wearing a helmet, the pillion rider’s face was masked.

“There have been many attempts on my life before as well. The miscreants should be arrested immediately as they are trying to vitiate the atmosphere of the state by attacking Hindu outfit leaders,” Giri, who is also the head of Pracheen Shiv Diwala Mandir, added.

CCTV cameras installed at his house gate have captured the accused. “The CCTV footage corroborate Giri’s claims. They two had made several rounds of the area before striking. They, it seems, had been keeping an eye on Giri for days,” said a cop.

Inspector general of police (IGP), Ludhiana Range, Jaskaran Singh said, “Giri showed alertness and quickly went inside his house on spotting them. We have increased his security.”

Khanna SSP Harpreet Singh said a case has been registered under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (act done by several persons with common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and under the Arms Act.

“As it was dark at the time, the CCTVs have not captured the bike’s registration number. It is possible that the bike had no numberplate,” a cop said.

The CCTV footage showed the two had made a round of Giri’s house around 5.23am. On seeing him stepping out, they drove towards him. At 5.24am, the pillion rider fired two gunshots, one of which hit the gate.

Police said after miscreants shot Shiv Sena leader Durga Gupta in Khanna in 2016, Giri was provided a security cover for about two years. The gunmen were later withdrawn as there was no threat perception. Giri is the national preacher (pracharak) of Goswami Samaj. He also runs Ajoona Akhara, besides being Rashtriya Pracharak of Shiv Sena, Punjab.

Khanna DSP Tarlochan Singh said they were probing the case from various angles.

Police said personal enmity angle could not be ruled out.

Threat calls

Giri said, “After I received a threat call from a man, who introduced himself as Imran Khan of J&K, my security review report was sent to the DGP. On January 23, a gunman was deployed with me. On June 6, 2019, too, I had received threat calls.”

Pulsar bike, the common thread

In most of the cases of attack on Hindu outfit office-bearers, the miscreants came on a Pulsar motorcycle. In every attack, the bike either had no numberplate or it was not captured on CCTVs.

Recent ‘attacks’ on Hindu outfit leaders

March 7: Jamalpur police booked unidentified accused for attempt to murder Shiv Sena (Hindustan) labour wing head Narinder Bhardwaj, 45, of Dhandari Khurd. He had told police that two men on a bike tried to kill him while he was on way home from his workplace in Focal Point, near Kohara, on March 6

February 22: A bullet hit the car of Shiv Sena (Hindustan) president Amit Arora parked outside his office in Sector 39 on Chandigarh Road. He and Shiv Sena (Punjab) state youth president Mani Sheera were at the office at the time

131,['10/03/2020'],DIMTS to help design vehicles for Delhi's Walled City,"DIMTS will provide consultancy to SRDC under the corporate social responsibility.

NEW DELHI: The Walled City in the capital, currently being remodelled by the Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), may have its own transport system to discourage private vehicles and restrict para-transit modes in the area. SRDC has decided to rope in Delhi Integrated Multimodal Transit System (DIMTS) to help it provide viable and sustainable transport.

DIMTS will provide consultancy to SRDC under the corporate social responsibility. SRDC is the nodal agency executing the Chandni Chowk beautification and pedestrianisation project.

The corporation had earlier formed a six-member sub-committee under joint commissioner of police (traffic) to explore the idea of Walled City’s own public transportation.

The sub-committee felt that the transport system for Shahjahanabad cannot be dealt with in piecemeal manner and advised that DIMTS give suggestions in consonance with zonal development plan of Master Plan of Delhi-2021.

The special commissioner (transport), who is a member of the sub-committee, has been tasked with preparing terms of reference for DIMTS, which will be discussed in a meeting on March 16.

Last December, Delhi government had rejected SRDC’s proposal to run ‘trackless tram’ in the area and asked it to “look for” an affordable mode of transport to provide comfortable commuting options. “It is necessary to provide a transit system that will have connectivity with parking lots, markets, tourist places and Metro stations among others,” said an official. “Until we provide better public transport, we can’t dissuade private vehicles,” he added.

132,['10/03/2020'],"Son in isolation, man spreads awareness on bone marrow transplant","Vijay Patel and his son Bhavy

Vadodara: Even as his son is awaiting bone marrow transplantation, this Barodian is extending a helping hand to all those who are suffering from aplastic anaemia, an autoimmune disease in which the body fails to produce blood cells in sufficient numbers.

Before two years, Vijay Patel’s son Bhavy, now 18, was diagnosed with severe aplastic anaemia, a condition in which bone marrow fails to produce enough blood cells.

But Vijay, an event manager by profession, has started raising funds not just for his own son, but also for other such patients who are suffering from this disease that requires expensive treatment.

“It was in April 2018 that my son was diagnosed with aplastic anaemia. Doctor had advised that Bhavy either needs to undergo bone marrow transplantation or ATG treatment. We got the ATG treatment in January 2019 after which he is stable but every week, he has to undergo six platelets and one PCV transfusion,” said Vijay, 49.

Because of high risk of infection at public places, Bhavy, who had just cleared his Class XII when he was diagnosed with severe aplastic anaemia, is under isolation at his home since last two years. But his father took it as a challenge.

“I had introduced Sayaji Glory Award in Vadodara in 2017 to felicitate those Barodians who really contribute for the welfare of the city. When my son got diagnosed with this disease, the second edition of the award in 2018 was organized to raise funds and awareness for bone marrow donation,” he said.

The third edition of the award will be held on March 24, the profits of which will be used to fund treatment of such patients.

“Thanks to support of all voluntary organizations, NGOs, charitable trusts and individuals, I could raise Rs23 lakh in 2018 for my son’s treatment,” said Patel, who has so far incurred Rs70 lakh just on treatment of his son.

“In developed countries like the United States, there are millions who are registered as bone marrow donors. Unfortunately, despite being a country with such a huge population, we have less than five lakh registered donors,” he said, adding that there is only one match in 10 lakh such patients.

To support this father’s efforts, Bollywood’s playback singer Anita Bhatt has decided to be a part of the forthcoming award function without charging a single penny.

What is aplastic anaemia?

Aplastic anaemia is a rare, serious blood disorder and an autoimmune disease in which the body fails to produce blood cells in sufficient numbers. Blood cells are produced in bone marrow by stem cells that reside there. Aplastic anaemia causes a deficiency of all blood cell types - red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

134,['10/03/2020'],Ahmedabad: Retail vegetable prices soar,"Picture used for representational purpose only

AHMEDABAD: While meat prices have dropped amid dwindling demand, your seasonal greens, herbs and spices have become dearer. Even as the wholesale prices of vegetables have hit the rock-bottom, retail prices of vegetables continued to remain high.

Lemon, which costs Rs 12-25 in wholesale was priced as high as Rs 120 in the retail market. Similarly, cauliflower which usually cost Rs 2 per kg at this time of the year in the wholesale market was priced at Rs 35 a kg in the retail market. Tomato which was sold at Rs 5 a kg in the wholesale market cost Rs 25 per kg in retail.

“With less stock of vegetables offloaded at the APMC on Monday and the market likely to remain closed on account of Dhuleti on Tuesday, there is limited supply of vegetables against the consumption. Consequently, the prices have gone up by 20%,” said a source in APMC. Deepak Patel, secretary, APMC – Ahmedabad, said, “The state had an extended monsoon, and as a result there has been a bumper crop. However, the APMC does not have control on the retail market prices.”

Prices of the same vegetables differed widely across areas of the city. For instance, cauliflower which usually cost Rs 2 per kg in the wholesale market, was sold at Rs 10 right outside the APMC with vendors. In Satellite, the same cost Rs 30. Increased vegetable prices are affecting household budgets. Memnagar resident, Sudha Patel, said, “Onions and potatoes still cost more than Rs 30 per kg. With fresh crop the prices were expected to fall but there has not been much impact on the retail market.”

135,['10/03/2020'],"In first for UP, online database to checkcrime against people with special needs","Agra: With the UP police’s ‘Dial 112’ receiving more than 5,000 distress calls on harassment and crime against people with special needs in the past year, a team of UP cops decided to step up to the challenge. Now, ‘Dial 112’, on recommendations of the superintendent of police (crime) Etah, is planning to introduce an online registration of such cases. Lack of enough data has been a constant hindrance for cops to act on the cases.

The move, said to be a first for the state, comes after a team led by Etah SP Rahul Kumar identified several cases in four UP districts — Etah, Moradabad, Rampur and Varanasi. A majority of such cases involved teenage girls and women. They were raped and some of the survivors later gave birth, police said. In Etah district, two such cases were reported in Mirhachi and Malawan.

In a written reply to Etah SP, Asim Arun, additional director-general (ADG) of police and in-charge of UP 112, stated, “The move will help reduce harassment and crimes against people with special needs. A proper training programme is being inducted in ‘Dial 112’ to sanitise the cops at district level so that they can tackle cases related to such individuals.”

Speaking to TOI, Etah SP (crime) said, “Since 2013, I have been working with a small team of constables to identify the people with special needs. Initially, we were focused to help them get medical or psychological certificates with assistance of CMO and DMs, so that they could avail government-run benefits. However, seeing the large number of cases, we couldn’t get enough support from authorities. So, we shifted our attention only on providing security. This covers protection from sexual abuse, illegal organ harvesting and unlawful possession of ancestral property after the death of parents or guardian of people with special needs, among other crimes.”

The 44-year-old officer added, “A majority of distressed calls are made by third party. The real figure may be much higher. So, I wrote to ADG in-charge of UP ‘Dial 112’ requesting him to introduce online registration of parents or guardian of people with special needs, like the one for senior citizens.”

At present, the UP ‘Dial 112’ under a programme called ‘Savera’ has registered over eight lakh senior citizens of the state on the online platform at level of police stations. Three days ago, the police also launched a similar database for registration of cases of women affected by domestic violence.

Explaining how it may work, police said a tablet provided at every police station is usually connected with a server of UP 112. It is mandatory for cops to register details of senior citizens and women affected by domestic violence (along with their case history, if available) residing within their police limits. This would help the cops to instantly access the records of such people whenever the need arise.

Resident of Prayagraj, Kumar had initiated data collection when he was a CO of three police stations in Varanasi. Later, he continued the exercise wherever he was posted. His team managed to record names and details of 2,000 individuals in Moradabad district, and 1,000 in Rampur. In Etah, his team identified 1,983 such people within 18 police station limits.

“After approval from police headquarters, we have given ‘special police officer’ (SPO) tag to parents and guardian of the people with special needs. The tag acts as symbol of security,” Kumar said, adding that it shows that “people with special needs are not alone”.

LUDHIANA: A 39-year-old man received two bullet wounds as he tried to broker peace between two warring groups in Guru Arjun Dev Nagar on Monday evening.

Jasbir Singh, a resident of Noorwala village, is admitted to Christian Medical College and Hospital, where his condition is stated to be serious.

Assistant commissioner of police (ACP-East) Devinder Chaudhary said, “Jasbir’s friend, Sunny, had purchased an SUV some months ago. Soon thereafter, he gave it to his friend Bunny, who had been paying the SUV instalments. Bunny had asked Sunny to transfer the SUV ownership in his name. On Monday morning, they prepared an affidavit for the same. Around 4.45pm, Jasbir, Sunny, Bunny and his brothers Honey, Shalu — all of whom are financiers — got together near LIF flats in Guru Arjun Dev Nagar to sign the affidavit.”

There, Sunny had an argument with Bunny and his brothers. As tempers frayed, Jasbir came out of his car to resolve the matter. “But Bunny, Honey, Shalu and their associates, took out a pistol and fired two shots, which hit Jasbir in stomach and on foot. They then escaped from the spot,” Chaudhary added.

An FIR was being lodged against Honey, Bunny, Shallu, all residents of Tibba Road, and their associates. The accused were also facing trials in scuffle cases. No bullet shells were recovered from the spot, he added.

137,['10/03/2020'],First DM in pulmonology in Maha to start this year: MUHS VC,"Nagpur: Maharashtra will soon join the elite club of five states where doctors will get super speciality knowledge in the field of pulmonology and respiratory medicine. Doctors in this field are specialists of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, sleep-disorders, interstitial lung diseases, tuberculosis and acute respiratory diseases like that of Covid-19.

Vice-chancellor of Maharashtra University of Health sciences (MUHS) Dr Dileep Mhaisekar said that state’s first Doctorate of Medicine (DM), a 3-year postgraduate super speciality degree course in the field of pulmonology and respiratory medicine will start from coming academic year.

Dr Mhaisekar, who was in Nagpur for an academic event, claimed that the Medical Council of India (MCI) has already inspected Seth GS Medical College attached to KEM Hospital (Pune) for DM course in pulmonology and he is hopeful that the college will get further approvals.

“We have already received consent of affiliation for this course from the MCI and I am quite confident that KEM Hospital will qualify for further approvals too,” said Dr Mhaisekar, who also is a pulmonologist.

DM is considered as the most advanced super speciality course in any field of medicine. Pulmonology and respiratory medicine is an important branch, especially when it comes to deal with respiration-related infections including novel coronavirus. Currently, DM in pulmonology is available only in Kerala, Karnataka, Delhi, and Chandigarh.

Dr Mhaisekar also appealed to private hospitals in Nagpur to come forward and conduct skill-enhancing fellowship courses launched by MUHS.

“Nagpur has already emerged as the medical hub of Central India. Many private hospitals in Nagpur are conducting fellowship courses launched by MUHS, but this number is not enough. MUHS has designed these fellowships so that graduates and postgraduates can develop their skills in sub-specialities. This activity is academic as well as beneficial for patients,” he added.

Why DM course is important

India has less than 2,500 expect pulmonologists

This number is not enough to deal with coronavirus-like outbreaks

Doctorate of Medicine (DM) is a super-speciality medical degree

It is awarded to MD/MS specialists after they complete 3 years of super specialization

This means a DM in pulmonology will create super-speciality doctors in respiratory medicine

There is no DM course in pulmonology and respiratory medicine available in Maharashtra yet

The rumours gained pace after reports suggested that governor Lalji Tandon, who was in his hometown Lucknow for Holi, will return to Bhopal on Tuesday.

Chouhan met Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP chief J P Nadda on Monday and is learnt to have discussed the party strategy after Congress’s Jyotiraditya Scindia raised the banner of revolt. Chouhan and Nadda were joined by party functionaries from MP and Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar, and they had a long meeting with Shah at the latter’s residence.

According to sources, Chouhan will be elected legislature party head and BJP will immediately seek a floor test. CM Kamal Nath is to present the budget on March 16 and Chouhan will move a no-confidence motion the same day.

Sources said Scindia had met senior BJP functionaries in Delhi after which his loyalist MLAs and state ministers were flown to Bengaluru.

Sources claimed that there could be a repeat of Karnataka where BS Yediyurappa replaced Congress’s Siddaramaiah after several Congress MLAs rebelled and quit. Most of them joined BJP and returned to the assembly after winning the bypolls.

However, the decision to convene a legislature party meeting on Tuesday, despite it being Holi, hinted that BJP may have already struck a deal with Scindia, who has been restive for a while now. A senior BJP functionary said, “We might form the government soon.”

However, the party is treading cautiously in view of the embarrassment that it faced in Maharashtra.

142,['10/03/2020'],VIDC cleared Yes Bank deposits just in time,"Nagpur: Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC), which is already under fire owing to the alleged irrigation scam, had a narrow escape from another controversy. Among the other government agencies in the city, VIDC, too, had as much as Rs100 crore parked in the now beleaguered Yes Bank . This was the total amount kept as fixed deposits from time to time throughout the current financial year..

The entire amount was cleared by January, when the last Rs30 odd crore remaining in the bank was removed. Now the funds are parked with the PSU bank’s apart from the state’s treasury which is the main source of funds.

A senior official in the agency said that the deposits were withdrawn as the money was needed to fund irrigation projects. The bank now continues to hold deposits with PSU banks. At any given point of time, VIDC has bank deposits to the tune of Rs500 crore. However, a larger corpus is held under the state treasury.

VIDC had kept its funds with Yes Bank since 2010-11. There were no specific instructions to deposit the money in the bank as such. However, Yes bank also met the criterion for VIDC to park its funds, which are fixed on the basis of the deposit size and net worth. Above everything else, it has to be a scheduled commercial bank (SCB), that can be both from government or private sector, a source said.

Meanwhile, TOI independently learnt that the funds were withdrawn considering the banks’ falling condition.

Meanwhile, the crowds receded at Yes Bank’s branches in the city which reopened on Monday, even as depositors continued to reach the bank to withdraw up to the prescribed limit of Rs50,000. The ATM machines at the branches visited by TOI were not functioning. However, the officials said the depositors could withdraw their cash using the Yes Bank card from any other bank’s ATM.

Yes Bank has six branches in the city — Civil Lines, Byramji Town, Khamla, Ramdaspeth, and Central Avenue. The electronic transfer of funds continues to be barred, said one of the staffers, requesting not to be named.

Electronic transactions of over 100 cooperative banks in the state continue to be held up. The cooperatives were using NEFT and RTGS facility of Yes Bank. Some of the cooperatives also used Yes Bank’s cheque clearance system that has now been hampered too, said a director in one of the urban cooperatives of the city. The state government’s department of cooperatives is gathering data of cooperatives that used Yes Bank facility. These include nearly a dozen banks from Vidarbha.

143,['10/03/2020'],Gujarat: Flame-of-the-forest lights up houses of Panchmahal farmers,"In three days till Sunday, farmers sold 270kg flowers for around Rs 27,000

VADODARA: The flame-of-the-forest is set to light up houses of poor farmers in the Panchmahal district. The flowers of the tree Butea monosperma also called ‘Palash’ or ‘Kesudo’, were sold in an organized way in the market in the district for the first time.

The farmers in a meeting on Thursday last decided to sell the flowers that grow freely in the area and began the process on Friday. In three days till Sunday, the farmers sold 270kg flowers for around Rs 27,000. While the amount may seem small, officials as well as the villagers are happy with the development that they could manage to do so in no time.

Said a farmer Ajitsinh Solanki, who was associated with the project from the Nesda village of Panchmahal taluka, “We had a meeting on Thursday at the Agriculture Technology and Management Agency (ATMA). It was decided that the flowers should be collected wherever possible. We were asked to count the number of trees that had the flowers.”

ATMA project director at Godhra A I Pathan said that the villagers identified around 500 trees in Nesda and surrounding areas that were bearing the flowers. “We began work at the last moment. Nesda villagers took the lead and sold their flowers at Kalol market yard. We were not sure of the price we could get. The highest we could get was around Rs 150 per kilogram,” said Pathan.

Besides use as a natural colour in Holi festivities, the flowers have a range of other uses. They have medicinal value and are also used in cosmetics. The leaves of the tree are used to make disposable plates and bowls.

Pathan said that the farmers were able to get some extra income without making any investment. “They just have to collect the flowers. We even helped them with transportation,” he said. After the farmers from Nesda, farmers from Jambughoda also sold the flowers at the Jhand Hanuman temple of Saturday when there is heavy rush of pilgrims there. On Monday, an outlet was set up near the Panchmahal district collectorate in Godhra.

The BMC will also be launching eviction drives in areas, including Delapir, Novelty, Quila, where road spaces have been encroached upon.

“A plan is being chalked out to take up eviction exercise on the Shyamganj-Satellite stretch, which has been encroached by street vendors, hawkers, makeshift shopkeepers, stalls and eateries. With flyover construction underway near Satellite, the area is already witnessing traffic congestion while the occupation of free spaces has been hampering vehicular movement. Thus, to ensure that construction works are not hindered and road spaces remain free for smooth vehicular movement, the eviction will be carried out in the area to make the place encroachment-free,” Bareilly municipal commissioner Abhishek Anand told TOI on Monday.

“Any other encroachments and illegal vehicle parking in the area will also be removed to ease traffic congestion,” he added.

Commuters and local shopkeepers in the area said the situation aggravates especially on Sunday when a few other makeshift shopkeepers join and put up their stalls in the area.

Abhinav Gupta, a resident, said, “There was no major problem earlier, but ever since the construction of the flyover started here, traffic often comes to a grinding halt, giving tough time to commuters who are stuck in jams for several minutes. Setting up of extra kiosks here on Sunday adds to the woes.”

Apart from that, the corporation would also be clearing encroachments that have come up in other prime locations, including Novelty crossing-Khaleel school, outside BMC office building, and Maulana Azaad.

BMC officials informed that issues pertaining to encroachments were discussed with corporators and locals at a recent board meeting.

The cameras would allow the officials to record all the activities of the anti-social elements and that can be used as evidence during the trials. The high-resolution cameras would be able to capture the images/videos from a distance of more than 100 metres. It is first of its kind of practice in Bareilly zone.

Additional superintendent of police (rural) RK Bhartiya said it is a step towards smart policing.

“Rs 3 lakhs have allocated to purchase the cameras. If this project delivers fruitful results then all the vehicles would have ‘Dash Camera’. In the case of drunken driving cases, we would have the recording of the driver and he cannot say in court that he has been wrongly charged by the police. When the police car is chasing a criminal then the action could be recorded in the camera to produce it as evidence. The video evidence, once verified forensically, is very strong evidence in the court,” he said.

“Since the cameras are attached to a powerpoint in the car, there will be no charging related worries. There would be a front and rear camera and we are thinking to have an additional camera to record the activity inside the vehicle. We would see if webcasting is possible as it will allow us to monitor the movement of our cops,” he added.

Chandigarh: The Punjab Health Systems Corporation, nodal agency for procurement of medicines for the government hospitals in the state, on Monday said there is no shortage of medicine in government hospitals at present.

The corporation added that stock of most important essential drugs for approximately three months was available in drug warehouses and hospitals.

The Times of India stands by its March 9 article on the issue. The story nowhere mentions that that government hospitals were facing shortage of essential medicines.

The Punjab food and drug administration (FDA) had on March 5 held a meeting with pharma companies— a copy of the minutes of that meeting is in possession of The Times of India — and the pharmaceutical firms had alerted the Punjab government about the real possibility of drug shortage in the state as they only had raw material stock to meet requirements up to March 31.

The Indian pharmaceutical industry is heavily dependent on Chinese imports for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) — 70% of APIs are imported from China.

NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha MP and AAP functionary Sanjay Singh on Monday alleged that those who had defaulted on Yes Bank were close to Bharatiya Janata Party and had given them donation in the last few years.

Singh also questioned as to why Yes Bank was allowed to give out loans of Rs 1 lakh crore, even as RBI was monitoring its operations over irregularities.

BJP, however, rubbished Singh’s allegations as “half-baked sagas”. The saffron party’s Delhi unit spokesperson, Praveen Shankar Kapoor, said: “Sanjay Singh seems to be an expert at serving half-baked sagas. He has tried to portray that some of Yes Bank defaulters had made donations to BJP but has easily ignored the fact that the bank’s head had gifted money for paintings to AAP’s new political ally, the Congress.” Kapoor added that Singh shouldn’t forget that AAP has been accused of accepting donations from benami companies.

Addressing a press conference on Monday, Singh said that the future of 21 lakh account holders of Yes Bank was uncertain due to the crisis. “The big defaulters because of whom Yes Bank has been destroyed have direct links to BJP. The central government is supporting these defaulters. They have played with the hard-earned money of workers, labourers, daily wage earners, farmers and merchants,” the RS member alleged.

151,['10/03/2020'],"Eateries shut at 10 pm, owners urge revising closing hours","Visakhapatnam: After the success of the night food and craft bazaar, restaurant owners in the city are preparing to present a fresh set of demands to the city police and Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) to let restaurants stay open till midnight.

A team from the Andhra Pradesh Hotel Association is expected to meet the top brass of the city police and officials of the civic body soon. “Although there are a few problems with the night food bazaar, we can tell that it’s a success. Now police should allow the restaurant and street food shop owners to operate at least till midnight,” said T Satyanarayana, president of the association to TOI.

The night food and craft bazaar was opened on Jail Road near RTC Complex on February 1 and remains open from 4 pm till 2 am.

A government order (GO) issued by the state labour department in October 2018 allows all restaurants and eateries in the state to remain open till midnight but the city police is reluctant to allow outlets to operate beyond 10.30 pm, or in some cases, beyond 11 pm.

Restaurant owners said that police should allow eateries to remain open at least till midnight in view of the tourist footfall in the city and the large number of employees who work late-evening and night shifts.

“With applications like Zomato and Swiggy, the trend for late night orders has increased. Often we have seen people ordering for dinner after 10.30 pm. But following directives from the city police we don’t accept orders beyond 10 or 10.15 pm,” said S Srinivasa Rao, owner of a food joint in the city.

Executives working late shifts said that they face problems while placing orders at night and have to order dinner before 10 pm.

“Often I work on afternoon shift that gets over at 10 pm. After reaching home when I try to place order only a few restaurants accepts order on the app. The solution is to book food and get it delivered at office itself. But by the time I reach home, the food is already cold,” said S Deoghoria, who works at a a call centre in the city.

Restaurateurs said most establishments that accept orders beyond 10.30 pm on food delivery apps are neither restaurants or street food outlets but cloud kitchens that do not occupy physical space or have dine-in facilities. These establishments are run out of spaces that prepare the food for delivery.

“See the irony. We pay license and other fees and carry out ‘illegal’ business. But we are not allowed to operate beyond 10.30 pm. But these cloud kitchens can operate round-the-clock without paying any fees,” added T Satyanarayana.

152,['10/03/2020'],Issuing fake bills for refunds: 4 city firms raided for GST fraud,"Ludhiana: Directorate general of GST intelligence (DGGI), New Delhi, raided four city-based companies suspected of being hand in glove with a Delhi duo who fleeced government of crores of rupees by claiming fraudulent IGST (integrated GST) refunds.

Sources said these companies provided bills to the firms of the accused duo on the basis of which they claimed fraudulent refunds worth crores. The total IGST refunds availed by the duo’s companies were of Rs 61.02 crore.

Sources said raids in this case were being conducted simultaneously in Delhi, Ludhiana, Baddi and other cities since March 6. Teams of more than 50 officials, including those from Ludhiana zonal office, were parts of the operation.

“DGGI had raided four Delhi-based firms on March 6 on information that these were engaged in the business of availing fraudulent input tax credit (ITC) for payment of IGST on export of goods. These four firms have claimed forged IGST refund of more than Rs 61 crore. The department also conducted raids on some companies located in Ludhiana and Baddi that were connected with the four firms of Delhi duo, as they were providing them bills. On the basis of these bills, the Delhi firms applied for fraudulent ITC,” sources said.

Officials are still assessing since when the Ludhiana firms started the malpractice.

Source said the raiding party also had instructions to raid a house in Ludhiana that belonged to the owner of a raided firm, but sleuths were unable to do so due to a death in the family of the businessman. The businessman is likely to be summoned to Delhi for further questioning.

The bill network

On March 6, DGGI (headquarters) had registered a case against Delhi-based Aastha Apparels Pvt Ltd and three other firms. The firms fraudulently claimed ITC on the basis of invoices received from non-existent/ non-functional companies or from those that have indulged in circular trading. The said firms also did not have commensurate purchases backwards. The supplier companies were controlled and managed by only a few persons and they were also engaged in claiming IGST refunds. These companies have created a complex web of circular trading among themselves without commensurate payments or actual supplies of goods to pass on ineligible ITC to the exporters. As a result, two directors of these exporter companies were arrested on March 7 under the CGST Act. Subsequently, officials began to probe the role of suppliers and others associated with these exporters.

BHOPAL: The 15-month-old Kamal Nath government plunged into uncertainty on Monday with the shock rebellion of AICC general secretary Jyotiraditya Scindia and his faction in the morning, triggering the mass resignation of all ministers around midnight in an effort to help the CM save the government.

“All ministers present at the meeting (at CM House) have handed over their resignation. We have requested the CM to reconstitute the cabinet and tackle the situation created by BJP. The government is all right and will run for five years,” said PR minister P C Sharma.

Nath issued a statement, saying that he will “not let the forces trying to create instability with the help of mafia succeed”. The Congress Legislative Party has called a meeting at 5pm on Tuesday. Governor Lalji Tandon is learnt to have cut shot his vacation and is returning to Bhopal on Tuesday. CM Nath has sough an appointment with him.

“A true Congress leader will stay with the party,” said former CM Digvijaya Singh.

The crisis hit Congress and CM Nath just when they thought they had weathered the ‘horse-trading’ storm.

Scindia — a second-generation top rung Congress leader — and 17 of his MLAs, including six ministers, went incommunicado in the morning, and flew to Bengaluru. This, when two Congress MLAs are still missing and believed to be in Bengaluru. BJP sources said the former Guna MP was scheduled to meet PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah.

Congress, completely blindsided by the Scindia googly, got to know of it only when the group had landed in Bengaluru. Sources in the state Congress claimed it was not the BJP this time, but an “internal crisis”.

However, there were signs that it may be more than mere pressure tactics by Scindia for the PCC chief post or the ‘safe’ Rajya Sabha seat. BJP sources said that the former Guna MP is scheduled to meet PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah. The state BJP top leadership is in Delhi and met at Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar ’s residence from where they went to meet Shah. Scindia was seen entering his Delhi home at 7.45pm.

The labourers are employed in constructing a housing unit near the ground. The shelters would create inconvenience to both players and labourers, the petition said.

V Kuppusamy, a representative of those who play in the ground, said the temporary shelters were put up last week.

“A total of 36 shelters have been set up using zinc and asbestos sheets for the labourers. The labourers were brought in for a contract period of 18 months. They might stay in the temporary shelters during the contract period.”

An altercation between players and labourers could take place when many people come to the ground to play cricket, football and volleyball, he said.

“On Sundays, the ground is fully crowded. Balls might enter the labourers’ shelters and we fear this could cause problems between players and labourers,” he said.

Also, residents living near the ground use it for jogging and walking daily.

“As there are no proper sanitation facilities for labourers, there is also a risk of health hazard,” he added.

He said they had already sent a petition to the chief minister’s cell and on Monday they petitioned the district collector and city police commissioner for accommodating the labourers in some other place.

NEW DELHI: The trust that runs Delhi University’s Daulat Ram College has to pay over Rs 5 crore as its contribution in running the institution. But it hasn’t paid for several years, and now there is a suggestion that if dues are not cleared, the college should be made a university-maintained institute.

Being trust-run, the college is to receive 95% of its funds from the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the rest from the trust. The executive council (EC) of the university has also taken up the matter and a decision will be taken in its meeting on Friday.

According to an EC statement, it “resolves that the trusts of the trust-maintained colleges be asked to contribute their 5% mandatory share as indicated by UGC in its yearly budget sanction letters to the respective colleges”. On the basis of the UGC letter to Daulat Ram, it said the university had requested the chairperson of the governing body to deposit the trust share of Rs 5,38,30,115.

However, Suneeta Sudhershan, the chairperson of the governing body, said there had been a “miscalculation”. “It is 5% of the first 1,000 students. That is the share of each trust-maintained college. There has been some miscalculation,” Sudhershan told TOI. A teacher of the college confirmed that the trust had not paid its dues, which had been delaying infrastructural work.

According to EC, “In case a trust fails to contribute its share, the process of getting 100% grant-in-aid from UGC and converting that trust-maintained college into a university-maintained institution be initiated.” At DU, 21 colleges are trust-run. Besides Daulat Ram, these include Ramjas, Hindu, Hansraj, and SRCC.

An elected EC member said this had been a long-standing demand of the university. “The trusts do not make the mandatory 5% contribution. UGC keeps on writing but nothing happens,” said Rajesh Jha.

161,['10/03/2020'],Reservation jigsaw will force parties to go for BC women candidates in many general seats,"Political parties are in a tight spot to select candidates due to erratic reservations fixed for Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies ( MPTCs ) in several mandals in the state.

In many places, none of the MPTCs are reserved to the category to which the mandal parishad president post has been given.

Since the election of mandal parishad is an indirect one, one of the MPTCs should be fit to contest to the president’s post. The post of mandal parishad president is considered a prestigious one at rural level as it enjoys considerable clout and say over allotment of funds to different villages.

The allotment of reservations to MPTCs has created ripples in political parties. For instance, the president post of A Konduru mandal parishad in Krishna district is reserved for BC woman while none of the 14 MPTCs in the mandal has been reserved for this category. This would force parties to field at least two BC women from general seats in order to win the mandal president post.

A similar situation prevails in Buchireddypalem mandal of Nellore district. While the Mandal Parishad president post was reserved for BC general category, none of the MPTCs was spared for BCs in the mandal. It is now open to the parties to field the BC candidates from general seats and make them Mandal Parishad president.

In fact, the officials too have faced a lot of dilemma in the finalisation of the reservations in 48 hours. “The district is taken as unit for deciding reservations to the ZPTCs while population in the mandal is criteria for MPTCs. As per the rules, we need to spare seats first to the ST quota, then to SCs before giving seats to the BCs as per the ratio fixed by the government. We have also taken a lot of care in allotment of reservation as ZPTC and MPP post should not be spared to same reservation category,” explained Nellore ZP chief executive officer P Susheela.

She said that they have not violated the rules anywhere during the allotment of the reservations.

Meanwhile, the elections in Podili mandal of Prakasam district were postponed following a directive from the SEC. Sources said that Podili MPP was given for BC woman category while none of the MPTCs was given to the same category. The parties could overcome the issue only by allocating general seats to backward classes.

LUDHIANA: As the Ludhiana municipal corporation has an acute shortage of funds, development works proposed for the city, including those meant to improve essential infrastructure, are hanging fire. In fact, sources said the civic body is dependent on funds from smart city mission even for essential road markings and construction of bridges, especially the railway bridges.

The situation is so bad that not only the opposition councillors, but also the ruling party councillors are complaining about lack of infrastructure in their wards. Right from roads and sewerage to water supply, everything is affected. Residents said they are the real sufferers as they do not get even the basic necessities.

The senior Congress councillor Jai Parkash said, “When we do not have funds, how will we get works done? We are dependent on smart city mission or other central government schemes for money.” He blamed the the previous Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party government for the precarious situation that the civic body is facing. According to him, there is a need to take some strict steps and rollback exemptions from taxes — for instance, he pointed out that houses constructed in 125 square yards are neither paying property tax nor water and sewerage bills.

However, on the other hand, leader of opposition and senior Akali Dal councillor Harbhajan Dang said, “The situation has touched an extreme low only in the last two years — the Congress could not get proper roads constructed, sewerage system has collapsed and even water supply is affected,” said Dang, adding that the chief minister has no time for civic bodies.

Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu said, “It is not that we do not want to spend on development, but we do not have sources. The government has recently agreed to slot paying guest accommodations, quarters and rental accommodation in the commercial category — we will recover property tax at the rate of 7.5% of annual rent of the property. Similarly, we will recover water bills on commercial rates.” He also said the charges for services should be revised as they are outdated.

164,['10/03/2020'],Three rescued from kidnappers in Malaysia,"Victims family rejoices

AHMEDABAD: Three persons from the city, Tushar Patel of Vastral, one Praful and another were rescued by Malaysian police from their kidnappers in Kuala Lumpur and are being sent back to their homes in a case registered by the city crime branch four days ago. They had been held captive by kidnappers for over a month in Malaysia. City crime branch took the help of the ministry of external affairs and the Indian embassy in Malaysia to coordinate the rescue of the kidnapping victims .

Senior crime branch officials said the three persons who had been kidnapped had contacted a city travel agent, Vishal Jani for going to Australia on work visa. However, they were first flown to Malaysia and the agent told them that they will have to stay in Malaysia for about 10 days before they could proceed for Australia. One day during their stay in Malaysia, when the trio went out of their hotel, they were kidnapped.

Soon their relatives in the city began receiving calls from the kidnappers demanding ransom money of Rs 10 lakh to release each of their captives.

“A relative of one of the victims contacted city crime branch, which registered a case four days ago and traced the ransom calls to Malaysia and not Australia.

“We traced the location of the building where the victims had been held captive. On Saturday, a task force of Malaysian police raided the building and rescued the victims, but the accused managed to flee. The three men are being sent to Ahmedabad,” said a senior police official.

A crime branch official said that if needed they will send a team of crime branch to Malaysia which will jointly work with Malaysian police to trace the accused.

LUDHIANA: Two thefts and a snatching rocked Daba’s Sundar Nagar early on Monday.

Manjit Singh, a driver and resident of Sundar Nagar, said in his police complaint, “For the treatment of my mother, who is a heart patient, I had borrowed Rs 50,000 from my employer two days ago. When I woke up on Monday morning, I found my house ransacked. Rs 50,000 kept in an almirah and two cellphones were stolen. Neither me nor my family heard any noise on Sunday night or in the small hours of Monday.”

In the second incident, Sooraj Kumar, a labourer and resident of the area, told the police that when he woke up, he found his cellphone missing. “I had kept it near my bed,” he added.

A few hours later, two men on a motorcycle snatched Rs 22,000 from a vegetable vendor.

Gauri Shankar, also a resident of Sundar Nagar, said, “I was going to the vegetable market when two men on a bike intercepted me near old building of Daba police station.

166,['10/03/2020'],Haircut for PSU bank in state waiver scheme,"Nagpur: As state government pays off farmers’ loans, the PSU banks will have to be take a haircut while cooperative banks will be getting full amount back. The state government has negotiated a formula with PSU banks. Under this, they will have to forgo a part of the amount due from farmers, depending upon the date it was classified as a non-performing asset (NPA).

The haircut for PSU banks under Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s Jyotirao Phule Shetkari Karza Mukti Yojana was in line with the arrangement under Maratha Chhatrapati Shivaji Yojana launched by BJP government. The new scheme covers loans upto Rs 2 lakh granted from April 2015 to March 2019 that were due as on September 30, 2019.

If the loan was a declared NPA as on September 2019, the banks have to forgo 15% of the dues. The proportion goes up with the age of NPA. In an account that was NPA as on March 31, 2018, the haircut comes to 30%, and 45% for NPAs as on March 2017.

Earlier it was proposed to apply the haircut on ledger balance. This means the dues along with interest till the date the account was declared NPA. The matter was discussed in a meeting between the state government’s officials and state level bankers’ committee (SLBC). The state government was represented by the chief secretary. The banks, however, proposed to take a haircut on the interest due till September 30, 2019, which is the cut off date for the scheme.

However, no haircut will be applicable to district central cooperative banks (DCCBs). DCCBs are part of the three tier farm lending structure, and crop loans are their mainstay. A senior official in state’s department of cooperatives said this is because PSU banks normally write off crop loans soon after the account becomes NPA. DCCBs on the other hand keep it live in the books much beyond NPA date. Considering this, it has been decided to provide the entire amount to the cooperatives, the source said.

Vijaysingh Bais, lead district manager (LDM) from Bank of India, said, “in Nagpur, data for over 40,000 loan accounts has been uploaded. Of these, Aadhaar verification remains for over 10,000 accounts. If the farmers get the verification done at the earliest they can avail of waiver scheme too.” A PSU bank is appointed as lead manager in each district which monitors the farm lending including that of other banks too. In Nagpur, Bank of India is the lead manager.

PANAJI: With cruise ships being seen as fertile grounds for the Coronavirus (Covid-19), Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) has decided to turn away all international cruise vessels till the end of this month, as a precautionary measure.

International cruise lines have also informed MPT that they are cancelling cruises as passengers across the globe have begun to cancel their bookings. This, said MPT officials and stakeholders, will have a financial impact on stakeholders.

“In view of the coronavirus threat, the central government has decided that no cruise ship from any foreign destination will be allowed to call on Indian ports with immediate effect,” deputy chairman Guruprasad Rai said in a notice to shipping agents.

MPT’s restriction on port calls does not apply to cargo vessels, which continue to arrive as per schedule, but the crew of the vessels have to abide by the standard operating procedures put in place by the Union ministry of health and shipping.

The port has already put in place screening, detection and quarantine system for disembarking seafarers of cargo tankers and other commercial vessels.

Cruise liners MSC Lirica with 1,560 passengers and MV Celebrity Constellation with 2,000 passengers were scheduled to arrive on Sunday and Monday, but were turned away.

MS Nautica, MS Asuka II, Norwegian Jade and Seven Seas Voyager have cancelled their cruises, which were scheduled for April.

“Our revenue from cruise tourism is low so not much impact will be there on our revenue, but yes there will be a dip,” said Rai.

MPT handled 38 cruise vessels till February end and at least 15 more vessels were expected at the port before the season ends.

Apart from international cruise liners, two domestic cruise liners, Angriya and Karnika, also make regular trips to Goa from Mumbai.

BHOPAL: In a bid to cope with the coronavirus scare, Khajuraho airport has started thermal scanning of tourists. Apart from scanning, travel history of tourists is also being recorded.

Though the number of foreign tourists to Khajuraho has dropped sharply, it still continues to be the highest in the state. On Monday, two flights that landed at Khajuraho airport brought just 75 foreign tourists as compared to around 300 on normal days, airport sources said.

Director of Khajuraho airport PK Bej told TOI, “The state government has deputed doctor at the airport along with the thermal scanning machine to check the body temperature of tourists. We are also recording the travel history of tourists. Based on the report, we are taking action.”

Owing to the coronavirus scare, the number of tourists reaching Khajuraho has dropped considerably, especially in the last few days. Mahendra Sharma, an office-bearer of the hotel owners association in Khajuraho said, “A large number of bookings have been cancelled as the government has decided to cancel the visa of tourists some European nations, like Italy. Just 5% to 10% tourism is left at the moment in Khajuraho and Orchha. There was a good flow of Chinese tourists to Khajuraho before the outbreak of COVID, but almost all the bookings have been cancelled.

Vadodara: A nine-year-old male leopard was caged from a private farm located in middle of Hoshepura and Medad villages of Padra taluka of Vadodara district early on Monday morning.

Residents of Hoshepura and Medad had complained of sighting a leopard in the area for the past one month. The farm where the leopard was trapped falls on the border of Hoshepura and Medad villages on Padra-Karjan stretch of Vadodara district.

“Residents were demanding that we place a cage to trap the leopard which they had sighted. We had kept the cage a month back and it was at around 6.30 am that it got trapped,” said Shailesh Talpada, range forest officer at Padra range.

The leopard was brought to the Vadodara Rescue Centre of the forest department.

It will be fitted with a microchip as part of a programme to find out the identity of animals in inhabited areas. The microchips carry an identification number. “It will be released in deep forest area of Jambughoda wildlife sanctuary,” said Talpada.

About two years ago, residents of neighbouring villages — Shihor and Tikariya — faced similar leopard menace. A leopard had killed their cattle.

“A year and a half ago, we had trapped another leopard from the region,” said Talpada, adding that the stretch that falls on the river bank between Chansad and Nedra villages, has witnessed movement of leopards in the past as it is a forest area.

The inquiry is the result of a AP high court order. Sources said that a CBI team from Delhi on Monday came to Guntur and initiated the inquiry into the illegal detention.

On October 14, 2019, Guntur urban CCS police allegedly took three persons—N Adinarayana, R Srinivasa Rao and T Srinivasa Rao of Nara Koduru village in Guntur district—into custody on charges of cricket betting. As the trio didn’t return home, their wives lodged a missing complaint with the Pattabhipuram police station and approached Guntur Urban police chief PHD Ramakrishna.

Since the police failed to respond to the complaint, the wives filed habeas corpus petition in the AP high court seeking direction to the police to present their husbands before the court. Chebrole police finally produced the trio in court on October 31, 2019.

Sources said CBI officials visited Chebrole police station and CCS Police station in Guntur district and collected the case diary from the police stations. The CBI team also recorded the statements of the police. CBI officials visited Guntur Urban police chief PHD Ramakrishna’s office as a part of their inquiry.

The CBI team will also meet the trio to record their statement. The CBI will submit a comprehensive report to the court once it completes the inquiry. The matter was posted in the High Court to June 17 for further hearing.

The LG office confirmed that it had received a petition from Vinay Sharma’s lawyer. “The petition has been forwarded to Delhi government’s home department for its comments. Appropriate decision will be taken on the basis of the department’s views,” an official said.

The convict moved the LG’s office through his counsel A P Singh, who filed a plea under Sections 432 (power to suspend or remit sentences) and 433 (power to commute sentence) of CrPC.

Sharma, in his petition, described his life behind bars and what he faced during his confinement. The plea urged the lieutenant governor to allow Sharma’s lawyer to make oral submission before him. “Along with other nuances of the petitioner’s case, the entirety of physical and mental torture suffered by the petitioner could be best conveyed to your excellency only by means of an oral hearing,” it said.

Members of the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), Tamil Nadu Annal Ambedkar Sanitary Workers and General Workers Association and Jansakthi Mazdoor Sabha demanded preference while filing the posts of permanent sanitary workers and also condemned the corporation for recruiting freshers.

The corporation had conducted a recruitment test to fill 549 vacant posts of permanent sanitary workers a few months ago. On Friday, Velumani handed over appointment orders to the 351 selected candidates. The new workers took charge on Monday.

“I had joined as a temporary sanitary worker for a meagre wage of Rs 60 a day a decade ago. I continue to work on a temporary basis for Rs 9,500 per month. Despite the good job I do, I was not made permanent. How long should I wait or what should I do more to become a permanent worker?” asked a protester, who had appeared for the recruitment test.

Most of the newly appointed workers are graduates, she said. “Now, I will be forced to do their work also as they hesitate even to touch brooms.”

Protest coordinator N Selvaraj said the recruitment was mired in corruption. “If investigated properly, major scams can be unearthed. Appointment orders were given only to those who had bribed the officials. Most of the candidates were from the south zone, which falls under the minister’s constituency,” he told TOI. “When a case pertaining to the regularization of temporary workers is pending in the Madras high court, how could the appointments be made? An inquiry should be launched immediately.”

Corporation commissioner J Sravan Kumar refuted the allegations. “We had followed all the norms, including reservation, while selecting the candidates,” he said.

BHOPAL: In a bid to promote Orchha as a major tourist destination of religious and archaeological importance, the district administration has decided to make it mandatory for shopkeepers to display a picture of Lord Ram on the display boards of their shop. This unique initiative was initiated just before the recently-concluded Orchha festival. The town is famous for Ram Raja temple where the legend is revered as the King of Orchha.

On the administration’s prodding, a large number of shopkeepers, especially near the Ram Raja temple, have displayed the picture of Lord Ram and Kalp Vriksha ( the baobab tree ) on both sides of their display board where the name of the shop is mentioned. There are also two Baobab trees of African origin, believed to be more than 500 years old, in Orchha and both are revered by the people as they offer prayers and seek blessings of the “sacred tree” .

Talking about the campaign, Niwari district collector Akshay Kumar Singh said, “We did float the idea, which people lapped it up. More than 100 shopkeepers already have their display boards with the pictures of Lord Ram on one side and Baobab tree on the other. There are about 250 shops in total in Orchha.”

When asked about the response of shopkeepers belonging to other religions regarding the initiative, he said, “Lord Ram is also a symbol of Orchha heritage and everybody understands this quite well.

Still, it is optional for shopkeepers, other than Hindus. Nothing is compulsory and shopkeepers are doing it willingly.”

Mukesh Jain,a grocery shop owner near Ram Raja temple, said: “This campaign will give Orchha a unique identity like Jaipur which is known as pink city.”

VADODARA: A sessions court in Chhota Udepur sentenced a farmer from Kawant to rigorous life imprisonment for killing his minor daughter’s lover in February 2017.

The farmer Jambu Rathwa’s wife Karpi was also booked in the case, but the court acquitted her with benefit of doubt.

According to the details of FIR, the deceased Ashok Rathwa (27) had went to meet the minor girl at her home in the middle of the night on February 3. When Ashok teased the girl, the girl screamed hearing which Jambu and Karpi rushed inside the house. The couple was sleeping outside in the courtyard. Seeing Ashok, Jambu got furious and hit him with wooden stick.

Ashok was then tied to a pillar inside the house and beaten and stabbed mercilessly which led to his death. The murder came to light next morning when Ashok’s younger brother Arvind came searching for him at Jambu’s home. The body was still tied to the pillar and he was bleeding profusely. Arvind then informed police and the couple was arrested for murder.

During the trial, Jambu’s daughter-in-law was examined by the additional public prosecutor R S Parmar. She told before the court that she had seen Jambu hitting Ashok with a wooden stick which led to his death. However, she denied seeing Kapri involved in the killing. Parmar also presented the murder weapons – wooden stick and knife – recovered by police from a water tank in the village.

178,['10/03/2020'],HC: No directions to Centre on unverifiable cases of 1971 soldiers,"Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court has made it clear that it cannot issue any directions to the Centre to take up matter regarding soldiers missing in the 1971 India-Pakistan war, when there are no verifiable facts about their whereabouts. The high court, however, directed that in case any reliable information is received by the central or state governments, necessary action shall be taken.

HC’s Justice Lisa Gill passed the order while disposing of a petition filed by Paramjit Kaur, a resident of Bathinda district, who had approached the HC for directions to the Union government to take up the matter regarding the whereabouts of her father Jagraj Singh, who was serving in the Army’s 102 Engineer Regiment.

According to the petitioner, her father was deployed in Ferozepur sector during the 1971 war. During the war, her family received a letter from the military authorities informing them Jagraj Singh was killed in action when a shell exploded on December 3, 1971. His body, however, could not be recovered. A letter to this effect was also issued to his widow (the petitioner’s mother).

According to the petitioner, information has been received that Jagraj Singh was captured by the Pakistan Army and he is confined in a jail in Pakistan. As per some information received by the petitioner, Jagraj Singh was handed over to the authorities of Saudi Arabia and was reportedly jailed in Oman.

After hearing the arguments, the bench reiterated the observations made in a similar matter, stating that as far as the prayer for directions to the Centre government asking it to take up the matter with the Pakistan government are concerned, no such directions can be issued by the court in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution and that too without verifiable facts available on record, except to say that the central government and the state government will keep their eyes and ears open through the diplomatic channels.

“The petition is disposed of with the similar observation that in case, any reliable information is received by the central or state government, in respect to the whereabouts of the petitioner’s father Jagraj Singh... necessary action shall be taken,” Justice Gill observed while disposing of the matter.

179,['10/03/2020'],Ludhiana: 2 motorcyclists open fire on Hindu outfit office-bearer,"A CCTV grab of the assailants

LUDHIANA: Two men on a motorcycle opened fire on the Punjab Shiv Sena national spokesperson while he was walking back home in Khanna from a nearby temple on Monday morning.

The incident comes three days after Shiv Sena (Hindustan) labour wing head had claimed attack on him in Focal Point. Mahant Kashmir Giri, 47, a resident of Khatikan Chowk, said in his police complaint, “Like any other day, I went to Pracheen Shiv Diwala Mandir around 5.15am. On reaching there, I realised I had forgotten something home. I soon left and while walking back home, I saw two men on a Pulsar motorcycle making rounds of the area. I was leaving home for the temple when I saw those two bikers driving towards my house between 5.20am and 5.25am.”

As they aroused his suspicion, Giri closed the gate and rushed inside his house. “The two men then opened fire. The first bullet hit the gate and the second was fired in air,” he added. Though the government has deployed a gunman with him, he was near the temple at the time. “I suspect the two had fired at me when I was at the temple, too. But they missed their mark and temple hymns drowned the gunshot sound,” Giri said.

While the bike driver was wearing a helmet, the pillion rider’s face was masked.

“There have been many attempts on my life before as well. The miscreants should be arrested immediately as they are trying to vitiate the atmosphere of the state by attacking Hindu outfit leaders,” Giri, who is also the head of Pracheen Shiv Diwala Mandir, added.

CCTV cameras installed at his house gate have captured the accused. “The CCTV footage corroborate Giri’s claims. They two had made several rounds of the area before striking. They, it seems, had been keeping an eye on Giri for days,” said a cop.

Civic officials said that 20 traders were penalised Rs 5,000 each for keeping single-use plastic in violation of the ban. Some others were fined for littering on roads, not segregating waste at source, etc between March 9 and 14.

The action was initiated as part of the cleanliness drive launched in view of the completion of 60 years for the formation of Maharashtra state. “Initially, we have started taking action against erring citizens not segregating waste at home, dumping construction waste and garbage in the open instead of giving it to garbage collection vans,” officials said.

The action has been taken by the teams of NMC officials at divisional level led by divisional sanitary inspector. Nineteen citizens have been fined totally worth Rs 6,500 for non-segregation of waste in to dry and wet at source.

As many as 41 citizens have been fined totally worth Rs 33,290 for littering on public spaces. NMC has fined 7 citizens with fine totally worth Rs 3,300 for dumping construction waste on open spaces.

181,['10/03/2020'],Guns bind them for life: Surrendered rebels throw light on the struggle between ideology and love,"Gadchiroli: Guns bind them together, not just in the battle for territorial supremacy but also in companionship.

When love blossoms in the conflict zones while following path of “Maoist revolution”, the rebels do not have the luxury of having a ceremonial wedding. They simply exchange guns to solemnize marriage between fellow comrades, TOI learnt from two senior surrendered Maoist cadres, who chose to abandon the idea of “revolution” to settle for a family life in the urban comforts.

Former divisional committee member (DVC) of company number 4 Gokul Madavi, 30, had to flee the forested den with his colleague-turned-lady love to evade action from the top-brass of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist). They had to escape in order to tie the knot as Madavi was barred from marrying. As per rules that the Reds have to follow, a Maoist cannot marry within a year after death of his/her spouse in encounter and for at least three years in case the life-partner is arrested.

“Marriage is simple ritual in the party. It’s just exchanging guns in the presence of seniors followed by distribution of biscuits as sweets among party colleagues,” said Madavi, who surrendered in June last year.

As a DVC, he was commanding Tippagarh, Kasansur, Chatgaon, Korchi and platoon 15 apart from company number 4 in North Gadchiroli. “As my wife was killed in an encounter at Medhri in 2018, I had no sanction from the party to remarry within a year and hence had to quit,” he said.

Throwing light on the life of a Maoist, Madavi said, “It’s true that seniors press cadres to undergo family planning operation with the help of “experts” within the party. We have cadres trained in carrying out such small surgeries in the forest itself.”

Madavi is learnt to have now undergone reverse vasectomy with police help and is waiting for his marriage to be formalized now.

Having joined the movement in 2005 as a minor, Madavi’s biggest involvement was in the police massacre at Markegaon in 2009 where 15 jawans were gunned down. “We had waited for three days in ambush before the cops walked into the trap. Though, it’s not possible to remain stationed for three days now with police intelligence gathering and patrolling having increased,” he said.

Like Madavi, former Chatgaon deputy commander Devidas Atla, 26, too has left the party with his lady love to settle for a family life. He too had joined the party as a teenager without completing studies while in Standard X.

Joined the movement in 2011, Atla was groomed as a “medical expert” apart from training in arms. Dubbed as ‘doctor’ in the dalam, he now pins hope on the skills learnt in the movement to make a living by getting a job at any hospital.

“The support base of the party (Maoists) is eroding everywhere as people are shying away from offering help or even passing on information. The government’s reward policy too seems to have forced some cadres to consider surrender,” said Atla, who too is waiting for formally marrying his former colleague-turned-girlfriend.

According to a source in Gadchiroli police , there is a plan to get the former Maoists married with their lady loves and help them settle through government schemes.

JIND: A government primary schoolteacher was on Monday booked for caning a Class III girl student, 8, of a school in Shadipur village of Haryana’s Jind district for failing to solve a maths sum. The child’s mother alleged that the male teacher had caned her daughter mercilessly, leaving dark cane marks on her rear.

The child’s mother told the media that the caning incident on Friday had left the child traumatized and scarred. ""My daughter is completely shattered by the caning and has been unable to eat since last three days, so I decided to approach the police on Monday to seek strict action against the teacher. He has beaten my daughter like an animal and injured her. It is not the first time that this has happened. I had urged the teacher not to mete out such harsh punishment, but to no avail,"" she said.

The mother said that she had got the child’s medical examination conducted at the local civil hospital and lodged a complaint with education authorities and police. Acting on her complaint, block education officer Shiv Naryan Singh has issued a notice to the teacher. He condemned the incident saying that the physical punishment was banned in Haryana government schools and anyone resorting to it was violating rules. “Appropriate action would be taken against the teacher after a fair probe,"" he said.

Surender Singh, Julana SHO, said that a case has been registered against the teacher, Ashok Kumar.

Vadodara: A huge fire broke out in a cotton ginning mill in Shinor town, around 55 km from here , on Monday evening.

Due to absence of fire fighting machinery in the area, those from Dabhoi, Karjan and as far as Vadodara city were pressed into service. According to Vadodara Fire and Emergency Services, the fire at Gopal Industries broke out around 5.30pm and they received a call for back-up at 7pm.

However, by then a large area was engulfed in flames.

Sources said that cotton bales of Gopal Industries as well as Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) had caught fire which could lead to losses in lakhs of rupees.

184,['10/03/2020'],Even graduates appear in board exams at Bhind,"Representative image

BHOPAL: A few years back, we had seen pictures of mass cheating in Bihar board examinations. In Bhind, the scene was a bit different, as officials were shocked to find a number of youths appearing in board examinations claiming themselves to be teenagers!

After investigation, it has come to light that several youths had used forged documents to appear in board examinations, even though they had completed graduation and even post-graduation. And the biggest shocker is that they were doing all this just to get a birth certificate that has a reduced age so that they could appear for Army recruitment tests.

After primary investigation, police have registered a case and started investigation into the entire case. The candidates who have used forged documents to enlist themselves as students of class X had come to notice on March 3 during Sanskrit examination of class X at a private school in Mehgaon.

According to the complaint lodged by the in-charge of the examination centre at the school Devesh Kumar Verma to the police, a few suspected candidates were noticed by the sub-divisional magistrate as well as the centre in-charge during the examination. After examination the SDM as well as the centre incharge cross-checked their date of birth, name of father and mother and it was then found that their actual date of birth was different from that mentioned on the admit cards. Subsequently, the block education officer was instructed to provide the eligiblity-related documents of the suspected candidates, they had appeared for the examination on the basis of class 9 marksheets. When the schools whose marksheets were shown by the suspected candidates were contacted, they informed that neither the marksheets were issued by the schools concerned nor the candidates had ever been students of the school. Subsequently, the centre incharge made a written complaint with police on March 7.

Police have registered a case and started investigation. Bhind SP Nagendra Singh confirmed that FIR has been registered. “We are carrying out detailed investigation into the matter and also checking whether any similar racket was being done in other areas also”.

Sources said that so far police have identified around 40 suspected candidates. It is noteworthy that youths in Bhind district, which comes under the Chambal region, have a penchant for jobs in armed forces. The district has more than 2000 war widows. Since the recruitment age in armed forces is less, the youth could not make it to the recruitment test, hence they tried to indulge in such malpractices with the connivance of racketeers, said sources.

Expressing his appreciation, Nathwani tweeted, “I sincerely thank Hon’ble Chief Minister Sh @ysjagan and his party @YSRCParty for considering me as their Rajya Sabha candidate from Andhra Pradesh. I am committed to serve the people of #AndhraPradesh”.

The announcement by YSR Congress senior leader Ummareddy Venkateswarlu that Nathwani will be one of the party’s four candidates, ended speculation on the possible state from which Nathwani will seek a re-election to the Rajya Sabha.

Earlier last month, Parimal Nathwani is said to have met AP chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy, triggering speculation that he had been offered a Rajya Sabha seat from Andhra Pradesh.

AHMEDABAD: Unarmed constables, who form almost 70% of the existing police force, may soon be seen probing cases. Gujarat DGP Shivanand Jha has sent a proposal to the home department to allow unamed constables investigate certain cases. A senior police official said that the government has approved the proposal in principle.

The proposal suggests that unarmed police constables who have been in service for five years or more be allowed to probe offences punishable with not more than imprisonment of five years, with or without fine. The DGP stated that the step will immensely improve capacity of the Gujarat police as these constables will gain experience in investigation procedures.

A senior police official said that policemen who are allowed to carry arms, including head constables, assistant sub-inspectors, inspectors and their seniors are overloaded with work. “Their workload will be enormously reduced if unarmed constables, who form about 70% of the force, can work as investigators. This gain in experience will help the constables to handle important cases as soon as they get promoted,” said the official.

Pointing out that the step will lead to better use of personnel, a senior police official said, “Unarmed constables are usually deployed in bandobust duty, and accompany seniors in combing and other operations.”

In his proposal, the DGP has cited his powers under Section 157 of the CrPC read with Section 2 (O) that permit him prescribe such a step as a DGP and IGP of the state.

189,['10/03/2020'],The evening is yet to be: Vairamuthu’s ode to Tamil,"CHENNAI: Vairamuthu remembers March 10, 1980, as if it was yesterday. It was the day he penned "" Pon Maalai Pozhuthu "" from P Bharathiraja’s ‘Nizhalgal’. The film may not have set the box office on fire, but the song stirred hearts. It changed his life.

The lyricist hasn’t looked back since, but does so again, at how the moment shaped his career. Forty years ago, he says, he was in his 20s and working in the state language department, translating Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPc), Indian Penal Code (IPC) and other law-related material to Tamil. Restless and keen on spreading his love for Tamil literature through cinema, he was waiting for a chance.

He had been introduced, through a common friend, to Bharathiraja who asked him to come to Atlantic Hotel in Chennai. ""You can imagine my plight,"" Vairamuthu recalls. ""My wife was in hospital, we were going to have our first child. I asked the doctor to look after her and rushed there.""

When he walked into room ‘410’, maestro Ilaiyaraaja was fiddling with his musical instruments, preparing to create the songs for ‘Nizhalgal’. Bharathiraja explained the situation and 30 minutes later, Vairamuthu came up with ""Hey ho ha lallala, Idhu Oru Ponmalai Pozhuthu"", an ode to the evening. The song, set in ‘kedaram’ raga, talks about a young man’s dream.

So impressed was Ilaiyaraaja with his cultural wavelength and the urge to change the language of Tamil film music , that he asked Bharathiraja to save the young man’s phone number. His partnership with the music maestro, however, lasted just six years, stopping with the Kamal Haasan-starrer ‘ Punnagai Mannan ’ (1986).

Vairamuthu continued his march with leading directors such as C V Sridhar, K Balachander, Mani Ratnam and Shankar and garnering along the way seven national awards and six TN state awards.

The secret of his success in an industry with expiry dates for almost everything, he says, is staying trendy. ""Whenever possible, I incorporated Tamil grammar. For example, ""Kannodu Kanbathellam"" in ‘Jeans’ had ‘Irattai Kilavi’ (double words) and ""Kalvare"" in ‘Raavanan’ included ‘Valimigum idangal valimigaa idangal’ (pertaining to the soft and hard consonants in Tamil). It was my intention to infuse grammar into romantic songs so that it can reach youngsters easily.""

Offered lead roles in movies like ""Kadhal Oviyum"" and ""Mann Vasanai"" by Bharathiraja, Vairamuthu turned them down, saying he wanted to stick to his passion of writing. Those who tried to make him take the political plunge, too, were gently asked to choose someone else.

After a long stay at the peak came the inevitable period of struggle before A R Rahman got him to come up with lyrical magic for ‘Roja’ (1992), now considered a cult classic. Vairamuthu’s genius has spread beyond his native land, with poet-lyricist Gulzar admitting at a function, ""We both are lyric writers. Vairamuthu writes better than me. With his enchanting words, he mesmerizes the film world. I cannot do that. I am scared to imagine what would happen to me if he starts to write in Hindi."" Javed Akthar, asked to write for the Hindi version of ‘Jeans’, told director Shankar, ""It is almost impossible to translate Vairamuthu’s thoughts into Hindi. His thoughts are at such a height.""

He is also the creator of what is regarded as the longest song in Tamil cinema — ""Satham Illatha Thanimai Ketean"" from Ajit-starrer ‘ Amarkalam ’ (1999). A few of its lines are on the walls of Senji Fort. Having played a major role in bringing Sangam literature, folk songs and modern poetry into film music, Vairamuthu in K Bhagyaraj’s ‘Chinna Veedu’ (1985) completed ‘Chittukkuruvi Vetkappadudhu Pettai Kuruvi Katru Tharudhu’ after four other lyricists failed.

He has taken everything in his stride — from being drawn into a controversy by quoting a book that called Andal a ‘Devadasi’ to being accused of sexual misconduct during the #MeToo movement — and chugged on, saying education and experience stood him in good stead. He is also secure in the knowledge that he is respected by friends like actor Suhasini and late actor Srividya who gifted him a book saying he was a man ahead of his times. ""My best friends are Rajinikanth, A V M Saravanan and Bharathiraja,"" says Vairamuthu. ""They are my go-to people. Otherwise I spend my time reading.""

Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy welcomed Dokka to the party when he met the CM along with education minister Adimulapu Suresh and senior leader Ambati Rambabu.

Dokka told the media that he had decided to extend his support to the chief minister in his “courageous” efforts to uplift Dalits, minorities and weaker sections and claimed he had thought of joining YSRC before the 2014 elections but it took five years for him to finally take the plunge.

Although Dokka has been keeping away from TDP’s affairs for the past several weeks, his decision to snap ties was a big jolt to the party particularly at the time of elections to local bodies. Dokka, a senior Dalit leader, has considerable following in several constituencies in the district.

Earlier in the day, Dokka, in a letter to TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu, said he had decided to resign from his primary membership in the party as he was not on the same page as the party leadership on many issues.

The former minister had in fact sent his resignation letter to Naidu when the council took up controversial bills of decentralization of capital city and the CRDA repeal.

He said the party had fielded him from Prattipadu assembly constituency in 2019 elections against his wishes. He said he wanted to contest from Tadikonda segment which he represented twice in the past but was allocated Prattipadu in the eleventh hour.

He said he had contested the as a disciplined soldier of the party despite knowing that it was going to be a losing battle. “I got information during the last assembly session that there was no fine balance between the legislative assembly and council resulting in a chaotic council session. It is not a desired development for a healthy democracy and hence I decided to keep away from such chaotic sessions,” explained Dokka.

He said that he was inclined towards YSRC even before the start of the session but did not consult any of the YSRC leaders. He said he came into politics only to serve the public and the party was only a forum to serve the public cause. He said he had proved this during his stint in Congress and TDP. He condemned the campaign unleashed against him by certain groups saying he never worked for his “selfish ends”.

Shukla said that he had visited a city-based famous temple with a Supreme Court judge and they found the place in total chaos. Shukla has instructed his deputies to conduct surprise visits to temples in their respective jurisdictions, issue necessary instructions to trustees and report back.

The charity commissioner has also requested all district collectors and municipal commissioners to see that desired level of cleanliness and order is maintained, and action should be taken against the trustees who make a default. He has also warned, “This is a serious issue and on basis of personal experience, the trustees of religious places are being warned that they should stop playing with sentiments of devotees or they would be removed from their posts.”

The charity commissioner has issued strict instructions for all including trustees not to indulge in re-sale of devotional offerings because it hurts sentiments of devotees.

In his instructions to deputy charity commissioners and request to collectors and municipal commissioners, Shukla cited his visit to a local temple where he accompanied a sitting Supreme Court judge during last weekend. He said that the judge was unhappy over the chaotic condition in and around the temple in the middle of the city and instructed him to act promptly.

193,['10/03/2020'],Sri Lankan migrants find a new home in Andhra Pradesh,"Chennai: Sri Lankan citizens looking for jobs in India are choosing Andhra Pradesh over Tamil Nadu, shows data released by Union labour minister Santhosh Gangwar in the Rajya Sabha last week on foreigners entering the country on employment visa. At least 551 Sri Lankan citizens registered in Andhra Pradesh compared to 221 in Tamil Nadu in the past three years.

Sri Lanka has expertise in the garments sector and many skilled workers have migrated to India on employment visa. ""In Visakhapatnam, there are garment factories where Sri Lankans are working, after getting an employment visa,"" said Sri Lankan deputy high commissioner in Chennai V Krishnamoorthy. He said Tamil Nadu too offers opportunities in the garment industry.

At least 1,291 Sri Lankans with an employment visa have entered India in the past three years. Of this, 772 are in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. ""The numbers are of Sri Lankan citizens, who are employed in white collar jobs,"" said Krishnamoorthy.

Apart from the garment industry, people from the island nation are also employed in the information technology industry, said the Sri Lankan official. Foreign affairs expert P S Suryanarayana said most of the Sri Lankans on employment visa in India would have been recruited by agencies in the island nation. ""Based on the demand from Indian companies, the recruitment agencies select people to be employed in India. Employment visa is given only if there is a need in India,"" said Suryanarayanan.

""The applicant for employment visa must be a skilled and qualified professional or person who is being appointed by a company, organisation, industry, or undertaking in India on contract or employment basis in positions such as technical expert, senior executive or managerial level,"" reads the notification on the website of the Indian High Commission to Sri Lanka. According to the website, employment visa is not granted for jobs for which large numbers of qualified Indians are available.

Tamil Nadu has also seen 183 Chinese entering the state. But compared to Maharashtra, Haryana or Karnataka, the number of foreigners registering to stay in Tamil Nadu is less. ""The Government of India is not implementing any specific scheme regulating migrating workers from neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh and Nepal,"" said the minister. There are also three Bangladeshis, two people from the Maldives and one from Myanmar who are working in Tamil Nadu on employment visa.

Ramachandra Rao wrote the letter on Monday requesting them to ensure that the promises made to the residuary state of AP are honoured as they were made on the floor of the two Houses of Parliament. He said that the central government had released only Rs 7,545 crore as financial assistance to AP in the last six years, apart from reimbursement of Rs 8,615 crore for Polavaram Project.

Stating that the central government is obligated to give 30% additional funds to the state under various centrally-sponsored schemes, he regretted that the government had tied-up this central schemes share to the repayment of externally-aided projects (EAP). By linking this 30% share with EAP, the central government had betrayed the state as repayment of EAP has a few years of moratorium. “When there is no need for repayment of the EAP loans for some years, what is that the Central government will pay the state,” he asked.

He asked the central government to increase its share to 90 per cent in all the centrally-sponsored schemes to the state, as promised by the government in Parliament at the time of bifurcation in 2014.

195,['10/03/2020'],Alert watchmen put out fire at Srirangam temple,"The fire was doused before spreading further, it exposed the vulnerability of the temple to fire accidents.

TRICHY: Watchmen at Srirangam Arulmigu Ranganathaswamy temple put out a minor fire that broke out at the prasada stall at Garuda Mandapam during the early hours of Monday. Though the fire was doused before spreading further, it exposed the vulnerability of the temple to fire accidents.

Sources said that around 3.30 am, six watchmen appointed by the HR&CE department who were on duty at the corridors noticed smoke emanating from the prasada stall. The watchmen and temple workers doused the fire using fire extinguishers and water immediately. The prasada stall was leased to private parties. Wooden furniture and edible items worth lakhs of rupees were gutted.

The temple workers did not immediately alert the local fire service station at Srirangam as it would take time for them to reach the spot. Instead, the workers managed to douse the flames by themselves. The gamble could have been costly if the fire had spread to the vehicle shed at Garuda Mandapam adjacent to the prasada stall where the procession vehicles of the deity Lord Namperumal are stationed. The timely efforts of temple workers prevented further loss. Electrical short-circuit is suspected to be the cause of the fire, temple officials said.

The incident happened two years after the major fire at the Veera Vasantharayar Mandapam of Madurai Meenakshi Amman temple has shaken the Srirangam residents. The fire has baffled the devotees as well as the management as several rounds of safety audits had been carried out by the Tamil Nadu police (security) at the temple.

""Electrical wiring has to be checked frequently. The fire might be minor, but the incident at the worshipping place has saddened us,"" T Santhanakrishnan, a resident of Srirangam, said. After the fire accident at Madurai temple on February 2, 2018, the HR&CE department at the Srirangam temple said that adequate fire extinguishers were positioned at the spots as suggested in the safety audit. ""Srirangam police were alerted, and an inquiry will be conducted by the temple management to ascertain the cause of the fire accident. There was no damage to the structures,"" an HR&CE source said.

196,['10/03/2020'],‘Can’t file for divorce and also demand restitution of conjugal rights’,"Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court has quashed a Bhuj family court’s order to a woman living in London to return to India and fulfil her matrimonial duties.

The HC accepted the woman’s appeal against the Bhuj court’s order on the husband’s request for restitution of conjugal rights under provisions of Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The HC first considered that merely because the woman left India due to harassment and chose to live in UK with her daughter does not establish that she has withdrawn from her husband’s society.

Moreover, the HC also considered the husband’s behaviour. He obtained the family court’s order in May 2019 that the wife should return to India and live with her husband. He waited for her return, but when she did not, the husband filed for divorce in a UK court in January 2020. The HC said that the husband cannot seek divorce on one hand and compel his wife to come to him and fulfil her matrimonial duties on the other hand.

The couple belongs to Madhapar town near Bhuj. They got married in 2009. After a brief stay in India, the woman shifted to London and gave birth to a daughter, who at present studies in a school in Kingsbury area in UK. The husband also joined her in London for some time, but returned India following acrimonious marital relationship.

The wife filed a complaint in Bhuj court accusing the husband and in-laws of domestic violence in 2015. She also filed for divorce in Bhuj in 2016, but withdrew her application in 2017. The husband, on the other hand, approached the court for restitution of conjugal rights accusing the woman of wilful desertion.

The Bhuj court accepted the husband’s argument that the woman should not live in London and join her husband in Bhuj, who is not in a financial condition to live with his wife in UK. The HC, however, found the family court’s order without any proper basis and quashed it, said the woman’s advocate Brijesh Trivedi.

197,['10/03/2020'],City drenched in Holi colours,"Meerut: As the city prepares for Holi, the health department and police are on their toes to ensure a safe and peaceful festival of colours.

Amid swine flu and coronavirus scare, the health department has issued an advisory for city residents, asking them to avoid large gatherings and applying colours on one another in order to avoid contracting any kind of infection. Swine flu spreads by touch.

On its part, the police department has divided the city into nine zones and 31 sectors to keep a check on any unlawful activity here, especially in the context of the recent protests over the Citizenship Amendment Bill that turned violent in some parts of west UP.

Dr Raj Kumar, Meerut chief medical officer, said, “In the backdrop of the coronavirus and swine flu scare, it is only safe to avoid playing with colours this Holi. One shouldn’t use cold water to play Holi, as that might lead to flu. Moreover, contact of any kind should be avoided as it will increase the risk of catching an infection.”

In fact, many functions related to Holi have been cancelled in the city.

Meanwhile, security in the city was stepped up to ensure that no law and order situation occurs in Meerut.

Ajay Sahni, Meerut SSP, said, “The city has been divided into 31 sectors, and the symbolic Holika was burnt at 1,421 spots. Companies of Provincial Armed Constabulary and Rapid Action Force have been deployed at sensitive places in the city.”

Police have decided to set up barriers at various crossings, including in Jagriti Vihar, Hapur road, Kankerkhera and Garh road amomg others.

198,['10/03/2020'],‘A sense of belonging as ancestors are buried here’,"Meerut: Rupert Michael Blaquiere Talbot, 77, carries with him a history of 200 years, including that of his maternal great grandfather, George Augustus Webbe, a landlord farmer in Baghpat who was killed by the sepoys during the 1857 Revolt.

Talbot turned nostalgic after finding remains of the works his family had done in Baraut, including a small church which was earlier a community hall built by his ancestors before they bid goodbye to India in 1963. The Webbes stayed in Baraut for more than 115 years.

Born in Kent, England, in 1943, Talbot came back to India while working as a water engineer with UNICEF in 1967. He is instrumental in developing the current model of handpumps often seen in rural areas. He married Kolkata’s Rina Bhattacharya in 1980 and they have a son who is an economist with World Bank.

Talbot says, “History is full of bloodshed but we must move on. I have personal affinity to India. The fact that my ancestors are buried in this land gives me a great sense of belongingness to India.”

Talbot reminisces, “George Augustus Webbe worked with the East India Company at the Commissariat. Sometime in 1848, he bought agricultural land in Baraut (now in Baghpat) and built a house called ‘The Manor’. He was killed sometime in June 1857 by local farmers but his wife and three children escaped. I heard from my elders that George Webbe was initially buried in Baraut. Later, his body was exhumed and moved to St. John’s Cemetery in Meerut, but we are not sure. One of the sons, Alexander Webbe, was 11 years old when his father was killed. He later became a banker and worked in Darjeeling. He is my grandmother's father.”

Though, Talbot is yet to locate George Webbe's grave in St John's Church cemetery in Meerut, he feels blessed to have discovered the ruins of ‘The Manor’ and some furniture his family once owned in Baraut apart from a broken stone plaque bearing the name of Isambard Webbe, the last of the family to be buried in India.

The story goes like this – the eldest son of George A Webbe, Augustus Philip Webbe, took over his father’s property in Baraut (and Sonthi village) and lived at ‘The Manor’ until his death in 1919. His son, Isambard Webbe, carried on the family legacy of cultivating wheat and mangoes till he died in 1963.

His wife, Alice, sold the property and returned to England, thereby ending the Webbe link with Baraut, which saw three generations from about 1848 to 1963.

But before leaving, Alice built a community hall in memory of her husband, next to The Manor in Baraut, which has now been converted into church and falls within the jurisdiction of Church of North India (CNI) Diocese of Delhi.

Having discovered some of his ancestors’ belongings like an almirah, a table, a broken plaque, the ruins of the family house, Talbot says, “I can go back with a lot of pictures of this treasure.”

In his search for his ancestors, Talbot was helped by Amit Rai Jain, a historian of Baraut. The latter’s cousin’s grandfather had brought the Talbot’s property from Alice Webbe.

“I received a mail from Rupert Talbot and spoke about his link to Baraut and I dug out all details including the church and suddenly, the history of 125 years came alive. Though the entire property had either been sold off or given in charity, the place still has embedded memories of the first Christian family of Baraut.” says Jain.

The year 2020 holds immense importance for the Talbots for it marks 200 years of their presence in India. Rupert Talbot has a copy of a document he procured from British archives. It states that his first ancestor arrived in India in 1820, exactly 200 years ago.

“My great great grandfather, Henry Christian Talbot (from father’s side) came to India in 1820 and joined the Bengal Regiment at the age of 15. Later, his son, also a Henry, joined the Great Trigonmetrical Survey of India under the legendary George Everest after whom Mount Everest is named,” sums up the 77-year-old Talbot who gives a long look at the lone hand pump in the cemetery before leaving.

199,['10/03/2020'],Coworking set to be the buzzword in Kochi,"A coworking space was developed on MG Road Metro Station in Kochi

Kochi: On the fifth floor of MG Road Metro Station in Kochi, a freshly developed coworking space would welcome its first clients this month. The only luxury around is a glass wall on one side that gives a ringside view of the city. The furnishing is sparse. A large S shaped work station in the centre, with potted plants on the side, and narrow work tables that line the walls that can seat 40 pax (occupants).

“One can now commute to work and leave without touching the city. Hartals and strikes won’t impact your work as everything is right here inside the station, including restaurants and a bank,” said Francis Mukkanikal, CEO of Fortune , a budget coworking space.

Francis had launched an air-conditioned bed space facility called Peter’s Inn last year at the station with a capacity of 150 pax last year and the business has picked up. He has now leased 5,000 sq ft space at Kaloor Metro station, where a 250-pax facility would open in four to five months.

Francis has also worked out a combo scheme in which customers can get bed space accommodation for Rs 13,000 per month at Peter’s Inn along with workspace. “If someone is a frequent traveller and does not find it economical to hire a separate accommodation, they can opt for it,” he said.

At SRM Road, not far away from Townhall Metro Station, Innerspace, a 100 pax coworking space that opened on January 24 had close to 50% of its capacity filled within a month. “We started occupancy from February 2 and have clients who are into IT, tourism and branding. There are three startups and one major company G10X, based in Singapore, which has taken up 44 seats,” said Niyas Muhammed, general manager, Innerspace Coworking .

The city had several business centres and managed office spaces before but coworking as a concept never took off here as seen in metros such as Bengaluru, Mumbai and Gurgaon.

“When we opened in 2017, there were only business centres here,” said Dileep Ibrahim, director, operations of InQ Innovations, an Australian company which provides coworking space along with incubation facilities for startups. InQ opened in Sydney Startup Hub and Kochi simultaneously in 2017, providing a collaborative work environment for professionals, entrepreneurs and innovators. “We opened in Bengaluru this year and are planning to launch in Mumbai shortly,” said Ibrahim. InQ has also plans to expand their presence in the city.

“Right now we have 180 seats, and there is another 200, 300 seats that we can add,” said Ibrahim. “In a typical business centre if an office-goer might just go to his cubicle, and pack up and go back in the evening to my office, I will just go to my office, evening I will pack up and go. Here we have a collaborative environment, with a lot of activities, seminars, upskilling programmes, expert talks, it is a lively environment, that is what we provide,” he said.

One of the biggest players in the segment is Incuspaze , a multi-city premium chain of cowork spaces, which began Kochi operations in November 2019 with a 20,000 sq ft facility at Oberon Mall in Kochi. The centre is now 85% occupied. “We are planning two facilities in Kochi, including one on Airport-Seaport Road,” said Mohit Sreevastava, CEO, Incuspaze.

Work on a similar Incuspaze facility in Thiruvananthapuram has already started. Mohit feels that Kochi’s ecosystem is now ripe for the shift and will see a surge in adoption this year.

“Coworking and coliving are concepts that are disrupting the real estate sector. It’s real estate 2.0 and players in real-estate segment need to look at this seriously,” said Robin Alex Panicker, venture partner, Unicorn India Ventures.

The best part of coworking deal is that the person who sits in the next table could be your potential customer. “Freelancers and graphic designers can immensely benefit from the environment based on share economy,” said Panicker, whose company works out of coworking spaces in Bengaluru and Thiruvananthapuram.

BIJNOR: On her return from a weekly market, the exhausted wife of a 32-year-old Bijnor man was amused to see him home early, cooking something for the dinner. But, an otherwise careful look shook her to the core, and she felt nauseatic. There was a human hand and fingers on the platter.

The man, a drunkard, had discreetly brought the human flesh in a polybag from a nearby crematorium, and was frying it on a pan when his wife entered. And she ran for her life, alerting the neighbours and police. The man, Sanjay, was locked in his home in Bijnor’s Tikkopur village till police came.

In the initial probe, police found that the man, who is a drunkard, had even attacked his father a few days ago. “He has apparently picked up the hand from a crematorium. A probe has been set up in the matter,” a police officer said.

Station house officer (SHO) RC Sharma said, “We visited the house of the man and found the human flesh. Police have detained the accused. Prima facie, he had brought it from the bank of Ganga where bodies are cremated.”

Meanwhile, Sanjay’s wife was too afraid to return home.

Experts in temple maintenance said that the blackened parts of the granite mandapam have to be refurbished at the earliest to prevent permanent damage.

The edible items including ghee at the prasada stall had aggravated the fire, temple sources said. The ceiling and some portion of pillars of the 20-foot tall structure have turned black. As there were drinking water taps close to the accident site, the temple staff could put out the fire immediately. ""If the granite ceiling was charred due to the burning of edible items, the sugar molecules deposited on it can be cleaned. Bringing the blackened structure back to its original state is possible, but the refurbishment work has to be commenced at the earliest,"" an official source in ASI said. Temple workers on Monday cleaned the pillars and floor after the incident.

While the H-&CE managed temple had restrictions in the past for lighting lamps at designated spots, local people said that such restrictions were only imposed on devotees. ""Hydrant facility has to be installed in the temple as fire extinguishing vehicles cannot pass through the narrow towers. Though the temple management failed to alert us, we will take stock of the situation to suggest safety requirements,"" an official with the fire service department said.

203,['10/03/2020'],"Feeling sidelined, Scindia was at loggerheads with Kamal Nath govt","BHOPAL: Ever since the Congress government was formed in Madhya Pradesh in December 2018, it was clear that Jyotiraditya Scindia was far from happy with things. He headed the campaign committee in the 2018 assembly polls and clearly wanted to be chief minister as the Congress high command had not named a CM candidate during campaigning.

Scindia felt he had a chance against Kamal Nath (who was then PCC chief), given his youthful energy and proximity with then Congress president Rahul Gandhi. Rahul went for experience and chose Kamal Nath as leader of Congress legislative party (CLP). Scindia accepted this, but set his eyes on the post of PCC chief, which Nath wanted to quit on becoming CM.

After the party’s drubbing in the April 2014 Lok Sabha election, Nath again offered to resign but Scindia was sent to Maharashtra as screening committee chairman before the assembly election in that state. Since then, Scindia resolved to assert himself in MP politics lest he be sidelined completely by rival factions in Congress.

MP political crisis: Live updates

Scindia set rumour mills spinning by meeting former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan in January 2019, then removing all references to the posts he holds in Congress from his Twitter profile, and supporting the abrogation of Article 370.

The power equations have simply not settled after Kamal Nath was made CM. Scindia kept feeling left out and his annoyance increased as there was no decision on PCC, either. In the previous Lok Sabha, he was very often at Rahul Gandhi’s elbow, regularly sitting next to him. The compromise of making Nath the CM left Scindia determined that he would keep pressing for his “dues”.

From the beginning, ministers and MLAs from his camp in the Kamal Nath government started mounting pressure on the CM and party high command to nominate him as PCC chief — a demand resisted till now by the chief minister and senior party leader Digvijaya Singh. On one occasion, ministers and MLAs of Scindia camp had assembled at Delhi to demand that Scindia be named PCC chief. They also started hinting that they were being neglected and that their leader was not being given the respect he deserves as one of main architects of Congress win in MP.

Scindia has often spoken out against the state government. He criticised the “incomplete” agri loan waiver promise, the state’s survey of crop loss after floods, and recently threatened to hit the streets if promises made in party’s “Vachan Patra” were not made.

The party gave Scindia a long rope. Every time, he criticised the government, the official response would be, ‘Yes, we will look into his concern’. But when Scindia warned that he would hit the streets if the manifesto promise to regularize services of guest teachers wasn’t fulfilled, CM Nath retorted: “Them, let him.” It was a clear indication that they were on a collision course.

But, the latest trigger seems to be the party’s first choice for nomination to Rajya Sabha. Scindia was apparently apprehensive that Digvijaya Singh would be the party’s first choice for the ‘safe seat’ and his election to Rajya Sabha would, then, depend upon party garnering two extra votes. Although Congress has the support of seven alliance legislators, Scindia decided to come out in the open.

The notice was issued in the form of red cards and hence termed as ‘red card notice’ that warns the recipients of strict action, in case of any trouble in their area.

DIG Ravinder Gaur is also camping in the city, as a precautionary measure, to supervise security preparations in the wake of large scale violence that the district witnessed during anti-CAA protests on December 20.

On Tuesday, colour processions are expected to be taken out in different pockets of the district. And Bijnor district is ‘sensitive area’ with mainly mix population.

Therefore, police are putting all preparations in place to ensure the festival passes off peacefully. On Monday, Bijnor superintendent of police, Sanjeev Tyagi, said, “We served red cards to 3,650 troublemakers with past criminal records or they are suspected because of their illegal activities. Police will maintain a strict vigil so that they don’t create any trouble.”

“A ‘warning’ mentioned on the red card states that the recipient will be sent to jail if any clash erupts. Besides, there are six vulnerable towns and 46 villages in the district where additional forces will be deployed. Drones will be flown in sensitive areas, if needed,” Tyagi added.

Meanwhile, at least 1,700 red cards were served to suspected troublemakers in Amroha district. Amroha superintendent of police, Vipin Tada, said, “We have served red cards to 1,700 trouble-makers. We have stated over 25 sections of IPC in the card. The imprisonment awarded for crimes are also stated. Around 40 spots are vulnerable in Amroha. Additional police have been deployed in mix-populated areas to maintain peace.”

AHMEDABAD: On Monday, a young doctor became the latest victim of AMC’s apathy towards repair of roads. Dr Ramesh Sisara, 38, was riding on his scooter on Naroda road on Monday morning when near Memco he suddenly came upon a pothole and swerved to the left to avoid it.

A Gujarat State Regional Transport Corporation (GSRTC) bus, which was trying to overtake Mehta from his left, hit him causing serious injuries. Sisara, a resident of Thakkarbapanagar , was taken to Civil Hospital, Asarwa, where he died during treatment. The deceased worked as a medical officer at UN Mehta hospital in Civil Hospital campus.

Another doctor at the UN Mehta hospital, and the deceased’s colleagues blamed Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) for not repairing bad roads and increasing risks of fatal accidents.

“The doctor’s life was lost due to sheer negligence of AMC officials. We pay taxes for roads but AMC authorities don’t care to provide us good motorable roads,” said the doctor.

Inspector T R Rathwa of E division traffic police, who is investigating officer of the case, said Mehta was a resident of Thakkarbapanagar. He had suffered serious injuries to his skull and shoulder even though he had been wearing a helmet.

E division traffic police registered a complaint of negligent driving causing death against the driver of the ST bus, who fled after the accident.

Police have sent the body of the doctor for postmortem report and begun further investigation.

207,['10/03/2020'],Sluggish growth in auto industry hits transport dept’s revenue collection,"Vijayawada: The transport department, one of the major sources of revenue, has failed to meet the revenue target for the financial year 2019-2020. This comes in the wake of the department already struggling to surpass the previous fiscal’s revenue target resultant of the slowdown in the automobile industry.

Officials in the department said the the revenue comes from life taxes, quarterly taxes, registration fee and compounding fines among others. Among all the taxes that bring in revenue to the department’s coffer, the life tax contributes around 50% to 60%.

In 2018-19 fiscal, the transport department collected Rs 3,204 crore in revenue. It has earned Rs 3,003 crore in the current fiscal till February. Officials attributed the drop to lack of growth in the vehicular density. “We could not collect enough life taxes due to lack of growth in the number of vehicles,” they added.

Speaking to TOI, additional transport commissioner P Srinivas said revenue collection was not impressive in the first nine months of the current fiscal year and there has been little progress in the past two months. Despite the exception for auto-rickshaws, tractors and few other vehicles, we have managed to collect a revenue of Rs 3,003 crore in the current fiscal year from April to February, against Rs 3,001 crore in the corresponding period of the last fiscal.

“The apex court has set the deadline for registration of Bharat Stage IV (BS-IV) vehicles as March 31, 2020 and from April 1 only BS VI category vehicles will be allowed for registration. Since some of the automobile dealers are giving good discounts to clear their BS-IV inventory, we are expecting more number of vehicle registration across the state from March 10 and we will either meet or cross the last year revenue collection of Rs 3,204 crore by the end of the current fiscal,” Srinivas added.

A senior officer with the department, on condition of anonymity, said that every year the government increases the revenue target by 15%. The RTA will struggle to meet its revenue targets in the coming days if the growth in the automobile industry continue to be sluggish,” he added.

208,['10/03/2020'],Matri Sadan head to sit on hunger strike for clean Ganga from today,"yyyyyyyyyyyyyy

Dehradun: Swami Shivanand Saraswati, the head of Matri Sadan , has announced to sit on a fast-unto-death from Holi onwards for the cause of ‘Clean Ganga’.

The 73-year-old seer who is a post-graduate from Kolkata’s Jadavpur University and was a teacher before taking up ‘sanyas’, said, “I have no demands from the government. I will sit for meditation from Tuesday onwards with a hope that all demands of late professor GD Agrawal are met and Sadhvi Padmavti and Brahamachari Aatmabodhanand get more power in their fight.”

Matri Sadan seers have been demanding a ban on mining activities in and around Ganga and a ban on the construction of four hydropower projects — Phatabhyum, Singoli Bhatwari, Bisnungot Pipalkoti and Tapovan. “I cannot see my disciples being left to be killed by the administration,” added Saraswati.

To recall, two Matri Sadan seers — Sadhvi Padmavati and Brahmachari Atmabodhanand — had been sitting on fast-unto-death for the same cause. Later, the two seers were admitted to AIIMS in New Delhi. While Padmavati continues to undergo treatment at AIIMS, Aatmbodhanand had again started his hunger strike after being discharged from the facility. He drank water after 40 days of protest on Monday. Notably, three Matri Sadan seers — Nigamanand Saraswati, Gokulanand Saraswati, and GD Agrawal — have lost their life fighting for the cause of Ganga.

209,['10/03/2020'],"Back home, Surendra Singh Shera says he’d like to be home minister","BHOPAL: Finance minister Tarun Bhanot on Monday morning addressed a joint press conference with independent MLA Surendra Singh Shera , who had gone incommunicado on Thursday and returned from Bengaluru on Saturday. Bhanot said chief minister Kamal Nath is likely to reshuffle and expand the cabinet after Holi and Shera said BJP won’t succeed in “whatever it is trying”.

However, after the fresh political turmoil with 17 MLAs and ministers of the Scindia faction in Bengaluru, the cabinet expansion now seems a distant possibility.

During the press meet, Bhanot may not have had information that six of his cabinet colleagues had flown south, but he did seem to have information on the state BJP leadership meeting in New Delhi.

“Where are Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Gopal Bhargava , Narottam Mishra, Kailash Vijayvargiya and VD Sharma? Where have they gone for pilgrimage, vacation or medical treatment?” Bhanot asked when told that BJP was denying any involvement in the disappearance of Congress and alliance MLAs last week.

The BJP leaders were, meanwhile, holding meetings at the residence of Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar in New Delhi.

Bhanot said: “Our MLAs have specifically said how they were offered Rs 35 crore to switch loyalties. This allegation of offering money was not made by Digvijaya Singh. It was first made by our MLAs who were approached. BJP is losing ground and that is the reason behind the ongoing political turmoil.”

Shera said he has known chief minister Kamal Nath for 25 years. “BJP will not succeed at what it is trying,” the independent MLA from Burhanpur said. “Kamal Nath’s personality is very strong. You will see many BJP MLAs will join Congress,” he said, adding that after his return from Bengaluru, CM Nath assured him a ministerial berth.

Asked which portfolio he wants, Shera said, “Let the chief minister decide. But I would prefer the home department because I want to work towards a people-friendly police.”

Bhanot added that the Kamal Nath government’s second budget to be presented on March 18 will be a welfare budget and not put any extra burden on the common man.

210,['10/03/2020'],Consumer Forum jails three builders for contempt,"Nagpur: Terming three builders “white collared criminals”, the Additional District Dispute Consumer Redressal Forum here awarded three years simple imprisonment to them along with a fine of Rs 45,000 for deliberately not complying with its earlier orders.

Censuring them for not returning the complainants money even after 14 years the judges Smita Chandekar and Avinash Prabhunestated the builders didn’t deserve any leniency and deterrent punishment was to avoid such fleecing of gullible customers.

Builders Nilesh, Rajesh and Chandrakant Patel through their firm Kalindi Infrastructure had taken Rs 9.5 lakh from complainants Rajiv and Rachana Mokashe for building a duplex house at Kamptee on May 22, 2006. They, however, failed to hand over possession of the house nor refunded the down payment for it.

The judges however told the builders they could escape jail if they returned Rs 9.5 lakh with 12% interest till date along with fine amount within a month.

While holding builders guilty under Section 27 of Consumer Protection Act, the forum observed it was their modus operandi of receiving down payment from customers and utilizing it for their own benefit. “Since 2006, the amount paid by the complainants to builders could have grown to over Rs 25 lakh. Their behaviour of not following forum’s orders is very objectionable and therefore they are liable for the punishment,” the judges ruled.

After failure of builder to give possession of duplex for over a decade, Mokashe couple knocked the forum’s doors for refund of their money. On February 6, 2017, the forum directed Patels to either give possession of duplex to the complainants or pay Rs 9.5 lakh with 12% interest within a month. They were also slapped with Rs 15,000 fine for physical and mental harassment of complainants along with litigation cost.

Since the order was ex-parte, as Patels didn’t reply to notice nor appeared before the forum, Mokashes sent the order by registered post along with a court’s notice. However, both were returned to as “unclaimed”. The Mokashe couple once again knocked forum’s doors for contempt of its orders and subsequently summons was issued on February 12, 2018, against Patels.

All three builders then appeared before the judges on August 14, 2018, and clarified they wouldn’t be able to give the house but were ready for returning entire amount with 12% interest in two months. However, when they failed to refund the amount even after 16 months, the forum awarded jail term and slapped new penalty of Rs 45,000.

What forum said:

* Deterrent punishment to builders is must to avoid fleecing of customers

* Builders’ modus operandi is to receive payment from customers & utilize it for own benefit

* Their deliberately not following forum’s orders is very objectionable

* Must pay Rs 45,000 fine, including Rs 30,000 cost & Rs 15,000 towards litigation expenses

* To escape jail term, they should return Rs 9.5 lakh with 12% interest till date along with fine

211,['10/03/2020'],CM says SAD claims on jobs misleading,"Chandigarh: Asking SAD to check its facts, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Monday said the very premise of their criticism of his government’s employment generation programme was based on flawed data.

He said the Economic Survey released by the Centre stated that the source of data provided on unemployment was PLFS (Periodic Labour Force Survey) 2017-18 conducted by Labour Bureau, Government of India. He said the reference period was July 2017 to June 2018, which was barely a year since his government had inherited the mess created by the SAD-BJP government.

Amarinder said the survey had a small sample size of 6,497 and 6,877 persons from rural and urban areas, respectively, which translated into a total sample size of just 13,374 persons in a population of 2.27 crore. Further, he said, for youth in the age group of 15-29 years, the sample size was 1,870 and 1,961 persons for rural and urban areas, respectively, which meant a total sample size of mere 3,831, as against the state’s total youth population of 80.58 lakh in this age group.

SAD, he said, was making a fool of itself with repetitive attempts to mislead people with half-baked lies. The CM said SAD had not bothered to understand or analyse information in the Economic Survey. He said the sample size in the survey was ridiculously small. He said it was evident that SAD was either too dumb to understand the implications of this data or was deliberately trying to mislead people.

215,['10/03/2020'],Punjab: Parliamentary panel flags poor execution of post-matric scholarship scheme,"Representative Image

CHANDIGARH: The parliamentary standing committee on social justice and empowerment of Union social justice and empowerment ministry has expressed displeasure over Punjab officials facing corruption charges in dispersal of the post-matric scholarship to students belonging to Schedule Caste (SC) community.

In a report tabled in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on March 3, the committee observed that it can “perceive the helpless condition” of poor students who are deprived of scholarships .

Punjab and Bihar are the two states where the scheme has been marred by poor implementation. Punjab has not put forth demand for funds due to poor utilisation of allocated funds as it could not submit utilisation certificates. The Union ministry has released funds for 2019-20 to all the states/UTs which have submitted proposals along with utilisation certificates.

Delay in release of post-matric scholarship by the Punjab government has become a major political issue. The government faced the heat over the issue with the opposition MLAs holding protests and staging walkouts in the recently-concluded budget session.

About three lakh students belonging to the SC category in the state are affected due to the non-payment of post-matric scholarships by the government. Many educational institutes have withheld degrees of students due to non-payment of scholarship. Non-disbursal of funds has also taken a toll on about 1,600 colleges as they have not been able to pay salary to staff.

As per the report, due to ongoing special audit in Punjab, complete proposals are still awaited. Not amused with the state of affairs, the committee, headed by BJP MP Rama Devi, impressed upon the ministry to pursue the Punjab government to complete the formalities and release the scholarships to the beneficiaries in time and send the complete proposals in time.

For ensuring that beneficiaries are not deprived of scholarships and fast and effective implementation of the scheme, the central government is planning to transfer the scholarships directly into the accounts of the beneficiaries.

The committee has been informed by the ministry that a proposal for transferring funds directly into the bank accounts of the students under direct benefit transfer (DBT) is awaiting approval of the cabinet. The committee directed the ministry to ensure implementation of the proposal at the earliest in the interest of the beneficiaries.

217,['10/03/2020'],NSUI defeats ABVP in Gujarat University student elections,"The student senate elections, which are to be held annually, were last conducted four years ago

AHMEDABAD: In a clean victory, the Congress’ student wing National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) won six of eight seats in the senate in the Gujarat University Students’ Union elections.

The elections, held after more than four years, saw the BJP-backed Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) win two seats.

“The students of Gujarat University have ensured that the unity and democratic values of India are protected as they threw aside the ABVP in the student elections,” said NSUI spokesman Parthivraj Kathwadia. The student senate body has 10 members, two of which were won uncontested. Elections for the eight seats were held on March 8 and the results were declared on Monday.

NSUI then kept its winning streak going in the student welfare board elections, which were held simultaneously. Of the 14 student welfare board seats whose results were declared on Monday, NSUI won 9 and ABVP won 5.

“The loss in GU elections will weigh heavy on the BJP and some GU authorities will likely face the music,” said a BJP source.

The seats won by NSUI include Faculty of Arts (undergraduate), Faculty of Science (undergraduate), Faculty of Arts (post-graduate), Faculty of Commerce (post-graduate), Faculty of Education (undergraduate + post-graduate combine). The sixth seat Faculty of Law (undergraduate + post-graduate combine), was won by NSUI candidate Harshadityasinh Parmar, the son of Congress spokesman Jayrajsinh Parmar.

The student senate elections, to be held annually, were last held four years ago while the polls for the student welfare board are held every three years.

ABVP spokesman Samarth Bhatt claimed that in the 2016 senate elections, they had won six seats while the NSUI won four. “This time we have won four seats as the two uncontested seats were won by our candidates,” Bhatt claimed. “The government may distract the common man by making false promises, but the students are educated and know what is good or bad for them. The government has been avoiding elections for four years because were afraid of losing,” Kathwadia said.

While the world celebrated International Women’s Day on March 8, five women were among the 22 winners on Sunday. Four women were elected to the welfare board and one woman won a senate seat.

There have been many petitions filed in courts challenging the electoral process for the senate and board of student welfare. At a GU syndicate meeting in February last year, it was announced that the student senate election would be held after October 31. This did not happen till members of NSUI began protests, pressing their demands for elections. ABVP also began similar protests later.On January 4, the academic and executive council meeting decided to hold elections soon. The varsity asked its 328 affiliated colleges to submit the voters list by January 23. On March 8, 2,218 voters exercised their votes out of the total 3,279 voters Some of the senior heavyweight political leaders, both in the BJP and the Congress, have been part of the GU student senate in their younger days where they were groomed for a bigger role.

For example, the old structure had four chimneys but now it seems that only two chimneys are being constructed. In order to ensure that the building retains its original design, old photographs of the building must be consulted.” Bhardwaj added that he has written to Royal Geographical Society in United Kingdom and requested for old photographs of this historic building.

Ganesh Saili, another veteran author and historian of the town, added, “The house of Sir George Everest in Park Estate is of great historical importance. I hope that it is restored in sync with what existed.”

Speaking to TOI, Arvind Kumar Shah , whose family had owned the property from 1943 to late 1960s, said, “It is great to know that this historic building is being restored to its original shape and size. While most of the things in the restoration plan seem fine but I feel that there is some need for some amendment.”

Shah, who was born in the building and had spent his early childhood here, says that the building had an old rainwater harvesting system wherein nearly 85,000 litres of rainwater was stored in an underground reservoir while the overflow went to a pond located in front of the building.

“I understand that they are building an amphitheatre at the place where the pond was located. I think that should be shifted elsewhere,” he added.

Meanwhile, tourism department officials have claimed that they have accessed the old photographs of the building and are restoring it as per its original design. “We have accessed all the records and old photographs of the building and the restoration work is being carried out as per the original layout of the building,” claimed RK Tiwari, additional director of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) programme in the tourism department.

To recall, the state tourism department is restoring the building with the support of ADB. The project has an outlay of Rs 23.71 crore and aims to develop the George Everest house as a heritage tourism site.

219,['10/03/2020'],Protest by unemployed teachers: 70 booked day after cane charge,"Patiala: Patiala police on Monday registered a case against 70 unemployed teachers for allegedly assaulting and obstructing police personnel. The action came a day after five unemployed teachers were injured and two jumped into the Bhakra canal after they were cane-charged by police while trying to march towards the house of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh during a protest to demand jobs.

The case has been filed at the Civil Lines police station for assault to deter public servant, voluntarily causes hurt, obstructing public servant and disobedience. Police have identified 20 of the 70 accused.

Those booked include injured Jarnail Singh, Manpreet Singh, Sukhdev, Sukhchain, and ETT-TET Pass Unemployed Teachers’ Union state president Deepak Kamboj. Police had come under severe criticism from opposition parties for use of force to disperse the protesters.

Condemning the case’s registration, Kamboj said first the state government used force against protesting teachers and had now registered a case against them to mount pressure. It would not demoralise protesting teachers and they would continue with the stir until their demands were met, he said.

Up in arms against Sunday’s police action, protesters continued the sit-in at Puda Ground, near Gurdwara Dukhniwaran, and Bhakra canal. They also blocked the Patiala-Bathinda road through the day.

The blockade was lifted after an assurance by the state government that principal secretary for education will meet them on March 12 to resolve issues. However, jobless teachers said they would continue the protest at Puda Ground. Patiala senior superintendent of police (SSP) Mandeep Singh Sidhu said it was the duty of personnel to ensure law and order and the protesters tried to create chaos near the residence of the CM on Sunday, following which police had to use force.

Shiromani Akali Dal MLA Harinder Pal Chandumajra said his party would hold a protest along with the teachers if the government failed to meet their demands.

Chandumajra, who joined the sit-in on Monday, said all partly MLAs would join the protest if the government failed to advertise more posts. The Congress government has backtracked from its promise of providing jobs to youngsters, he said. “Ghar Ghar Rozgar was a big lie by the CM. Qualified youth are being thrashed for demanding jobs,” he said.

220,['10/03/2020'],"Man allegedly stabbed to death by brother, motive not clear","Nagpur: A 27-year-old man was allegedly stabbed to death by his younger brother and three others in the early hours of Monday over an unspecified motive. According to sources, a couple of theories have come to fore.

The incident took place at the residence of the victim, Vickky Jaiswal, at Abumiya Nagar. Initially, the murder seems to have taken place over a drunken brawl between Vickky and his 24-year-old brother Shubham.

Vickky would often create ruckus at home under the influence of alcohol. He had even thrashed his mother Maya in presence of Shubham on many occasions. A couple of years ago, Vickky’s wife Rakshita had left with their four-and-half year old son due to the victim’s liquor addiction and violent behaviour.

Police initially said that Vickky brandished a knife to attack his mother when she objected to his drinking habits. The first line of probe indicates that Shubham, his friend Akshay and two others were sleeping on the terrace at that time. They came down after hearing a commotion in the house.

After seeing Vickky assaulting their mother, Shubham and others pounced upon him. When Vickky brandished a knife, Shubham wrenched it from him before stabbing him his elder brother, followed by others in turns, said cops.

In a twist, police have now learnt that on Sunday morning Vickky had gone to meet Rakshita’s place where he abused her and his sister-in-law. Rakshita narrated this incident to Akshay who was her neighbour in the past. Akshay called up Shubham and told him about his elder brother’s audacity.

It’s learnt, Akshay also told Shubham that he was coming to his place to teach Vickky a lesson. Vickky was resting in the house after having dinner when Akshay and his two other friends allegedly entered from backside and pinned down the victim before stabbing him repeatedly.

Wathoda police have taken Shubham in custody. Search operation has been launched to nab Akshay and two others.

221,['10/03/2020'],"Kumaon celebrates Baithaki Holi, a 500-year-old tradition, over months","Nainital: While the rest of the country is all set to play Holi on Tuesday, the celebrations in Kumaon started months ago. “Baithaki Holi” has been a tradition in hundreds of villages across the Kumaon region for years now. A term which literally translates to “sitting Holi”, “Baithaki Holi” involves women sitting in their verandahs and singing traditional songs.

“The celebrations start on the first Sunday of the ‘Poush’ month of the Hindu calendar, which falls between December and January. However, it is only after Vasant Panchami that the revelry gets more lively,” said Brij Mohan Joshi, a folk artist and Nainital-based photographer.

The songs performed to the music of harmoniums and dholaks on Baithaki Holi can be of various “ragas”, Joshi added. “Their themes range from ballads to general jokes and even flirtations. However, most of the songs tend to be devotional. Traditionally, a master sits in the centre and starts a song. The women sitting around him then take turns to sing it. While ‘bhakti’ remains the central theme, some songs may be in a lighter vein as well. The women follow it up with dances,” Joshi said.

Historians trace the origin of the “Baithaki Holi” to the courts of the 15th century Chand kings of Champawat district.

“The ‘Baithaki Holi’ literally means sitting Holi or simply traditional Kumaoni Holi. It’s being celebrated across Kumaon for over 500 years now. An integral part of the traditional Holi is the ‘cheer bandhan.’ Shreds of cloth are collected from each house in a village and draped around a cheer (a twig),” said Ajay Singh Rawat, Nainital-based historian and environmentalist.

“The cheer has to be protected. If stolen by residents of another village, the village that lost it cannot celebrate Baithaki Holi unless they manage to steal a cheer themselves,” Rawat added.

According to local residents, even though the age-old tradition of Baithaki Holi has somewhat diminished in the hills, the celebrations hardly lack enthusiasm or vigour.

“People of all ages and backgrounds come together to celebrate the festival,” said Sarita Devi, a resident of Almora, adding with a smile that her favourite part of the festival is to “get together with friends and share gossip.”

222,['10/03/2020'],"Coronavirus scare in Delhi: Chinese goods untouchable, electronics hub in Chandni Chowk reports 75% dip in sales","Bhagirath Place

NEW DELHI: Bhagirath Place in Chandni Chowk, the city’s go-to hub for electronic goods, is awash with Chinese products. But after imports from the novel coronavirus-hit country has dwindled since December last year, the sales have now been affected by the riots in northeast Delhi. As a result of the double whammy, traders are reporting drop in sales of more than 75%.

“Chaliya bhai, chaliye, corona aa gaya hai,” shouted a porter asking for space on the narrow, congested lanes, the black humour perhaps perfectly natural in a place that depends inordinately on Wuhan — the epicentre of the viral outbreak in China — for the electronics on the shelves. Masks are ubiquitous in the market today, obscuring the faces of most people from porters to sellers to buyers.

Sitting idle awaiting customers at his fairy lights shop, Praveen Kumar, 56, said from behind a mask that he hadn’t seen a slump like this even at the height of a hyper-nationalist campaign to boycott Chinese goods. “Fairy lights, lanterns, home lighting, fans, hot-water bottles and electronics — nothing is selling,” muttered Kumar, who mostly stocks Chinese products.

Roshan Kumar, at another shop, told of a similarly woeful time. “The Chinese products were attracting very few buyers, and then came the riots,” he said. Bharat Ahuja, who heads the Delhi Electrical Traders Association, said demand for electronic goods exists, but no one comes to Bhagirath Place due to both the virus and the riots. “If the trend continues for another month, we will face a crisis,” Ahuja said darkly.

In complete contrast, the neighbouring surgical equipment market near Raam Gali is overwhelmed by a mad rush for masks and hand sanitisers. Common surgical masks costing Rs 2 apiece are flying off the shelves even at Rs 30 per unit. N-95 masks, available for Rs 150 on Wednesday, was selling for Rs 250 on Thursday. And as a seller disclosed, “Dettol hand sanitiser is not available even at double its price.”

Many wished the central government put into place a regulatory mechanism. Ahuja recalled intervening with friends in the surgical market a few days ago to help some doctors. “A government hospital had exhausted its store of masks,” he explained.

Sanjay Bhargav, member of the Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, was quite critical of what was happening. Tagging different authorities, he tweeted that surgical and medicine sellers were cheating people and charging exorbitant rates for masks and sanitisers and requested both the state and central governments to step in, especially at Bhagirath Place.

223,['10/03/2020'],20 dists need to plant over 240cr saplings to achieve Maha green cover target,"Nagpur: After achieving the gigantic plantation target of over 50-crore in last five years, the forest department has prepared a road map to increase green cover by taking up another 50-crore plantations in the state, albeit with some tweaks in the earlier policy.

The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has christened the project as Vasantrao Naik Harit Maharashtra Abhiyan.

Though the new 50-crore plantation plan for next five years includes 22 crore by three wings of the forest department — territorial, social forestry and Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) — and 28 crore by non-forest agencies, this time the idea is to take up greening drive in 20 green cover deficit districts. Forest minister Sanjay Rathod has ratified the decision.

“Instead of implementing massive plantations in all districts like earlier, we plan to target those districts where green cover is below 16.5%. There are 20 such districts in the state identified in the Indian State of Forest Report (ISFR-2019). On an average, green cover in Maharashtra is 16.5%,” said Praveen Srivastava, principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) for production & management.

“Of the 36 districts in the state, if you exclude sub-urban Mumbai and Palghar in Thane, 20 districts have green cover below 16.5%, while 14 districts have 16.5% cover. So, idea is to bring green cover to 16.5% in all the districts by removing the deficit. If this is done, then average green cover in the state will be 20.5%,” said Srivastava, who is also coordinator for the new scheme.

As per the ISFR-2019 by Forest Survey of India (FSI), 20 districts having green cover below 16.5% (as per geographical area) are — Wardha (13.66), Satara (12.20), Pune (10.94), Jalgaon (9.75), Nanded (8.90), Nashik (6.93), Buldhana (6.12), Washim (6.06), Akola (6), Aurangabad (5.61), Dhule (4.19), Hingoli (2.28), Sangli (1.75), Ahmednagar (1.57), Beed (1.53), Osmanabad (0.66), Parbhani (0.65), Jalna (0.47), Solapur (0.33) and Latur (0.18).

Considering the above figures, there is a huge green cover deficit in Marathwada districts compared to the state average. The national green cover average is 24.5%. As per the National Forest Policy (NFP), forest cover should be 33%.

Srivastava says to remove the shortfall in the 20 districts, the state will need at least 240 crore saplings. “It is a demand-driven exercise and not based on any arithmetic calculations. This figure has been calculated after subtracting the saplings planted during the earlier 50-crore plantation drive. We have reduced the area of very dense forest (VDF), water bodies, shallow and steep slopes and encroachments,” the top official said.

A two-pronged strategy to achieve the goal includes taking up plantations in non-forest areas and boosting Green Army initiative which has 67 lakh members till now. “We have also held two preliminary meetings in Pune and Konkan divisions on February 13 and 14, and dialogue has been initiated with non-forest agencies to implement the scheme,” said Srivastava.

As per the road map prepared by the forest department, 14 districts are above state’s average 16.5% green cover. These include Gadchiroli (68.81%), Sindhudurg (54.31%), Ratnagiri (51.33%), Raigarh (41.10%), Gondia (37.04%), Chandrapur (35.43%), Mumbai suburban (31.36%), Thane (31.37%), Amravati (25.94%), Bhandara (24.44%), Kolhapur (23.24%), Nagpur (20.22%), Nandurbar (20.08%) and Yavatmal (19.20%).

After Dhindsa came to Jalandhar on Monday to attend the death anniversary of Babu Labh Singh, who was SAD president and died due to injuries sustained in an attack by Muslim League followers when he was trying to pacify a communal disturbance in Jalandhar on March 7, 1947. He died in a civil hospital, which was later named after him, on March 9, 1947.

Earlier in the day, Dhindsa attended a function at Babu Labh Singh Nursing College, associated with local civil hospital, and then went to Gurdwara Babu Labh Singh at Rainak Bazaar, the spot where the late leader was attacked. Dhindsa, accompanied by former district SAD (urban) president Gurcharan Singh Channi and other Akali activists, performed ardaas at the gurdwara.

After Dhindsa’s visit, SAD local leaders, led by district chief Kulwant Mann, also went to the gurdwara to mark his death anniversary.

Sikh author and chronicler Harwinder Singh Khalsa, who accompanied Dhindsa, said the first incident of communal violence in Punjab before Partition happened in Amritsar on March 5, 1947, in which one Bhai Mangal Singh was killed by Muslim League followers. “As this created communal tension in Punjab, Babu Labh Singh, who was then president of Akali Dal, went out in Jalandhar city on March 7 to soothe tempers to avert any clash. He was attacked in Rainak Bazaar by Muslim League followers,” Khalsa said.

AHMEDABAD: About 15 years ago, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which was directly contesting the student elections in Gujarat then, found it difficult to make inroads into Gujarat University (GU) in the winning syndicate or senate polls. It was K S Shastri, former GU vice-chancellor and former president of Gujarat State Federation of University and College Teachers’ Association who was keeping the BJP at bay.

Now, when BJP has emerged as the most powerful party in the country, ruling both the state and Centre, it is the Gohil brothers, Indravijaysinh and Digvijaysinh, standing between Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and GU senate and syndicate bodies.

The duo have caused defeat after defeat to the BJP-backed ABVP, so much that there was a buzz about the state government making attempts to thwart the elections.

Forty-year-old Indravijaysinh is known for his micro-management of elections – from candidate selection, booth management, voter preparation list, caste equations, this three-time GU syndicate member is known as a key strategist in students elections. Their efforts can be seen in the senate and student welfare board elections, which the Congress swept on Monday.

In the the GU syndicate election last year, Indravijaysinh and Congress-backed candidates won two out of three seats and he cornered more than half of the total votes for the seat he contested and won. Indravijaysinh, who is presently the general secretary for Gujarat Congress, was president of NSUI from 2002 to 2009. When the party decided to conduct elections to choose NSUI leaders across the country, Indravijaysinh defeated Paresh Dhanani, a powerful Congress leader, who is presently the leader of opposition in the state assembly. He has also been Youth Congress president, Gujarat, for four years.

His older brother, Digvijaysinh Gohil, 45, a professor of English Literature at Sahajanand College , is known for his planning and relations with political leaders cutting across party lines. He is the general secretary of Gujarat University Teachers’ Association and has been syndicate member at GU for the last four terms.

While the Congress has not been able to win assembly elections and or keep their stronghold in local elections in the state for two decades, the Gohil brothers have given the party hope in GU.

227,['10/03/2020'],Less sleep results in infertility: Experts,"Nagpur: Sleep medicine specialists have claimed that sleep duration is decreasing in young generation and affecting their fertility. This may come as a shocker to young adults who spend late nights on mobile phones and don’t get enough sleep.

“Getting a good night’s sleep regulates important functions in our bodies including fertility-related hormones. Research proves that young adults between 26 to 30 years of age who get less than 5 hours of sleep at night face fertility issues,” said Dr Sushant Meshram, HOD of pulmonary medicine at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH).

Meshram also happens to be the regional coordinator of World Sleep Society. It hosted a public forum for all on March 8 to mark the beginning of World Sleep Day celebrations.

Dr Nancy Collop, internationally acclaimed specialist of sleep medicine, said that exposure to blue light for more than 7 hours is common in youths of reproductive age groups. This can be directly linked with the decreasing fertility rate in young generation.

“Light emitting from your mobile phone will never let you sleep properly. Young professionals should try to be consistent in their sleep. Changing shift timings too often is also dangerous,” said Collop.

“Some clues that you’re getting enough sleep are if you don’t need an alarm clock to wake up, if you don’t sleep longer on the weekends, and if you don’t use extra caffeine to help you stay awake,” she added.

Dr Collop spoke at length about sleep apnoea which is very common and often ignored by Indians.

“Sleep apnoea is serious sleep disorder. It causes breathing to repeatedly stop and start during sleep. If your snoring is loud enough to disturb your sleep or that of others and you suddenly wake up with gasping or chocking, you should see a doctor,” she said.

Sleep apnoea may result in excessive daytime drowsiness which may cause people to fall asleep while working or even driving a vehicle.

“In USA, the government tests drivers for sleep apnoea and they don’t get license renewed if they fail to prove that they are getting proper treatment over it,” said Collop.

SLEEP DOCTORS

Minimum 7 hours of sound sleep is must for good health for adults

Children and adolescences need sleep up to 10-11 hours a day

Snoring is not a sign of sound sleep but indicator of disturbed sleep

Young adults working in night shifts should try to be consistent in their sleep

Maintaining wake-up time is more important than maintaining bedtime

228,['10/03/2020'],Man held for non-payment of insurance claim dies in custody of revenue police,"Representative image

HARIDWAR: A 48-year-old man, who was held by revenue authorities on Sunday evening on the charges of not repaying Rs 2.25 lakh claim to an insurance company, died allegedly in the custody of the department hours later.

The deceased has been identified as Murtaza, a resident of Pavdohi area that falls under the jurisdiction of Jwalapur police station in Haridwar . He was held by the revenue department on Sunday evening and was declared brought dead by doctors at the district hospital around 8 pm on the same day.

A magisterial inquiry has been recommended in the case.

Meanwhile, the family members of the deceased staged a protest against the district administration and demanded action and compensation for the death .

Providing details of the case, Rizwan Ali, a relative of the deceased, told TOI, “In 2004, Murtaza sold his auto to a man named Tanjeem Qureshi and made a notary agreement but the auto was still registered in Murtaza’s name. Three years later, the auto met with an accident and the driver, whom Qureshi had given the auto on lease, died. Following this, the family got a compensation of Rs 2.25 lakh from the insurance company.”

Ali added that in 2012, officials of the insurance company approached Murtaza and demanded back the claim money. “They said that the insurance claim was invalid and citing the registration certificate which said that the auto was in the name of Murtaza, asked him to pay back the money. When Murtaza refused, they moved the district court but the court ruled in Murtaza’s favour. The company then approached HC and the case was moved back to the district court in 2013. After a long legal battle, the district court finally ruled in favour of the insurance company in January this year and asked the office of the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) to retrieve the amount from Murtaza by March 12,” Ali said, adding. “We informed the revenue officers about the past history of the case but even then, they reached Murtaza’s house before March 12 and took him in their custody.”

When queried about the matter, Haridwar SDM Kusum Chauhan said, “We were asked by the court to recover the amount before March 12 but Murtaza failed to repay. So, following the Public Money (Recovery of Dues) Act, 1965, we took him into 14-day custody. But since Murtaza was already unwell, he died. We have conducted his post-mortem, the report of which is awaited, and a letter has also been sent to the human rights commission. Further, we will ask the court to order a magisterial inquiry into the matter.”

Meanwhile, Yogesh Dev , station house officer of Jwalapur police station said that the body had no injury marks.

Till the time of filing this report, they could not be brought down despite repeated attempts by cops to convince them.

Bobby Panwar, chairman of Uttarakhand Unemployed Union, screamed from the tank — ""We will not get down unless the forest guard recruitment exams are declared void and new jobs are announced for the unemployed youth.""

The other protesting youths, who stood near the water tank fled the spot as soon as police reached there. The protesting youths have been demanding that forest guard recruitment exams must be held again within 100 days and that the state government should release an annual calendar of state government job examinations. They also demand that chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat must deliver on his promise of filling 18,000 vacant job posts.

Earlier on Saturday, some of the protesting youths were taken to Sudhowala prison, around 15 kilometres away from Dehradun .

Notably, the forest guard recruitment examination, which was held across the state on February 16, got mired in controversy after a cheating scam came to the fore. Several accused have been arrested in the case so far and a SIT probe is underway. The examination was conducted by Uttarakhand Subordinate Services Selection Commission.

BENGALURU: Asked to vacate his house for creating nuisance and behaving indecently, a youth and three of his associates allegedly assaulted the landlord and vandalised his car in T Dasarahalli.

Bagalagunte police have arrested the tenant and his minor friend. Efforts are on to nab two more suspects in the case.

Police said Ramesh G, 52, a resident of T Dasarahalli, had rented out his ground floor house to Subramanya, a private firm employee. Subramanya lived with his wife and three sons, including prime accused Venkatesh S, 25.

Ramesh used to object to Venkatesh honking unnecessarily, riding his bike in a rash manner on his building premises, bringing his friends to the building and making noise by watching videos on the mobile outside his house.

“Venkatesh told Ramesh his father was paying the rent and they were not freeloaders. Ramesh later asked Venkatesh’s family to vacate the house,” Bagalagunte police said.

Ramesh alleged Venkatesh and three of his friends assaulted him with cricket bats while he was on a walk around 6pm on Saturday. Later, the gang rushed to Ramesh’s house and broke the windows of his car parked outside.

Ramesh then filed a complaint with Bagalagunte police, who arrested Venkatesh and his 17-year-old minor friend. “The duo confessed to the crime and identified their two other associates as Rajesh and Srinivas. Efforts are on to trace and nab them,” a police officer said.

235,['10/03/2020'],Bengaluru shoppers all smiles as veggie prices go southward,"Vegetable markets have reason to cheer, thanks to the prices of most greens having dipped.

BENGALURU: Buyers frequenting vegetable markets have reason to cheer, thanks to the prices of most greens having dipped.

The prices, however, have stayed true to the trend in March: a drop is usually seen during the month due to favourable conditions like no excess rain, moderate heat and no water shortage.

Most vegetables are now available in the city at less than Rs 45 per kg. Traders say excess rain ruins crops leading to supply shortage and price spiral.

A Hopcoms vendor said, “This is the only time in the year when there’s no excess rain or shortage of water. The yield is higher than usual. A crop that yields 5kg during the rest of the year gives nearly 15kg during this time.”

Green peas, chilly and carrot are among the very few vegetables priced beyond Rs 45 in the retail market. Green peas is selling at Rs 140 per kg, while chilli is priced at Rs 58 and carrot Rs 50.

Onion, whose price had touched Rs 300 per kg during November-December, is now available for Rs 35 per kg. Cabbage used to cost Rs 35 per kg two months ago and is now priced at Rs 15, while tomato price is down from Rs 40 to Rs 20, beans from Rs 100 to Rs 38 and drumsticks from Rs 250 to Rs 45. Capsicum, which usually sells around Rs 80 per kg now costs only half of that. Lemons to have become cheaper — from Rs 180 per kg to Rs 60.

Homemaker Shyamala Murthy said, “It’s good that vegetable prices have reduced. I don’t understand why they should skyrocket in the first place. I believe this is because of middlemen who create artificial scarcity.”

Sandhya Pawar, another homemaker, said only a few months ago, she would think twice before using onion. “I’m glad I can use onions freely now. But the cost of garlic hasn’t reduced as much.”

Malleswaram resident Rekha Chari said, “I usually buy seasonal vegetables. I think the government should intervene and make sure the prices don’t drop after certain level for the benefit of farmers.”

Fruits, however, have not seen much drop in prices.

However, civic bodies in both Telugu states are citing various including the production of an autopsy report as the reasons behind this delay in sanction.As per a report by the National Commission for Safai Karamcharis, as many as 920 deaths of karmacharis have been identified across the country since 1993. But among these confirmed cases, compensation of Rs 10 lakh has been paid to the families in only 55 cases. In 161 cases, families still await compensation.The data revealed that in AP, 23 deaths were reported. Among these, in 12 cases compensation of Rs 10 lakh was paid and four families received compensation below Rs 10 lakh. In seven cases, no action has been taken by the government. Meanwhile in Telangana, six sewer deaths have been reported with a compensation of Rs 10 lakh paid in two cases, a lesser amount was paid in another two cases while in the remaining two cases, no compensation had been paid.The figures were presented by the Union Ministry for Social Justice and Empowerment in Rajya Sabha on March 4. Speaking to TOI, president of Safai Karamchari Andolan Telangana, K Saraswati said that the figures were quite different than those given by the ministry. “Around 105 deaths took place in Telangana only. We could only find evidence for 31 deaths over the past decade. We are still trying to document the other deaths. The figure quoted in Rajya Sabha is too low,” he said.In Hyderabad alone, three families are awaiting compensation while in Medak, compensation is yet to be paid for a death that occurred while cleaning the sewers in 2014. In Kollapur, families of two deceased were paid compensation of Rs 2 lakh which is below Rs 10 lakh as prescribed in the norms.

237,['10/03/2020'],Bengaluru: Have suggestion on adoption? Write to authority directly,"TimesView The move to elicit suggestions from key stakeholders of the child adoption cycle can help simplify a system that demands a lot of emotional investment. The exercise could shine light on many issues adoptive couples face, sometimes leading to situations where they can’t cope with this life event. An open communication channel, like the one rolled out, could address some of the most pressing concerns. Nothing could be more disheartening than families giving up on adopted children. People must take the opportunity to chip in with their thoughts and ideas. For, these could be life-changing in the real sense.

BENGALURU: The Central Adoption Resource Authority ( CARA ) has invited suggestions and feedback from the public for simplification of adoption process.This is the first time that CARA has invited suggestions and sought feedback from all stakeholders, including prospective adoptive couples, for easing the adoption process.The move has been welcomed by all, in the light of a spike in demand for child adoption and increase in the number of adoption failures. In 2017-19, 278 children adopted across the country were sent back by their adoptive families.CARA, a statutory body under the ministry of women and child welfare, recently notified that child welfare committees, state adoption resource agencies, childcare homes, adoptive parents and the general public can write to the authority before April 3, 2020 on carahdesk.wcd@nic.inIndia reported 3,374 in-country adoptions in 2018-19. While Maharahstra topped with 695 adoptions, Karnataka stood second at 237. Besides, there were 253 inter-country adoptions, of which the state accounted for 44 of them.Between April 1, 2019 and March 7, 2020 Karnataka has seen 252 adoptions, including 20 inter-country ones.There are 2,919 parents in Karnataka waiting to take home a child. The waiting period in the state is close to two and a half years, a reason why many from Karnataka have opted for adoptions from states like Odisha, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.Former CARA chairperson Dr Aloma Lobo says this step by CARA is important as it can make the body more public-friendly. “A national consultation meeting was held in January 2020 in New Delhi to further streamline adoption. Major issues include the need for counselling of potential parents prior to adoption, reduction in the waiting time and adequate preparation on the part of both the child and the parents, in case of adoption of older children and kids with special needs,” Dr Lobo added.With this advice and feedback exercise, CARA is attempting to look at the bigger picture to know what’s happening on the ground, said Gayatri Abraham, founder of Padme, an organisation that works on counselling couples and adoptive parents. “In some cases, the medical reports of children up for adoptions would be blank, causing concern among parents looking to adopt. There is scope for improvement at various levels to make the process smoother,” said Abraham.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74558188,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-184561,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/have-suggestion-on-adoption-write-to-authority-directly/articleshow/74558188.cms
238,['10/03/2020'],Draft tourism policy looks to overhaul Goa’s image,"Panaji: Goa’s draft tourism policy which awaits government approval, is focused on myriad aspects of the industry. It addresses coastal tourism, culture and heritage, nature-based tourism, leisure and entertainment , meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) and weddings, clubbed as destination development.

Savio Messias, president of trade body Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) said, they are happy that the tourism master plan is finally ready - tourism policy has been formulated under the masterplan - and its implementation should start immediately. “We have reasons to worry since it has taken about four years to get the tourism masterplan ready,” he said.

Under coastal tourism, the draft tourism policy suggests a blue certification or comparable standards for select beaches to be adopted. This will subsequently be extended to the coast as per suitability in a progressive manner.

The government’s plan for blue flag certification for Miramar beach was opposed by the fishing community. In view of this, it needs to be seen how this proposal can be taken forward as and when the master plan becomes applicable.

Counting environment sustainability as the key component of coastal tourism, the regeneration of beaches as planned by Goa Tourism Board (GTB) will be undertaken. It will include infrastructure development such as access, parking, urban sidewalks, promenades, public amenities and services for providing cleanliness and security on beaches.

The draft tourism policy has also suggested that introduction of labels and accreditations for Goan cuisine and special services be instituted. Shack owners and operators will have to fulfil certain guidelines to acquire these labels and accreditations.

There are plans to also develop fishermen markets, and food and beverage courts in liaison with local stakeholders with laid out standards on cleanliness, hygiene, preparation and availability of Goan cuisine.

For promotion of culture and heritage tourism, GTB will take up a role of identifying essential infrastructure and public amenity requirements for identified tourism assets of historical and cultural importance. Encouraging tourists to visit villages and designating villages conducive for development as tourism villages, has been listed.

To promote nature-based tourism, the draft tourism policy is keen to follow ecologically sustainable and environmentally sound practices. It talks about creating high quality facilities in protected areas to increase the stay duration of high-end visitors as also developing nature clusters with key natural or cultural assets located in the vicinity of each other across the Goan hinterland.

In the way of leisure and entertainment tourism, it is suggested that family entertainment districts be developed. There are also plans to introduce investment promotion and facilitation schemes to attract top international or national investors and brands.

The state reported its first case of Covid-19 on Monday. With the infected man having returned from the US only last week, the health department is taking measures to address concerns raised over Bengaluru techies travelling abroad for work.

""We’ve had two rounds of meetings with representatives from 25 companies. We explained to them the guidelines to be followed pertaining to Covid-19, the dos and don’ts and precautions to be taken. We briefed them about collecting travel history of all their employees, who went abroad,"" said Pankaj Kumar Pandey, commissioner, health and family welfare department.

Proactive declaration from persons with travel history to the affected countries is very crucial, officers said.

Deputy CM and minister for IT/BT CN Ashwath Narayan told TOI the IT and BT companies must adhere to precautionary measures. ""Many are already avoiding international trips. We don’t want to create fear, but one has to be aware. Companies are aware of the risks. All the suspect cases that we have seen till now are those who had travelled to affected countries earlier,"" he said.

Medical education minister K Sudhakar said persons with travel history to affected countries have to honestly self-report themselves in case of symptoms. ""All they have to do is report to the toll-free Arogyavani (104),"" the minister added.

Besides, the Karnataka government has got into a proactive mo-de, advising IT/BT firms to allow workers showing flu-like signs to work from home and promote and encourage standard hand and respiratory hygiene practices at workplaces.

Close on the heels of the advisory, business parks across Bengaluru confirmed they are adopting thorough measures to ensure their premises are clean and hygienic, while companies said they are drastically reducing business travel to affected countries and are advising employees to work from home in case they show any flu-like symptoms.

Sanat, a techie, and wife Pramita Mishra, a faculty at IISc, go on a spin during weekends. The ‘ tandem couple ’, as they are known in the cycling community, has done a 200km brevet on a Tandem Bike.

Rare collection

With its wide tyres and weight, the Fat Bike (bought in July 2018) can conquer any rugged terrain. According to Sanat, it is the best bike for developing stamina and losing weight.

Tandem Bike (August 2018) is designed for two — the front rider is called the pilot, who changes gears and keeps the bike on course, and the one in the rear is the stoker, who pedals to provide the extra push. Both have to be in sync for a smooth ride.

Road Bike (June 2017) with thin tyres is meant for long-distance rides. The dropped handlebars allow the rider’s position to be aero-dynamic.

Unicycle (August 2017) has a single fat tyre and requires persistence to master the skill of riding it. It throws a great physical challenge and calls for mental focus.

Penny Farthing (August 2017) is the forefather of the modern-day bicycle with a bigger front wheel and a smaller rear one. The bike is named so because its tyres resemble two British coins — penny and the farthing. There are no gears and no effective brakes. The rider’s entire weight lies on the front axle. All these make Penny Farthing a difficult bicycle to ride, especially for longer distances.

Recumbent Tricycle (December 2017) is a customised three-wheel bicycle, also called a recumbent tadpole or a reverse trike. It has two steered wheels at the front and one driven wheel at the back.

Chopper (June 2018) is a single-speed gearless bike with a thin front tyre and a wider rear one. It has a long-padded high backseat and high-rise handlebars. The unusual frame is like that of a motorbike.

Folding bike (June 2018) is designed to fold into a compact form, facilitating easy transport and usage. Its smaller wheels provide potential for more speed and quick acceleration. But it is unstable on rugged terrain.

241,['10/03/2020'],Bengaluru: Cabbie hands out masks to passengers free of cost,"Azam Khan, an Uber driver, also shares tips with travellers on how to stay safe.

BENGALURU: Undaunted by the panic surrounding Covid-19, a cab driver is doing his bit to protect passengers by giving them masks free of cost.

Azam Khan, 40, an Uber driver, also dishes out a few tips to travellers on how to keep the virus at bay. “I began doing this over a week ago when a passenger handed me a mask before alighting from my cab. I was very happy that someone was concerned about a stranger’s well-being. That’s when I decided to do something to stop spread of the virus,” said Khan, a resident of Whitefield.

Since March 1, Khan has distributed at least 10 masks a day. He purchases them from medical stores whenever possible and hands them out to passengers in need. “I am more concerned about people going to crowded places. I ask them if they have a mask and hand it over if they need one,” said Khan. He buys masks at Rs 20-30 a piece.

Chain of good gestures

Most of Khan’s passengers ask him how much the mask costs and many choose to pay him. Some even pay for more than two or three masks to help Khan stock up for other passengers. “Some said they want to help me. They asked me to give the masks to people in need. It’s this innate need of people to do good that makes my efforts worth it,” said Khan.

With many druggists running out of stocks, Khan often has to do several rounds to get the masks.“On Monday, I wasn’t able to find even a single mask, though I stopped at more than four stores,” Khan told TOI. “At times, I even stop during ongoing rides if I spot a medical store, provided the passenger is okay with it,” he said.

Khan asks passengers to use sanitisers and wash their hands frequently. “Unless they insist, I advice them not to opt for AC in the cab. I have heard that cold surroundings are helpful for growth of the virus,” he said.

“The cab is a public place. All types of passengers use it, and I also make multiple rounds of the airport. It’s one of the most vulnerable places and hence, I ask passengers to take all possible precautions,” Khan said. He also does his best to to maintain hygiene in his cab.

Father of two children, Khan said he’s the one who is the most susceptible to the virus in his family. “I keep myself safe with sanitisers and bathe with medicinal soap as soon as I enter my house,” he said.

Genuine concern

244,['10/03/2020'],Provide medical attention to murder convict in Haridwar jail: SC,"Supreme Court

HARIDWAR: The Supreme Court on Monday directed the state government to provide immediate medical treatment to a murder convict lodged in Haridwar jail. The apex court gave the direction while hearing a plea filed by the convict Manish Kumar (alias Sonu). In his petition, Sonu had alleged that he was not being provided with medical treatment in the jail which is a violation of his fundamental right.

Refuting Sonu’s allegation, Haridwar jail authorities maintain that he is provided with medical treatment like any other inmate. “Sonu has been in the jail for past nine years now. We are providing him medical treatment as per our capacity. We also shift our inmates to the higher medical facilities if the jail doctor recommends so. Sometimes, jail inmates try to get bail on health grounds. I have no knowledge about the honourable court’s ruling but we will surely follow SC directions after we get the order,” SM Singh , jailor at Haridwar jail, told TOI.

It is worth mentioning that Haridwar jail has only one doctor for around 1,225 inmates lodged there presently. The jail has the capacity to lodge only 900 inmates but the number of under-trial prisoners in the facility is quite high at present.

“We have limited sources for providing medical treatment to inmates but we shift those in serious condition to district hospital for treatment. In emergency cases, we shift them to higher facilities as well,” added Singh.

Police nabbed three suspects at Palakkad railway station in connection with the case.

Police identified the deceased as Akash, his wife Vandhana Kumari, 21, and his nephew Sunny Kumar, 18, all from Agra. They were working at a silver ankle chain manufacturing unit run by P Thangaraj, 42, who lives near the deceased house at Tirumalaigiri.

“Around 11.30pm on Sunday, Thangaraj and his neighbours went to check upon Akash as his eight-month-old son was crying for a long time. They found Vandhana Kumari lying dead with her throat slit inside the house and found Akash and Sunny Kumar’s bodies in the backyard,” a police officer attached to the Steel Plant police station.

After being informed, police team reached spot and began the inquiry. City commissioner of police T Senthil Kumar, deputy commissioners P Thangadurai (law and order), S Senthil (crime and traffic) and other officials also visited the spot.

The preliminary inquiry revealed that Vinoth, 23, Dinesh, 25, Vijay, 23 and Suraj, 23, who had worked in Thangaraj’s unit about two years ago, approached him on Saturday seeking job again. Thangaraj hired them and asked them to stay in a house next to Akash’s house.

“It seems that Akash had previous enmity with Vinoth. The four were also missing after the incident. So we checked CCTV footage in the bus stand and the railway station and spotted them boarding a Kerala-bound express train,” the officer said.

After being alerted, the Palakkad police nabbed three suspects, while Suraj managed to escape. A search has been launched in Palakkad for Suraj, the officer said.

A special team brought back the trio from Palakkad on Monday. “We are questioning them. They will be produced before a magistrate on Monday night,” the officer added.

247,['10/03/2020'],MP Latest News: Back in focus in political turmoil; Jyotiraditya Scindia family’s BJP connections,"Jyotiraditya Scindia

BHOPAL: Will Jyotiraditya Scindia fulfil his grandmother Vijayaraje Scindia’s dream of the family’s return to BJP — the party she had founded and nurtured along with members of Jana Sangh?

Vijayaraje, from the family that once ruled Gwalior, joined electoral politics in 1957 as a Congress member and won Guna Lok Sabha seat, but switched to Jana Sangh in 1967. She played a significant role in nurturing the saffron citadel in Gwalior region and in 1971, Jana Sangh defied the Indira Gandhi-wave and won three seats — Vijayaraje from Bhind, Atal Bihari Vajpayee from Gwalior and Vijayaraje’s son Madhavrao Scindia from Guna.

The Scindia family plunged headlong into state politics and Madhavrao Scindia became a Lok Sabha member at the age of 26. But the saffron love didn’t last long for him, and he chose to part ways with Jana Sangh and his mother after Emergency in 1977.

In the 1980 elections, he switched allegiance to Congress and won from Guna a third time, and served as Union minister in the Congress government. Madhavrao’s son Jyotiraditya Scindia carried on with his legacy.

In the meantime, Vijayaraje’s daughters Vasundhara Raje and Yashodhara Raje also entered politics. In 1984, Vasundhara Raje joined as a member of the BJP national executive. She was also elected to the 8th Rajasthan assembly from Dholpur. Vasundhara’s son Dushyant is a BJP MP from Jhalawar constituency in Rajasthan.

Yashodhara moved to New Orleans, USA, in 1977 after marrying Sidharth Bhansali, a cardiologist. She has three children, none of who joined politics. Yashodhara returned to India in 1994 and went into formal politics by contesting the MP assembly election in 1998 as a BJP member. A five-time MLA, she was a minister in the erstwhile Shivraj Singh Chouhan government.

Jyotiraditya chose to remain in Congress. After his father’s death in a plane crash in 2001, Guna Lok Sabha constituency fell vacant. Jyotiraditya contested the bypoll in 2002 and won by a record margin of 4.5 lakh votes. Jyotiraditya won the next three LS polls from Guna but suffered a shock defeat in 2019 at the hands of his long-time aide Krishna Pal Singh Yadav.

It was a double blow to Jyotiraditya, having lost out in the race for chief ministership only six months earlier. Despite playing a significant role in Congress’s victory in the 2018 assembly polls, Jyotiraditya could get the support of only 23 MLAs. The then AICC chief Rahul Gandhi picked Kamal Nath for his experience, and indicated that Scindia’s time would come. After the Lok Sabha defeat, Jyotiraditya felt sidelined by the state Congress leadership although six MLAs from his faction were made ministers in the Kamal Nath cabinet.

In January 2019, Scindia sparked a buzz by calling on former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan one evening. Both leaders dismissed speculation and called it a “courtesy meet”. In September 2019, rumours went around that he could switch to BJP. Scindia clarified that he has no intention of leaving Congress and dubbed the reports as “rumour-mongering by vested interests”. Then, in November, he dropped all references to his official posts in Congress from his twitter profile. He played it down, saying he had changed the profile a month earlier, and chose to identify himself as a “public servant and cricket enthusiast”.

As of March 9, when 17 MLAs from his faction went missing, his Twitter profile said the same.

These two major instructions, which were issued by the health department and district administration in the backdrop of spread of coronavirus infection, were rarely followed by the devotees.The smoke emanating from hundreds of pongala hearths made the devotees wipe their eyes and nose frequently. Most of them were sweating profusely due to the heat and it was very difficult for people to refrain from touching their face. Amidst the busy rituals, devotees rarely washed their hands.Kunjumol and Usha, who arrived from Kadakkal in Kollam, hadn’t heard about coronavirus or Covid-19. Both are staunch devotees of Attukal Bhagavathy and came to the city as usual and found an ideal space at the road near Statue Junction to offer pongala. When asked about instructions on washing hands frequently, both said that they were unaware any such directions.Nirmala Kumari, who regularly offers pongala, said that she was aware of precautions against spread of virus as her daughter, a doctor, had warned her in advance. “I just washed my hands before offering pongala. I tried to get a sanitizer. Unfortunately, it was not available in shops,” she said.Bindhu Velayudhan, a businessperson who arrived from Dubai to offer pongala, said that she had taken enough precautions. “I try not to mingle with the crowd. But washing hands is not practical during the rituals,” she said, adding that she is offering pongala for 23 years.While instructions were given not to touch hand-railings, most devotees, including children, were seen touching it. Another rule which was ignored was the direction against going to crowded areas. As usual, there was a huge rush to visit the temple after offering pongala. People also thronged at spots were there was distribution of food and refreshments.When asked about facilities for hand washing in festival areas an official of Kerala water authority said that no such instruction was given to them.

The task force now works under the District Disaster Management Authority under the new label Inter Agency Group (IAG). The group was formed in the district in January this year.

Attukal Pongala was the first official assignment of IAG after its formation. Around 350 youths, all in their 20s were on duty on Monday. They comprised of college students, young IT professionals and even PG doctors studying in medical colleges at Thiruvananthapuram, Venjarammoodu and Karakkonam.

District collector K Gopalakrishnan and deputy collector (disaster management) Anu S Nair supervised them.

The volunteers of IAG played crucial role in coordinating the actions of the police, fire and rescue services and health officials.

What made them capable for the task was the training they received under the District Collector’s Internship Programme to respond to cases of natural calamities as well as major tragedies.

One of the major roles played by IAG volunteers on the pongala day was to spot foreigners among the pongala crowd and initiate steps to keep them at a safe distance from the devotees offering pongala.

“Besides coordinating the action with other department officials through wireless communication devices, our volunteers stayed connected with each other using a push-to-talk walkie talkie app installed on our phones. This enabled us to share information quickly,” said Bharat Govind, convener, IAG.

They also played key role in alerting health officials whenever they spotted devotees in need of help.

Former collector K Vasuki had launched the internship programme following the floods of 2018. It was the overwhelming response of the youths in aiding the administration in relief works that prompted her to tap into the resource of youths to form an army to meet emergency situations.

The pongala was relatively safe with no major untoward incidents being reported. Around 50 persons approached the special control room of the police set up near the Attukal Bhagavathy Temple seeking help to reunite with their companions after they got stranded. Action was taken promptly on all cases.

“Surprisingly, all the persons who got stranded were adults. Unlike previous years, not even a single child was reported missing during pongala,” said an official on duty at the special control room.

Besides this, the Fort police registered a case after a devotee complained that her gold chain has gone missing.

The health department officials said that there were only five cases of burns reported during the pongala. As many as 260 out-patient cases were registered at six medical camps set up across the city.

HARIDWAR: A 48-year-old man, who was held by revenue authorities on Sunday evening on the charges of not repaying Rs 2.25 lakh claim to an insurance company, died allegedly in the custody of the department hours later.

The deceased has been identified as Murtaza, a resident of Pavdohi area that falls under the jurisdiction of Jwalapur police station in Haridwar . He was arrested by the revenue department on Sunday evening and was declared brought dead by doctors at the district hospital around 8 pm on the same day.

A magisterial inquiry has been recommended in the case.

Meanwhile, the family members of the deceased staged a protest against the district administration and demanded action and compensation for the death.

Providing details of the case, Rizwan Ali, a relative of the deceased, told TOI, “In 2004, Murtaza sold his auto to a man named Tanjeem Qureshi and made a notary agreement but the auto was still registered in Murtaza’s name. Three years later, the auto met with an accident and the driver, whom Qureshi had given the auto on lease, died. Following this, the family got a compensation of Rs 2.25 lakh from the insurance company.”

Ali added that in 2012, officials of the insurance company approached Murtaza and demanded back the claim money. “They said that the insurance claim was invalid and citing the registration certificate which said that the auto was in the name of Murtaza, asked him to pay back the money. When Murtaza refused, they moved the district court but the court ruled in Murtaza’s favour. The company then approached HC and the case was moved back to the district court in 2013. After a long legal battle, the district court finally ruled in favour of the insurance company in January this year and asked the office of the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) to retrieve the amount from Murtaza by March 12,” Ali said, adding. “We informed the revenue officers about the past history of the case but even then, they reached Murtaza’s house before March 12 and took him in their custody.”

When queried about the matter, Haridwar SDM Kusum Chauhan said, “We were asked by the court to recover the amount before March 12 but Murtaza failed to repay. So, following the Public Money (Recovery of Dues) Act, 1965, we took him into 14-day custody. But since Murtaza was already unwell, he died. We have conducted his post-mortem, the report of which is awaited, and a letter has also been sent to the human rights commission. Further, we will ask the court to order a magisterial inquiry into the matter.”

257,['10/03/2020'],Digital transfers at Goa State Co-op hit by Yes Bank’s woes,"Panaji: The financial crisis that’s hit Yes Bank , India’s fourth-largest private bank, has had a ripple effect in the state. One unlikely victim, the Goa State Cooperative Bank (GSCB).

Along with the over Rs 1,000 crore deposits that remain locked with Yes Bank in Goa, the month-long moratorium has also frozen net-banking transactions at the state’s apex cooperative bank.

In 2016, GSCB tied up with Yes Bank to provide customers with an online banking and mobile banking platform. As part of the agreement, GSCB also had to park a certain quantum of funds with the private lender.

“Due to the Yes Bank crisis, our RTGS, NEFT and cheque clearances, which were being done through their platform, are affected,” GSCB chairman Ulhas Phaldesai told TOI.

GSCB is among the 300-odd co-operative banks across the country which depended on Yes Bank for online transactions.

The co-operative bank now plans to move to another private sector bank so that online banking services can be resumed. “We have got the NOC from Yes Bank to move to another bank, most probably ICICI Bank, Phaldesai said. “The bank urges customers not to panic as services will be available in one or two days.”

Reserve Bank of India’s moratorium says that for the next 30 days, Yes Bank will also not be able to grant or renew any loan or advance, make any investment, incur any liability or agree to disburse any payment. RBI’s decision of capping withdrawals at Yes Bank at Rs 50,000 per account for a month has ramifications for Goa’s leading co-operative bank. All the 50-odd branches of GSCB were linked to RBI’s Centralised Funds Management System through Yes Bank, thus hampering inter-branch fund transfers.

“Our deposits are with Yes Bank, but there is no problem as the moratorium is only for a month,” Phaldessai said.

Yes Bank has seven branches in the state and had collected deposits (as on December 1, 2019) to the tune of Rs 1022.6 crore. This includes Rs 967.2 crore worth local deposits and Rs 55.4 crore worth foreign deposits.

Yes Bank also had 1737 loans on its account book for Goa amounting to Rs 368.3 crore, as per documents released in December. The bank has kept its latest figures out of public domain.

KOCHI: The dispute over the selling of a building which had housed the CPM Kochi area committee office till recently led to a minor scuffle and tension in Fort Kochi on Monday. The building at Calvathy in Fort Kochi, overlooking Coast Guard office , is one of the tourist attractions in the area.

Around 6.30pm, a group of CPM men led by party area committee secretary K M Riyadh entered the building and threw out items like carroms board which a section of sympathizers of the party had been using.

The youngsters who were using the building opposed the move of the party leadership and this resulted in a minor scuffle between the two groups.

The building had been of little use after the party area committee office was shifted to another building. “Now, the party wanted to construct new office for the area committee and so it was decided to sell off the land parcel which comes to roughly four cents. The proposal has been endorsed by the party state committee and district committee,” said Riyadh.

“After the area committee office was shifted to another building quite some time ago, some antisocial elements occupied a portion of the building. They had been using alcohol and drugs there. So, we locked the room. But they broke the lock and again occupied the room. They even put up a board that the land is not for sale. So, we decided to evict them and bring our building under party’s control,” Riyadh said.

At the same time, the youngsters say that they were thrown out of the building as they opposed the land deal. “The land and the structure which is more than a century old has been put up for sale. We opposed this move. The holding is one of the most precious property in Kochi,” said Shalik, one of the youngsters in the group.

While Shalik claims to be a party member, area committee leaders say that he was expelled from the party for working against the interests of the party recently. According to the youngsters, one of them was injured in the assault and was later admitted in the Fort Kochi Taluk Hospital.

260,['10/03/2020'],Former mines officials urge CM not to accept Lokayukta report,"Panaji: Former mines secretary Pawan Kumar Sain and former director of the department of mines and geology Prasanna Acharya on Monday urged chief minister Pramod Sawant not to accept the Goa Lokayukta recommendation to order a CBI investigation into the second renewal of 88 mining leases as the Supreme Court had not ordered such an inquiry.

Sawant held a personal hearing with Sain and Acharya. Both have filed their replies to the Goa Lokayukta report in which Justice P K Misra said that the two officers shouldn’t hold the offices held by them while recommending that the state government conduct a CBI inquiry.

Sources said that during the hearing, both officers stated that they renewed the leases as per the decision of the state government and that though the NGO had approached the apex court, it had not directed for a CBI inquiry.

“That is our ground, that the state should not accept the Lokayukta report”, one of the officer told the chief minister, sources said.

NGO Goa Foundation had filed a complaint with the Lokayukta alleging that the renewals appeared to be “result of corrupt acts” by the then chief minister and officer of directorate of mines.

The state government has also sought a “written explanation” from former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar over the Goa Lokayukta report that alleged “corruption” and “criminal conspiracy” over renewal of 88 mining leases between November 2014 and January 2015.

Sawant had said that based on the outcome of the hearing, the state government would act on the Loyakukta report.

The January 20 Lokayukta order has also recommended that the directorate of vigilance’s anti-corruption branch (ACB) file an FIR against Parsekar, Sain and Acharya in the case.

He attributed Sunday’s fatal accident at Verna , where three minor boys died, to this delay.

Dhavalikar further challenged chief minister to sack Godinho from the cabinet. “The transport minister first blamed bad roads for delaying the implementation of the act to after the monsoon. Then he said it would be implemented in December. But, even one year later, the government is yet to implement the act,” he said.

Dhavaliakar said the act has provisions to put parents behind bars if they allow their minor children to drive or ride.

He also alleged that car racing is taking place at Verna and accused the authorities of turning a blind eye. “Despite having information about where the races take place, traffic police and the transport department does not take timely action,” he said.

Stating that the Verna accident could be ruled out as a race, he said that when he was transport minister, he had directed transport officers to take necessary action against these races.

“The letter will be delivered to the PMO by March 15. It will also be e-mailed on the same day,” Dhavalikar said.

Dhavalikar said that chief minister Pramod Sawant ’s meeting with the jal shakti ministry and environment ministry to urge them “not to entertain any proposal by Karnataka on the Mhadei without keeping Goa informed” is just an eyewash.

Sawant should have met the Prime Minister over the issue as various ministries are involved in the Mhadei issue, including environment, forest, water resource, hydro power, power and water supply, he said.

“Meeting jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh and environment minister Prakash Javadekar is just an election stunt,” Dhavalikar said

On March 2, the Supreme Court had rejected Goa’s plea to stop Karnataka from starting work on the Mhadei. The apex court had said that Karnataka can only begin construction after getting permission from the central government and after preparing a detailed project report (DPR).

The SC also said that the 2014 interim order of the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal will remain in force.

This effectively means that Karnataka can go ahead with its water diversion projects provided it gets permission from the wildlife board and environment ministry, besides other agencies.

The tribunal’s interim order on April 17, 2014, stated that Karnataka could not start work without a revised DPR that has to be approved by the Union government or the Mhadei Water Management Authority.

After Goa did not object to Karnataka’s plea to notify the tribunal’s August 14, 2018, award, the Supreme Court had directed the Centre to notify it. On February 28, the Centre notified the tribunal’s final award.

263,['10/03/2020'],Tarun Bhanot held press meet with Surendra Singh Shera before fresh crisis hit Madhya Pradesh Congress,"BHOPAL: Finance minister Tarun Bhanot on Monday morning addressed a joint press conference with independent MLA Surendra Singh Shera , who had gone incommunicado on Thursday and returned from Bengaluru on Saturday. Bhanot said chief minister Kamal Nath is likely to reshuffle and expand the cabinet after Holi and Shera said BJP won’t succeed in “whatever it is trying”.

However, after the fresh political turmoil with 17 MLAs and ministers of the Scindia faction in Bengaluru, the cabinet expansion now seems a distant possibility.

During the press meet, Bhanot may not have had information that six of his cabinet colleagues had flown south, but he did seem to have information on the state BJP leadership meeting in New Delhi. “Where are Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Gopal Bhargava , Narottam Mishra, Kailash Vijayvargiya and VD Sharma? Where have they gone for pilgrimage, vacation or medical treatment?” Bhanot asked when told that BJP was denying any involvement in the disappearance of Congress and alliance MLAs last week.

The BJP leaders were, meanwhile, holding meetings at the residence of Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar in New Delhi.

Bhanot said: “Our MLAs have specifically said how they were offered Rs 35 crore to switch loyalties. This allegation of offering money was not made by Digvijaya Singh. It was first made by our MLAs who were approached. BJP is losing ground and that is the reason behind the ongoing political turmoil.”

Shera said he has known chief minister Kamal Nath for 25 years. “BJP will not succeed at what it is trying,” the independent MLA from Burhanpur said. “Kamal Nath’s personality is very strong. You will see many BJP MLAs will join Congress,” he said, adding that after his return from Bengaluru, CM Nath assured him a ministerial berth. Asked which portfolio he wants, Shera said, “Let the chief minister decide. But I would prefer the home department because I want to work towards a people-friendly police.”

Bhanot added that the Kamal Nath government’s second budget to be presented on March 18 will be a welfare budget and not put any extra burden on the common man.

264,['10/03/2020'],Switch to steel utensils helps reduce waste,"Thiruvananthapuram: The city corporation’s decision to give steel glasses and plates on rent as alternatives for disposables paid off during Attukal Pongala . As many as 3,000 steel plates and 10,000 steel glasses were taken on rent by individuals and associations which took license for distribution of food and water on the day of pongala.

The civic body fixed a nominal rent rate for cutlery and plates were given at Rs 1 per day and glasses at Rs 50 paise. A good percentage of vessels were booked a week in advance.

In addition to this, private suppliers also made the most of the opportunity and gave away vessels and glasses on rent to many of the caterers. This helped reduce waste generation considerably, corporation officials said. There were many takers for vessels on rent from shops based in Chalai for pongala day.

The corporation, which could reduce generation of waste during pongala from 350 tonnes to 67 tonnes in 2019, hoped to reduce it further by at least ten tonnes on Monday.

A final estimate of waste generation will be compiled by the health wing on Tuesday. As per the reports received from various health circles, there was a considerable dip in generation of waste in many wards and even in composition of waste, it was mostly confined to paper and dry leaves, unlike previous years.

The special squad constituted by civic body to identify and prevent use of disposables issued a notice to a few organizations which used disposable glasses and plates for distribution of food and water in areas near Manacaud on Monday.

A penalty will also be levied from the associations which were found at fault for non-compliance with green protocol .

The squad also took note of exemplary initiatives by some of the residents associations and organizations.

Two days ago, the health squad seized 1,800kg of banned plastic items from various wards as part of implementing green protocol.

The squad also conducted raids in 329 shops in 31 wards under festival zone in order to ensure hygienic distribution of food and water. The corporation deployed 26 health inspectors and 96 junior health inspectors to co-ordinate activities related to implementation of green protocol.

The officials however said that despite the good response towards green protocol received from various quarters, it will take another year or two before cent percent compliance with green protocol is ensured.

The civic body deployed 3,300 cleaning staff on the day of pongala.

The city corporation estimated that 54 tonnes of waste were collected during the post-pongala collection drive, marking a significant reduction when compared to figures of waste generation during pongala before three years. Green protocol violation was detected in 10 cases and preliminary notices were served on Monday.

VIJAYAWADA: The YSR Congress on Monday named Reliance Industries Limited Group president Parimal Nathwani, party senior leader and industrialist Alla Ayodhya Rami Reddy and two ministers in the Jagan Mohan Reddy cabinet, Pilli Subhaschandra Bose and Mopidevi Venkata Ramana, as its candidates for the March 26 Rajya Sabha (RS) polls in Andhra Pradesh.

The party chose Nathwani as RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani personally flew down to Amaravati and met CM Jagan recently seeking Upper House berth for the Reliance honcho, according to sources. Currently, Nathwani represents Jharkhand in the RS.

The two ministers were picked for RS since they would be losing their MLC status and ministerial position as the Assembly had passed a resolution seeking dissolution of the Legislative Council.

Since both of them belong to backward class communities, their candidature could bolster YSRC campaign in the upcoming local body elections. Bose and Mopidevi were staunch loyalists of Jagan's father, the late CM Y S Rajasekhara Reddy. After the latter's demise in a copter crash, both of them stood by Jagan after he left Congress and floated his own party, the YSR Congress in 2010.

Ayodhya Rami Reddy, founder of Ramky Infrastructure Ltd, is a close associate of Jagan. He lost the Lok Sabha poll from Narsaraopet constituency in 2014.

The ruling YSR Congress with a strength of 151 members in the 175-member Assembly is comfortably placed to bag all the four Rajya Sabha seats.

The AP assembly would elect four RS members to fill the vacancies caused by retirement of Congress’ M A Khan and T Subba Rami Reddy, TDP’s T Sitarama Lakshmi and TRS’ K Keshava Rao. Their RS term ends on April 9.

This is because of the in-vitro (tests performed in test tube) and in-vivo (tests performed in living organism) data for the drug is available for coronaviruses. “Further, studies in mice using Remdesivir showed superior efficacy over the drugs Kaletra+IFNbeta,” the draft report says.The report adds that a clinical trial is being planned in China to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drug in association with optimised standard of care, as the next step. Remdesivir slows the infection of healthy cells by blocking viral replication.The WHO expert also reviewed drugs used in HIV treatment —lopinavir and ritonavir — either alone or in combination with IFNbeta. It stated that among the repurposed drugs under consideration, this would be the suitable second option for rapid implementation in clinical trials.The use of convalescent sera-serum obtained from someone who has recovered from an infectious disease and considered to be especially rich in antibodies against the infectious agent of the disease could also be an option, said the expert group. However, the report adds: “...but it remains to be defined if sufficient amounts of sera with high antibodies titres could be feasibly collected, using concentration and purification process.”Among the projects that should not be prioritised, the WHO group said there was consensus that Ribavirin — an antiviral medication used to treat RSV infection (a type of respiratory infection), hepatitis C and some viral hemorrhagic fevers — does not appear like a candidate worth investigating.“The experience with its evaluation in SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in Canada in 2003 may have resulted in higher mortality than in other countries. It also reduced haemoglobin concentration — a side-effect that is undesirable in patients with respiratory disorders,” the draft report says. Immunosuppressants and steroids were also identified as products to be de-prioritised by the experts. Anti-malaria drug Chloroquine was also mentioned in the report as a product for which there is insufficient evidence to support further investigation.Among the non-antiviral products, statins, blood-thinners, and high-dose vitamin C were mentioned as products for which more discussion could be considered.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74559582,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-227637,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ebola-drug-best-pick-for-treating-covid-19/articleshow/74558769.cms

PANAJI: From January 1 onwards till date (March 9) the Goa police’s traffic cell has registered a total of 103 cases against underage riding/driving. Speeding or racing of vehicles is commonly seen among underage riders, traffic officials informed. In the most recent incident, the dangerous combination of underage driving and speeding led to the tragic death of three teenagers in Verna on Sunday.

“All three of them were underage drivers,” said DySP North Goa, traffic, Dharmesh Angle. “We are regularly booking such cases and we patrol areas where these incidents take place, especially near colleges. Yet, many youngsters still drive or ride without licences.”

He said that it is also the responsibility of the parents to ensure that they do not hand over their vehicles to their underage children.

“We are doing our best to educate them and create awareness. Parents must realise that they are not only endangering their lives of their children but also the lives of other road users,” he said.

Besides the traffic cell’s attempts at curbing such activities that put road safety at risk, the enforcement teams at regional transport offices (RTOs) also maintain a close watch.

An RTO official told TOI that there is a need to hold parents accountable. “There should be a penalty for both, the underage driver and the parents,” he said.

Speeding ranked as the number one traffic violation owing to which motorists lost their driving licences in 2019. Last year, the driving licences of a total of 2,053 people were suspended for three months owing to this violation.

271,['10/03/2020'],Recurring gaps on Cauvery bridge worry commuters,"Trichy: As the gaps between the spans on the Cauvery bridge have been recurring quite often, commuters have urged the district administration and state highways department to get experts to find out the root cause of the problem.

Recently, a gap resurfaced between spans on the Mambalasalai end of the bridge.

In 2018, the state highways department carried out maintenance works to strengthen the joints of all 14 spans of the bridge at an outlay of Rs 15 lakh. Through guniting technique (spraying a mix or concrete on to a surface with the help of a spray gun), the gaps were filled.

However, over a period of time, the fillings came off.

“One after the other, adjacent spans of the Cauvery bridge have been developing gaps. We are not satisfied with temporary solutions. An expert team should study the bridge and suggest a permanent solution,” said P Aiyarappan, president, Road Users Welfare Association.

The bridge has witnessed at least seven major and minor repair works since November 2015, spending over Rs 1.5 crore. In December 2019, the department had proposed to invite experts from Highways Research Station, Chennai, to study the bridge, which is yet to happen.

Officials with the state highways department said that they will soon study the bridge. “Based on their suggestions, we will take up the maintenance work,” the official added.

273,['10/03/2020'],"2 tonnes sea cucumber seized, 2 held","Nagapattinam: More than two tonne of sea cucumbers, meant to be smuggled out of the country, were seized from two premises at Akkaraipettai in Nagapattinam district on Monday evening.

The sea cucumber is a marine species protected under the Wildlife Protection Act 1972. The value of the seized cumber is estimated to be more than Rs 60 lakh.

Based on information, the Organised Crime Intelligence Unit (OCIU) of the state police from Thanjavur, led by inspector Laxmanam conducted a search on the premises of P Senbagaraman, 63, of Akkaraipettai and found around 1,200kg of sea cucumbers.

Police secured Senbagaraman along with his accomplice, Chandru alias R Chandrasekar, 45, of Kodipangu in Ramanathapuram district.

The special team also raided the premises of Muruganantham and seized 1,050kg of the sea cucumbers. Muruganantham was absconding, police said.

After preliminary investigations, the OCIU team handed over the seized sea cucumbers and the duo to district forest officer (DFO) S Kalanidhi.

When contacted, the DFO told TOI that since there were processed and unprocessed sea cucumbers, it would be difficult to measure the exact weight. “Once dried, the weight of the sea cucumbers will come down. However, definitely, it would be more than two tonne,” he said.

“Poaching of sea cucumbers is banned to prevent the extinction of the rare species. If anyone is caught possessing the species, he will be sentenced to imprisonment for a period ranging from three to seven years,” he stated.

With neither any survivors nor any eyewitnesses of the incident, the police have failed to piece together vital information that could throw light on how and what caused the accident.

Joshua Barreto, 15, Rowan Sequiera, 14, and Ethan Fernandes, 15, died after the car in which they were travelling, apparently veered out of control of the driver and after hitting the rocks plunged into a 10-12 feet deep ravine, on Sunday.

The police are yet to establish who of the three deceased was on the driver’s seat when the accident occurred. While owner of the car, Peter Fernandes, died two years ago, the ownership of the vehicle is yet to be transferred to anybody, police sources said, adding that Joshua Barreto, one among the three deceased, was Peter’s grandson. Joshua’s father, William, stays in the US and is expected to reach Goa by Tuesday.

Ethan’s father also works overseas. While bodies of both, Joshua and Ethan, have been preserved in the morgues, Rowan’s funeral will be held on Tuesday.

“Ideally, an offence should be registered against the car owner for letting his minor son drive his car. But here, as the car owner is dead, we can’t move against him,” a police official dealing with the investigations told TOI.

The police are also yet to recover the mangled remains of the car that lies in the ravine at the Verna plateau. “We will have to requisition the services of a bigger crane from a private agency,” a police source said.

Police were also unable to figure out if the three deceased would frequent the place where the accident occurred. “We aren’t yet able to speak to the kin of the deceased as they are visibly shocked and shaken,” a police official said.

HYDERABAD: A 43-year-old doctor, who was also managing director of Shri Adithya Hospitals, allegedly committed suicide by shooting himself in the temple with his licensed weapon at his residence at Saket Mithila near Dammaiguda in the early hours of Monday.

A tiff with his wife or financial stress could be the trigger for Dr Ravindra Kumar, an anaesthetist, to take the extreme step, Jawahar Nagar police suspect . He was alone at home when the incident happened. The doctor’s licensed pistol was recovered from near his body.

Incidentally, it was the second such incident in the past two months. On February 4, a 40-year-old doctor and managing director of a private hospital at LB Nagar committed suicide by hanging in the hospital premises.

Ravindra, who had a surgery appointment on Monday afternoon, was inaccessible to his staff over phone since morning. When hospital staff, including his sister-in-law, the sister of Ravindra’s wife, reached his duplex house at the gated community at 11.30am, he was found dead in a pool of blood in the bedroom on the first floor. His face was covered with dried blood, cops said.

On Sunday, around 11pm, Ravindra's wife Dr Smitha had left the house in a huff after a tiff with the former over attending a family function and went to her parents’ house at Dilsukhnagar, Jawahar Nagar inspector PB Rao told the media.

“At 2am, he made a phone call to talk to his 12-year-old son. After speaking to the child, Ravindra might have committed suicide. We are probing the cause of death as there is no suicide note. The family gave a complaint that it could be suicide,” Rao added. Police said a bullet injury was found on the temple. The statements of family members has also been recorded.

Ravindra and Dr Smitha, who oversee functioning of Sri Aditya Hospital, had established the health facility at Dammaiguda 7 years ago. Ravindra, according to his hospital staff, had studied at Kakatiya Medical College in Warangal .

276,['10/03/2020'],Ham radio operators made communication easy,"Thiruvananthapuram: At a time when thousands throng an area, communication becomes the toughest task. For police and disaster management wing, proper communication is paramount. For the first time, the district administration roped in a group of amateur/ham radio operators, who made communication and co-ordination seamless.

Members of Radio Amateur Society of Ananthapuri (RASA), who functioned inside the police control room near the Attukal temple premises and control room at collectorate, coordinated crucial information such as co-ordination of 108 ambulances, shifting of foreigners from the pongala area, search for missing children etc.

The deployment of RASA members was part of the constitution of inter-agency group by the district administration for disaster management activities. Though RASA was initially convened to co-ordinate the activities of ‘108’ ambulances, soon they were entrusted with management of different types of communications.

Amateur radio or ham radio is the use of radio frequency spectrum for exchange of messages. It is widely used at the time of disasters or for emergency communication when other modes of communications are ineffective.

RASA secretary Saji K George said that ham radios are highly effective at events which witness a bid crowd, where communication through mobile phone becomes difficult due to network issues. “We had around 20 amateur radio operators on field and others were coordinating information in the control rooms. This helped police to focus more on law and order,” said George.

George said that they didn’t find any difficulty as collector K Gopikrishnan and DGP Loknath Behra were also ham radio operators. “They are not active users. But being hams, it was easy to be part of the discussions,” he said.

George said that with the use of a set of codes, communication is easy and clear in amateur radios. “For example, QRZ is used to ask who is calling me and QTH for location. So there is no question of lack of clarity,” he said.

RASA president Dr Zakkir Hussain said that the organization was started in 2012 and they were active in co-ordinating information during the last flood. Being a doctor, Hussain also handles emergency medical situations near the temple.

RASA has a repeater station at Kerala State Science and Technology Museum, which enables them to amplify the effects of their walkie talkies. “In normal cases, the communications through walkie talkies are possible in 2-km radius, while the repeater station helped it to amplify it to 20-km radius,” he said.

The RASA team meets on first Saturday of every month. For details, contact rasaletter@gmail.com.

“Because enemy’s enemy is my friend. We want to defeat BJP and its alliance candidates,” Sardinha told reporters at the Congress South Goa district office in Margao. Acknowledging that MGP helped him win the previous Lok Sabha elections, Sardinha said it was the party’s obligation to support MGP this time.

He added that in Goa, while Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was the ‘B’ team of BJP, NCP was also in cahoots with the saffron party. “NCP is our greatest ally in Maharashtra, but not in Goa. NCP in Goa is in the pockets of BJP,” he said. He urged people not vote for AAP or NCP because both parties “are nothing but allies of BJP”. Voting for them, he said, was like voting for BJP.

Queried over the party’s failure in fielding a candidate in Sancoale constituency where BJP won the seat unopposed, Sardinha termed the development as “very unfortunate” even as he said it was a case of “match fixing” but declined to elaborate.

To a query over Congress’s move of fielding Royla Fernandes in Benaulim constituency, who had contested the previous assembly polls as AAP candidate, Sardinha said, “Perhaps she has realised her mistake of going with AAP and has now merged with the ocean that Congress is.”

Speaking at the International Women’s Day event in EVR Periyar College, Trichy on Monday, she recalled an eight-year-old girl from Manipur, who had responded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi through social media post for his gesture of surrendering social media accounts to woman achievers as part of Woman’s Day celebration. Through a social media post, the girl had asked the Prime Minister to not celebrate women if he is not going to listen to them. Elizabeth said that she liked what the 8-year-old said as the society needs to change the way it looks at women.

As women are considered weak and subjected to violence, it is one of the things that keep women behind, she said and added that violence is prevalent in the society.

She said women need to get over the idea of being physically weak or mentally weak. Let us stop this falsehood that women do not have strength or not capable of doing things that men can do, she said.

Giving examples of women engaged in labour-centric works, she said women should not be seen either as objects by men nor an instrument for the development of the family or society.

“A woman must study not because her family must improve but she has the rights to study and develop, she said. Similarly, she should be allowed to marry only if she feels like marrying and not because her friends and relatives are getting married,” said Elizabeth.

“Today because of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and anti-CAA protests, people are remembering Ambedkar,” she said while asking students to read works by B R Ambedkar and rationalist Periyar EVR, who spoke about eradication of caste and woman empowerment.

Corporation primary school at Edaimalaipattipudur has inducted the students by organising a grand annual day event on Sunday. The event also helped the school fulfill its requirements as parents offered necessary materials including stationery and furniture worth Rs 2.5 lakh to the school.

The newly-admitted students were welcomed in decorated vehicles and the school authorities felicitated them with garlands and crowns.

The idea was to ensure that schooling remains a joyous affair for the kids, said school headmistress P Jayanthi.

The school, which has been making private schools a run for their money, is no less than any private schools. Students are exposed to electronic gadgets for smart learning at the school.

Students are involved in sports, music, and in-door games free of cost. “We have been focusing on engaging children into extra-curricular activities with no additional fee. It has made many parents pull out their children from private schools and enroll them here,” said H Pushpalatha, assistant teacher.

The school has managed to enroll around 100 students in class 1 last year too when many government schools were struggling to get students. There is a general perception that government school lack basic infrastructure, but this school is an exception, said S Anandhi, a parent.

She had enrolled her children at the school after getting transfer certificate from a private school. She says that she has been giving the money spent on fee at the private school to the corporation school so that they can buy necessary things for the students.

Little wonder, thermal plants are on top of the heap by attracting Rs 61,374 crore investments. But the real estate sector, including industrial parks and IT buildings, is not far behind as it has emerged as the second biggest gainer in India’s youngest state in the last five years.With Rs 37,667 crore investments in its kitty under the Telangana State Industrial Project Approval and Self-Certification System (TSiPASS), the realty sector is laughing all the way to the bank. Solar and other renewable energy sources are not lagging behind with Rs 17,519 crore investments to boot, according to a report of Socio-Economic Outlook-2020 of Telangana.Despite the slowdown, the biggest gainer has been the real estate field. Telangana Developers’ Association president GV Rao said growth in the sector was unaffected as it was linked to the state’s growth rate, especially in IT (14%) and pharma (15%) sectors, this financial year.According to official stastics, IT exports had increased to Rs 1.09 lakh crore 2018-19. “Going by the growth in the IT and pharma sectors, one lakh new jobs have been created in the last couple of years for which 1 crore square feet commercial space and 2.5 crore sq feet residential space is required for employees (as per estimates, 100 sq ft is required for each employee),” Rao explained.He further said a stable regime and sound policies of the government plus law and order also helped the growth rate in real estate and other sectors despite a dull economic scenario.Confirming this, senior officials said the real estate sector remained largely unaffected in Telangana, especially Hyderabad, and bagged huge investments from 161 units. A majority of the investments were made in IT buildings in the IT corridor in Greater Hyderabad, officials recalled.It may be recalled that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao recently said that over five lakh people were working in the IT corridor alone.According to the Socio-Economic report, 11,857 industries (22 categories) had made investments to the tune of Rs 1,84,655 crore in the last five years. Another plus was employment was provided to 13 lakh people. The report said over seven lakh people were employed in the realty sector and another 1.96 lakh gained employment in the textile sector.Since thermal power projects require huge investments, 16 units alone pitched in Rs 61,374 crore. Many projects were taken up by TSGenco and Singareni Collieries Company Ltd and executed by private agencies. Solar and other renewable energy units also received a big boost with private developers setting up about 200 units generating 3,000 MW daily.“Of the 11,857 industries, 9,020 became operational and 764 units are under advanced stage.

Scindia was welcome in the saffron camp and party workers cheered but top leaders, however, stuck to the official line that it was “Congress’s internal matter”. Only BJP chief whip in assembly, Narottam Mishra — accused by Congress of trying to poach ruling alliance MLAs last week — said Scindia would be greeted warmly by BJP.

“There must have been some compulsions that led him (Scindia) to take this decision. Everyone is heartily welcome in BJP. Scindiaji is definitely welcome,” said Mishra. There was euphoria at the party HQ, when the party’s state in-charge, Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, state party chief V D Sharma and leader of opposition Gopal Bhargava arrived.

There were smiles all around, but the top leadership was careful with its words. “We are here to discuss Rajya Sabha polls.

285,['10/03/2020'],"Khaunte moves HC, seeks quashing of FIR against him","Panaji: With Goa police functioning without a police act and manual, Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte approached the high court of Bombay at Goa seeking quashing of the FIR registered against him for allegedly assaulting a BJP office bearer a month ago.

The high court on Monday issued notices to the police inspector at the Porvorim police station and Premanand Mhambre, the BJP functionary who complained that he was manhandled by Khaunte.

During the hearing, counsel Shailendra Bhobe representing Khaunte told the court that Khaunte is seeking institutionalisation of the process and that police should have a checklist so that there is no interference in the process.

The government was questioned by the court over Goa police functioning without a police manual.

Bhobe said Khaunte was, without reason, slapped with Section 323 (causing voluntary hurt) and Section 341 (wrongful restraint) of the India Penal Code, which are bailable offences.

Bhobe added that Khaunte was arrested in a bailable office at 1am and that this shouldn’t happen to someone else.

In his petition the Provorim MLA stated that the case against him was one of political vendetta and was an act to pressurise, intimidate and blackmail him and desist him from highlighting the failures of the government.

Acting on Mhambre’s complaint, Porvorim police had booked Khaunte around 10pm on February 5. He was then arrested from his residence around 1.50am on February 6 and released around 2.30am on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 5,000.

Mhambre had said that Khaunte reacted angrily in response to a press conference he had addressed as BJP spokesperson on February 5 raising certain issues pertaining to the assets and businesses of the independent MLA from Porvorim constituency.

Khaunte had denied the charge that he assaulted Mhambre. Former chief minister Pratapsing Rane, who was an eye witness to the incident, had also reacted saying it was a false allegation by BJP against Khaunte.

But a new variety of rice developed and cultivated by Professor Jayashankar Telangana Agriculture University may not only help in reducing blood glucose, it may also help in fighting cardiovascular diseases.According to the researchers, the new variety — ‘Telangana Sona’ — has only 51.6% glucose when compared to other varieties which have between 55% and 62% glucose. Another important finding about this variety is that it has less carbohydrates than even millets, according to National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Secunderabad.A paper on Sona has now been published in a recent issue of the reputed American Journal of Food Nutrition as useful variety with low glycemic index (GI). The researchers say the variety is effective in reducing type 2 diabetes.“In conclusion, it can be reported from the study that the low GI rice RNR 15048 can be useful therapeutic diet that helps in reduction of blood glucose and elevation in plasma HDL Cholesterol levels in patients with type 2 diabetes,” the paper states. Food low on GI release glucose slowly and steadily. Foods high on GI release glucose rapidly.Sona was developed by the university three years ago along with another variety named after Bathukamma, Telangana’s floral festival celebrated during Dasara. “Since then, we have been promoting this variety. A few lakh hectares in Telangana have been converted into Sona cultivation,” professor Pravin Rao, vice chancellor of the university, told TOI. “I can say this is the most authentic diabetic-friendly developed in the country.”Officials say that the variety is also farmer-friendly as it gives yield in very short span when compared to other varieties.

The NH was commissioned for public use about six years back but without a service road for 14.5 km stretch between Palpannai and Thuvakudi.

In the absence of the service road, commuters especially two-wheeler riders were falling victims to fatal accidents. Subsequently, the federation for retrieval of Trichy-Palpannai-Thuvakudi service road in March 2016 filed a case in Madras high court seeking the service road. The final judgment for the case came on October 15, 2019, directing the stakeholder departments to lay the service road within six months. Despite the court’s order, residents said that an inordinate delay persists in commencing the land acquisition.

“While more than four months have passed since the court passed an order, no progress was made by the authorities. Without service road, we are using the NH under constant fear,” S Subramanian, chief organizer of the federation said. The federation said that they will continue and intensify their agitations including road blockade if the district administration further delays the construction of service road. Sources from the stakeholder departments said that a revised Land Plan Schedule (LPS) is being chalked out by NHAI to calculate the extent of land required for the acquisition process. Once the revised LPS is submitted to the revenue department, official sources said that 3D notification will be released and published in the newspapers as per The National Highways Act to initiate land acquisition.

289,['10/03/2020'],MP takes up plant quarantine official’s posting with Centre,"Trichy: Su Thirunavukkarasar, MP has taken up with the Centre the non-availability of a dedicated officer at the Trichy airport to issue plant quarantine certificate to authorize export of perishable products. He met Union minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar recently and pointed out the difficulties faced by exporters at the airport due to this.

Perishable commodities like vegetables, fruits and flowers constitute 85% of the total volume of consignments sent from Trichy airport predominantly to Singapore, Dubai, Sharjah, Kuala Lumpur and Colombo. The remaining 15% of exports is of non-perishables like garments and pharma products.

However, exporters have been hamstrung by the non-availability of dedicated certifying officials for perishable products which need a phytosanitary certificate from the plant quarantine department under the ministry of agriculture. Customs officials clear the consignments only on furnishing the certificate. In the absence of a proper office and officials at the cargo terminal, exporters have to go to the plant quarantine office located at Khajamalai, 4 kilometres away from the airport. This also delays their consignments, said the president of express courier operators association, S A Sayeed.

“The signing authorities are available only on weekdays at the plan quarantine office between 7 am and 3 pm, not on weekends. Also, with no dedicated officer, officials in charge have been coming from Chennai or Kochi, which sometimes causes losses to the exporters.

290,['10/03/2020'],Coronavirus scare: Markets slump as Delhi misses Holi cheer,"In northeast Delhi, which is limping back to normalcy amid an undertone of unease, not many people are ready f... Read More

NEW DELHI: The Holi ebullience is certainly missing this year. Instead of the laughter and levity associated with the festival, there is a sense of seriousness around, in no small measure due to the growing reach of the novel coronavirus. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced he would forego the celebrations, as did chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who added sensitivity to the plight of riot victims to the sweep of Covid-19. So there aren’t going to be too many Holi milan gatherings in the city this year. Consequently, business related to the festival of colours is reported to be down at least by half.

With no reason for cheer, the Defence Colony Market Association has cancelled all celebrations. Rajinder Malik, president of the Association, said, “Our businesses were already hit by the sealing and economic slowdown. Now this coronavirus fear, due to which people are not coming to the markets. When there is no revenue generation, what festival cheer are we talking about?”

In the Walled City, Sanjay Bhargava of the Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal fully concurred: “The massive slump in business at festival time is the combined effect of the riots and the coronavirus.”

Some markets are trying to attract customers with special measures, but to little avail. The traders’ association at Sarojini Nagar market has been offering free hand sanitisers and face masks to customers, even given out 2,500 masks till date. But as Ashok Randhawa of the association revealed, business is still down more than 50%. “We faced the first slump when the riots broke out in northeast Delhi, but the coronavirus scare has worsened the situation,” he said.

It is no better in the posher markets of south Delhi. The Greater Kailash M Block market association estimated that around 75% of the Holi retail business has been affected by Covid-19. Rajender Sharda, president of the body, said their Holi milan programme too stood cancelled. “This gathering is a tradition for the market, but this year we decided not to organise a meeting for fear of infection,” he explained. “Besides, business is not doing well with the entire chain from wholesale to retail being impacted.”

With Holi enthusiasm on the ebb, Sanjeev Jain sits waiting for customers. “My shop is empty for you to see,” he said glumly. “We ordered our goods from China before December, but it seems it will be difficult to clear our stocks this season.” Yogesh Singhal, member of the Bullion and Jewellers Association in Chandni Chowk, said gold and silver normally sold less at this time due to the inauspicious Holashtak period. But even the nominal transactions were affected by the viral scare.

In northeast Delhi, which is limping back to normalcy amid an undertone of unease, not many people are ready for the usual bonhomie between communities. In a lane in Maujpur, women observed the Holika puja on Monday and one of them, identifying herself as Monica, said, “It will be a quiet affair this year. For shagun, we will apply some gulal, but no going all out. There’s fear even now and police are around. We have told our children not to go far from home. Also, since the exams were postponed due to the violence, the children need to study.”

In such a scenario, the shopkeepers don’t have much to do. Ramesh Kumar Gaur, president of the market association of Maujpur and Ghonda, said, “Usually we put the Holi powders, balloons and pichkari on display a week before the festival, but this year we could start selling them only by March 4. Business has been poor, and only if we sell the products at half their price will we perhaps be able to get rid of the stock.”

Gaur quantified the slide in business by disclosing that he had sold around Rs 50,000 worth of Holi wares this season against Rs 2-3 lakh in earlier years. “There is no communal harmony this year and the coronavirus has added to the gloom,” he claimed.

VELLORE: A 13-year-old girl was gang-raped by three men who tore her clothes to rags before assaulting her at Mettupalayam village near Vaniyambadi on Friday evening when she went to the Palar riverbank for her ablutions. The child had to cover herself in a ragged dhoti left behind by mourners at the burial ground where the accused raped her to return home and tell her mother what had happened. Police arrested three men suspected to be the rapists, on Sunday night.

Police booked M Chandru, 24, P Parthiban, 21, and R Kannan, 30, all daily wagers of Vaniyambadi, under the Pocso Act and a local court sent them to Vellore central prison on Monday. The girl told police she hadn’t notice the men who were sitting and drinking when she went to the riverbank, 500 metres from her home. They grabbed her and took her to a burial ground nearby and took turns raping her.

When she resisted, they threatened to stab her with a broken beer bottle. After the men left, the child scrounged around for something to cover herself as her clothes had been completely torn up. She found a soiled dhoti, one of those left behind by people who come to bury their dead, and covered herself with it before rushing home.The girl’s father had died of an illness two years ago and she was raised by her mother. The child had dropped out of school a year ago because they could not afford it.

Her mother took the child to the Vaniyambadi government hospital and lodged a complaint with police who launched a hunt for the three. The child knew who the three men were as they lived in the locality.

K Mangayarkarasi, inspector of the Vaniyambadi taluk police station, said all three accused were arrested under IPC Section 376 (punishment for rape) and Section 506(II) (punishment for criminal intimidation) and Sections 5 and 6 of the Pocso Act.

The child was discharged from hospital on Monday morning.

292,['10/03/2020'],ED lens on Kapoor’s Rs 380-cr mansion in tony Delhi area,"Rana Kapoor's bungalow at 40, Amrita Shergill Marg in Delhi

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate’s probe into Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor ’s alleged corruption will look into his acquisition of a big bungalow on Amrita Shergill Marg in Delhi, as well as properties in Mumbai, the US, the UK and France.

Sources said Kapoor acquired the bungalow at 40, Amrita Shergill Marg for around Rs 380 crore. Gautam Thapar, the previous owner, had mortgaged the property spread over 1.2 acres, one of country’s most expensive pieces of real estate, to Yes Bank for a corporate loan of Rs 600 crore.

Barely weeks after Thapar expressed willingness to sell the property to settle his dues with Yes Bank, Kapoor’s wife Bindu launched a shell company, Bliss Abode Pvt Ltd, in March 2017. The bank invited bids before selling the bungalow to the just-launched Bliss Abode for Rs 380 crore which was a fraction more than the highest quote. ED sources said the sale was scripted and Yes Bank only went through the motion of inviting bids before allowing the luxurious mansion to be taken over by Bliss Abode, which it suspects had been launched only with the purpose of acquiring the property.

Other properties belonging to Kapoor include a plot in the vicinity of Mukesh Ambani’s Antilla, eight-nine flats in an apartment complex promoted by Indiabulls in Mumbai and properties in the US, the UK and France.

The ED is also looking into Kapoor’s dealings with Indiabulls. The agency has registered a case against Kapoor, his wife and daughters under PMLA and has identified several shell firms the family members allegedy operated to launder bribes that the Yes Bank co-founder collected from companies. These transactions had been under the ED’s lens since it started investigating Dewan Housing Finance Limited and its promoters, the Wadhawans.

The appellant was convicted by the trial court under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code with imprisonment for life.

The high court found that the sessions court judge “totally erred in coming to the conclusion that the accused is last seen at the spot of the incident” and added that one of the panch witnesses has acted as panch witness in many cases of Ponda police station. The high court also stated that the panch witness is working as a home guard for the past eight years and is now posted at Ponda police station.

“Moreover, the last seen theory cannot be made applicable, unless the accused was seen along with the deceased within the proximate time of his death,” the court observed.

The high court also stated that the “chain of circumstantial evidence is not at all complete to hold that the accused is the only author of the crime. Furthermore, the questions were not put to the accused while recording her statement under Section 313 of the CrPC upon which the learned trial court heavily relied on”.

The high court went on to state that the CCTV footage is not that clear to identify the lady in the footage as the accused, which is evident from the evidence of the witnesses.

The court acquitted the woman stating that the prosecution failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the murder of her husband.

295,['10/03/2020'],Madras HC rejects MP’s GI tag claim for basmati rice,"Chennai: Madhya Pradesh government’s struggle to join the elite ‘basmati’ league has failed once again as the Madras high court has dismissed the state’s plea seeking geographical indication ( GI ) tag for basmati rice grown in areas falling under the state.

A division bench of Justice R Subbiah and C Saravanan also refused to quash an order passed by the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) granting GI certificate to basmati to Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA)

Noting that for a same produce, two GI certificates of registration cannot be issued and precisely that is the reason why MP government has approached the court, the bench said, “At the same time, we have to observe that the petitioners have an alternative and efficacious remedy available by filing an application to the registrar of trademark seeking to cancel or vary the GI certificate issued to APEDA.”

The issue pertains to an order passed by IPAB on February 5, 2016, granting GI certificate to basmati in favour of APEDA. Aggrieved, MP government contended that such GI tag cannot be awarded to APEDA as some of the regions falling under MP which also produce basmati have been omitted from the list provided by APEDA.

However, observing that the documents and evidence filed by Madhya Pradesh show the importance, special characteristics of rice cultivated in the state but not basmati cultivation in the traditional growing area, the IPAB rejected its claim.

Challenging the rejection order and the order granting GI tag to basmati in favour of APEDA, the MP government had moved the present appeal in the high court.

In May 2010, GI status was given to basmati grown only in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and parts of western Uttar Pradesh, and Jammu & Kashmir. Madhya Pradesh moved a statutory opposition demanding that its 13 districts be recognised as traditional basmati growing regions.

The 13 districts of Madhya Pradesh which have been excluded from the tag are Monera, Vidisha, Bhind, Raisen, Gwalior, Sehore, Sheopur, Hoshangabad, Datia, Jabalpur, Shivpuri, Narsinghpur and Guna.

According to MP government, these 13 districts have been growing basmati for several decades and they have been located in the Indo-Gangetic plains having climatic conditions favourable for cultivation of basmati. Non-inclusion of the state in the basmati growing areas would have an adverse effect on the lives of farmers who mainly depend on basmati cultivation, it said.

Major political parties are busy making sure the necessary logistics are in place for their campaigns. While key leaders are busy lobbying for tickets, a few aspirants have started campaigns in their divisions.

On Monday, the Andhra Pradesh State Election Commission (APSEC) issued notifications for the municipal elections. State election commissioner N Ramesh Kumar and municipal administration commissioner G Vijaya Kumar, while addressing media conference, said that municipal elections will be held only in 12 of the 15 municipal corporations in the state. Out of 104 municipalities, elections will be held in 75 constituencies.

The nomination process will commence from March 11 to March 13. Political parties are yet to finalise viable candidates.

Opposition parties are unhappy with the reservations and the election process. Telugu Desam party and Jana Sena alleged that the state government intentionally issued an ordinance to complete the election process within 15 days. “It is very tough for any political party to face elections within two weeks. Selection of candidates, nominations, the campaign should be done in two weeks which is not at all sufficient. YSRC is conspiring to win elections by not giving any time to the opposition parties to prepare for the local body elections,” said B Rama Mohana Rao, Jana Sena’s Vijayawada east region in charge.

Some political parties expressed their dissatisfaction over the ward-wise reservations notified by the district administration for VMC. Left parties alleged that reservations and delimitation of election wards were made based on the instructions of the ruling party. Out of 19 general women seats, 10 wards were situated in Vijayawada east constituency, which is facing severe criticism from the political parties.

YSRC and Telugu Desam are eyeing to release the first list of candidates by Tuesday evening and are likely to start filing nominations from Wednesday.

297,['10/03/2020'],Goa: Colvale jail inmates bake recipe of reformation,"Bakery products with the label manufactured at Colvale Central Jail.

PANAJI: The next time you shop at the nearest supermarket, don’t be surprised to stumble upon bakery products with the label ‘manufactured at Colvale Central Jail’.

Inmates are trading their prison clothes for aprons in an effort by jail authorities to rehabilitate them and provide an opportunity to earn some income. The prison houses 553 inmates, including males and females.

The bakery at Colvale jail has been operational for quite sometime, and inmates are being trained to manufacture cakes, cookies, biscuits and patties, additional inspector general of prisons Ashutosh Apte told TOI. These items are consumed by inmates. Sometimes they also receive special orders from outside.

The jail administration wants to add more products to the list so that when they approach the supermarket, they can supply a variety of products.

“All our bakery products are delicious ,” Apte said, while praising the efforts of the inmates. The idea behind initiating commercial supply was to allow people to sample the items manufactured in the jail, he said.

“We have applied for a licence from the Food and Drugs Administration. We will also conduct a fire audit and apply for GST registration to begin commercial operations,” he said.

At present, the items will be supplied to supermarkets. Based on the demand, they plan to gradually expand production and reach out to maximum shops in the state. Gauging from this success, jail authorities then plan to scale up the business by opening standalone stores across the state.

Apte said they also plan to start commercial supply of furniture. “Many inmates are skilled in carpentry.

298,['10/03/2020'],Rivals urge VMC not to display Jagan’s pictures on govt bldgs,"Vijayawada: While officials of Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) and the Krishna district administration are focused on implementing the model code of conduct , opposition parties have been requesting them to immediately cover chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy’s photograph printed on hoardings of ward and village secretariats across the district.

VMC’s town planning wing, on Monday, started removing flex banners and posters of political parties erected across the city. They also covered a few statues of key politicians in the city. The posters of a few government schemes, with the photos of ministers, were also removed following instructions in the model code of conduct.

“Village secretariats are local administration centres. Ward secretariats are visited by hundreds of citizens daily. The chief minister’s photograph on secretariats will influence voters. Majority of the secretariats were painted with YSRC colors and the Election Commission refused to take action and the issue is pending with the high court. We strongly demand the state Election Commission remove the CM’s photo from village secretariats across the state,” Jana Sena’s local body elections in-charge Pothina Venkata Mahesh said.

CPM state secretariat member Ch Babu Rao said that they would submit a representation to the VMC commissioner and other officials on Tuesday and request them to cover the chief minister photographs.

VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh, speaking to TOI, said that they would strictly implement the model code of conduct and remove any material which could influence voters. He said that they have already started covering the CM’s photographs on ward secretariats in the city and the process would be completed by Tuesday evening. Venkatesh added that covering statues was not necessary as per the model code of conduct, but they were still being covered as a regular practice.

The Union government had on Friday directed all ministries to suspend biometric attendance till March 31 as the virus is prone to spread through touch.

Director of school education S Kannappan told TOI that following the Centre’s move, teachers in the state were asking for exemption from registering attendance using AeBAS.

A circular from the directorate to chief education officers and district education officers said that all teachers in government and aided elementary, middle, high and higher secondary schools and non-teaching staff in offices should sign in attendance registers.

Members of the Tamil Nadu Government Employees Teachers Association had on Saturday written to the directorate seeking exemption from using the biometric system. Association president S Arunan said as people successively touch the biometric system, it posed a risk of the virus spreading.

Teachers said there were apprehensions about using the system. “We have been wiping the apparatus using cotton wool before using it,” said state auditor of the Tamil Nadu High and Higher Secondary School Graduate Teacher Association (TNHHSSGTA) T Arulanandam.

While awareness programmes are being taken up in some government schools, teachers said it is not enough. “Children in primary sections are yet to be made aware of the disease properly. There have not been any structured preventive measures or precautions as such in government schools,” Arulanandam added.

300,['10/03/2020'],"Folks ready to celebrate Holi with fun, family and friends","‘Holika dahan’, the ritual burning of Holika marks the end of evil, a day prior to Holi

Nagpur: A splash of bright coloured gulal on dresses to enjoying special sweets and savoury dishes, the festival of Holi is all about fun and frolic. The festival of colour and joy, Holi, which marks the beginning of spring and harvest season will be celebrated in the city on Tuesday. Citizens will perform a pooja on the night before Holika dahan, the ritual burning of Holika which also marks end of evil.

Thanks to concerns about water shortages and pollution, many are looking forward to have a dry and ecofriendly Holi while some don't want to miss out on the fun of using water sprays and guns.

Showing his concern on the acute water crisis the city faces, environmental activist Kaustav Chatterjee said, “Last year Nagpur faced acute water crisis during summer. Hence, wasting water in holi should be avoided. Post Holi too, a lot of water is wasted in removing colour stains from vehicles and buildings. Water balloons should be strictly avoided as they choke sewer lines.”

Colours available in market contain toxic substances like copper sulphate (green), aluminium bromide (silver), mercury sulphate (red) that can cause serious injuries to eyes and skin. “Heavy metals like lead, chromium, cadmium, nickel, zinc etc which are highly injurious to health and are found in all chemical based colours. Hence, one must play with natural colours,"" said Chatterjee, who is also founder of Green Vigil Foundation.

Apart from the splashing colour on each other playing music loudly. Feast prepared at households is the main attraction of the festival. ""On the day of Holika dahan, a traditional sweet 'Lapsi' is prepared as bhog. Before puja, sisters performs aarti of brother with badkule mala (made with cow dung) which is then burnt with Holika to ward off evil eye,"" said Kiran Mundra, a homemaker.

Gulal, thandai and gujhiyas are best combination for the festival of colors. ""We gather along with our neighborhood and do holika pujan and distribute sweets. Holi is all about friends, colour and fun. Post that, we have lunch together generally prepared by all of us. I am making pan thandai and gujhiya for tomorrow,"" said Debashree Chatterji, a teacher.

Ruchika Asatkar, a food and lifestyle blogger, calls the festival of Holi a walk down memory lane as it reminds her of childhood days. ""Holi is very close to my heart. My family gathers to one place and we play Holi with gulal and colours and shake legs to Hindi songs,” she said.

“ My mother and aunties make chana, chhole, chiwda, gujhiya , laddoos and we cousins eat them all day while playing and dancing,"" she added.

Sharing his thoughts about ecofriendly Holi, yet having fun Srujal Randive, a student said, ""We as youngsters must be aware of our responsibilities and ensure people around us do not waste water. Children can enjoy with small water guns but I will be celebrating dry Holi this year."" he said.

CHENNAI: A gang of six men on Sunday beat two history-sheeters to death when the two went to settle a love matter involving one of their friends during a volleyball match at Ponneri, 45km from Chennai, in Tiruvallur district, police said.

A team sent the bodies of Veera and Sudhakar, who were hammered with cricket bats, stumps and stones, to the government hospital in Ponneri for postmortem, while Gautham, their friend, fled. Police later arrested D Jayaprakash, 26, R Deepan, 22, R Ranjith, 22, and V Sugan, 22, of Periya Colony in Aaladu near Ponneri, P Samuvel, 22, of Pudu Kacheri Road, and J Harish Kumar, 22, of Sakthi Nagar and charged them with murder. A court sent them to jail on Monday.

Police said Gautham and his friend Jayaprakash had fallen in love with a girl student of a Gummidipoondi college after befriending her through Facebook.

Friends turn foes after knowing their love interest was the same

However, after coming to know that their love interest was the same, the close friends turned foes.

A few days ago, Gautham greeted Jayaprakash, a diploma holder in electrical and electronics engineering, and tried to reach out to him but was snubbed, a police officer said.

On Sunday, the officer said, Gautham asked Veera, 25, and Sudhakar, 26, to help him patch up with Jayaprakash and to warn him to stay away from his girlfriend.

Veera and Sudhakar, of Venpakkam village in Ponneri, were involved in 4-5 criminal cases, including a 2018 murder, at different police stations in Tiruvallur district.

Aware that Jayaprakash was playing volleyball with some friends in Aaladu village, the two men and Gautham went there to make peace. But a fresh quarrel broke out and soon turned into a fist fight.

Jayaprakash and the five others attacked the two men and smashed their heads with stones, killing them on the spot, said the officer.

Sudhakar is survived by his newly wed wife, while Veera was a bachelor.

Later, special teams formed by Tiruvallur district superintendent of police P Aravindan nabbed the six men. Further investigations are on.

CHENNAI: State assembly speaker P Dhanapal has extended the deadline by 10 more days for the 11 MLAs, who voted against the Edappadi K Palaniswami government during the trust vote on February 18, 2017, to reply to his notice . The 11 lawmakers include deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam and minister K Pandiarajan.

“The speaker issued notices independently to all 11 MLAs and gave them four weeks’ time. Some MLAs have replied while others sought more time. The speaker has set March 16 as the new deadline,” said a senior official, seeking anonymity. “Once all the MLAs reply, the speaker will take a decision,” said the official.

The DMK had moved the SC seeking their disqualification for having voted against the Palaniswami government when they were in the rebel camp led by OPS. By doing so, they had violated the ruling party whip and attracted disqualification under the anti-defection law, the DMK had stated in its petition.

On February 14, the state government had informed the Supreme Court that the assembly speaker had initiated action on the DMK petition, which accused him of not acting on a plea seeking disqualification of the 11 AIADMK lawmakers. The SC bench took note of the submission and disposed of the DMK petition.

“I received the notice and since then I have been busy collating documents to reply to the speaker. I have been asked to reply within a week,” Mettur AIADMK MLA S Semmalai told TOI. Semmalai and nine others had quit the AIADMK to team up with OPS when he tendered his resignation as chief minister and launched his ‘dharmayudh’ against V K Sasikala and her family.

DMK propaganda secretary Thanga Tamilselvan said he called on the speaker a few days ago and asked him about the pending case. Thanga Tamilselvan was one of the 18 MLAs (backing AMMK leader T T V Dhinakaran) who were disqualified for expressing lack of confidence in chief minister Palaniswami. He has since joined the DMK.

“I told the speaker that when 18 MLAs could be disqualified for expressing lack of confidence in the chief minister, how could the 11 MLAs, who voted against the government be permitted to continue,” said Thanga Tamilselvan.

Wherever there used to be a crowd, it is not happening now – people are getting little scared.”“However, it is not as bad as is what is portrayed. On the social media this scare is going on — there was a WhatsApp message being circulated which said that things would be bad towards the end of this week. Further, from today onwards, you have this caller tune on phones being changed [to the Covid-19 precautionary warning] and that is creating an even bigger scare,” he said.“We haven’t come to the crisis part yet, this is only the beginning. It is inversely proportional — as the crisis goes up, the less will be the number of footfalls in shops,” said Aswani, who is also the co-chairman of the Kerala chapter of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).Aswani cited the tourism industry as another victim of Covid-19. “Earlier the flights [that brought in tourists to Kerala] were full, but they are not so packed nowadays,” he said.According to staff at the Centre Square Mall, the decline is 20%, compared to a normal day of the current season. “Footfalls had been coming down and the trend was noticed for the last three days.

“A private hospital was treating a person with coronavirus symptoms. It is good that the medical reports of the person turned out to be negative, but the hospital had failed to inform the administration about the development. We have issued them a notice,” district collector Suraj Mandhare said.

Mandhare pointed out that the administration had issued a notification under the provisions of the District Disaster Management Act (DDMA) in which the civil surgeon, Nashik, and the district health officer (DHO) have been appointed as incident commanders and they will be taking all the measures related to containing the spread of the virus.

“Under the provisions of the DDMA, organisations have to comply with the orders of the incident commander. In this case, the hospitals have to follow all government guidelines and report to the respective incident commanders of their region. The failure will attract direct action,” the collector said.

He added that all the hotels, industries, resorts and recreational centres across the district have been asked to inform the administration about the movement of the foreigners or even foreign-returned Indian nationals if it is within 15 days since their landing in India.

Meanwhile, district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal on Monday took a round-up of the responsive agencies. Civil surgeon C S Jadgale, police commissioner Vishwas Nangare-Patil, NMC commissioner Radhakrishna Game, district superintendent of police Arti Singh, CEO zilla parishad, Nashik, Leena Bansod and others were present at the meeting. Bhujbal advised the citizens to stay away from gatherings and follow all the protocols prescribed.

He also appealed to the people to not buy masks, as they are only required by the people who are in close contact with a patient or will be dealing with them for long periods, like the nurses, doctors and relatives.

Jagdale said that the Civil Hospital would require a few more ventilators and monitors for the treatment of patients if and when they are admitted.

Bhujbal has sought a detailed list of the equipment required which, he said, would be forwarded to the state government and necessary steps would be taken.

He had landed in the Trichy airport and was travelling home, when he realized he had a cold. Instead of proceeding to his hometown, he stopped in Coimbatore and approached CMCH for treatment.A throat swab taken from the man was sent to the King Institute for testing, deputy director of public health Dr Ramesh said. “He came to CMCH at 7.15pm. Doctors, who had coronavirus test kits, collected throat swab, and sent him to ESI Hospital’s quarantine ward,” he said. “He had landed in Trichy on Sunday. If he tests positive, we will trace everyone he was in contact with, including drivers of vehicles he travelled in and people who served him at hotels.”Officials said the man, who was travelling to Thrissur from the Trichy airport alone, was told by his family not to come home. “When the man told them he had a cold, his family asked him not to come home, prompting him to seek treatment in Coimbatore,” said Ramesh. “The panic seems to have stemmed from the fact that six people, including a child, tested positive for the virus over the last three days in Kerala.”The department has allocated an exclusive 108 ambulance to transfer patients showing coronavirus symptoms to the ESI Hospital and CMCH. “We clean the vehicle using Lysol after transferring each patient.

312,['10/03/2020'],7k farmers get supply through HVDS,"Nashik: Over 7,000 farmers from Nashik and Ahmednagar districts have received power supply through Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company’s (MSEDCL) High Voltage Distribution System (HVDS).

The HVDS has helped the state power utility in cutting down cases of power theft as the scheme curbs illegal tapping of power and helped the farmers in getting uninterrupted power supply.

The conventional low tension lines have transformers at some places from where 25 farmers are given connections. But in the HVDS, power can only be drawn after it goes through the transformer dedicated for maximum two farmers at one time.

In conventional power supply lines that would run for several kilometers, stealing of electricity also led to constant burning down of transformers. The MSEDCL would thus be forced to replace the transformers every time they got damaged because of overloading.

The MSEDCL, therefore, came up with the HVDS where tapping power illegally would cost dearly to the farmer in terms of damaged motors and appliances. All farmers who had paid for getting the connections before March 31, 2018 were eligible for the scheme and so far the MSEDCL had supplied a total of 7,078 connections across Nashik zone.

The number of connections given in Nashik urban circle is 1,385, while in Malegaon circle it is 2,795 and 2,898 in Ahmednagar circle.

The work orders of Rs 490 crore have been given by the MSEDCL to provide connections to the farmers across the Nashik zone wherein 10, 16 and 25 KVA transformers were installed.

Conventionally, the 63 to 100 KVA transformers were required for providing connections to 15 to 25 farmers through one transformer.

313,['10/03/2020'],HC quashes recovery proceedings against woman over 36 years’ delay,"Madurai: Madras high court has quashed recovery proceedings initiated against a woman under the Revenue Recovery Act after taking cognizance of the fact that recovery proceedings were initiated against her after a delay of 36 years for the notional loss suffered by the state government during an auction of an arrack shop in 1982.

M Rajathi moved the high court Madurai bench in 2018, seeking to quash an order of the divisional excise officer at Thirumangalam in Madurai district for initiating recovery proceedings.

The facts of the case are that an auction was conducted for an arrack shop at Thirumangalam in which an impersonator in the name of the petitioner’s husband, S A Maharajan took part in 1982. The impersonator had offered the highest bid of Rs 45,180. Though there was a precondition that the impersonator had to remit certain amount of money before the end of the day, the impersonator did not come forward to pay the amount.

Therefore, the authorities re-auctioned the shop which was fetched by another person for Rs 30,105. Since the difference in auction price is Rs 15,075, the amount which was calculated for 12 months at Rs 1,80,900 is being recovered from the petitioner.

Taking cognizance of the submissions that the authorities were well aware of the fact that an impersonator took part in the auction, justice C V Karthikeyan observed the petitioner’s husband died in 2004 and no action was taken by the officials when he was alive. The judge observed that recovery proceedings were initiated only in 2018 and there is no explanation given by the officials for not taking action for the past 36 years.

The judge also noted that the proceedings were initiated not for the actual loss but the notional loss said to have been suffered by the state government. “This is the case which reflects the retrograde bureaucratic approach of the government officials. TNN

318,['10/03/2020'],‘Brigade of 325’ to transform ZP school edu in Yavatmal,"Yavatmal: Taking cue from Delhi government’s success in transforming school education system to a great extent, Yavatmal collector M Devendra Singh has decided to implement his brainchild project — ‘ Brigade of 325 ’ in the district.

As a first step, he has set up ‘Brigade of 325’ — a group of dedicated teachers from ZP schools who would be tasked to take corrective measures for improving standard of education across the district.

All the 325 teachers have been summoned to the collector’s office here on Thursday (March 12) when they would be briefed about the task and their respective areas.

According to Singh, he had earlier, during his brief tenure as CEO of Chandrapur ZP, taken initiative to improve the standard of ZP schools there. He, however, could not see the results as he was transferred.

“Now in Yavatmal, I wish to implement the project soon so that I could witness the success of the project,” he said.

Explaining the idea, Singh said 325 promising teachers from ZP schools having expertise in maths, English, Marathi, Hindi, social sciences and science subjects have been selected and the teachers’ brigade was constituted on March 5. All the teachers have been chosen from tehsil level, three for each subject. There are 33 teachers in the brigade who are also computer savvy, said Singh.

Initially, the brigade will be assigned the task of preparing list of students along with the subjects they are lagging in their studies, he said.

The brigade members may contact private schools in the area and get themselves acquainted with the methods and techniques adopted there to make teaching easier and interesting for the students.

In a bid to incentivise the efforts, Singh said, the brigade members will be considered for promotion on the basis of their performance which will be assessed by a panel of education experts.

When asked why he is keen to take up the responsibility of improving the standard of education in ZP schools, which come under ZP CEO and EOs, the collector said he had his schooling in government-run schools in neighbouring Telangana and the quality education he received there has enabled him to become an IAS officer.

“I wish to see students from ZP schools getting quality education which will ultimately prepare them to achieve academic excellence and lead a successful life,” said the collector.

MADURAI: More than two days after a 69-year-old man and his three-year-old granddaughter were pushed down from a scooter, police registered a case against the culprit on Monday. But this was only after the victim’s son knocked on the doors of director general of police (DGP) J K Tripathy as local police refused to register a case and even denied the incident took place.

The incident took place around 9 am on Friday when Ramesh’s father B Rajamoni of Vadassery was riding his scooter with R Mirthika on the pillion seat. They were on CBH Road at Krishnankoil in Nagercoil Town when the accused, R Nagarajan from Vadassery, who was also on a bike, forced Rajamoni to go extreme right to the wrong side of the road. As Rajamoni tried stopping the scooter he and his granddaughter fell down as Nagarajan pushed down the vehicle. It is learnt that Rajamoni and Nagarajan were not on good terms over a temple festival issue.

Despite minor injury the traumatised girl went to school. Rajamoni was admitted to the government medical college at Asaripallam. Ramesh approached Kanyakumari district SP N Sreenath who promised action and the local police also got a statement from Rajamoni. “Vadassery police refused to register a case and supported the accused. The local police told me my father was at fault and he had attacked Nagarajan. The SP was also informed thus by the local police,” Ramesh said.

On Sunday, Ramesh managed to get a copy of the recorded CCTV footage of the incident from a resident. With the help of a friend, he directly sent it with a complaint to the DGP’s mobile number in the evening, following which a detailed probe was conducted and a case registered. Nagarajan was booked under sections 294(b) (use of abusive language), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) and 506(i) (punishment for criminal intimidation) .

SP Sreenath said that the accused has been arrested. He said the delay in registering the case was due to some misinformation on the place of occurrence, due to which the police went to another place and probed before the correct place was identified. Allegations on the local police not registering a case earlier is being looked into and action will be taken.

A civic official said a section of elected representatives from Marathwada are putting pressure on the Maha Vikas Agahdi-led state government to cancel NMC’s water reservation in the dam located in Igatpuri.

The letter has been sent to the principal secretary of the state water resources department. The NMC, in the letter, reminded the state government that water reservation for the civic body was made till 2041 and the civic body had spent crores in creating infrastructure to draw water from the dam.

Currently, water from the dam caters to around 6 lakh people. The water needs of the remaining 12 lakh are being catered by the Gangapur and Darna dam.

The Centre had given an approval to the Mukane pipeline project to the NMC under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. While the Centre and state government have jointly funded 70% of the project cost, the civic body paid the 30% of the cost.

The Centre had given approval to a proposal of Rs 230 crore, which was later increased by the NMC by Rs 35 crore. In July 2009, the state government had approved reservations for NMC till the year 2041 to cater the drinking water needs of the city.

The water reservation for NMC in Mukane dam is 28.32 million cubic metre (mcm) till 2021, 69.10 mcm till 2031 and 165.25 mcm till 2041.

“This is the water reservation approved by the state government. The city will face scarcity if the government cancels reservations for Nashik,” the official said.

The civic body started supplying water from Mukane dam to the city from May 1, 2019 and currently, water from the dam is being supplied to the Cidco division and Indira Nagar area.

NMC has urged the WRD to give its quota of water reservation from live storage. Currently, around 300 mcft of total water reservation for the civic body is from the dead stock.

The WRD has also been urged to not consider water from the dead stock of the Gangapur dam while the fixing water quota.

But experts argue the state-run bus utility should harness its monopoly in ferrying passengers between various points: It must grow beyond being an operator and become an aggregator that uses various mobility options.Bus is not the only answer to commuting Bengalureans, experts say, adding new mobility services like shared vehicles, ride-hailing firms, rental scooters, bike taxis, on-demand bus services and carpool apps also provide a range of options.Though there was a proposal for BMTC to launch a cab service focusing on tech corridors, it was put into cold storage. “The idea was to lease cars and operate under the BMTC banner, but the plan didn’t take off. There is a huge demand from companies, especially on Outer Ring Road, to ferry employees,” said a BMTC official.Experts say BMTC should widen its scope of services. Sudeept Maiti, senior manager, integrated transport programme, World Resources Institute, says: “BMTC could also act as a regulator for the other services even though its mandate is to provide quality bus service. Different types of vehicles are required for different types of services. For instance, a smaller vehicle could be suitable for last-mile connectivity. BMTC could tie-up with private firms and distribute some routes for the app-based bus service system.”“Many bus aggregators are operational in other cities. BMTC could identify an origin and destination and conduct a pilot with them, charging a royalty per km. If BMTC wants to run it, it can use their technology,” says transport expert Pawan Mulukutla.BMTC MD C Shikha says the transport utility is working to meet people’s aspirations and growing demand. “Currently, last-mile connectivity is a major issue. We are now coming up with nine-metre non-AC electric Metro feeder buses with flat fares to address these concerns.”Srinivas Alavilli, founder-member, Citizens for Bengaluru, suggests that BMTC be a division of BBMP. Shared autos have huge potential, but it has never been explored in Bengaluru.Startups like Zipgo, Ola Shuttle and Shuttl offered on-demand bus services in the city, but had to shut shop after a crackdown by the transport department. These app-based solutions allowed passengers to select a route and book a ride, real-time tracking, Wi-Fi and cashless payment. In fact, these services were quite popular in the tech corridors as they were cheaper than cab rides.The transport department, however, seized their vehicles as the stage-carriage permit in the city is BMTC’s exclusive right and no other private operator is allowed to pick up or drop passengers. Stage-carriage permits allow operators to pick up and drop passengers midway on a route. Similarly, shared autos, popular in most other cities, aren’t allowed because of BMTC’s monopoly. However, unlike private firms, the transport corporation has a social obligation to operate in loss-making routes.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74560244,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-205255,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/transport-experts-want-bmtc-to-act-like-an-aggregator-and-not-a-mere-operator/articleshow/74558266.cms

325,['10/03/2020'],NGO claims drastic improvement in Gadchiroli schools,"Nagpur: Four years after implementation of its project, a Mumbai-based NGO has claimed improvement in average learning outcomes of students, above national and state average scoring in mathematics and language. The schools have also witnessed reduction in dropouts due to seasonal migration in several remote villages of Naxal-infested Gadchiroli district which is among its four special focus places.

Amravati, Nandurbar and Parbhani are the other districts where NGO EdelGive Foundation has initiated ‘The Collaborators for Transforming Education’ project under its School Transformation Programme, which was started in 2016. It covers 272 schools in the four special focus districts.

The NGO has tied up with Maharashtra government’s department of school education and sports (DSES) for the purpose.

The Collaborators for Transforming Education has been initiated by EdelGive to bring together a consortium of key funders, and experienced and highly respected NGO partners to work with government’s education machinery and local communities to transform last mile delivery of education.

The coalition aims to improve learning outcomes of elementary schoolchildren and also identify and disseminate best practices of the sector that can be integrated into the government education system.

This public-private-partnership with the state government finds EdelGive Foundation at the centre as the anchor funder. EdelGive facilitates the flow of funds from the pool of funders to the partners on ground at zero-cost. It also monitors the impact of the programme and conducts a third-party evaluation of the programme periodically. Through the programme, EdelGive aims to build a case for collaborative philanthropy, where all stakeholders (government, funders, implementing partners and the beneficiaries) are aligned towards social progress.

Recently, the NGO organized a media visit to a couple of villages in Gadchiroli district and meetings with education officials there.

“The Collaborators for Transforming Education’ programme was developed to strengthen the existing government education system in Maharashtra. Working with the state government for two years before we launched the programme enabled us to collectively understand the needs of the government and design interventions that would support the existing machinery. I am thankful to the officials across the state, district and block level for their partnership in the programme; the impact and scale of which would not have been achieved without their complete support,” said Vidya Shah, CEO, EdelGive Foundation.

He said the campaign is against the proposal in the draft notification to extend the ESZ to increase the forest cover in the district by 500 to 650 sq kms.

The MP said that the proposal will badly affect the livelihood of thousands of people with land holdings close to the forest in the densely populated district.

“Such drastic increase in the forest cover will reduce the very little space available in the district for industrialisation and construction of houses too. This move will affect the development of the district,” he said. The campaign vehicle will create awareness among stakeholders on the impact of the draft and emphasize on maintaining the existing zero point.

The campaign also highlights how and to whom the objections to the draft have to be made. Last month, the MP had petitioned the minister of state for environment, forest and climate change Babul Supriyo in this connection.

“Several small lanes and bylanes cannot be accessed by the big vehicles. We have requested the board to direct the ghantagadi contractors to deploy a few smaller vehicles to ensure garbage collection from houses located in the smaller lanes,” the health officials said.

CBD’s chief executive officer Ajay Kumar said the board officials have noticed, through the GPS system in the big vehicles, that they cannot enter the small bylanes, uneven roads, slum areas and some residential societies.

“We have issued instructions to the contractor to acquire a tipper and a tractor for waste collection from the small lanes,” the CEO said.

The board had a tipper until February 2019, the services of which was discontinued after the contract ended.

At present, CBD has 11 ghantagadis that are deployed to collect garbage from doorsteps in the wards. Each ghantagadi collects 1.5 tonne of wet and dry garbage per day. The vehicle has two containers for wet and dry waste.

Then the garbage is taken to the new functional solid waste management plant where it is treated.

Some local residents are irked that the ghantagadis are not collecting dry waste during the autumn.

“As we have big trees in our society, dry leaves fall in large quantities. We get them heaped near the gates, but the vehicles do not take them citing that they do not have enough space in their dry container. We have to dispose of the leaves to their solid waste management area,” said Amit Sanghvi, a local resident.

This was conveyed in a telephonic interaction between an embassy official and an Indian fisherman in Iran leaving the fishermen and their families livid.

It is learnt that the conversation took place between a fisherman named Robinson and the officials on Saturday night. “We decided to reach out to embassy officials as they have not visited us to understand our plight or to give an assurance to us on when we will be repatriated to India. Over the last one week the officials said they will come tomorrow, but tomorrow never came,” Ascar, another fisherman, told TOI.

In the six-minute audio, the official is heard saying that the embassy officials have prioritised repatriating those who came on pilgrim visa, followed by student visa, after which it will be fishermen’s turn. He says they are unable to come to the different locations where Indian fishermen are working in Iran as they are busy with medical tests in Qom. “The flight is coming for student and pilgrim visa persons first,” the official says.

Fishermen in separate audio and video messages said that at some places the fishermen have anchored in the sea following warning from their Iranian employers that COVID-19 has spread to places close to Kish Island where about 300 Indian fishermen are based. “We are running out of water and food supplies. Twelve days ago we started raising the issue, refrained from fishing and started seeking help but in vain,” another fisherman said.

“We trust the assurances given by the chief minister of Tamil Nadu that we will be repatriated soon,” a fisherman said. In another video, a fisherman says that if not COVID-19 they might lose their life to hunger as they are running short of supplies. “What if we died here in this foreign land? We will be buried or cremated like orphans, right?” asked another.

In another video, a fisherman says in Malayalam pointing to two others, “They saved more than 150 lives during the Kerala floods in 2018 but now they are among the many like us, not knowing when and if we would get help to save our lives.” Meenavar Orunginaippu Sangam secretary Charles Johnson said that such videos are on the rise after the response from embassy officials which left their kin back home worried.

In the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak in China — a major supplier of drug raw material or active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) — the Directorate General of Foreign Trade had “restricted” export of 13 specified APIs, and formulations containing these, from India with immediate effect through a notification on March3.

Senior representatives from major pharmaceutical firms along with industry associations had raised concerns about the move. On Monday, at a meeting with the expert panel set up to look into availability of medicines in the wake of the viral outbreak, the industry assured the government of “enough stocks”.

In a written submission reviewed by TOI, the industry said that in case of any unexpected shortage “all production and sale of APIs and formulations will be restricted to domestic consumption”.

331,['10/03/2020'],Forest dept adopts real-time revenue transfer to treasury,"Nagpur: The Maharashtra forest department has taken to real time revenue transfer by integrating its e-auction portal with the government revenue accounting system (GRAS).

“This will expedite the revenue receipts to the government treasury immediately. Earlier, it used to take over a month to deposit the receipts due to procedural delays,” said Praveen Srivastava , principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) for production and management.

“Now, the forest department has integrated its e-portal with the SBI payment gate. On a pilot basis we have started implementing e-payment in Nagpur division. From April 1, we will implement it in the entire state. Now money will be transferred to the treasury in two days,” said Srivastava.

On July 1, 2016, the state finance department started the virtual treasury office wherein it decided to receive payments electronically for e-challans, refund of e-payment, accounting and reconciliation of e-receipts.

E-payment is a mode of payment in addition to the conventional methods of payment offered by the state government.

The forest department generates over Rs260 crore revenue through e-auction of timber , firewood, and bamboo . However, even as the GR was issued in 2016 and ideally money should be deposited in seven working days, it took over a month, causing loss of huge interest to the state exchequer.

Sources said, “In June, orders were issued by the state government that all amounts being paid by way of EMD and tender fee shall be collected in separate pooling/collecting accounts to be maintained with SBI, Mumbai. Despite this, the entire EMD amount from the auction of timber and firewood was deposited in private banks till November 2019 due to which there was a huge loss to the exchequer.”

Also, the amount towards the tender fee, if applicable, shall be directly remitted to the government treasury on opening of the tender at the duration as specified by the directorate of accounts & treasury. But these instructions were not followed in by the forest department till the end of November 2019.

The e-auction portal was started in Maharashtra from January 1, 2016, but instead of integrating it with empanelled banks, the PCCF’s office signed an MoU with a private bank, which was not on the list of the empanelled ones. For over three years, e-receipts towards the sale of timber were never deposited in GRAS in time by the said bank causing loss to the state exchequer.

In 2019, the PCCF again signed an MoU with another private bank, which, too, did not deposit the e-receipts in time. While signing the MoU with these banks, a condition was deliberately put that e-receipts would be deposited in one week. But it took more than a week to get the money transferred to government treasury.

332,['10/03/2020'],Shivraj may take over as MP CM for fourth term,"New Delhi: If everything goes according to BJP ’s plan, three-time Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan may take over for a fourth term, after being out of office for 15 months, somewhat settling scores for BJP’s ouster in Maharashtra, where its rivals teamed up with Shiv Sena.

The Madhya Pradesh shocker came even as Congress leaders felt they had a handle on BJP by challenging it on issues like the economy and anti-CAA unrest. Jyotiraditya Scindia and BJP were scripting a regime-change story.

Scindia’s joining will be a big boost to the saffron party, which lost the assembly polls in 2018 because of poor performance in Gwalior-Chambal region, the stronghold of the Scindia clan. Besides, his induction will help focus attention on Congress’s growing vulnerability at a time when the Modi government is battling resistance to CAA, with the Delhi result seen as a win for its opponents.

It also scotches rumours of whatever reservations Modi-Shah may have had about Shivraj Singh Chouhan. There was speculation that BJP is unwilling to bring down the Nath government due to a “trust deficit”. BJP sources maintained that they were clear about not acting in a hurry and waiting for the contradictions to ripen.

There were initial apprehensions about leadership’s equations with rival branch of Scindia clan. Jyotiraditya’s equations with his aunt Vasundhara Raje, former Rajasthan CM, were said to be not even.

The rivalry was at least partly a fallout of the political schism in the family, which started when Vijaya Raje Scindia paid a price for opposing Emergency and staying with Bhartiya Jan Sangh. If sources are to be believed, the Scindia family is united now. The recent picture of Vasundhara Raje hugging her nephew was an indication that the family is together. There are other likely claimants to the CM post but Chouhan’s claim is clearly well recognised.

BJP has moved with caution. Before the rebel Congress MLAs were flown to a ‘safe-house’ in Bengaluru on Monday, a BJP leader, who was coordinating with them, asked them at least twice as if they are “completely ready” to quit the party in support of Scindia, who had made up his mind to join BJP as he was upset with the Congress leadership for neither considering him as PCC chief nor nominating him to Rajya Sabha.

As the MLAs assured to stay firm, BJP leaders swung into action. Chouhan and Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who were assigned to keep a watch on developments in the state, held meetings with the party high command, including home minister Amit Shah and J P Nadda to finalise the plan to topple the Nath government and have Scindia join the party.

Scindia’s aunt and BJP MLA Yashodhara Raje played a crucial role as she termed her nephew’s imminent joining BJP as “ghar wapsi” since his father Madhavrao Scindia had quit Jan Sangh and joined Congress after differences with his mother, the late Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia, one of the founder members of BJP.

The BJP central election committee met on Tuesday to finalise Rajya Sabha candidates and review MP developments. It was learnt that there was no discussion about Chouhan’s taking over as CM, as it will be formally discussed only after more clarity emerges over status of resignation of the Congress MLAs.

HYDERABAD: A public interest litigation (PIL) was filed in the high court seeking constitution of state council for clinical establishments. The petition also demands to put in place relevant enforcement mechanism for preventing private hospitals from resorting to malpractices.

The plea was filed by M Vijay Gopal, president of NGO Forum Against Corruption, questioning the inaction of the state in checking the malpractices by clinical establishments.

In his plea, the petitioner said the central government had brought in The Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010. It was notified by Parliament on February 28, 2012. Relevant rules too were notified on May 23, 2012.

States were asked to adopt it and bring the law into force. Telangana adopted the Act through its Assembly on March 25, 2017, but forgot to bring in the required mechanism to enforce the law, the petitioner said. Apart from constitution of the council, the state has to bring in registering authority under this law in each district. Enforcement cell too has to be formed.

The state has to form grievance redressal facility apart from releasing approved and standard list of medical procedures and standard template that would specify the costs of medical procedures as approved by the National Council for Clinical Establishments, the petitioner added.

In fact, the Union health secretary had written to the states in November 2017, informing them how the private hospitals were collecting exorbitant fees, deficiency in services and ignoring the standard treatment protocols, which was resulting in the compromise of patients' safety, the petitioner said. “This is raising several questions about the transparency and accountability in health care costs,” he added.

The victim has been identified as Thirunavukkarasu from a village near Pattukottai in Thanjavur district. He had been wandering in the streets after running away from his house. Police said that Thirunavukkarasu was mistaken by a gang to be an associate of a former history-sheeter. They thought him as a potential threat and murdered him in a cold-blooded manner. A team led by the Avaniyapuram police inspector G Pethuraj, which cracked the case, arrested two people identified as Muthupandi, 24, and Sivakumar, 24, from Thanthai Periyar Nagar in Avaniyapuram and are searching for two more people - Ranjith and Senthil.

A police officer said that there was a dispute between Sivakumar and Pipe Kumar, a former history-sheeter. Kumar has been staying away from criminal activities and is working as a guide, since he is well-versed with multiple languages. On Friday night, Thirunavukkarasu approached Kumar to buy him food. After buying him food, Kumar left the place after assuring to provide him a job the next day.

Meanwhile, Thirunavukkarasu, who was loitering around in the area was stopped by Sivakumar and his gang, while consuming alcohol. When they inquired with him, he mentioned Kumar’s name. Mistaking him to be his accomplice, they took him to a secluded area and murdered him. The accused buried the head some 500m away from the spot and left.

A police officer said that Sivakumar was arrested from a hideout in Alagarkovil hills. When the police reached there, he tried to escape. He fractured his leg while jumping from a rock. He has been admitted to the Government Rajaji Hospital for treatment. TNN

Already, plugging has been done at 98 places and notices have been issued to 131 buildings, commercial and residential, to stop letting untreated sewage water directly into the centuries-old water body.

Officials said that a survey is also under way to find out the places where the banks of the river have been encroached upon. It has already covered 11 kms of the river’s 13-km stretch in the city limits and the rest will be completed soon. The river originates at Virattipathu on the city outskirts from the streams draining from Nagamalai hillock and draining into Gundaru next to Ring Road. It then drains into Malattar before flowing into Bay of Bengal. The river is polluted throughout its 13-km stretch in the city.

Madurai corporation commissioner S Visakan recently instructed his officials from engineering wing to issue notice to those who also dump garbage into the water body, apart from those letting sewage water. He along with a team of officials walked through the channel, covering a major part of it, to get a better picture of the present status of the water body. An official said that the corporation is taking up seven major works at various points of the water body in an effort to revive it.

This includes sewage treatment plant to treat water from the channel, construction of lift well to collect sewerage and send it to designated places and laying new sewer line at Virattipathu and Pookara Street in Ellis Nagar. All works are to be carried out from the corporation fund, he said.

Tender of the preparation work is already under way for the proposed sewage treatment plant at Mela Anupanadi. The plant planned at a cost of Rs 23 lakh will have a capacity to treat 32,000 litres a day and the treated water will be let into Sokkayi Oorani to enrich the ground water, officials said.

CHENNAI: On February 28, when E Arun Kumar was at Pulicat, he sighted half-a-dozen rare birds including the long-toed stint that had come to the lake after travelling thousands of kilometres.

Kumar, one of the 100 volunteers that were part of a two-day bird census in Vedanthangal and Karikili bird sanctuaries in Chengalpet district and Pulicat in Tiruvallur district, said the stint is one of the newcomers to Vedanthangal this season. The bird, which breeds around Siberia and northern Asia, in winter migrates to places like Pulicat. “Our team sighted two birds. They feed on snails, insects and worms,” he said.

Nature Trust founder K V R K Thirunaranan said the census was mainly to record water birds, but his team sighted Asian brown flycatcher, Indian pitta and Orange-headed thrush in Vedanthangal.

HYDERABAD: In a bid to promote skill-based education, the Telangana State Board of Intermediate (TSBIE) has decided to develop four vocational junior colleges into Centres of Excellence (CoE). While one of the CoE will come up in Hyderabad, remaining three will be in Mahabubnagar, Nalgonda and Warangal.

“We are taking guidance from Centurion University , the first skilled university in the country, for introducing need-based new vocational courses, to remove outdated courses, to train faculty and for lab upgradation. Under their guidance, the CoEs will be established,” said Syed Omer Jaleel, TSBIE commissioner and secretary, adding that CoEs will start functioning from the academic year 2020-21.

BIE officials said they would also establish 10 skill centers as part of skill development programme for Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY). “We have received permission from National Skill Development Corporation. The plan is to make these centers operational in next couple of months,” added Jaleel.

He said these centers will be operational round the year. “As these skill centers are targeted at school and college dropouts, we need not wait for academic year to begin. The plan is to start them before the academic year 2020-21 starts,” said TSBIE commissioner.

State Institute of Vocational Education (SIVE) officials said candidates who have done courses in tailoring, carpentry, etc. can work at these centers. “They can take up stitching of school uniforms or making furniture, among others,” said an SIVE official.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has arrested 10 people and apprehended a juvenile in different cases registered in connection with the northeast Delhi riots. The list of arrested people also includes suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain ’s brother Shah Alam .

Arif and Abid Qureshi have been arrested in connection with the murder of a 26-year-old civil engineer Rahul Solanki. A case was earlier registered at Dayalpur police station in this regard.

The deceased had left his office last Monday around 4.30pm. Before leaving, he had told his colleagues not to worry and that everything would be fine. Just an hour later, they got the news of his murder. Solanki had stepped out after reaching his residence when he was killed by the rioters. His elder sister’s marriage was scheduled in April.

A Special Investigation Team (SIT) arrested Lokesh Kumar Solanki for his alleged involvement in four murder cases. He had allegedly murdered and dumped the bodies of four people in a drain. On March 5, four riot cases, which had taken place in northeast Delhi on February 24, were transferred to the Crime Branch. All the four cases were earlier registered at the Gokulpuri police station.

“An investigation revealed involvement of a group of persons in these incidents. Evidence were collected and Lokesh was subsequently arrested. During interrogation, he disclosed about his other associates. Efforts are being made to trace and nab them,” said a senior police officer.

Meanwhile, police also arrested Shah Alam, brother of suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, after his presence at Hussain’s house on the day of the violence was established.

Eyewitnesses told the cops that when the violence broke out, Alam was at Hussain’s residence and he even engaged in pelting stones at other people.

Soon after Hussain’s name surfaced in the murder case of IB official Ankit Sharma, Alam had gone missing. He later switched off his phone and took shelter at the residences of three different people who were known to him. Later, police also arrested these three people. Two of them have been identified as Jaggar and Ilyasi.

Rahul has been arrested for vandalising a mosque and two others for looting a shoe factory. The juvenile was also apprehended in this connection.

345,['10/03/2020'],More schemes afoot even as Vamanapuram river ails,"Thiruvananthapuram: In order to ensure pumping during summer, Kerala water authority (KWA) has raised the height of the check dam across Vamanapuram river at Poovanpara. As summer intensifies, the water level has sunk below the check dam. Though the pumping has not been affected so far, KWA is pinning hopes on summer showers.

While the condition of Vamanapuram river is turning worse during the summer, KWA is planning more and more schemes with the river as the source. Already the Aruvikkara and Attingal divisions of KWA has around 20 schemes depending on Vamanapuram river, which dips to an alarming level during summer. Sources said that KWA is drawing around 100 mld of water from Vamanapuram river. The state government has sanctioned Rs 16 crore project for supplying water to areas such as Anad, Palode and Kurupuzha villages.

After revising the estimate, tenders will be called for the project next month. Another project — a comprehensive water supply scheme to Pulimath, Nagaroor and Karavaram panchayats — too is in the pipeline. The project, which has an estimate of Rs 80 crore, will be funded by Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). In addition to this, KWA is planning augmentation of some existing schemes.

KWA superintending engineer Suresh Chandran said that constructing weirs across the river could only ensure water to the schemes. “A four-metre regulator-cum-bridge has been proposed at Arattukadavu. Irrigation department is responsible for the construction. Lack of regulators affect the schemes during summer. However, the existing crisis can be cleared if there are 2-3 summer showers,” he said.

The Vamanapuram river is the lone major river in the district which lacks a dam or major regulators to ensure water availability during drought-like situations. Arun P R, scientist of ground water division at Centre for Water Resources Development and Management, who is conducting a study on the ground water availability of the Vamanapuram river basin, said that there must be some regulation for controlled release of water during summer season. “Extreme climatic changes affect projects that solely depend on the river. Instead of river-based projects, more houses should start rainwater harvesting,” he said.

Meanwhile, the irrigation department officials said that the department does not have a proposal for construction of a dam across the Vamanapuram river. “The old proposed Vamanapuram irrigation project has been shelved. Now, projects to construct check dams at Ayamkadavu and Koottapparakadavu, near KWA pumping stations, are under consideration,” said an irrigation department official.

This was revealed by the official in a written reply to the questions asked by Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel.

Jaleel, in a press conference held on Monday evening, requested all MPs in the SCR region to come together and push for various demands related to improving the rail connectivity in Aurangabad.

In a letter dated November 11, 2019, the Aurangabad MP had written to the railways with a set of 12 demands. Responding to the demand for the pit line, Mallya said that coach maintenance facilities are available at Purna Junction and Nanded and the maintenance requirements are fulfilled for present trains at the existing pit lines .

“However, if required, based on traffic, pit line and infrastructure facilities will be planned in Aurangabad,” Mallya said in his reply dated February 10.

For the demand to improve rail connectivity between Aurangabad and Chalisgaon and Aurangabad and Ahmednagar-Pune, the official said there is no traffic survey sanctioned by the Railway Board for these lines.

The plea for stoppage of all major trains at Mukundwadi, Lasur and Rotegaon stations have also been turned down.

According to SCR, currently 24 express and 13 passenger trains have stoppage at Lasur, 22 express and 13 passenger trains have stoppage at Rotegaon and 2 express and 15 passenger trains stop at Mukundwadi.

“Additional stoppages are not feasible due to operational constraints on the congested single line section,” the SCR official said.

Lack of feasibility was cited for failure to introduce trains from Mumbai to Aurangabad and extension of Hampi Express from Parbhani to Aurangabad and a direct train from Aurangabad to Bangalore.

Jaleel said that lately a lot of unconfirmed reports regarding establishment of pit line and improvement of rail connectivity of Aurangabad were doing rounds.

“Through this letter, we now have the official stand of the railways regarding our long-pending demands. All public representatives should come together to raise these demands with the rail ministry,” the MP said.

NEW DELHI: The Special Cell of Delhi Police has arrested an alleged member of the Popular Front of India (PFI) on the charges of allegedly spreading fake propaganda and fanning violence during anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests.

Mohammed Danish Khan (33), a resident of east Delhi’s Trilokpuri, was produced before a court on Monday and was sent to four days’ police custody.

Khan is reported to be the Delhi-based secretary of the outfit and handles its intelligence wing. He was spotted at all major protests in the city, claimed a source, adding that his interrogation had already given clues regarding the outfit’s “information war”.

The police also claimed to have found some recent suspicious transactions — the latest one being a deposit of Rs 20,000 — in his account and are tracing their sources. Khan has claimed that he took the money as a loan.

The FIR, under which Khan was arrested, was filed by the Crime Branch, but as the larger conspiracy regarding the Delhi riots is being probed by the Special Cell, the matter has been transferred to it, said a senior officer.

The Enforcement Directorate is already studying PFI’s financial transactions and its alleged role in fanning anti-CAA protests. A preliminary probe by the anti-money laundering agency has established a suspicious pattern of deposits into and withdrawal of money from PFI’s accounts, a source claimed.

PFI, however, called the move a conspiracy against it. “We have to say whatever happens in India, the agencies puts their blame on us. We have to say that whenever such allegations were levelled against us, these were never proved by that agency. Even this time, too, we will come clean. To hide real culprits, they are targeting us,” the outfit said in a statement.

Meanwhile, a team of the Special Cell has begun an extensive interrogation of the arrested Kashmiri couple having alleged links with the Islamic State (IS) in the Khorasan province.

Police have roped in CERT-IN (Computer Emergency Response Team) for assistance in analysing the eight mobile phones and the laptop recovered from the couple, identified as Jahanjeb Sami and his wife Hina Bashir Beg.

Sami has been sacked by the company he worked for after his arrest for sedition and under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The couple allegedly shifted their base from Kashmir to Delhi after the internet clampdown there.

During the Monday’s meeting, deputy mayor and standing committee member Rajendra Janjal raised the issue of delay in processing the tender of Balasaheb Thackeray Smruti Van and procurement of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj statue at Kranti Chowk. Incidentally, the state government in February had approved Rs 26 crore for the memorial project after the detailed project report was submitted by the AMC.

Janjal demanded the AMC administration to produce the file of project management consultant appointed for the designing and establishment of Thackeray Memorial at Priyadarshini Garden. Subsequently, accounts officer Sanjay Pawar was called upon on which he stated that he does not have permission to present the file before the committee. He cited Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act 1965 and said that he is bound by the rules to present the file as the matter has not been tabled before the committee.

This led to verbal spat between Pawar and Janjal with the latter saying the committee chairperson is presiding over the meeting and officials do not need to tell the members about the rules. Janjal later said that Pawar’s hesitation to present the file shows that there is an attempt to conceal something.

Issue of elevation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj statue was also raised in the meeting. The AMC has issued the tender for the procurement of the statue for the second time after the first tender was rejected due to technical flaws. Janjal stated that the retendering the process has been delayed by around two months and the administration is failing to act on the sensitive issue.

The first tender to procure a new statue was published in January. The tender called for the second time will be opened on March 13. After the officials could not give any satisfactory reply on the delay, standing committee chairperson Jaishri Kulkarni directed the officials to furnish a written explanation and issued directives to complete the project in time.

350,['10/03/2020'],Telangana: Kin prevent Amrutha from attending father’s funeral,"A video grab of Amrutha addressing presspersons on Monday

HYDERABAD: Tension prevailed in Miryalguda on Monday at the funeral of T Maruthi Rao, the prime accused in the murder of his Dalit son-in-law Pranay Perumalla, as his daughter Amrutha tried to attend her father’s last rites on Monday.

Maruti Rao was found dead in his room at Arya Vysya Bhavan in Khairathabad on Sunday.

Amrutha visited the crematorium amid high security. However, a large crowd, including Rao’s family members, that had gathered at the crematorium blocked her way, raising slogans against her and telling her to go back.

Though Amrutha tried to move closer to the body, she could only see the body from afar as the police had to escort her back to the vehicle in which she arrived, after which she left.

Addressing a press conference, Amrutha said she believes that her father might have committed suicide due to pressure from Shravan, Maruthi Rao’s brother and one of the accused in the case.

Asked if there was threat to her from Shravan, she said, “There might be a threat, but I cannot say for sure. I feel that my mother might be facing threat from him.”

On her father’s last wish in the suicide note asking her to return to her mother, Amrutha said that she would welcome her mother only if she stays at her in-laws’ house and if the decision does not break her ties with her in-laws.

Amrutha alleged that Shravan used to dominate her father and that he has physically attacked him.

Amrutha further alleged that her father had benami properties which include properties in the name of Karim, who is also one of the accused in the murder case.

Refuting the allegations made by Amrutha, Shravan told reporters that the allegations against him were baseless, and added that Maruthi Rao’s wife was free to approach the police if she feels threatened by him.

“Amrutha, who had wished that her father be given capital punishment, is now changing her attitude in order to own her father’s property. Amrutha is making the allegations only to get hold of her father’s property. I have no role in stopping her from getting one last glimpse of her father,” he said.

Reacting to Shravan’s claim, Amrutha stated that she was not interested in laying claim to her father’s property.

351,['10/03/2020'],"Heavy rush in trains, buses due to Holi","Dehradun: Ahead of Holi , Dehradun railway station witnessed a heavy rush of passengers. The station remained jam-packed with passengers on Monday and over the weekend. Most of these passengers were those boarding trains going towards UP, Bihar, and Delhi.

Ticket availability became an issue for those who did not book tickets earlier. The waiting numbers for a sleeper coach ticket were between 50-400. The AC coaches were no better.

“I had to go to Delhi urgently but since trains were completely full with no chance of a reservation, I had no other option but to book a taxi,” said Praveen Das, a student.

Sitaram Sonkar, station superintendent at Dehradun railway station, told TOI, “Most of the trains have 400 (or more) waiting. There were 52 people in waiting for a sleeper coach seat in Doon Express (Dehradun-Lucknow) on Monday. On Sunday, this number was 412. Other trains like Link Express, Dehradn-Muzaffarnagar Express, New Delhi Shatabdi, and Nanda Devi Express are also witnessing a heavy rush.”

Smriti Shukla, a passenger travelling in Link Express, told TOI, “I couldn’t reach my own seat before Moradabad due to the heavy rush in the train. Even the toilets were occupied by passengers and there was no space to move around in the sleeper coaches.”

Train delays made matters worse for passengers. On Monday, Sangam Express (Allahabad-Dehradun) got late by five hours. The train had got delayed by three hours on Sunday as well.

Meanwhile, in view of the festive rush, Uttarakhand Transport Corporation (UTC) ran 60 new buses on Monday. The UTC drivers, who work on Holi, have been promised allowance of Rs 2,000.

Deepak Jain, MD of UTC, told TOI, “The department has already procured 60 new buses. These buses were made to ply on Uttar Pradesh and Delhi routes to cater to the passenger rush.”

The official further informed that the process of getting 50 new buses is also underway and the UTC is expecting to get their delivery by next week. “By March 31, we expect to have 300 new buses in place,” added Jain.

353,['10/03/2020'],"Delhi: No player or instrument, wedding bands fall silent","The sudden shortage of bands has forced families to opt for simpler matrimonial affairs

NEW DELHI: Over 20 wedding band groups with their outlets on Johripur main road in Shiv Vihar are in a fix. Many of their set-ups were damaged in the recent riots and their musical instruments looted. Most of the band players too have left Delhi and gone to their home villages. This is why normality gradually returning to the violence-affected district only means more frustrations for the band operators. With wedding bookings having resumed in northeast Delhi, they are ill prepared to take up assignments.

Most of the bands had been booked for weddings on February 24 and 25 — the days when riots haunted Shiv Vihar. Some called the customers to tell them of their inability to come due to the violence, others had already dispatched their music players and horses, which came under attack.

Sonu Thakur, who runs Sonu Band, despaired that only four instrumentalists in his group remained after the others left Delhi. “We had five weddings for February 24 and 25, but all were cancelled. We sent our horses to be sheltered and are yet to get them back because the people looking after them are still scared to come back,” said Thakur. “Last week alone, we lost Rs 1 lakh in net earnings.”

Sonu Band received queries for Monday too, but had to turn the customers down. “By the time our members return to Delhi, this wedding season will be over. We will now only be able to resume in mid-April when weddings take place once again,” said Thakur.

Alauddin, owner of Shri Akash Band Company has lost even more. Not only has his musicians left for their hometowns, but his shop was first looted and then burnt down. “The rioters stole the instruments lying in the outlet. What remained was burnt down on February 24,” said Alauddin. “We were slated to play at weddings on February 25, 26 and 27. All had to be cancelled. I have to return the advance payment I received, but I don’t have any money.”

Its musical instruments lying in heap in one corner and the flashy orange livery for band members scattered around, Vijaya Band also suffered a big financial loss in the communal riots that caused so much turmoil over four days. “These were some of the best lagan days of this season. We had bookings for several marriages, but we could not move out of this place,” owner Vijaya Kashyap said despondently. “A band shop in our vicinity was reduced to ashes. If we had gone, our set-up too would have met the same fate.”

Vijaya Band is no longer accepting orders because of the tension and uncertainty hanging in the air. “Each wedding provides employment to 20 band members and over 100 workers. All of them are sitting here idle; some have even started looking for alternative work till the next lagan arrives,” added Kashyap.

The sudden shortage of bands has forced families to opt for simpler matrimonial affairs. In Ram Mohalla in Johripur, the riot even reduced the local marriage venue to a shambles. A family that had scheduled the ceremonies there decided eventually to marry off the young couple with a baraat comprising just five people.

354,['10/03/2020'],"Soon, overbridge for bikes &amp; three-wheelers at Plavila","Thiruvananthapuram: Following the unrelenting protest of local residents at Plavila near Kazhivoor in Mukkola-Karode national highway, the national highway authority of India ( NHAI ) has decided to construct an overbridge for two-wheelers and three-wheelers across the NH.

Local residents have been obstructing construction of the NH for over two years by protesting the plan of NHAI to demolish an existing mud road at Plavila, which is used by students and locals.

Sources in NHAI said that a bridge similar to foot overbridge, but without stairs, will be constructed across the national highway on the existing location of the mud road. “It can be used by two-wheeler, three-wheeler and small cars,” sources said.

Though the NHAI took the decision, local residents said that they are kept in dark over the developments. Last week, local residents had disrupted the works.

The construction company arrived on Wednesday to demolish the Kanjiramkulam panchayat high school-Thazhankadu road. Local residents and Kazhakoottam-Karode bypass action council chased them away, said V Sudhakaran, chairman of the action council. He said that they do not want any discussion with the contractor. “The NHAI has never convened a meeting to allay fears of local residents,” he said.

“We won’t allow demolition of the road without construction of an overpass. Buses used to ply on the road. Lot of school buses and other vehicles are taking this road, which is a connected to schools, markets and temples,” the action council pointed out.

“Though we filed a petition with the PWD minister, collector and national highway project director, there was no response,” Sudhakaran said.

While local people cite lack of measures for crossing the road, NHAI has provided connectivity to the opposite side at 180 metres and 250 metres on either sides of the Plavila mud road. However, residents are not ready for any compromise other than an alternative overbridge at the location of the mud road.

NHAI is constructing a flyover from Nellimoodu Junction to a few metres near the Plavila bridge. A vehicular overpass is constructed around 250 metres after the Plavila bridge at the Vengapotta side.

356,['10/03/2020'],Rajya Sabha elections: Split in CPM over fielding Yechury from West Bengal,"NEW DELHI: Split is wide open in CPM over a debate over fielding party chief Sitaram Yechury for a third term in Rajya Sabha.

While the West Bengal unit of the party is understood to be keen to field Yechury to give the party a much-needed, articulate voice in Parliament, another section of CPM is not in favour of the proposal as it would require the party to take support from others like Congress.

Since CPM lacks the numbers to send Yechury to Rajya Sabha on its own strength, it will have to lean on Congress for support. Congress is learnt to have offered support to the Left if Yechury is fielded.

CPM has 26 MLAs in the West Bengal assembly, and Congress has 45. Polls to 5 RS seats will be held on March 26. While TMC can win 4 seats, it will fall short of votes for the fifth seat, leaving it open to the opposition.

At a meeting of the party’s politburo, a section of CPM though came with a firm ‘no’ to any truck with Congress and thus objected to Yechury’s candidature.

With March 13 as the last date for filing nominations, sources said Yechury had shot off a missive to the members of the politburo who had not attended the meet, seeking their opinion.

AHMEDABAD: A group of alleged eve-teasers on Saturday stabbed and seriously injured the brother of a girl and two of his friends while they were sitting outside their society in Khokhra. Inspector B Z Jhala of Khokhra police station said all the accused have been traced and will soon be arrested.

According to the FIR, Luhar and Rana live in Khokhra. Yogesh Koshti used to tease Rana’s sister whenever she went out of the house. Rana had confronted Yogesh over the issue.

On Saturday late night, Yogesh and his friends arrived with knives to teach Rana a lesson for daring to confront them.

Yogesh stabbed Luhar on his back and slashed Rana’s fingers, then they stabbed Mudaliyar. “Hearing cries of the victims, residents of the society rushed out and the accused fled,” said a police official.

She played a significant role in nurturing the saffron citadel in the Gwalior region and in 1971, Jana Sangh defied the Indira-wave and won three seats — Vijayaraje from Bhind, Atal Bihari Vajpayee from Gwalior, and Vijayaraje’s son Madhavrao Scindia from Guna.The Scindia family plunged headlong into state politics and Madhavrao Scindia became an LS MP at the age of 26. But the saffron love didn’t last long for him, and he chose to part ways with Jana Sangh and his mother after the Emergency in 1977.In the 1980 polls, he switched allegiance to Congress and won from Guna a third time, and served as Union minister in the Congress regime. His son Jyotiraditya carried on with his legacy.In the meantime, Vijayaraje’s daughters Vasundhara Raje and Yashodhara Raje also entered politics. In 1984, Vasundhara joined as a member of the BJP national executive. She was also elected to the 8th Rajasthan assembly from Dholpur. Vasundhara’s son Dushyant is a BJP MP from Jhalawar in Rajasthan.Yashodhara moved to New Orleans, USA, in 1977 after marrying Sidharth Bhansali, a cardiologist. She has three children, none of whom joined politics. Yashodhara returned to India in 1994 and went into formal politics by contesting the MP state poll in 1998 as a BJP member. A five-time MLA, she was a minister in the erstwhile Shivraj Singh Chouhan government.Jyotiraditya chose to remain in Congress. After his father’s death in a plane crash in 2001, the Guna LS seat fell vacant. Jyotiraditya contested the bypoll in 2002 and won by a record margin of 4.5 lakh votes. He won the next three LS polls from Guna but suffered a shock defeat in 2019 at the hands of his long-time aide Krishna Pal Singh Yadav. It was a double blow to Jyotiraditya, having lost out in the race for CMship only six months earlier.Despite playing a key role in Congress’s victory in the 2018 state polls, he could get the support of only 23 MLAs. The then AICC chief Rahul Gandhi picked Kamal Nath for his experience, and indicated that Scindia’s time would come. After the LS defeat, Jyotiraditya felt sidelined by the state Congress brass although six MLAs from his faction were made ministers in the Kamal Nath cabinet.In January 2019, Scindia sparked a buzz by calling on ex-CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan one evening. Both termed it a “courtesy meet”. In September 2019, rumours went around that he could switch to BJP. Scindia clarified he had no intention of doing so. Then, in November, he dropped all references to his official posts in Congress from his Twitter bio. He played it down, saying he had changed the bio a month ago.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74559302,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1271223,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/therere-some-scindias-in-bjp-some-bjp-in-scindias/articleshow/74559299.cms

This is a mandatory subject for all non-English medium schools.

Principals told TOI that there were mistakes in two questions of one mark each apart from numerous printing errors in punctuation.

Ashnarayan Tiwari, principal of Adarsh Vidya Mandir, said “The first mistake is on page no. 2 in section B. Students have been asked to make meaningful sentence out of the phrase ‘to be know as’ whereas it should have been ‘known as’. It is obvious that students will get confused and either not attempt it or write something wrong.” This question was for one mark.

Tiwari said, “The second mistake appears on page no. 12 in section A(4). Students have to choose the correct voice and in the options given in MCQ, none are correct. The closest, though still incorrect, one is option (b) which says ‘Sawai Jai Singh II found Jaipur’, whereas it should have been ‘founded’.” This question was also for one mark.

In addition to these mistakes in questions, Tiwari said the paper is ‘riddled’ with typos. “There are places where prepositions and articles are missing. Many sentences are devoid of punctuation and that is also not good. For these students (of Hindi and Marathi medium), English is as it is a killer subject. Such blunders only complicate things for them,” said Tiwari.

He added that they will be writing to the board to make award bonus marks for the same.

Each and every corner of the NCERT book is important. I would recommend you to concentrate on full syllabus as questions are asked from every chapter. More concentration is required in algebra, followed by geometry and trigonometry. Easy chapters such as statistics, probability, constructions, areas related to circle and co-ordinate geometry should be well prepared to score good marks in maths.

361,['10/03/2020'],Nagpur Heroes profiles,"Chess prodigies Raunak Sadhwani and Divya Deshmukh have many similarities. Born in December 2005, both started playing chess at the age of seven. They are the youngest to win Maharashtra’s top sports honour Shiv Chhatrapati award. They have played consistently in the last seven years, won many international medals, are troubling established Grandmasters, and are also among the top 10 junior players in the world

Divya, the miracle girl, setting new benchmarks

Nagpur: In the world of 64 chequered boxes, Divya Deshmukh is synonymous with chess and records. This little chess queen from the city, who has acquired celebrity status over the past seven years, has given young girls across the country a reason to play chess and aim higher.

Surprisingly, chess happened accidentally for Divya. “I started with badminton when I was young (around six and half) but that racquet was too big for me. Since chess classes were also going on in the same hall, my parents sent me there. Initially, I didn’t like chess at all. I would hide at home at the chess class timing so as to avoid it. I truly fell in love with chess after winning my first tournament,” she says.

And as they say, the rest is history. She soon started scripting records, not just in the country but also across the world.

After pocketing her first international gold medal by becoming the Asian champion in 2012, Divya became youngest in the world to become the World Youth Chess Champion in 2014. In 2017, she became the first to win the championship twice.

She has represented the country 21 times and brought home a gold medal on 20 occasions, again a rare record. Divya to her credit also has many national achievements which no other girl in the country has been able to accomplish.

“I want to become an IM and WGM, targets I am close to now. If I continue playing good chess, automatically all the titles and glory will come,” says Divya.

After winning her maiden national gold at the age of seven, Divya for the next seven years from 2012 won all the age category national championships. In July last year, she became country’s first youngster to win the U-15 national chess championship for the third-time in a row.

While five players have scored a hat-trick of winning the open national championships, Divya became the first Indian player to claim the coveted trophy thrice in U-15 age category nationals — a record not even India No. 1 Koneru Humpy has achieved.

Divya’s consistent play got the acknowledgement from none other than Humpy who said, “It’s a good achievement. Winning thrice shows her potential.”

Divya also went on to become the youngest Indian player to win a senior national medal. At 13 and in her first senior event, Divya won bronze medal in the national woman chess championship.

The STD XIII student of BVM, Civil Lines, has in her kitty 2,305 international rating points and is currently World No. 5 in the junior girls’ category.

In the U-14 group, Divya became World No. 1 and for the past two years she has maintained the No. 1 position among the junior girls in India.

With age on her side, Divya is all set to bring more laurels for the country.

RAUNAK SADHWANI

Like his name, he is city’s Raunak in the sports arena

Amit.Sampat

Nagpur: Raunak Sadhwani is a ruler and often makes world’s best chess masters resign with his bold moves. Raunak is not just a kid, he is “just something else”, said legendary Viswanathan Anand after the five-time World Champion posted a victory from the jaws of defeat against the city youngster in an international rating chess tournament.

After he started making moves on the board at the age of seven, Raunak took two years to become the state champion and emerged as the national U-9 champion the same year.

Within a short span, Raunak went on to win Asian medals and even grabbed Commonwealth gold in 2015. Thereafter, he started participating in the Open category and soon became a headache for medal winning international players, including former world, continental champions.

In 2018, Raunak became Nagpur’s second International Master (IM), ending a 19-year wait for the city. It was in 1999 that Anup Deshmukh had become city’s first IM. Raunak achieved the feat at the age of 12 and is still the youngest to hold the record in Maharashtra.

Within a year, he went on to become a Grandmaster, the highest title awarded by the World Chess Federation for a player.

He now holds the record of being the youngest Grandmaster (GM) in Maharashtra and the only one from city. Raunak started India’s next chapter of Grandmasters when he became 65th GM of the country last year. At the age of 13, nine months and 28 days, Raunak is the ninth youngest player in history to achieve the GM title.

In the international rating championships, Raunak performs like a Super GM and has developed a habit of giving a performance rating above 2,600 Elo. With an international rating of 2,545 Elo, Raunak is ranked seventh in the World in the Junior Open category. He is No. 3 in India among junior masters.

The talented youngster is working hard to meet the target set for him by Viswanathan Anand who wants Raunak to increase his rating and become a World Champion.

“I want to become a World champion. My initial goal is to improve my game, increase my rating and ranking. I want to use my time to become better and better. I want to be physically fit and psychologically stronger for upcoming tournaments. Dreams can’t be realized through magic. They need sweat, determination, passion and hard work. I will have to come out of my comfort zone and think out of the box,” says Raunak on his dreams.

Raunak’s consistent performance since last three years gave him a wild-card entry to the World Open chess championship featuring Magnus Carlsen, Hikaru Nakamura. He is now the first from the region to participate in such at a high level.

NEW DELHI: A 24-year-old youth, along with an accomplice, entered the apartment of his former girlfriend in east Delhi’s Vasundhara Enclave and allegedly stabbed her as well her 45-year-old mother to death early Monday morning.

Police said the bodies of Sumita Mary and her 25-year-old daughter, Samrita, were found with multiple stab wounds in different rooms of the flat in Mansara Apartments.

The prime suspect, Vikrant Nagar, was held in the evening by Rajasthan cops from a Jaipur-bound bus. He had fled with cash, jewellery, Samrita’s phone and the family’s car. Nagar, an aspiring model, had recently come out of rehab for drug abuse.

Samrita, who was interning at a five-star hotel in Lutyens’ Delhi, had ended her relationship with Nagar but he hadn’t reconciled with the break-up. Initial probe revealed that Nagar was upset over Samrita’s friendship with another man. Her mother worked with an event management firm and also with an NGO in Noida.

Investigating officers said Nagar had the murder planned and was waiting for Samrita to reach home on Sunday night. Around 11pm, she came home after watching a movie with a friend. Just as her car entered the apartment complex, the accused followed behind her.

At 3.07am, Samrita is seen in CCTV footage walking out towards the gate. “It appears that the two had an argument and she was walking away in anger. She told the colony guard that she was going back to pick up her phone and would come out again. Samrita never returned,” said a senior police officer.

Double murder: Youth’s accomplice yet to be nabbed

At 3.50am, Nagar along with his friend are seen exiting the gate of the locality. Samrita’s friend revealed that Nagar did not know how to drive a car. “He banged it at multiple places and broke the main gate of the colony while fleeing. When the security guard questioned Nagar, he said he had pressed the accelerator instead of the brake by mistake,” said a police officer.

In an earlier footage, Nagar along with his friend are seen entering the apartment behind Samrita. Nagar’s friend, who is wearing a hoodie and a mask, has been identified as Prayag. He is absconding. The two can be seen waiting near the staircase of the building before moving towards the house.

Police said that when no one opened the door in the morning, the household help had borrowed the keys to the flat from the neighbours and discovered the bodies. The cops also suspect that Nagar used one of Samrita’s work to commit the murders.

Neighbours told the police that Nagar was a familiar face in the complex and had even occasionally stayed with the family. That is why his presence did not raise suspicion.

Sumita Mary and her daughter had been staying in a third-floor flat in B-block, Mansara Apartments, for many years. Samrita’s father had died when she was five years old. Sumita has two siblings, a brother and a sister, both residing in Kerala.

Hubballi: As part of the cash-strapped Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation ’s ( HDMC ) efforts to generate revenue, and streamline its advertising policy, the civic body has rolled out a proposal to regularize illegal advertisements under the Akrama-Sakrama scheme in the twin cities.

This is being seen by stakeholders as a last chance being offered by the HDMC to the advertising agencies to comply with the norms. In order to carry out this regularisation drive, the civic body, owing to paucity of funds, has decided to penalise those who have erected illegal hoardings, and finance the scheme using the fines.

HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal said that a meeting had been held in February, with representatives of advertising agencies in attendance, and a deadline set for them to furnish a document, wherein they were declare all hoardings that were legal and those that were not. “Before holding the meeting, we had booked cases against agencies for two illegal hoardings under the provisions of the Disfigurement Act. We have prepared a list of five more hoardings The advertising agencies have now submitted lists of hoardings erected legally, and those put up without requisite permission,” said Itnal.

A survey carried out by the HDMC to list both legal and illegal hoardings found that there were as many as 500 billboards across the twin cities, of which 300 were found to be compliant with the norms, and 200 not to be adhering to them.

Sources said that the civic body can earn up to Rs 2 crore in the form of cess and fees by regularising all the outdoor advertisements. The HDMC is also mulling over legal options to initiate stern action against thise putting up hoardings without the necessary approval.

Illegal hoardings dotting the skies of the twin cities has for long been an eyesore for the residents, who have been seeking action against those responsible for putting them up. Corporator Sudheer Saraf, who was the chairman of the HDMC accounts committee two years ago, had ordered a survey of illegal hoardings. He had subsequently issued directions to the authorities to get all of them removed. However, the drive lost steam soon after.

Saraf, also a former mayor, welcomed HDMC’s new initiative and endorsed the call for stern action against illegal hoardings. Advising HDMC officials to check the size of hoardings, Saraf added, “When I was the mayor, I verified the dimensions of the hoardings to ensure they matched with what was submitted to the authorities in the records. If there are no avenues to levy fines, then illegal hoardings must be removed. In case there are no provisions in the law to collect tax, this must be appealed in the court,” said Saraf.

RAICHUR: The resolve of women taking part in the anti-citizenship protest at Raichur ’ Shaheen Bagh , which will enter 50th day on March 15, shot up with thousands of supporters cutting across communities turning up at Mahatma Gandhi stadium to mark the International Women’s Day.

The Anti-CAA , NPR and NRC sit-in dharna led by women was launched on the eve of Republic Day. With determination reinforced, there is no turning back for these women. The dharna will continue until government withdraws CAA that is discriminatory towards people of certain faiths, they say.

Striking a balance between household chores and social cause, nearly 600 - 700 women have been participating in the sit-in since the day of its launch at Tipu Sultan Garden near deputy commissioner’s office.

Salma Khanum, a convener of the indefinite sit-in, said: “Women are hitting the streets to protest anti-people policies of the government. This is a new wave of women uprising that will save the country from the clutches of the fascist regime. It was only a few in the beginning and now we are nearly 700.”

“Karnataka is a land of warrior women who have fought against oppressive rulers. Kittur Rani Chennamma and Belvadi Mallamma, who fought against British colonialism, inspire us to continue with our protest,” she added.

Speaking to TOI, another convener Naiyyad Tayaba said the protest is in tune with Gandhi’ model of non-violence. “The women march through city once a week and spread awareness on Constitution. We conduct constitutional readings and poem recitation. Songs of Dalit uprising are sung too as many from the community take part in the protest. Children also stage cultural programmes. For us, Tipu Garden has become a new home. The permission for dharna is till 9:30pm and so the women return home in the night and comeback next morning,” she said.

The indefinite sit-in is backed by Raichur-based Citizens Forum for Constitutional Rights. The forum was formed by many like-minded left, democratic, women and Dalit organisations.

367,['10/03/2020'],MD kingpins using women as peddlers,"Nagpur: In an emerging trend, the MD racketeers are allegedly using women peddlers to avoid being tracked down by police. Apart from catering to a fixed clientele, these women peddlers are also visiting pubs, restro-lounges and hookah parlours to find new customers and drag them into the addiction of MD or Mephedrone drugs.

The drug costs around Rs3,000 per gram in the international market.

While crime branch’s special cell dealing with cases related to Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, has nabbed some of the main MD kingpins like Abu, Pakya Pathan, Mujaheed, Imran Dalla and few of their operators, there are many others who have come up to fill the void. Some of these emerging drug lords dealing in MDs are allegedly using women for peddling the narcotics powder.

Qayyum, Maqsood and Sonu Dam are learnt to be controlling their MD networks across the city from their bases in north Nagpur. They are using women to take MDs to their fixed clientele and also to young crowds at parties and pubs.

It’s learnt that most of these women are consumers too. “Several women and young girls, especially school and college-going ones, have taken to prostitution for easy money to buy MD. Some of these consumers too are subsequently turning to peddlers,” sources said.

Chitra Rahangdale, daughter of woman drug lord Chandra Thakur, was the biggest catch so far by city police who was nabbed with cocaine worth more than Rs26 lakh around a year ago. She too was found with suspected MD powder in her possession.

Additional CP (crime) Nilesh Bharne too admitted that names of some of the women peddlers have come to fore from north Nagpur. “They are in our radar. We are after them,” he said.

It’s also learnt that the MD racketeers, through their women peddlers, maintain close relation with cricket bookies who are one of the biggest clients. Police sources said MD dealer Dalla’s brother Afzal is one of the bookies who is a deep addict.

Aslam, Feroze, Anwar and some more bookies like them are regular MD consumers who have for some reason remained out of police net.

BENGALURU: A 41-year-old software engineer working with an MNC in Bengaluru has tested positive for Covid-19 in Karnataka’s first confirmed case, the government said on Monday.On February 28, the engineer left Austin for New York in the US. The next day, he boarded a flight to Dubai and reached India on March 1. According to officials in Karnataka,he had come in contact with 2,666 people on his journey back home. Three teams have been formed to trace all those who were exposed to him at workplace in Bengaluru and his east Bengaluru apartment.The engineer has been admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD), Bengaluru. His wife, daughter and a colleague, who flew with him from the US, too have been admitted to RGICD. They are said to be showing symptoms; their test results are awaited. The infected man’s driver, his wife and their two children have been placed in home isolation. They have not shown any symptoms so far.Co-passengers seated two rows ahead and behind him and as well as on his either side on the Emirates flight to Bengaluru have been traced, along with the crew. All of them are under surveillance, Dr K Sudhakar, medical education minister, told reporters on Monday. Sixteen people who flew with the infected engineer are under home isolation.The software engineer attended work in Bengaluru on March 2 and 3. After he developed Covid-19 symptoms on March 4, he visited a private hospital in Bengaluru on March 5 where he was treated as an outpatient. He was admitted to RGICD hours after he tested positive on Sunday. “A confirmatory test was done. His blood and throat swab samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, and the results confirmed it,” a health officer said.“He is healthy, responding to the treatment. He is not on ventilator,” RGICD director Dr C Nagaraja said.

371,['10/03/2020'],"Bewildered by reservations, parties renew nominee hunt","Visakhapatnam: The ward-wise reservations announced for the GVMC elections by the district administration on Sunday midnight have shattered the hopes of majority of aspirants of the political parties who were looking to contest the polls.

As part of the reservation exercise, majority of the wards have gone to a different community or category than that of active leaders or ward presidents whom the parties thought would win them the polls.

For example, the YSRC ward president of the 45th ward is from the general category. However, with ward-wise reservations, the seat is now reserved for the ST category. YSRC is facing a similar situation in the 55th ward as well.

The TDP too is facing a similar challenge across several wards in the city. Consequently, political parties will have to come up with a different strategy, with little time left for the polls, as their preliminary calculations have gone for a toss.

In an attempt to strengthen the political participation of women, 49 wards of the total 98 wards of the GVMC have been reserved for women. All wards in Bheemili (4) and Anakapalli (5) have been allocated to women.

Steps such as these have caught political parties unaware. Choosing the right candidate, that of a particular community and of a particular gender is a herculean task. The parties are also deciding on potential mayor candidates. The mayor will have to win as a corporator to assume the post.

What has made things more complicated is the March 13 deadline, leaving parties only a few days to decide on candidates.

YSRC sources told TOI that the announcement has come as a major shock to party cadre. “The party has candidates ready for only 30 wards. Search is on for remaining wards. This may go on for one or two more days,” a source from YSRC said.

On the other hand, TDP, which has four MLAs in the city, is trying to place itself at a better position than the rival party. The party wants to cash in on the second-rung of leadership associated with the MLAs in the core constituencies.

While Congress seems to be out of the race, the BJP-Jana Sena alliance may have an impact in some segments. Political observers are of the opinion that rebel or independent candidates may play a crucial role in the local body elections.

Visakhapatnam district has 39 ZPTC, 39 MPP and 652 MPTC seats. Except for the ballot papers, all material is ready to be sent to the mandals. A total of 2,077 policing centres have been set up, of which webcasting will be arranged in 286 centres.

Filing of nominations has begun on Monday. While March 11 is the last date to file nominations, the scrutiny process will end on March 12.

Speaking to TOI, a senior TDP leader said, “It is going to be difficult for candidates to meet voters within 10 days. Meeting voters personally will not be possible for any candidate. The elections are going to be based on the party and the party chief’s charisma.”

Dadi Veerabhadra Rao of YSRC, who is in-charge of the party’s campaign for the local body polls said, “Welfare schemes introduced by the YSRC have reached the public. The chief minister’s good governance will provide the mandate to candidates.”

He added that interacting with leaders at the village level would not be possible in this and it is the party president’s image that will play a crucial role.

Owing to the time constraints, political parties are now trying to organise community meetings for a group of villages at one to meet more voters.

“But even that is not possible as they (the parties) will have to look after electioneering too after taking care of the panchayats,” said Congress leader S Sudhakar.

“Community leaders will play a key role in mobilising voters. Most aspirants are already in touch with leaders of various villages in their mandals,” he added.

In terms of monetary expenditure, a ZPTC candidate is allowed to spend Rs 4 lakh while MPTC candidates are allowed Rs 2 lakh

The district has a total of 17,84,678 voters. Of these, 9,08,546 are women and 8,76,061 are men. This means that nearly 51 per cent of voters are women.

Women voters will outnumber men even within categories, according to an official of the Visakhapatnam collectorate who is supervising the census and the electoral process.

Consequently, political parties are now busy trying to woo women votes. Tourism minister and MLA from Bheemili, M Srinivasa Rao said that chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy is committed to welfare of all communities, particularly women.

Srinivasa Rao further said, “As far as the Visakhapatnam zilla parishad is concerned, the chairperson post has been allocated to ST women. This clearly indicates how Jaganmohan Reddy is committed to the welfare of women.”

Meanwhile, a senior TDP leader said that he felt the election announcement was sudden and did not take into account people’s problems, including fears of the spread of the novel coronavirus.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Panic spread in the Visakhapatnam Agency on Monday after reports that Maoist action teams are on the prowl in the area. Maoists have reportedly put up posters at Maddigavuru area in G Madugula mandal of the agency on Sunday midnight.

While leaders of political parties and aspirants in local body polls are looking to campaign, nominees, with the exception of TDP and YSRC, are not daring to enter the villages owing to the threat of Maoists. Sources from Visakha rural police said that the Maoists are desperate to assert their dominance and would like to take their chances during the elections.

“A lull in their activities indicates that they may strike at any time during the elections. We have information that there have been changes in their rank and file,” a senior official of the Visakhapatnam rural police told TOI.

After taking a beating at the Gummirevula encounter, Maoists have remained largely aloof. Now, with the local body elections around the corner, they seem to have pressed their action teams into action. Visakhapatnam rural SP, Babujee Attada said, “We are alerting leaders and people on the Maoists’ target list. We have intensified our combing operations as well as the information network.”

“We managed to successfully handle the situation during the 2019 elections and ensured free and fair polls,” Attada added.

Maoists have a history of attempting to disturb elections in the area. In 2013, Maoists had taken away related papers at Jamiguda village in Pedabayalu mandal and took away nomination papers in other gram panchayats

Koteswara Rao chaired a video conference with zonal commissioners, returning officers and assistant returning officers. In course of the conference, Koteswara Rao directed zonal commissioners to make lodging arrangements for returning officers. He also asked them to store election materials in respective zones.

“Route maps should be prepared for distribution of election material such as ballot papers and to bring them back to the reception centre. Norms set by the election commission should be strictly followed without deviation,” Rao added.

Meanwhile in Vizianagaram , district collector M Hari Jawaharlal urged officials to ensure that the model code of conduct be implemented strictly. During a meeting with officials, the collector said that nominations must be filed between 11am and 3pm and added that no more than two people should be allowed to accompany the candidate.

He further said that the process of filing nomination papers must be recorded on camera and warned officials against violation of rules. He asked them to consult the state election commissioner in case they have any doubts.

Speaking to the media later on, Jawaharlal urged the public to not be tempted or get pressurised by candidates and their parties and exercise their right to vote in a free and fair manner. The collector said that 14 cumulative nominations have been filed so far for 549 MPTC constituencies.

The prohibition and excise department has, for the time being, decided to concentrate on ganja smuggling, which has been continuing unabated in the district despite concerted efforts by the police.

The excise department, alone, seized 100 vehicles and around 30,000 kgs of ganja in the last eight months. Visakha rural police, too, seized several vehicles and the banned product.

“We are destroying ganja plantations and seizing hundreds of kgs of ganja with the help of other departments as well,’ said prohibition and excise department deputy commissioner Srinivasa Rao.

“We have insufficient staff now. So we have shifted the focus on ganja smuggling which is cultivated in more than 10,000 acres in the Andhra-Odisha border (AOB), which precisely makes the task a difficult one,” said one of the senior officers in the excise department.

Speaking about the manpower crunch, sources in the department said, there is at least a 30% shortage in manpower in the district against the allotted strength, a source said.

VISAKHAPATNAM: VMRDA metropolitan commissioner P Koteswara Rao on Monday said the state government had extended layout regularisation scheme’s ( LRS ) application deadline to April 6. In a press release, Rao said applications could be made through https://lrsdtcp.ap.gov.in/, but only with the help of licensed technical personnel approved by VMRDA.

“LRS is applicable to layouts and plots registered before August 31, 2019 as per government order dated January 8. A copy of registered sale deed/title deed, location plan, detailed layout plan, land conversion certificate, etc. need to be uploaded for layout regularisation. The public can regularise their plots by paying a penalty and the value of 14% open space of the plot. The local civic body commissioners of Vizianagaram, Yelamanchili and Nellimarla can also regularise illegal layouts by taking prior approval of VMRDA commissioner. I request the public to utilise the opportunity to bring illegal layouts into the planning fold,” Rao said.

VMRDA received about 20,400 applications in 2015 under the scheme. The urban development authority regularised about 9,500 layouts/plots and rejected about 6,200 applications.

This time VMRDA has received a lukewarm response. This can be attributed to increased land prices and penalties.

BENGALURU: With Karnataka in the grip of Covid-19 scare, authorities from the health and family welfare department recently held two rounds of meetings with HR representatives of 25 IT and BT majors in Bengaluru.

The state reported its first case of Covid-19 on Monday. With the infected man having returned from the US only last week, the health department is taking measures to address concerns raised over Bengaluru techies travelling abroad for work.

“We’ve had two rounds of meetings with representatives from 25 companies. We explained to them the guidelines to be followed pertaining to Covid-19, the dos and don’ts and precautions to be taken. We briefed them about collecting travel history of all their employees, who went abroad,” said Pankaj Kumar Pandey, commissioner, health and family welfare department.

Proactive declaration from persons with travel history to the affected countries is very crucial, officers said.

Deputy CM and minister for IT/BT CN Ashwath Narayan told TOI the IT and BT companies must adhere to precautionary measures. “Many are already avoiding international trips. We don’t want to create fear, but one has to be aware. Companies are aware of the risks. All the suspect cases that we have seen till now are those who had travelled to affected countries earlier,” he said.

Medical education minister K Sudhakar said persons with travel history to affected countries have to honestly self-report themselves in case of symptoms. “All they have to do is report to the toll-free Arogyavani (104),” the minister added.

Besides, the Karnataka government has got into a proactive mode, advising IT/BT firms to allow workers showing flu-like signs to work from home and promote and encourage standard hand and respiratory hygiene practices at workplaces.

Close on the heels of the advisory, business parks across Bengaluru confirmed they are adopting thorough measures to ensure their premises are clean and hygienic, while companies said they are drastically reducing business travel to affected countries and are advising employees to work from home in case they show any flu-like symptoms.

384,['10/03/2020'],"Coronavirus News: How coronavirus attacks? Study of 56,000 patients reveals it stage by stage","NEW DELHI: There is widespread panic across the world about Covid-19 caused by the novel coronavirus . But what does this insidious infection agent do to the human body? There are some answers after a review of nearly 56,000 Covid-19 cases from China, the country of origin of the perilous spread.The review of the Chinese cases shows that the virus causes mild to moderate symptoms after infection in most cases, such as fever, dry cough and fatigue. But this is when the infection is limited to the upper respiratory tract — the nose and the throat. Once the infection involves the lower respiratory tract, complications set in.The human lower respiratory tract consists of the windpipe (trachea), and the bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli that make up the lungs. These structures pull in air from the upper respiratory system, absorb the oxygen into the blood and release carbon dioxide in exchange.A review of the Covid-19 cases that had turned severe and critical, comprising 14% and 6% of the total cases, respectively, showed infection caused by the virus damaging the lungs, therefore leading to shortness of breath in which the patient starts breathing faster, more than 30 times a minute, and a drop in the level of oxygen in the blood.If the infection spreads to more than half of the lung, the oxygen transferring capacity of the organ gets affected. As a result, the oxygen level in the blood decreases. This lack of oxygen gradually affects the brain, heart and then the other organs.“In severe cases when the lung is damaged, complications can be limited to symptoms such as shortness of breath and low oxygen saturation. But if this continues despite treatment, the patient may start getting restless and fall unconscious due to less oxygen in the brain. It can also affect the heart, kidneys and other body parts, leading to multi-organ failure,” explained Dr Arup Basu, senior pulmonology consultant, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.According to the WHO China Joint Commission report, 13.8% of the reviewed cases involved severe disease and 6.1% turned critical. “Individuals at highest risk of severe infection or death include people aged over 60 years and those with underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer,” the report said.Dr Basu explained that patients without other conditions usually recover from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by an infected lung. “Those without a history of any underlying illness succumb to the condition only when there is a secondary bacterial infection,” he pointed out. “However, when patients already have serious or chronic conditions, it is possible the viral infection can cause septic shock or multi-organ dysfunction or failure.” This explains why the review reported most deaths occurred among the persons with co-morbidities.Dr Rommel Tickkoo, associate director, department of internal medicine, Max Saket, said treatment for Covid-19 is symptomatic because there is no specific drug or cure for it. “Management of a severe Covid-19 case involves ventilator support, fluid rehydration and fight against sepsis,” Tickkoo said. He noted that even in swine flu infection, the severe symptoms are similar to Covid-19, as is the management of the disease. However, unlike swine flu with a mortality rate of 0.03%, according to WHO data, mortality rate for Covid-19 is much higher at around 3.4%.Histological examination of the post-mortem samples from a 50-year-old man from Wuhan showed how the lung was completely damaged by the infection. The medical report said there was “evident desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation”, which indicated acute respiratory distress syndrome.A doctor said, “In a country like India where infrastructure for managing severe or critical symptoms is limited, it is all the more important to prevent Covid-19 from spreading.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74562175,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-337167,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-coronavirus-attacks-study-of-56000-patients-reveals-it-stage-by-stage/articleshow/74559381.cms

Yes, the wedding preparations are on in full swing, but right now I’m completely focussed on the film. We are aiming for a Dasara release so it’s a race against time. I’ve got a very hectic couple of months ahead of me,” he says, smiling.Admittedly, the actor has decided to put his honeymoon on hold, until he completes shooting for the movie. “I will only be able to take a week off from shoot for my wedding. Unfortunately, our honeymoon will happen only after I’ve wrapped up the film,” explains the actor. The Kirrak Party star has reunited with co-star Swati Reddy and director Chandoo Mondeti, both of whom were part of the original, for the sequel. “We released a concept video of the film and it’s gone viral. I’m glad the film has remained fresh in people’s minds even six years after release,” says Nikhil, who has been shooting in Hyderabad for the past few days. Kartikeya 2 will pick up from a year after the incidents of the first film, reveals the actor. “Swati will reprise the role she played in the original but we’ve cast another actress whose name will be revealed soon. The challenges my character will face this time will be bigger than in the previous film. We are in this complicated situation of having to pull off a mythological tale that’s taking place in the current period. We researched for six long months before kicking off the film,” he adds.The team of the film even visited Varadharaja Perumal Temple in Kanchipuram, Dwarka Temple in Gujarat, Konark Sun Temple in Orissa and Sri Anantha Padmanabha Swamy Temple in Kerala, apart from reading the Vedas, as part of their research, says Nikhil. Karthikeya 2 seems to follow in the same vein as the previous film, dealing with a mythological tale that dates back years. “The film’s shows how we are forgetting our culture, history and mythology. A lot of unknown secrets from 5,000 years ago will be revealed in the film. This time, instead of Subramanya Swamy, the film will explore Lord Krishna’s stories. And, of course, like in the previous film, we will also explore the concept of God being present in a human form now,” says the actor.Nikhil and his fiancée are all set to tie the knot come April 16. The Kirrak Party actor seems to have no time for a breather, what with juggling wedding preparations and his upcoming films at the same time. “Yes, the wedding preparations are on right now, but I’m also busy with shoot. I will only be able to take a week off for the wedding,” says the actor, adding, “My focus is completely on the sequel of Karthikeya for now, because we’re aiming for a Dasara release. I will only be able to take a break after that, so the honeymoon too will have to wait until I’ve wrapped up the shoot,” he says, signing off.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74553099,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-106841/74553099.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/telugu/movies/news/no-time-for-honeymoon-until-i-wrap-up-my-film/articleshow/74553099.cms

BENGALURU: A 16-year-old Kolar girl's deposition before a magistrate that she was in love with a youth, who was charged with abducting and raping her, and that they neither had sexual intercourse nor did he force her, has come to the accused's rescue.

Citing the girl's statement and absence of medical examination to prove rape, the high court overturned the December 10, 2018 verdict of a Kolar court convicting Kumar (name changed) of abduction and rape. Kumar, 29, had been sentenced for seven years each for abduction and rape and 10 years under Pocso Act.

Allowing his appeal, Justice Mohammed Nawaz held that the prosecution failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt, especially the basic charge of abduction. The judge noted that in the first place, the prosecution hadn't established that the girl had been kidnapped from her parents' residence and kept in a house belonging to Kumar's friend.

The judge said under section 164 of the criminal procedure code, the girl only stated before a magistrate that she was in love with Kumar and that he neither troubled her nor had intercourse during the 20 days they stayed together at his friend's house. The prosecution contended that Kumar kidnapped the girl on December 2, 2016, and took her to Srinivaspura and thereafter to Madanapalle in Andhra Pradesh. She was confined to his friend's house in Tambalapalli, Andhra Pradesh.

The case was registered based on a complaint filed by the girl's parents.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

NEW DELHI: Two men, including the son of the houseowner in Lajpat Nagar, were killed when the boundary wall of a private hospital beside their house collapsed on them on Monday afternoon. The men were erecting an iron mesh for construction work adjacent to the wall when it collapsed on them. A case of causing death due to negligence has been registered against the hospital.

Police said that the victims were identified as Gagan Wadhwa and Amit. The other labourers informed the area beat constable when the wall collapsed. A team of Delhi fire services, policemen and the labourers pulled out the two from under the debris and rushed them to a hospital. However, the two succumbed to their injuries.

Prima facie probe revealed that Wadhwa, a resident of the F-block in Lajpat Nagar part II, was getting the iron mesh erected along the wall when it started crumbling. It was found that the lower portion of the wall was made out of clay and bricks and was built at least 40-years-ago. Another 10-15 feet of concrete structure was also constructed on top of the clay base.

The additional weight of the iron mesh resulted in the clay to collapse. Police suspect that no maintainance work was conducted on the wall for quite some time. The owner of the hospital is being questioned regarding the incident. A probe has been initiated to find out whether there was a foul play involved as well.

A crime and forensic team was called to the scene to lift evidences from the scene. A report will be presented before the municipal corporation as well. The area would also be inspected by the civic body to find out if there was illegal construction in the premises as well.

415,['10/03/2020'],Cabinet may clear telecom bailout package this week,"Staggered payment plan may give telcos time to raise funds

NEW DELHI: A rescue package for stressed telecom companies may be cleared by the Union Cabinet later this week and could include a staggered payment schedule for the outstanding AGR (adjusted gross revenue) dues. Relief on the licence fee front may also come up for review as the government takes stock of measures aimed at nursing the telecom industry back to health.Top sources said the telecom department is in the process of preparing a “bailout package” for the companies in tandem with officials in the finance ministry and Niti Aayog. The relief is being worked out as the next date of hearing on the telecom matter comes up in the Supreme Court on March 17, by when the government and the mobile operators need a roadmap for paying the massive AGR dues.“We are enthused by the willingness of the companies to start making payments towards their outstanding AGR dues. While the government wants to abide by the orders of the Supreme Court, which remains the top priority, it also wants to ensure that there are no monopolies that are created in the sector, and that all the companies are given a viable option to pay back the massive dues,” one of the sources said.A staggered payment schedule may give companies time to raise funds and pay back the massive dues demanded from them. There could be an interest that could be demanded on such staggered payments, the source said. The licence fee is currently fixed at 8%, and this may be reduced in line with the recommendations made by Trai previously.The Digital Communications Commission (DCC), the high-level multi-ministry body seized of telecom matters, has already discussed various bailout options for the beleaguered telcos that need to pay a cumulative Rs 1.47 lakh crore to the telecom department in line with the SC’s order. Its views have been finalised and will be considered by the Cabinet.The majority of burden of the AGR dues has fallen on Vodafone Idea, which needs to pay Rs 53,000 crore but has so far managed to give only Rs 3,500 crore. Airtel, which was asked to pay Rs 35,586 crore, has so far paid Rs 18,004 crore (balance Rs 17,582 crore), while Tata group has to give Rs 13,823 crore but has paid only Rs 4,197 crore (balance Rs 9,626 crore).The companies have submitted their self-assessment numbers on the AGR dues and have disputed the telecom department’s demand notice.However, another source in the government said that the telecom department “stands with the dues demand” made by it, adding that it will not be able to reconcile numbers with the self-assessed estimates of the companies before the SC’s next hearing. “We are confident about our numbers, a large part of which have been audited by a CAG team. Also, it may not be possible to ratify each and every number with the estimates presented by the telcos so soon. This is a lengthy process and may take at least six months.”A bailout package is seen as necessary for the companies to survive. While Airtel has said that it wants to pay the money demanded by the telecom department well before March 17, Vodafone Idea has made it clear that it will fail to make the payment if a relief package is not extended.Vodafone Idea chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla has already met finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on the matter.Last week, Nick Read, the global CEO of Vodafone, also held a meeting with the two senior Cabinet ministers, telling the government that the British telecom major wants to stay invested in India. Seeking a rescue package, Read conceded that Vodafone Idea made a mistake by not paying the higher AGR amount previously.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74559478,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-107198,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cabinet-may-clear-telecom-bailout-package-this-week/articleshow/74559474.cms

NEW DELHI: In the next few months, the national capital may get a taste of a nutrabeverage developed from the mahua flower - key ingredient of the traditional country beer enjoyed in the tribal heartlands of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. The Tribal Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Trifed) is all set to bring to the market a mahua flower-based nutrabeverage in a blend of conventional fruits with high nutrition value and low alcohol content of up to 5%.

Trifed managing director, Pravir Krishna, told TOI that they have applied for an excise license with the Delhi government. Once production is stepped up, Trifed plans to expand the outreach in the market to other states.

Chhattisgarh-based Adivasi Bahuuddeshiya Co-operative Society has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with National Research Development Corporation to produce and market the mahua nutrabeverage developed by Trifed after two years of research collaboration with IIT Delhi. After testing the product among consumers, Trifed has now signed a MoU with NRDC for enabling technology transfer to suitable entrepreneurs to produce and market the beverage.

Mahua is a prominent multipurpose forest tree and plays an important role in the rural household economy. Its flowers are a rich source of sugar and contain appreciable amounts of vitamins, minerals and calcium. The flowers are fermented and distilled, yielding spirituous liquor also known as 'country beer'. The nutrabeverage is considered to have contents that can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease.

CHANDIGARH: The Punjab Health Systems Corporation, nodal agency for procurement of medicines for the government hospitals in the state, on Monday said there is no shortage of medicine in government hospitals at present.

The corporation added that stock of most important essential drugs for approximately three months was available in drug warehouses and hospitals.

The Times of India stands by its March 9 article on the issue. The story nowhere mentions that that government hospitals were facing shortage of essential medicines.

The Punjab food and drug administration (FDA) had on March 5 held a meeting with pharma companies— a copy of the minutes of that meeting is in possession of The Times of India — and the pharmaceutical firms had alerted the Punjab government about the real possibility of drug shortage in the state as they only had raw material stock to meet requirements up to March 31.

The Indian pharmaceutical industry is heavily dependent on Chinese imports for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) — 70% of APIs are imported from China.

GURUGRAM: An audit by the district education department of nine schools in Mewat ’s Ferozepur-Jhirka has revealed gross irregularities, with expenditure of more than Rs 7 lakh shown to be incurred for their midday meal (MDM) schemes.

The block education officer has been pulled up for oversight, asked to initiate the recovery and deposit the amount with the department within 15 days.

Last month, education officials reviewed the bills and financial records of all nine primary and middle government schools, and found that several items for midday meal schemes had been added by them. However, the officials found that these items had either not been serviced to the students, or the prices of each item had been spiked.

Under the state’s midday meal scheme, around Rs 4 a day is spent on a student in the primary segment and over Rs 6 in the upper primary segment.

The schools produce the bills based on the attendance records. In the case of the nine schools, the education department found that the amount quoted and sought was much higher than the money that was actually spent on each student as per the attendance records, pointing to discrepancies and possible siphoning of funds.

Of these nine schools, many did not produce their financial records from 2015, while others failed to produce an updated cashbook. For instance, in Doha village, the primary school did not show its records from January 2015 to September 2016. While the middle school for boys was pulled up for spending an additional amount of over Rs 9,000, the middle school for girls spent an additional amount of Rs 65,989 for midday meals, while its cashbooks for the months of September and October 2019 were incomplete.

Similarly, an additional Rs 1,67,858 was spent for midday meals at the Government Girls Primary School in Ravali village, while at the Government Girls Middle School, an additional Rs 1,54,732 was spent.

While district education officer Kapil Punia ruled out any lapses in the quality of food and services, he warned that officials could face action. “We noticed that per-student spend based on attendance records did not match. Many schools haven’t even updated their records. We have given 15 days to deposit the money. After Holi, if they don’t respond to the notice, another notice will be sent giving 15 more days. If they fail to adhere to that too, officials will be suspended and an investigation will be launched.”

Sources said more such misappropriation of funds could be unearthed if and when a detailed probe takes place.

Earlier this year, the Centre had decided to carry out a review of the MDM scheme in all states and Union Territories after alleged episodes of irregularities and corruption came to light. The review will be carried out by a private agency hired by government think tank Niti Aayog.

Haryana has 14,358 schools that are covered under the MDM scheme. Of these, only 10,679 schools have reported serving midday meals. Data for the remaining 3,679 schools is not available with the government.

A sitting MP in the RS as an independent from Jharkhand, Nathwani is due to retire on April 2.

YSRCP also named industrialist Alla Ayodhya Rami Reddy and two ministers in the Jagan Mohan Reddy cabinet, Pilli Subhaschandra Bose and Mopidevi Venkata Ramana, as its candidates for the March 26 polls. In the 175-member assembly, YSRCP, with its 151 MLAs, is in a position to win all the four Rajya Sabha seats from the state.

The announcement of Nathwani’s candidature comes days after recent meeting of RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani with the CM. Ambani flew down to Amaravati to meet the CM.

Expressing his appreciation, Nathwani tweeted, “I sincerely thank Hon’ble CM Sh @ysjagan and his party @YSRCParty for considering me as their Rajya Sabha candidate from Andhra Pradesh. I am committed to serve the people of #AndhraPradesh”. Nathwani is a two-time independent MP in the Upper House from Jharkhand.

Bose and Ramana were picked for RS since they would be losing their membership of the legislative council, thereby ceasing to be ministers, as the assembly had passed a resolution seeking the dissolution of the legislative council. Both of them belong to backward class communities and were staunch loyalists of Jagan’s father, the late CM Y S Rajasekhara Reddy.

GHAZIABAD: The sale of non-vegetarian products, especially chicken, has gone down by more than 60% in Ghaziabad in the wake of the coronavirus scare. Even Holi, when the demand is usually high, has failed to make much difference in the sale of chicken.

Traders said that during Holi, the demand for meat goes up as high as 20 times. ""But there is hardly any customer this year,"" said Salman Qureshi, a meat seller from Raj Nagar Extension. ""Around 80% of my customers have not been buying meat because of the misconception that coronavirus spreads from chicken. No doubt, the price has gone down in the wholesale market. If we reduce price in the retail market too, our survival will become difficult,"" he added.

The situation at restaurants and food joints isn't any better. Deepak Singh, manager of a restaurant in Ahinsa Khand 2, said, ""Ever since the news of coronavirus started beaming on TV channels, customers have been staying away from non-vegetarian products. We are getting just 5-10 customers a day against at least 40 on normal days. Even those who are coming are asking for mutton. Chicken has completely gone off the table,"" he added.

Chicken suppliers from the Ghazipur wholesale market said the rate has dipped by Rs 50 a kg. Mohammad Naushad Qureshi, a wholesale chicken supplier at the Ghaziapur Murga Mandi, said, ""The sale has gone down by 75%. In Haryana, the price for a kilo of chicken at poultry farms is Rs 28-30, while in Maharashtra, it is selling as cheap as Rs 10 a kg. It is poultry farmers who are the losers here.""

Ghaziabad chief medical officer NK Gupta clarified there is no harm in consuming well-cooked non-vegetarian food items, but advised caution against buying semi-cooked and frozen items.

Moreover, the devolution of money to the Municipal Corporation of Chandigarh is guided by the Delhi Finance Commission. As per their calculation, Municipal Corporation of Chandigarh is asking for Rs 1,400 crore as per their formula and the UT administration has been able to provide them only Rs 375 crore.""The report said, ""The committee has taken note of the condition of infrastructure in 13 villages that have been added to the municipal corporation of Chandigarh in 2019. It feels a sense of urgency in allocating more funds to the UT for proper infrastructure development of these villages - to provide drinking water, sewerage system, storm water drainage system, street lights, roads and horticulture works.

Energy index plunged 18.2% to its lowest level since August 2004 and crude prices were on track for worst day in three decades as Saudi Arabia and Russia moved to significantly ramp up production after the collapse of a supply cut agreement.Companies listed on the S&P 500 have now lost more than $5 trillion in value in a sell-off sparked by fears that the coronavirus epidemic could tip the global economy into recession.“There is potential that we could be at the start of a financial crisis part two,” said Dennis Dick, head of markets structure, proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. “It’s a possibility right now that wasn’t on the table until we had this oil plunge over the weekend.”Trading was halted immediately after the opening as the S&P 500 tumbled 7%, triggering an automatic 15-minute cutout originally put in place to avoid a repeat of the “Black Monday” crash in 1987, when the Dow slumped nearly 23%.The circuit breakers were adjusted in 2012 — the thresholds needed to trigger a trading pause were lowered and the S&P 500 replaced the Dow as the benchmark index.The S&P 500 has fallen 18% from its record high hit as recently as three weeks ago, and stands only about 3% away from moving into bear market territory, in one of the most dramatic swings ever. Wall Street ’s fear gauge, halted for the first half hour after opening, jumped to its highest level since the 2008 crisis. Oil majors Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp , fell more than 7%, each to hit multi-year lows. Underlining the broad-based tumble, declining issues outnumbered advancers for an 18-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 17-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury hit a record low again, sending the rate-sensitive financials index down 9.8%.Traders now expect US Federal Reserve policymakers to cut interest rates for the second time this month when they meet next week.

GURUGRAM: RWAs across New Gurugram have joined hands with NGOs to hold camps offering hand sanitisers and masks to residents at subsidised rates, as they have vanished from chemist shops after people resorted to panic buying amid the coronavirus outbreak. They are also trying to spread awareness in condominiums.

Societies where RWAs conducted or plan to conduct camps include Sare Homes (sector 92), DLF Regal Garden (Sector 90), BPTP Park Prime (Sector 66) and Vatika India Next (Sector 82).

On Sunday, a drug control department team had seized 3.5 lakh masks and 2,500 bottles of hand sanitisers from 70 shops. These seized items will now be sold from 40 stores across the city at 20% discount so that complaints of shortage can be addressed.

“Lack of availability of these hand sanitisers and masks is a serious concern. We’ve have tied up with an NGO to provide them at subsidised rates through camps,” Praveen Malik, president of SARE Homes RWA in Sector 92, said.

Congress functionary Capt Ajay Yadav said, “The government agencies should conduct raids in Gurugram to prevent hoarding of masks and sanitisers. Artificial shortage has been created by these people.”

Meanwhile, the District Legal Service Authority organised a medical awareness camp to quell fears about Covid-19 on Monday.

429,['10/03/2020'],Scrapping of AT1 bonds to hit mutual funds,"MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) decision to extinguish Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds of Yes Bank will hurt a large number of retail and other investors (through write offs in mutual funds and insurance funds), bank treasuries and HNIs. In addition, RBI’s decision has also increased uncertainty about these bonds, which are leading to a drop in the prices of these bonds issued by other banks, analysts said. As prices of these bonds drop, investors will see the value of their investments also go down.According to Suman Chowdhury , president — ratings, Acuité Ratings & Research, the RBI decision on Yes Bank’s AT1 bonds strongly validates the inherent risk in these bonds or Innovative Perpetual Debt Instruments (IPDI), which form part of the Tier-1 capital of a bank.“This is for the first time in the history of the Indian banking sector that a bank’s T1 bonds are being written down at the ‘point of non-viability’ (PONV) that is the investors have to take a hit on both principal and the balance interest payments,” he said in a note.Clearly, the investors in such bonds, mainly the MFs and banks’ treasuries will need to take a significant hit due to this development. “Acuité also believes that this will limit the market for AT1 bonds in India only to issuances by a few large public sector banks and further, the pricing will see increased differential with that of Tier-2 bonds to reflect the differential risk,” Chowdhury said.All the mutual funds like Nippon India MF, Franklin Templeton MF , UTI MF, Kotak MF and some others, which were holding these bonds by Yes Bank, have already written off their investments.According to a report by domestic brokerage Batlivala & Karani Securities, of about Rs 94,000 crore AT1 bonds currently being held by various institutions, which have been issued by various PSU and private banks, nearly 42% or about Rs 38,000 crore is with several mutual funds. The rest are with insurance companies, HUFs, trusts and others.“As market’s trust on AT1 bonds is sure to wane after the RBI decision to extinguish Yes Bank’s AT1 bonds, the prices of these bonds will fall (and yields will rise), the NAVs of funds will take a hit. Also, going forward “market will differentiate between good and bad credit, and accordingly we will see yield spreads widening across names but clearly differentiating between strong and weaker names,” the report by B&K Securities noted.“From MF perspective, after 100% mark down of Yes Bank bonds, we believe IndusInd Bank’s AT1 bonds are likely to face the major brunt (due to spread widening),” it said. Soon after the RBI decision on Thursday evening, IndusInd Bank had postponed a scheduled board meeting that was to deliberate issuance of AT1 bonds, among other agendas, by the lender.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74561308,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-37113,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/scrapping-of-at1-bonds-to-hit-mfs/articleshow/74559624.cms
430,['10/03/2020'],Government hopes SBI will exit Yes Bank before three-year lock-in period,"(File photo)

NEW DELHI: The government is hoping that State Bank of India (SBI) will exit Yes Bank well before the three-year lock-in period proposed in the draft reconstruction plan for the troubled lender.

The exit may be as early within a year, a senior government official told TOI, adding that in such a situation SBI may need a special permission from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which has worked out the restructuring strategy in consultation with the finance ministry.

""There is massive interest from investors and SBI will get some very good names. We expect things to normalise in the coming months and once that happens, SBI can slowly reduce its holding and exit,"" said an official. The draft restructuring plan has proposed that SBI has to hold at least 26% stake in Yes Bank for at least three years.

Bankers, however, said it may be too early to talk about an exit plan as the extent of the problem at the lender, which has been under regulatory spotlight for the past few months, will only be known once the new management takes charge and start implementing the revamp strategy.

Besides, the economic uncertainty could create fresh bumps for the banking sector, especially for an entity which is under pressure, bank executives said.

Official sources said the strategy to get SBI to acquire up to 49% in Yes Bank was a well thought-out strategy as it did not put any pressure on the exchequer or the bank, with initial infusion of around Rs 2,500 crore. Besides, it does not put any pressure on SBI's balance sheet.

RBI and the government appeared keen to try out a new model for restructuring instead of saddling the public sector with problematic entities and weighing down its operations for the next few years.

Bankers, however, suggested that a part of the reason may have had to do with SBI's own reluctance to merge Yes Bank with itself, given the massive mismatch in the operating structure and salaries of the two lenders, apart from concerns over the private player impacting the country's largest bank's balance sheet.

433,['10/03/2020'],‘Steps needed to counter economic fallout of virus’,"NEW DELHI: Policymakers will need to implement substantial targeted fiscal, monetary, and financial market measures to help affected households and businesses, considering that the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak reflects acute shocks in specific sectors, IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath said on Monday.Households and businesses hit by supply disruptions and a drop in demand could be targeted to receive cash transfers, wage subsidies, and tax relief, helping people to meet their needs and businesses to stay afloat, Gopinath wrote in a IMF blog.She said central banks should be ready to provide ample liquidity to banks and non-bank finance companies, particularly to those lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises, which may be less prepared to withstand a sharp disruption. Governments could offer temporary and targeted credit guarantees for the near-term liquidity needs of these firms. Financial market regulators and supervisors could also encourage, on a temporary and time-bound basis, extensions of loan maturities.Broader monetary stimulus such as policy rate cuts or asset purchases can lift confidence and support financial markets if there is a marked risk of a sizeable tightening in financial conditions (with actions by large central banks also generating favourable spillovers for vulnerable countries). Broad-based fiscal stimulus consistent with available fiscal space can help lift aggregate demand but would most likely be more effective when business operations be gin to nor malise.“Considering the epidemic’s broad reach across many countries, the extensive cross-border economic linkages, as well as the large confidence effects impacting economic activity and financial and commodity markets, the argument for a coordinated, international response is clear. The international community must help countries with limited health capacity to avert a humanitarian disaster,” Gopinath said in her blog.Gopinath said the coronavirus epidemic involves both supply and demand shocks. Business disruptions have lowered production, creating shocks to supply. And consumers’ and businesses’ reluctance to spend has lowered demand.“On the demand side, the loss of income, fear of contagion, and heightened uncertainty will make people spend less. Workers may be laid off, as firms are unable to pay their salaries. These effects can be particularly severe on some sectors such as tourism and hospitality —as seen for example in Italy.”“Since the start of the recent US equity market selloff on February 20, 2020, airline stock prices have been hit disproportionately, in line with the post-9/11 terrorist attacks but lower than after the global financial crisis. In addition to these sectoral effects, worsening consumer and business sentiment can lead firms to expect lower demand and reduce their spending and investment. In turn, this would exacerbate business closures and job losses.”",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74562818,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-331050,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/steps-needed-to-counter-eco-fallout-of-virus/articleshow/74559653.cms
434,['10/03/2020'],"Crude crashes to $31, recovers some ground","New Delhi: International benchmark Brent wilted to $31/barrel - the lowest since the 1991 Gulf War - but later recovered some ground to trade at $36.5 under the impact of Saudi Arabia's first salvo in its oil price war with Russia and a negative demand outlook from the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Monday was the first trading day after Saudi-led Opec and Russia, its ally since 2016 in propping up prices, parted ways on Friday over the former's proposal to deepen the current production cut to 3.6 million barrels per day (bpd), or 3.6% of the current daily global supply. Riyadh hit back with deep price discounts of $6-8/barrel and announced intentions to pump up volumes to flood an already over-supplied market amid faltering demand due to economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak.

The oil market was further spooked by the IEA's monthly outlook for March, which was prepared before Riyadh and Moscow split, saying demand will fall this year for the first time since the global financial crisis of 2009 as the coronavirus outbreak slows down economic activities in more and more countries. ""While the situation remains fluid, we expect global oil demand to fall in 2020 - the first full-year decline in more than a decade - because of the deep contraction in China, which accounted for more than 80% of global oil demand growth in 2019, and major disruptions to travel and trade,"" it said.

The price crash and the negative demand outlook prompted some western analysts to say a $20/barrel-price is a disticnt possibility. The general view, however, is that oil prices will remain subdued, possibly over the fist half. ""The immediate outlook for the oil market will ultimately depend on how quickly governments move to contain the coronavirus outbreak, how successful their efforts are, and what lingering impact the global health crisis has on economic activity,"" the IEA report said.

According to economic affairs secretary Atanu Chakraborty, the drop in oil prices is positive for India, the world's third-largest consumer that meets 83% of its demand through imports. An extended spell of low prices will hasten reduction in fuel prices and leave money in the government's kitty for incentives to revive growth without sacrificing social spending. Every $10/barrel fall in oil price is estimated to reduce India's import bill and the current account deficit by 0.4-0.5% of the GDP. The government can use the window of low pil prices to shore up finances by raising fuel tax like it had done between November 2014 and January 2016.

This is how it works: Cheaper oil brings down subsidy outgo and import bill - the latter improving balance of payments position. Lower demand for dollar to pay for oil helps the rupee. Low fuel prices brings down cost of living and services, creating ground for putting money into people's pocket by reducing interest rates.

HPCL, BPCL stocks gain on oil slide

MUMBAI: As global crude prices dipped by nearly a third, PSU oil marketing companies witnessed heavy buying on Monday with BPCL and HPCL both closing over 5% higher while IOC, after rallying in early trades, closed 1.3% lower. If crude oil prices fall, government-owned refiners will have to bear lower subsidy burden and hence the rally in these stocks.

Starting Friday, crude oil prices globally have been on a slippery slope after Russia and OPEC countries disagreed on future oil production levels and started a war on crude oil prices. According to Ravindra Rao, Head of Commodity Research, Kotak Securities, the Russia-Saudi Arabia tiff has fueled concerns about an outright price war in crude oil as each nation tries to gain its market share. “Demand destruction due to Coronavirus outbreak, higher US crude production and lack of any additional cuts by OPEC as well as no extension of existing cuts have fueled concerns about an oversupplied market resulting in a sell-off in crude oil,” Rao said.

AHMEDABAD: On International Women's Day on Sunday, a new Gujarati music album titled ‘Kachi Keri, Paki Keri (Raw mango, ripened mango)’ was released starring Alpita Chaudhari . Apparently, the lady cop, who was suspended for making TikTok video in police station, has decided to live life by her own rules and not give up what is close to her heart.

Chaudhari, working as a cop in Lok Rakshak Dal (LRD), a fixed pay constable position, had hit headlines after she was suspended, which triggered an avalanche of action against cops gripped with TikTok fever posting shortform mobile videos.

After being suspended for the viral video where she was seen dancing in front of lockup inside the Langhnaj police station in Mehsana district, Chaudhari had launched her first video album aptly titled ‘TikTok ni deewani’ with Gujarati folk singer Jignesh Kaviraj in September.

Later, she sang in two religious video albums and also featured in a video album with Gujarati actor Dhaval Barot named 'Kachi Keri, Paki Keri' recently. Chaudhari says she has numerous film offers but she awaits permission from her superiors.

Chaudhari, who joined the force as LRD in 2016, says she is fine-balancing living her dream and the one her father saw for her. “It was my childhood dream to become an actor, model or singer. But as my father, who is in police force, wished to see me as a cop, I followed in his footsteps and donned the khaki. I don't think it is fair for me to give up one dream for the other,” said Chaudhari.

Alpita has many offers to act in Gujarati films

Alpita Chaudhari says she acted in four video albums after her suspension which includes two on her community deity ‘Arbuda Ma’.

Currently, she is posted at Kadi police station in Mehsana. By her own admission, her stardom attracts attention on the job. “Whenever I go out for investigation or bandobust, people flock around me requesting for a selfie. Guess it is natural when you become a star.”

When asked about her plans to join Gollywood, she breaks into a smile and says: “There are too many offers but I need to take permission from my department. Once I get permission, I will act.”

While Thambi Durai was the Lok Sabha deputy speaker during 2014-19, Munusamy is one of the two deputy coordinators of AIADMK. Both the leaders, however, unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary elections last year - Thambi Durai from Karur and Munusamy from Krishnagiri.

Several leaders were mounting pressure on the AIADMK leadership for the three Rajya Sabha seats. Prominent aspirants included V Maitreyan, Natham R Viswanathan, Gokula Indra and A Anwhar Raajhaa, besides Thambi Durai and Munusamy. AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam and joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami had advised party leaders to abide by the decision of the leadership.

In addition, the AIADMK leadership was facing trouble from actor Vijayakant's DMDK seeking a Rajya Sabha seat for his brother-in-law L K Sudheesh. In a recent interaction with media, Vijayakant's wife reminded the AIADMK about its promise during the alliance talks for last year's Lok Sabha polls. Further, New Justice Party chief, A C Shanmugam, who is part of the AIADMK alliance and unsuccessfully contested the Vellore Lok Sabha election on the 'two leaves' symbol, was eyeing a seat.

""Unlike DMDK, Vasan did not make any noise and discreetly used his connections in Delhi to reach out to the BJP leadership. While Vasan had called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi sometime ago, BJP national general secretary Muralidhar Rao met chief minister Palaniswami last week and conveyed BJP's suggestion to allot a seat to Vasan,"" a source privy to the developments said.

""I will act as a bridge between the Centre and state government and ensure timely allocation of central funds to Tamil Nadu ,"" Vasan told reporters. Munusamy told TOI, ""The decision to nominate me was taken by the party leadership and I am thankful to them. My work in Rajya Sabha will speak.""

In a statement, MEA said, “Prime Minister’s visit to Bangladesh next week at the invitation of Sheikh Hasina is being deferred. While expressing understanding of the circumstances that necessitates this deferment, India is ready to work with Bangladesh, as partners, to combat the spread of this disease in our shared neighbourhood.”

The MEA spokesperson said they had received official notice from Dhaka on postponement of the public event which would have seen Modi delivering the keynote address on March 17. According to official sources in Dhaka, the event would have had many global leaders in attendance. Public health concerns as a result of the coronavirus pandemic had prompted the decision.

The past week has seen a number of protests by Islamist parties against India and the prime minister’s visit. The postponement could also help bring down temperatures and save embarrassment for both the governments.

LEICESTER: Harvey Barnes and Jamie Vardy each scored twice as Leicester strengthened their challenge for a place in the Champions League next season with a 4-0 thrashing of Aston Villa on Monday.

Brendan Rodgers's men had won just one of their previous seven Premier League games, but remain in third and restored an eight-point advantage over fifth-placed Manchester United in the battle for a top-four finish.

Defeat leaves Villa rooted in the relegation zone and there was little from the visitors to suggest they can save themselves in the final 10 games of the season.

No side has conceded more goals in the Premier League this season than Villa. It was easy to see why Leicester as passed up a host of simple chances from poorly defended set-pieces early on.

Pepe Reina blocked Jonny Evans's downward header before Kelechi Iheanacho and Caglar Soyuncu headed wastefully off target.

Reina was a spectator when Villa stunned Leicester to reach the League Cup final in January and Dean Smith's decision to recall the Spaniard in place of Orjan Nyland backfired for the opening goal five minutes before half-time.

The former Liverpool goalkeeper raced well outside his box, but was beaten to the ball by the pace of Barnes, who kept his cool to fire into an unguarded net.

Iheanacho then missed a great chance to double Leicester's lead early in the second half and the Nigerian may find himself back on the sidelines in the weeks to come as Vardy refound his scoring touch.

The former England striker started on the bench as he returned from injury and had only been on the field four minutes when he grabbed his first goal in 10 games from the penalty spot after Tyrone Mings was adjudged to have handled Barnes's cross.

Vardy was back in the groove and doubled his tally 11 minutes from time when he found space at Reina's near post to move two goals clear in the race for the Premier League golden boot.

Barnes then also smashed home his second of the evening from Marc Albrighton's low cross.

442,['10/03/2020'],5 beauty tips to remove Holi colours from skin,"A chilled glass of flavoured milk, relentless dancing to Bollywood songs on loop and different shades of colour in the air- there's so much to love about Holi. And what better way to celebrate it than the traditional way with gulal and splashes of colours? Having said that, we often forget to take care of our skin during this time amidst all the gaiety.The colours do take a toll on your skin, leaving it dry and dehydrated after the long hours of festivities coupled with exposure to the sun. Here are some post-Holi tips and tricks to help retain your glowing skin.The most important self-care step post-Holi is– ‘exfoliating’. After cleansing your skin completely, it is imperative to exfoliate your body using a gentle scrub to get rid of all the stubborn colour. Wash it off gently with cold water.A mandatory step of the post-Holi skincare regimen is using a body oil. It is rich in antioxidants and massaging a generous amount onto your skin will help nourish the skin from within, while getting rid of the colour gently and naturally.Excessive colour can cause breakouts and even dull your skin. A herbal face pack will help soothe the skin while healing it. Regularly using a face pack will help your skin slowly regain its glow.After taking a shower, don’t forget to moisturise your skin. The skin tends to get dry after exposure to the sun and colours, followed by rigorous exfoliation. The right moisturiser will keep your skin smooth and hydrated.Like your skin, your lips also need some post-Holi care. Your lips can get chapped and gently rubbing a lip balm into your lips not only helps you get rid of the colours, but it also acts as a protective barrier and keeps them nourished.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74554065,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-213224/74554065.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/beauty/5-beauty-tips-to-remove-holi-colours-from-skin/articleshow/74554065.cms

445,['10/03/2020'],Ranji Trophy final: Saurashtra 206/5 as Bengal make late inroads,"(PTI Photo)

RAJKOT: Bengal made late inroads to restrict Saurashtra to 206 for five at stumps on Day 1 of the Ranji Trophy final at the SCA stadium on Monday.

Avi Barot, who was promoted up the order, walked out with Harvik Desai after Saurashtra skipper Jaydev Unadkat elected to bat after winning the toss. The three Bengal pacers did not get their line right and bowled too short and often off the mark too. The Saurashtra openers quickly settled down and started scoring briskly.

Some poor catching also let Bengal down as three tough chances went abegging in the first session of play itself. Desai was first to be dropped by Anushtup Majumdar diving to his right at first slip when the right-hander edged one while attempting to drive pacer Akash Deep . Then, Ishan Porel reacted late and failed to reach a skier that dropped short of him at square-leg after Barot got a top edge while trying to sweep Shahbaz Ahmed.

The left-arm spinner was once again unlucky in his very next over when Desai, on 35, was dropped at first slip by Sudip Chatterjee as the ball spun and took the outer edge of the bat. All this allowed Saurashtra to take lunch at 77 without loss.

Shahbaz, who came in at the eighth over of the morning and bowled unchanged for 20 overs on both sides of the lunch break, ultimately provided the breakthrough by having Desai caught at silly point in the third over after the day's first interval. The opener this time played a flatter delivery forward that bounced a bit more and took the top half of the bat for substitute Abhishek Raman to grab it.

Barot, on the other hand, paddle swept Shahbaz to fine-leg boundary to bring up his 50 off 128 balls. But he failed to continue for long as Akash Deep picked him in the third over on his return for the second spell. Wriddhiman Saha, who replaced Shreevats Goswami behind the stumps, took an easy catch when the right-hander edged one while playing forward.

Saurashtra lost three more wickets in the last session of play that gave the visitors an edge. Akash Deep first bowled Vishvaraj Jadeja who missed the line to a delivery that moved away on pitching. In-form Sheldon Jackson began fluently hitting three boundaries, two off Mukesh's consecutive deliveries. But Porel had him trapped in front with one that came in and kept a bit low too.

Ill Pujara fails to continue

However, Saurashtra suffered the biggest setback when Cheteshwar Pujara walked back feeling unwell. The India middle order batsman delayed getting in, finally walking out at No. 6. He began well, hitting Porel through the mid-wicket boundary but looked much in discomfort and had to be attended twice by the support staff. Finally, he walked off after facing 24 deliveries. Bengal ended the day on a high when Akash Deep claimed his third wicket of the day by having nightwatchman Chetan Sakaria caught behind while playing away from the body.

Unadkat later ruled out any major trouble with Pujara. ""He (Pujara) fell sick overnight, and avoided coming out to bat until absolutely necessary today,"" he said. ""He has a throat infection and is also running a mild fever. When we lost four wickets, he felt he had to go out. But it was obvious that he was in a lot of discomfort and so he came off,"" Unadkat added.

Brief scores: Saurashtra 206/5 in 80.5 overs (Avi Barot 54, Vishvaraj Jadeja 54; Akash Deep 3/41)

GURUGRAM: Private schools operating on land allotted by HSVP are on the authority radar for failing to provide details of students who were given admission under the economically weaker section (EWS) category, and for allegedly violating other allotment regulations. As per the RTE Act, private schools have to reserve 10% seats for children from this category.

A year back, then HSVP ( Gurugram ) administrator Chandrashekhar Khare had formed a committee taking cognisance of the violations of the norms by the private school and had issued notices to four schools seeking details of students who got admission under the EWS quota. Despite repeated notices, some of the schools have not responded. “We have served them the last notice to share the details. If schools miss the 10 March deadline, we will initiate the proceedings to the resumption of the school site allotted to these schools,” said Vivek Kalia, estate officer (2) of HSVP. Last week, estate officer (1) had also issued notices to 34 private schools for not providing details of admission to EWS students.

Apart from the EWS quota, the schools are mandated to have one nominee of HSVP in the management board, the school fee structure should be approved by HSVP, and details on admission of EWS students should be displayed at the schools.

Chief information commissioner (CIC) has directed the HSVP to share EWS admission details with them, and after failing to provide it so far, their next hearing before CIC is scheduled for March 11. School managements, however, claimed that they are following the norms. ""HSVP representatives are supposed to monitor the implementation of the rules. We abide by the government norms,"" said the principal of a private school in Sector 53.

Parents alleged that HSVP periodically takes up the issues of EWS student admission but no action has been taken against violating schools to date. “There is no transparent system to know the availability of seats under EWS category. Whenever you approach a school they will say seats reserved for poor children are full but will never share details of numbers of seats and children who have been allotted those seats,” said Praveen Mishra, an auto driver resident of Sector 14.

447,['10/03/2020'],Congress demands judicial inquiry into Delhi riots,"Situation of Shiv Vihar after northeast Delhi riot (File photo)

NEW DELHI: A Congress delegation that visited Delhi's riot-hit areas has demanded a court-monitored judicial inquiry into the communal conflagration that claimed over 45 lives and injured over 300 people.

""We do not believe that the two SITs that have been set up will unearth much about the perpetrators of the Delhi violence. As a a result, we want an independent judicial inquiry led by a sitting judge of the high court or the Supreme Court,"" AICC general secretary Mukul Wasnik said. The Congress delegation included Wasnik, Tariq Anwar, Sushmita Dev, Shaktisinh Gohil and Kumari Selja.

While Congress acknowledged the injuries sustained by some Delhi Police personnel, it also said the police's role was suspect in many cases. Demanding the state government conduct a ""comprehensive damage assessment"" of affected areas and provide compensation to victims commensurate with their loss of life and property, the report on Delhi riots submitted to Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Monday reiterated the party's demand for home minister Amit Shah's resignation for failing to prevent the violence.

Gohil alleged that the violence spread as both BJP and AAP played politics and demanded the victims of violence be immediately given compensation. ""It was due to the vote bank politics of BJP that this violence spread in Delhi. Delhi people did not want violence,"" he said adding that the pattern of violence was a trademark of BJP across the country. He also sought fixing of accountability of Delhi Police and lodging of FIRs against BJP's Anuraj Thakur, Parvesh Verma, Kapil Mishra and Abhay Verma for ""inciting"" violence.

""We still believe the communal tensions that erupted in Delhi was because the government did nothing to prevent it from flaring up,"" Wasnik said.

Among other suggestions, the report said both the state and Union governments should identify bureaucrats and police officers and ""ensure they face due procedure for dereliction of duties"", and charge them for ""utter incompetence and inefficiency in handling the situation"". It demanded CCTV footage be preserved to aid the probe.

449,['10/03/2020'],North Korea's Kim Jong-un oversees new 'long-range artillery' drill,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (File photo: Reuters)

SEOUL: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has overseen another ""long-range artillery"" drill, state media reported on Tuesday, a day after Japan said the nuclear-armed country had fired what appeared to be ballistic missiles.

It was the second-such ""drill"" in a week and comes as a prolonged hiatus in disarmament talks with the United States drags on.

Kim ""guided another firepower strike drill of long-range artillery"" and ""highly appreciated the perfect combat readiness"" of the forces, KCNA said.

The North has been continuing to refine its weapons capabilities, analysts say, more than a year after a summit between Kim and US President Donald Trump broke down in Hanoi.

Pyongyang is under multiple sets of United Nations, US and other sanctions over its weapons programmes.

The North ""appeared to have carried out joint firing drills involving various types of multiple rocket launchers"", South Korea's joint chiefs of staff said on Monday, expressing ""strong regret"" over Pyongyang's actions.

The military leadership in Seoul initially said three projectiles were involved, before changing the description to ""multiple"".

The devices were fired northeast into the sea from South Hamgyong province and flew 200 kilometres (124 miles) at a maximum altitude of 50 kilometres, the Joint Chiefs said.

That was slightly shorter but also slightly higher than last Monday's firing of what the South's military described as two short-range ballistic missiles.

A US State Department spokesperson called on North Korea to ""avoid provocations"" and abide by UN Security Council resolutions.

Pyongyang should ""return to sustained and substantive negotiations to do its part to achieve complete denuclearisation,"" the spokesperson said.

The state department did not offer details on the latest launches but a Japanese defence ministry spokesman said North Korea had appeared to fire ""ballistic missile(s)"" -- which it is banned from doing under Security Council resolutions.

Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe told parliament: ""Repeated launches of items such as ballistic missiles have been a serious issue for the international community, including our country.""

In an emergency meeting, South Korea's security ministers said the North's continued firing drills were ""not helpful"" to efforts for lasting peace on the Korean peninsula.

After last week's launch, KCNA also said Kim had overseen a ""long-range artillery"" drill. It carried images of multiple launch rocket systems and several of a larger calibre rocket being fired in a forest.

Monday's firing came days after Kim sent a personal letter to the South's president Moon Jae-in, offering ""comfort"" for the rapid outbreak of new coronavirus in the country.

South Korea has one of the world's largest infection totals outside China with more than 7,400 cases, while Pyongyang insists it has not had a single one.

That message had followed an unprecedented statement by Kim's younger sister Yo Jong, berating Seoul's ""truly senseless"" and ""perfectly foolish"" condemnation of Pyongyang's weapons test last week.

The North carried out a series of weapons trials late last year, the last of them in November, which it often described as multiple launch rocket systems although others called them ballistic missiles.

It also conducted static engine tests, most recently in December. Pyongyang set Washington a unilateral deadline of the end of 2019 to offer fresh concessions on sanctions relief, and at a party meeting in late December Kim declared the North no longer considered itself bound by its moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests.

He also threatened a demonstration of a ""new strategic weapon"" soon. Heightened tensions in 2017 were followed by two years of nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington, including three meetings between Kim and Trump, but little tangible progress was made.

It's the time to celebrate the career of Wasim Jaffer . He was a special player. What he has achieved as a player is fantastic. For any player to be able to play for such a long time and perform consistently well is a testament to his commitment and dedication. Wasim's strength has been his temperament. He is very calm by nature and doesn't get too hyper. That makes a huge difference to people around you.

He has been a fantastic ambassador for cricket. His contribution to Mumbai cricket has been incredible.

I remember the time when he was a part of the Indian team. We practised together quite a bit. I always believed we worked together as a team and I got that time to spend with him. We shared a number of things with each other.

Wasim was a man of very few words. He would stay calm and composed under pressure and that is something which not many players possess. That has been his strength. One of his top qualities is that he had so much time to play fast bowling. That's an important element for any player, especially an opening batter.

He has done magnificently against top-class fast bowlers. He batted so well for his hundred against South Africa in Cape Town, as also for his double century against Pakistan in Kolkata. He was a batsman who attacked a lot. He was never a defensive player. Wasim possessed that quality --while he was attacking, the opposition didn't realize that they were being attacked. Only when they looked at the scoreboard did they realise that he's off to a flier. For any team, his was one of the top wickets. In first-class cricket, it always became important to dismiss him early. Along with his temperament and ability, Wasim could maintain his concentration level for long hours. He was always a threat, if you didn't dismiss him early, then one had to prepare for a long fielding session.

Stay at home.""A few hours later the Prime Minister used similar words as he announced a countrywide lockdown.""I am going to sign a decree that can be summarised as follows: I stay at home,"" Conte announced in a dramatic evening television address.The unprecedented measures limiting travel and banning public gatherings across the country of more than 60 million people came after 97 more deaths took Italy's toll to 463.The measures include the closure of schools, universities and the suspension of sports competitions.""There is no reason why matches and sporting events should continue and I am thinking of the football championship,"" said Conte.""I'm sorry but all the fans must take note of it, we will not even allow gyms to be used for sports activities,"" he added.The decree allows the possibility of organising matches under international jurisdiction behind closed doors, such as ties in UEFA's Champions League and Europa League.Juventus are due to host Lyon in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie in Turin next week. Inter Milan are due to host Spain's Getafe in the Europa League on Thursday while Roma welcome Sevilla a week later.Earlier Monday, Italy's National Olympic Committee (CONI), which has authority over all national sports federations, had recommended ""sporting activities at all levels"" be suspended until April 3 to help contain the virus outbreak and called for a government decree to enforce the request.The decree, which goes beyond sport and provides for draconian new measures to combat the coronavirus, will come into force on Tuesday throughout Italy, the second most-affected country after China.Since Sunday, there had been growing calls to stop sports competitions and in particular Serie A, with lower football leagues already paused.Sports Minister Vincenzo Spadafora called for the suspension of Serie A while Italian Footballers' Association president Damiano Tommasi tweeted that ""stopping football is the most useful thing for our country right now"".On Monday several Italian federations, such as those in swimming and winter sports, announced the end of competitive activities, joining rugby and volleyball which had been already suspended.Serie A is now frozen after 26 games out of 38 in the season, with eight-time reigning champions Juventus leading the table one point ahead of Lazio. Inter Milan are third, nine points behind, with a game in hand.Questions remain about getting the season finished. At least three rounds of matches will need to be rearranged after April 3 before the end of the season scheduled for May 24.There is little room for manoeuvre because of Euro 2020 beginning on June 12. And there are also concerns that Euro 2020, due to be hosted across 12 countries including Italy, might face an unprecedented cancellation.In 1973 a cholera epidemic which left 227 dead in Italy, including more than 170 in Naples, did not stop ""calcio"" in the football-mad country.",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74559995,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-290192,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/football/top-stories/serie-a-all-sport-in-italy-halted-because-of-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74560002.cms
454,['10/03/2020'],GST glitches: Infosys asked to give solution in 15 days,"(File photo)

NEW DELHI: The finance ministry has asked Infosys to provide within 15 days a plan for quick resolution of glitches on the GSTN portal, as it took strong note of the “unresolved” problems and “tardy” progress made over the last two years on multiple issues faced by taxpayers in filing returns.

On Saturday, revenue secretary held a meeting with top Infosys officials on the persistent glitches seen on GST network, and decided to ask Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani to make an urgent presentation before the GST Council on March 14.

Meanwhile, in a strongly worded letter to Infosys on March 5, the ministry said some of the problems highlighted as early as 2018 are still unresolved and failures month after month lead to genuine taxpayers “getting frustrated”.

“It is requested to go through the pending issues, day-today disruptions and the future road map and come up with a plan for quick resolution within 15 days. Infosys has set high international standards and it is expected that the efficiency which your organisation is known for should be visible in GST project also,” the ministry said in the letter to Infosys.

Infosys declined to comment on the matter.

The IT company has developed the software for GST Network (GSTN) — which provides the technology backbone for Goods and Services Tax (GST).

Highlighting the issues faced on the GSTN portal, the ministry said even though the GST system has been in operation for the last 30 months, there have been instances of taxpayer complaints on facing issues in filing returns in the last two days of filing of returns (for GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B).

“It is noticed that MSP (Master Service Provider) M/s Infosys has been repeatedly asked to take timely action and to identify the root cause of issues after each event and take corrective action. However, problem still persists,” it said.

The ministry said such glitches on the portal lead to an unhealthy tax compliance requirement more so when on account of such disruptions some taxpayers end up becoming liable for payment of late fee, interest.

NEW DELHI: Indian boxing legend MC Mary Kom will be making her second appearance at an Olympic Games. She booked her berth for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics by brushing aside Irish Magno of the Philippines 5-0 in a unanimous verdict in her 51kg quarterfinal bout at the Asia-Oceania Olympic Qualifiers in Amman, Jordan on Monday.The 2012 London Olympics bronze medallist will take on Yuan Chang of China in the semifinals. Having clinched the quota, the 37-year-old silenced her critics. Last year, Mary was involved in a war of words with fellow boxer Nikhat Zareen. It led to a trial between the two in order to take part in the Olympic qualifiers. Mary went on to beat Nikhat in that ill-tempered trial in the Capital.One of the favourites to win a medal among Indian boxers at Tokyo Olympics, Amit Panghal also lived up to his reputation by securing quota for the quadrennial showpiece. Amit defeated Carlo Paalam of the Philippines in the 52kg quarterfinal clash. The 2019 World Boxing Championships silver medallist won with a 4-1 split verdict in his favour.Simranjit Kaur got the country its eighth Olympic quota in boxing as she defeated Namuun Monkhor of Mongolia 5-0 in the 60kg quarterfinal. Simranjit will take on Shih-Yi Wu of Chinese Taipei in the semis.Eight boxers (7 men and Mary Kom) had qualified for 2012 London Olympics. The current lot has matched that figure (4 men and 4 women) for the Tokyo Games. The number can increase with Sachin Kumar and Manish Kaushik 's 'box-off' bouts scheduled later in the tournament. The other Indian boxers will get another chance to clinch Tokyo quotas at the world qualifiers in Paris in May.Amit had previously beaten Paalam in the semis of the 2018 Asian Games and the quarterfinals of the 2019 Worlds. That experience held him in good stead on Monday. ""I had played my opponent twice earlier and had beaten him. I was confident that I would be able to win this time too. I executed the strategy my coaches had chalked out,"" Amit told TOI from Jordan after entering the semis. ""I'm glad to get another Olympic quota in boxing for India. In the semifinals, I am up against a Chinese boxer I have defeated earlier in the Asian Championships. The aim is to repeat my performance and move into the final,"" the 24-year-old added.Amit will next take on China's Hu Jianguan, a bronze medallist at the 2016 Rio Olympics and the 2019 Asian Championships.It was not a perfect day for India as Manish Kaushik, who won a bronze in the 2019 World Championships, went down to third seed and Asian Games silver medallist Chinzorig Baatarsukh of Mongolia in a hard fought 63kg quarterfinal. It was a tight 2-3 loss for Kaushik.Kaushik can still fulfill his Olympic dream. With six boxers slated to qualify from 63kg weight class, Kaushik will get one more chance in the form of a box-off opportunity. Manish will face Harrison Garside of Australia in the box-off bout on Wednesday.However, it was end of the road for former world youth champion Sakshi Chaudhary who went down 0-5 to South Korea's Im Aeji in the 57kg quarterfinal clash. Only the semifinalists are entitled to an Olympic berth in the women's 57kg category of the ongoing event. Her next shot at Tokyo qualification would be the world qualifiers in May, provided she is selected for it.Late on Sunday night, veteran Satish Kumar became the first super heavyweight (+91kg) Indian boxer to qualify for the Olympics.

461,['10/03/2020'],That one Holi I will never forget!,"Like a million other people, my transition from being a child to a teenager was very tumultuous. There were so many changes, a few I was not very comfortable with, which my social conditioning stopped me from discussing with my parents. From a kid who never got anyone's attention, I was slowly turning into a young girl whose every moment stirred some unwanted emotions in the hearts of people from the opposite sex. I was not a fool to not notice that. Nothing I wore made me comfortable. Nothing I did waived off the unwanted attention. It was during that stage I experienced the most unforgettable Holi of my life. An experience that still sends a shiver down my spine.I belong to a small town, where neighbours become family and strangers quickly turn into friends. Every festival—from Holi to Eid, Diwali to Christmas—is celebrated with equal fervour. During Holi, people from neighbouring localities visit our place too. That year was no different.On the day of Holi, my friends and I assembled at a park near our school. As planned, we all had brought colours with us and chalked out a plan to visit everyone's place. Like us, there were other groups and it was not uncommon to have 'gang' wars during Holi where people from opposing groups attack each other with colours and water balloons.As the afternoon was approaching fast, it was difficult to recognise anyone because every visible part was covered in colour. We were about to wrap up and head home for lunch with family and friends when a group of boys approached us. They could have been of our age or bigger, their unrecognizable face made it very difficult to make out who they were or how old they were.""You guys are heading home so early?"" mocked one of the boys while another threw a water balloon at us.Rohit, who was the leader of our group, took the challenge and replied, ""We were just waiting for you guys. Hope you have enough colours and energy,"" he said while changing direction and walking towards the approaching group of boys.It didn't take long for their group to overpower us. Seven of us, five boys and two girls, were competing against 12 boys. Besides gulal and water colours, they were also armed with rotten eggs, grease and dirty water! I was already getting uncomfortable, so I was slowly retracing my steps.""Are you already running away?"" someone from behind sneered at me.""I don't like to play Holi with anything except colours,"" I replied sternly.""I have colours that you would not find offending,"" said the boy while throwing a fistful of gulal in my direction. The harsh powder was flying everywhere and I was almost blinded. Coughing hysterically, I tried to make my way towards my friends who now appeared at a distance.There was loud music surrounding us and everyone was busy playing Holi. It was then I felt a hand grab me from behind. It slowly caressed my cheeks like it was applying colours while continuing to move dangerously downwards. The man forced his hands down the neckline of my kurta and grabbed my tender bosom. I cried out loud while attempting desperately to kick him. Everything happened too quickly. And by the time my friends noticed me shouting, he was already gone.The man vanished into thin air and with him he took away all the joy and innocence associated with Holi for me. From that day onwards, I not only avoided Holi but crowded places too. Sadly, I never told my parents about it. I never could.But I am not alone. Such incidents are quite common during the colour of festival. Holi cannot be an excuse for not taking consent or physically harassing young men and women. Are we doing enough to make Holi safe and enjoyable for all?",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74549756,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-2460866/74549756.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/relationships/soul-curry/that-one-holi-i-will-never-forget/articleshow/74549721.cms

463,['10/03/2020'],Selection riddle for Vidarbha U-23 ahead of final against MP,"(TOI Photo)

As the whole country will be busy celebrating the festival of colours on Tuesday, Vidarbha and Madhya Pradesh players will start their day fine-tuning their skills at Holkar Stadium in Indore.

Exactly three months after they began their campaign in Col CK Nayudy Under-23 Trophy , the two teams would be clashing for the coveted crown starting from Wednesday. While MP has won the Trophy (when it was U-25 for a year in 2012-13), Vidarbha are still looking for their maiden crown in this category. It's the only Trophy they don't have in their ever growing silverware.

Fortunately, they are in Indore where Vidarbha got their maiden BCCI Trophy in 2016-17. They won their maiden Ranji Trophy also at the same stadium in 2017-18. Two months later when they played in their Cooch Behar final, the opponents were MP. There's some MP connection to every Vidarbha crown. Now, in their maiden Nayudu final, they would be up against the side, which has played as a team and knows the conditions well.

Vidarbha, however, would feel more at home than the hosts. Red soil wicket will be used for the final, which may favour Vidarbha. They had played their semifinal against Mumbai on a red soil wicket as well, while the other wicket used for semifinal between MP and Railways was on black soil wicket. The extra bounce will help Vidarbha pacers, who are in red hot form.

Led by Aditya Thakare , Vidarbha pacers had taken 17 out of 20 wickets in the semifinal where they had humbled Mumbai inside two days in their own den. On Monday, coach Trevor Gonslaves was seen giving advice to his bowlers about the length they need to bowl on this wicket, which also has some grass.

Later, Gonsalves also gave catching practice to to the players who usually man the slip cordon. Besides, Vidarbha batsmen also had nets session on red soil wicket during the practice session. While bowlers may enjoy the conditions, it would be interesting to see how Vidarbha batsmen respond to the challenge.

While they have plugged most of the loopholes, opening is still a worry for Vidarbha, especially after Mohit Kale and Aditya Thakare joined the squad and Siddhesh Wath too returned after playing last two Ranji matches.

It means only three out of Taide, Kale, Wath and Thakare could feature in the playing XI because of BCCI rules. The rule states that only three players who have represented their state teams in any of the three tournaments - Ranji Trophy, Vijay Hazare One-day Trophy and Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy - can feature in the playing XI of Nayudu Trophy .

Opener Saurabh Thubrikar hasn't done much with the bat and Vidarbha would be prompted to go back to Taide for the opener's slot. The southpaw already has 746 runs, including four hundreds under his belt. If that happens, skipper Mohit Kale would have to make way for him as Wath and Thakare look certain, thanks to their breath-taking performance so far. Wath has 1011 in 11 innings which has four hundreds and four fifties. Thakare has combined tally of 62 wickets in U-23 and Ranji Trophy.

Whether Vidarbha would be brave enough to take that call and that too in important match like the final is a big question. Rest of the side is well settled. Pacers Nachiket Bhute and Dushyant Tekan are complementing Thakare well while left-arm spinners Mohit Raut and Harsh Dubey have been brilliant besides scoring crucial runs.

Vidarbha have made some great comebacks in the competition and has handled the pressure situation as well despite an unsettled playing eleven in almost every match. They need to do the same one more time for their maiden triumph.

464,['10/03/2020'],Ronaldinho lawyers push for footballer's release over fake passport scandal,"(AFP photo)

ASUNCION: Lawyers for Brazilian football great Ronaldinho are trying to organize a hearing to get him temporarily released from detention for allegedly entering Paraguay with a fake passport, defense sources told AFP on Monday.

Ronaldinho and his brother Roberto were arrested on Friday and held in pre-trial detention in Asuncion for entering Paraguay using forged documents.

Sources close to his defense team told AFP the lawyers were trying to get the brothers a hearing on Tuesday in the hope of securing their temporary release.

Ronaldinho's Brazilian lawyer Sergio Queiroz has previously insisted that the two-time world player of the year's detention was ""illicit, illegal and unlawful.""

""Ronaldinho did not commit a crime because he did not know that the passport they gave him was faked,"" he said.

The brothers are spending a fourth day behind bars in the Paraguayan capital Asuncion, where late summer temperatures have soared to 40 degrees Celsius.

Queiroz wants the pair to be released and allowed to return to their home country.

He said prosecutors originally agreed that the footballer had acted in good faith before a judge ordered their detention, which Queiroz described as unwarranted.

Ronaldinho, considered one of the greatest footballers of all time, was one of the stars of Brazil's 2002 World Cup win and played for European giants Barcelona Paris Saint-Germain and AC Milan, among others.

He and his brother arrived in Asuncion from Brazil on Wednesday and showed their passports to immigration police, who did not immediately notice any problem with the documents.

Hours later, when the passports were determined to be fake, investigators raided the hotel room Ronaldinho was staying in and seized the brothers' identity cards and travel documents.

Ronaldinho said the passports had been given to him by people who had invited him to attend conferences sponsored by charities working with disadvantaged children.

A Brazilian businessman has also been arrested in connection with the fake passports, while two Paraguayan women have been placed under house arrest and Paraguay's migration director has resigned.

Queiroz said the brothers were offered the passports ""to facilitate the possibility of doing business"" in Paraguay.

""The idea was to position Ronaldinho with brands and companies,"" he added.

Paraguayan president Mario Abdo on Monday revoked by decree the legal status of the foundation that invited Ronaldinho to the country.

Defense lawyers for the ""Angelic Fraternity"" foundation's administrator, Dalia Lopez, acknowledged that she had requested official Paraguayan passports for the brothers but said she had no idea that those delivered were fakes.

Authorities have issued a warrant for her arrest.

Lopez's lawyers said the brothers had handed over $5,000 to ""accelerate the process to issue the passports"" and that she ""never suspected"" intermediaries dealing with the request would have submitted false information to authorities.

Her lawyers also denied she had paid Ronaldinho to come to Paraguay or that she was involved in business with him.

But the arrested businessman, Wilmondes Sousa, claimed Lopez was responsible for making the fake passports.

465,['10/03/2020'],WHO: Coronavirus mortality rate more than flu's,"NEW DELHI: The death rate due to novel coronavirus is far higher than that of seasonal influenza, which was so far considered to kill more people. Not just that, the new virus, to which no one has immunity, also causes more severe diseases than the seasonal flu, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said indicating that more people are susceptible to infection than was estimated and some will suffer severe disease.“Globally about 3.4% of reported Covid-19 cases have died. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.In its latest situation report, the UN agency said the reproductive number – the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual – is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for Covid-19 virus, higher than for influenza.Latest data suggests 80% of coronavirus infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation, according to WHO.The coronavirus outbreak – which originated in Wuhan, China – has infected around 1,10,041 people from more than 90 countries so far and killed 3,825 people. The virus causes a disease known as Covid-19.Experts said the death rate is likely to change further as more cases are confirmed and the percentage of deaths are expected to decline as currently milder cases of Covid-19 are probably going undiagnosed.Highlighting the differences between the novel coronavirus and other infectious diseases like MERS, SARS and influenza, Tedros said evidence shows that Covid-19 did not transmit as efficiently as the flu, which can be transmitted widely by people who are infected but not yet showing symptoms.Chances of dying from Covid-19 varies based on several factors such as where patients are treated, age and existing disease conditions.“We understand that people are afraid and uncertain. Fear is a natural human response to any threat, especially when it’s a threat we don’t completely understand. But as we get more data, we are understanding this virus, and the disease it causes, more and more. This virus is not SARS, it’s not MERS, and it’s not influenza. It is a unique virus with unique characteristics,” Tedros said.Both Covid-19 and influenza cause respiratory disease and spread the same way, via small droplets of fluid from the nose and mouth of someone who is sick.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74558996,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-982107,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/who-covid-19-mortality-rate-more-than-flus/articleshow/74558998.cms

The number of novel coronavirus cases in India touched 46 on Monday with seven more persons testing positive since Sunday — two in Pune and one each from Kerala’s Ernakulam, Delhi, UP, Amritsar and Jammu. A three-year-old child in Kerala, who had returned from Italy, was among those infected.The count rose late on Monday after a Pune couple, who had returned from Dubai on March 1, tested positive. Forty-three cases are currently active while three have been discharged.The child and its parents had reached the Cochin International Airport from Italy on March 7. As the child had virus symptoms, all the three were immediately referred to the isolation ward of the Kalamassery Medical College hospital, officials said. The child’s samples sent for examination at the NIV lab have tested positive for coronavirus, they said.In Delhi, the fourth person, whose case was detected on Monday, had been in contact with the earlier identified Paytm employee, a resident of west Delhi’s Janakpuri, who had recently travelled to Italy, say sources.On Sunday, five new cases were reported from Kerala with three of a family with travel history to Italy, and two of their relatives, testing positive. They had failed to report their travel to Italy. The family is reported to have visited kin and attended a few functions.

NOIDA: Health department officials have said that a group of foreigners that arrived in the city on March 6 pose no threat to local residents. A total of 42 foreigners were visiting the city for a tour organised at the behest of the ministry of textiles.

The group visited textile production centres and units in Agra before travelling towards Jaipur. On March 6, they had reached the city from Jaipur and since then they have been staying at a hotel in Sector 31.

According to the itinerary, the group would leave the city on March 28.

""They arrived in the country on February 1. None of them showed any symptoms associated with coronavirus. Individuals doubtful of carrying the virus need to spend 15 days in isolation. Their observation period was over long back,"" chief medical officer Anurag Bhargava said.

However, after learning about cases being detected in Jaipur and the presence of Italian tourists, six from the group insisted on getting tested.

Their samples were collected at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida on Sunday but nothing was found and they were dropped back to the hotel later.

Rakesh Gupta, director, GIMS, said: ""Nothing unusual was detected. There is no need to panic. We have sufficient detection kits and isolation wards at the health facilities in Noida."" Most members of the team are from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Afghanistan.

Till Monday evening, no coronavirus cases had been reported from Gautam Budh Nagar district.

Bhargava said that he has been coordinating with the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in Delhi on a regular basis. ""Nothing alarming has been brought to my notice and there is no need to be worried,"" Bhargava said.

470,['10/03/2020'],Mukesh Ambani loses Asia's richest tag to Jack Ma in $5.8 billion rout,"NEW DELHI: Indian energy tycoon Mukesh Ambani is no longer Asia’s richest man, relinquishing the title to Jack Ma after oil prices collapsed along with global stocks.

The rout, exacerbated by mounting fears that the spread of the novel coronavirus will thrust the world into a recession, erased $5.8 billion from Ambani’s net worth on Monday and pushed him to No. 2 on the list of Asia’s richest people, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ma, the Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. founder who relinquished the No. 1 ranking in mid-2018, is back on top with a $44.5 billion fortune, about $2.6 billion more than Ambani.

Oil plunged the most in 29 years on Monday as Saudi Arabia and Russia vowed to pump more in a struggle for market share. The slump comes just as the coronavirus is spurring the first decline in demand in more than a decade. That raises questions about whether Ambani’s flagship Reliance Industries Ltd will be able to cut net debt to zero by early 2021, as he has pledged. The plan hinges on a proposal to sell a stake in the group’s oil and petrochemicals division to Saudi Arabian Oil Co, the world’s biggest crude producer.

While the coronavirus has curtailed some of tech giant Alibaba’s businesses, the damage has been mitigated by increased demand for its cloud computing services and mobile apps.

Reliance Industries, by comparison, has no such silver lining. The Indian conglomerate’s shares plunged 12% on Monday, the most since 2009, extending this year’s decline to 26%. Alibaba’s American depositary receipts have slipped 6.8% so far in 2020.

Few of the world’s billionaires fared well in Monday’s collapse as the S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average each plunged more than 7.5%, the most since the 2008 financial crisis, threatening to end the longest bull market in history. But no one did worse than those whose fortunes are underpinned by oil. Wildcatter Harold Hamm’s fortune was cut almost in half to $2.4 billion and fellow oil magnate Jeff Hildebrand lost $3 billion, bumping both from Bloomberg’s 500-member wealth ranking.

In a pivot toward new businesses such as telecommunications, technology and retail, Ambani’s Reliance Industries has piled on billions of dollars of debt over the years.

It spent almost $50 billion -- most of it funded by borrowings -- to build Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, which became India’s No. 1 wireless carrier within about three years of its debut. As the mobile venture took off, Ambani also unveiled plans for an e-commerce empire to rival Amazon.com Inc in India.

Addressing concerns over the liabilities, Ambani pledged in August to cut the group’s net debt to zero from about $21 billion as of last March. The Aramco deal is crucial to that plan for which Reliance Industries has valued its oil-to-chemicals division at $75 billion including debt, implying a $15 billion valuation for the 20% stake that’s for sale.

Signs of a potential delay to that deal unnerved some investors, hammering the stock since it touched a record high on Dec. 19.

Reliance Industries expected the Aramco transaction to be completed by March, but people familiar with the matter said in February that talks were still ongoing to bridge differences between the two parties over the deal’s structure.

Adding to the uncertainty, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration has petitioned a court to halt the proposed stake sale, threatening a key source of funds needed to pare net debt.

But Ambani, 62, may soon bounce back from the setback, said Harish HV, managing partner at ECube Investment Advisors in Bengaluru, India.

“The game isn’t over,” he said. “Ambani has successfully built a robust business model which would keep him in the game. Moreover, his telecom business will start yielding results in coming years.”

471,['10/03/2020'],"Steven Bergwijn out for season, Jose Mourinho still confident of Spurs success","Steven Bergwijn (Reuters photo)

LEIPZIG: Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho does not believe Dutch international Steven Bergwijn will play again this season to compound his lack of forward options with Harry Kane and Son Heung-min also sidelined by injury.

Bergwijn suffered a sprained left ankle in a 1-1 draw at Burnley on Saturday that stretched Spurs' run without a win in all competitions to five games.

However, Mourinho is bullish Spurs can spring a surprise by overturning a 1-0 first leg deficit away to Leipzig on Tuesday to progress to the quarter-finals of the Champions League.

""I don't expect him to play again this season,"" said Mourinho at this pre-match press conference in Germany.

""We're used to it. I'd say we were psychologically more down with the other injuries because this one, when you've got four or five injuries, to have six or seven is the same. No problem, we are very confident.""

Tottenham are eighth in the Premier League , seven points adrift of a place in the top four, and were knocked out of the FA Cup by struggling Norwich last week.

A run of poor results despite a depleted squad has raised questions over Spurs chairman Daniel Levy's decision to sack Mauricio Pochettino in November and replace the Argentine with Mourinho.

Pochettino transformed Tottenham's fortunes in five-and-a-half years in charge, but failed to turn that progress into trophies.

Mourinho has a stellar coaching CV having won 25 trophies at Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Manchester United and he is confident that he will also end Tottenham's wait for silverware.

""I believe that Tottenham is not going to be my only club without silverware,"" added Mourinho.

""I won at every club and I believe I'm going to do it at Tottenham.

""I'm here for three or four months. I get the team in a difficult situation, now the team is in an even more difficult situation for the problems we are having, but I believe in me, in the players, in the club and believe that during my contract I will help the club and the players to do it.""

In the absence of Kane, Son and Bergwijn, the onus is on Dele Alli to deliver the goals to keep Spurs' season alive.

""This isn't a time to get our violins out. We have to show our character now as a team, everyone has to step up,"" said Alli.

""It's been a difficult season but we have to keep believing.""

Kane returned to training on Monday, but the England captain is still some weeks away from a comeback as he recovers from hamstring surgery.

""It's a massive boost. Even when he's coming to games to watch the games, he's always speaking and trying to motivate everyone, he's a real leader,"" added Alli.

""I don't want him to rush it because I know how much it can come back, but at the same time we need him as well.""
