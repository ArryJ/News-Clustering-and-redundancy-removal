10,2020/02/24,"Weinstein convicted of sexual assault, acquitted of being a serial predator: New York jury","Harvey Weinstein faces up to 25 years in prison on the sexual assault conviction.

Former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was convicted of sexual assault by a New York jury on Monday but acquitted on the most serious charges that could have sent him to prison for the rest of his life.

Once one of Hollywood's most powerful producers, Weinstein, 67, was convicted of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006 and raping Jessica Mann, a onetime aspiring actress, in 2013.

He faces up to 25 years in prison on the sexual assault conviction.

The jury acquitted Weinstein on two counts of predatory sexual assault, which carried a potential life sentence, and first degree rape of Mann.

The case was a milestone for the #MeToo movement that inspired women to go public with misconduct allegations against powerful men.

During his trial, Weinstein often appeared feeble, entering the courthouse using a walker. He sometimes leaned on his lead attorney, Donna Rotunno, for support.

“He's taken some good acting tips,” actress Rose McGowan said at the start of the trial on Jan. 6 while staging a protest near the courthouse along with actress Rosanna Arquette and other Weinstein accusers.

Weinstein made his mark with critically acclaimed films such as “The English Patient” and “Shakespeare in Love.”

More than 80 women, including famous actresses, had accused him of sexual misconduct stretching back decades. He had denied the allegations and said any sexual encounters were consensual.

Paul Callan, a former New York prosecutor who is not involved in the case, said Weinstein had strong grounds to argue the verdict should be overturned on appeal because of bias, noting that one of the jurors was the author of a forthcoming book on teenage girls and “predatory” older men.

During the trial, prosecutors portrayed Weinstein as a serial predator who had manipulated women with promises to open doors in Hollywood, coaxing them to hotel rooms or private apartments and then overpowering and violently attacking them.

“The man seated right there was not just a titan in Hollywood, he was a rapist,” Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Meghan Hast said during opening arguments.

Seated at the defense table, Weinstein often appeared impassive, though at times he looked intently at his attorneys when they cross-examined his accusers.

‘Jekyll and hyde’

During the many weeks of trial, the prosecution methodically elicited graphic testimony from several accusers, including Haleyi, who said Weinstein invited her to his SoHo home after she had worked on one of his television productions.

After she arrived, Weinstein backed her into a bedroom, held her down on the bed and forced himself on her orally, yanking out her tampon, Haleyi told jurors.

A onetime aspiring actress, Mann said that soon after meeting Weinstein she entered into an “extremely degrading” relationship with him that never included intercourse until, she alleged, he raped her in 2013.

She described Weinstein as a “Jekyll and Hyde” character: He was charming in public but often showed terrifying anger when they were alone, Mann said.

At one point, she started sobbing uncontrollably on the stand, prompting the judge to end testimony early for the day.

Weinstein was charged with assaulting Haleyi and Mann, but prosecutors bolstered their case by calling several other accusers as witnesses.

One of these women, “Sopranos” actress Annabella Sciorra, told jurors Weinstein came into her apartment one winter night in 1993 or 1994 and raped her.

Though the accusation was too old to be charged as a separate crime, prosecutors offered it to show Weinstein was a repeat sexual offender.

Three other women - costume designer Dawn Dunning, model Tarale Wulff and actress Lauren Young - testified that they were enticed into meeting Weinstein for professional reasons and then groped or raped.

Testimony of “prior bad acts” is generally not allowed in criminal trials, but an exception to the law allowed prosecutors to call these women to show Weinstein had a particular intention or a signature pattern of behavior.

Legal experts said the women provided powerful evidence that was difficult for the defense to overcome.

Dunning testified that the producer groped her in 2004 and offered her movie roles in exchange for three-way sex with him and his assistant, which she refused.

Young, a model and actress, testified that the producer trapped her in a hotel bathroom in 2013, masturbated in front of her while groping her breasts, and told her: “This is what all the actresses do to make it.”

‘Last line of defense’

Throughout the case, the defense said regret drove the accusers to take consensual incidents and reframe them as crimes.

Weinstein's lawyers zeroed in on friendly messages and ongoing contact between the women and Weinstein.

During cross-examination of Haleyi, for example, the defense showed her a message she sent Weinstein signed “lots of love” after her alleged attack.

Defense lawyers repeatedly suggested that Mann willingly had sex with Weinstein to advance her career.

Weinstein never testified in his defense, although he told reporters he had wanted to. One of his lawyers said the case was too weak to warrant putting him on the stand.

Weinstein's lawyer Rotunno told jurors during closing arguments that they were “the last line of defense” against an ”overzealous” prosecution and that women were “responsible” for the “choices they make to further their own careers.”

Prosecutors pushed back against claims that his accusers were not credible and the notion that they were responsible for the alleged attacks.

Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi said it was irrelevant whether they had ongoing contact with Weinstein after the alleged attacks.

Illuzzi rejected a defense claim that Mann had a loving relationship with Weinstein, but said it would not matter if she had been “head over heels in love with him.”

“He still wouldn't be allowed to rape her on March 18 of 2013,” she said.

Weinstein still faces sexual assault charges in California, which were announced just hours after his New York rape trial began, and dozens of women have filed civil lawsuits against him.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lwti0u/article30906591.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HARVEYWEINSTEIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/weinstein-convicted-of-sexual-assault-acquitted-of-being-a-serial-predator-new-york-jury/article30906592.ece
11,2020/02/24,Virus cases spread outside China,"South Korea, Iran and Italy see a jump in infections; WHO says a turning point reached in Wuhan

Italy, South Korea and Iran reported sharp rises in COVID-19 cases on Monday, but China eased curbs as the rate of infection there slowed and a visiting World Health Organization team said a turning point had been reached in the epicentre, Wuhan.

The virus has put Chinese cities into lockdown in recent weeks, disrupted air traffic to the workshop of the world and blocked global supply chains for everything from cars and car parts to smartphones.

But China's actions, especially in Wuhan, have probably prevented hundreds of thousands of cases, said the head of the WHO delegation in China, Bruce Aylward, urging the rest of the world to learn the lesson of acting fast.

“The world is in your debt,” Mr. Aylward, speaking in Beijing, told the people of Wuhan. “The people of that city have gone through an extraordinary period and they’re still going through it.”

The surge of cases outside mainland China triggered sharp falls in global share markets and Wall Street stock futures as investors fled to safe havens. European share markets suffered their biggest slump since mid-2016, gold soared to a seven-year high, oil tumbled nearly 4% and the Korean won fell to its lowest level since August.

But U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin cautioned against jumping to conclusions about the global economy or supply chains, saying it was simply too soon to know.

Mr. Aylward said multiple data sources suggested that the rate of infection in Wuhan was falling. “They’re at a point now where the number of cured people coming out of hospitals each day is much more than the sick going in.” But he added: “One of the challenges obviously is the strain on the system ... they still have tens of thousands of sick people.”

Liang Wannian of the National Health Commission said only that the rapid rise had been halted and the situation was still grim. He said more than 3,000 medical staff had become infected, most of them in Hubei province surrounding Wuhan, probably due to the lack of protective gear and to fatigue. Excluding Hubei, mainland China reported 11 new cases, the lowest since the national health authority started publishing nationwide daily figures on January 20.

The coronavirus has infected nearly 77,000 people and killed more than 2,500 in China, most of them in Hubei. Overall, China reported 409 new cases on the mainland, down from 648 a day earlier, taking the total number of infections to 77,150 cases as of February 23. The death toll rose by 150 to 2,592.

But there was a measure of relief for the world's second-largest economy as more than 20 province-level jurisdictions, including Beijing and Shanghai, reported zero new infections, the best showing since the outbreak began.

29 countries affected

Outside mainland China, the outbreak has spread to about 29 countries and territories, with a death toll of about two dozen, according to a Reuters tally.

South Korea reported 231 new cases, taking its total to 833. Many are in its fourth-largest city, Daegu, which became more isolated with Asiana Airlines and Korean Air suspending flights there until next month.

Iran, which announced its first two cases last Wednesday, said it now had 61 cases and 12 deaths. Most of the infections were in the Shia Muslim holy city of Qom.

Elsewhere in West Asia, Bahrain and Iraq reported their first cases, and Kuwait and Oman reported a combined total of five cases involving people who had been in Iran.

Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Pakistan and Afghanistan imposed restrictions on travel and immigration from Iran. Afghanistan also reported its first case, officials said.

Europe's biggest outbreak is in Italy, with some 150 infections — compared with just three before Friday — and a sixth death.

In northern Italy, authorities sealed off the worst-affected towns and banned public gatherings across a wide area, halting the carnival in Venice, where there were two cases.

The outbreak originated in Codogno, a small town southeast of Milan where Lombardy's first infected patient, a 38-year-old man now in stable condition, was treated.

12,2020/02/24,Pakistan isolates 200 people near Iran border,"The quarantine announcement came hours after Pakistan sealed off its land border with Iran while neighbouring Afghanistan said it had detected its first infection.

Pakistan began quarantining at least 200 people near the Iranian border, officials said on Monday, as fears spiralled over the growing toll from COVID-19 in the region amid allegations of a coverup in Iran.

The quarantine announcement came hours after Pakistan sealed off its land border with Iran while neighbouring Afghanistan said it had detected its first infection.

It also came as Iranian authorities denied allegations of an official coverup following reports that dozens of deaths had gone unreported in the country.

In the southwestern Balochistan province, authorities moved fast to quarantine at least 200 people after Shiite Muslim piligrims returning from Iran entered the country and briefly interacted with other residents.

“We have decided not to take a chance and keep all of them under observation for the next 15 days,” Najeebullah Qambrani, assistant commissioner at the Taftan border crossing, told AFP, saying 250 people were being quarantined.

Balochistan's secretary of health Mudassir Malik confirmed the quarantine but estimated that between 200 and 250 were being held.

He added that around 7,000 pilgrims had returned to Pakistan from Iran this month alone.

Afghanistan and Pakistan share long, porous borders with Iran that are often used by smugglers and human traffickers, while millions of Afghan refugees currently live in the Islamic Republic – raising fears that the virus could easily spread over the border.

Pakistan – bordered by China to the north and Iran to the south – also suffers the additional burden of having a lacklustre healthcare system following decades of under-investment by the state, leaving impoverished, rural communities especially vulnerable.

Balochistan in particular is woefully unprepared to handle a public health emergency after being beset for decades by a separatist insurgency, jihadist violence, and neglect from the central government.

13,2020/02/24,"Katherine Johnson, NASA mathematician portrayed in ‘Hidden Figures’, dies at 101","The mathematical genius was awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom by former President Barack Obama in 2015

Katherine Johnson, the black woman whose mathematical genius took her from a behind-the-scenes job in a segregated NASA as portrayed in the film Hidden Figures to a key role in sending humans to the moon, died on Monday at the age of 101, NASA said.

“Our NASA family is sad to learn the news that Katherine Johnson passed away this morning at 101 years old,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine posted to Twitter. “She was an American hero and her pioneering legacy will never be forgotten.”

Ms. Johnson was awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom by former President Barack Obama in 2015 and in 2016 he cited her in his State of the Union Address as an example of America's spirit of discovery.

“She's one of the greatest minds ever to grace our agency or our country,” then NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said when Ms. Johnson was presented the Presidential Medal.

In 2016, NASA named a research facility for Ms. Johnson in her hometown of Hampton, Virginia, and a year later her alma mater, West Virginia State, marked her 100th birthday in August 2018 by establishing a scholarship in her name and erecting a statue.

Ms. Johnson and her black colleagues at the fledgling NASA were known as “computers” when that term was used not for a programmed electronic device but for a person who did computations. They were little known to the public for decades but gained overdue recognition when the book Hidden Figures was published and the 2016 Oscar-nominated movie hit the screens. Ms. Johnson attended the 2017 Oscars ceremony, joining the film's cast in presenting an award for documentaries, and was given a standing ovation.

Ms. Johnson had a groundbreaking career of 33 years with the space agency, working on the Mercury and Apollo missions, including the first moon landing in 1969, and the early years of the space shuttle program. Astronaut John Glenn thought so much of her that he insisted Ms. Johnson be consulted before his historic earth-orbiting flight in 1962.

“Get the girl to check the numbers,” he said.

“He knew I had done [the calculations] before for him and they trusted my work,” Ms. Johnson told the Washington Post in 2017.

Ignored the racism

During the space race between the United States and the former Soviet Union that began in the late 1950s, Ms. Johnson and her co-workers ran the numbers for unmanned rocket launches, test flights and airplane safety studies using pencils, slide rules and mechanical calculating machines. But they did their work in facilities separate from white workers and were required to use separate restrooms and dining facilities.

Ms. Johnson always said she was too busy with her work to be concerned with racism.

“She didn't close her eyes to the racism that existed,” Margot Lee Shetterly wrote in Hidden Figures. “She knew just as well as any other black person the tax levied upon them because of their colour. But she didn't feel it in the same way. She wished it away, willed it out of existence inasmuch as her daily life was concerned.”

As a girl, Ms. Johnson was fascinated by numbers and counted everything, even the steps she took while walking and the dishes she washed after dinner.

She grew up in West Virginia at a time when educational opportunities for blacks were limited because of segregation. But her mother, a former teacher, and her father, a farmer and handyman, stressed education and moved the family 120 miles to a town that had a high school for black children.

Ms. Johnson's math skills got her into West Virginia State College at age 15. She zipped through the school's math program, earning degrees in math and French before becoming one of the first black students in the graduate school at West Virginia University in 1938.

After teaching school for seven years, Ms. Johnson went to work for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, a forerunner of NASA, in Hampton in 1953 with dozens of other black women.

Ms. Johnson found herself in a realm made up almost exclusively of white men when she was chosen to be part of the team supporting the 1961 mission that made Alan Shepard the first American in space. She would go on to calculate crucial rocket trajectories, orbital paths and launch windows.

Ms. Johnson made the transition to the computer era and worked on the shuttle program while writing or co-writing 26 research reports before retiring in 1986, NASA said.

She said she was most proud of her contributions to the first moon mission, which included the calculations that synched the lunar lander craft and the orbiting command module.

Ms. Johnson and her first husband, James Goble, who died in 1956, had three daughters. She married Lieutenant Colonel James Johnson in 1959.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/q77og4/article30906291.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THPTIKATHERINEJOHNSON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/katherine-johnson-nasa-mathematician-portrayed-in-hidden-figures-dies-at-101/article30906269.ece

15,2020/02/24,10 injured as car rams into crowd at German carnival,"Driver drove into them ‘at full throttle’

Ten people were injured on Monday after a car ploughed into a carnival parade in the western German town of Volkmarsen, police said, adding that the driver had been arrested.

Police declined to say if it was an accident or if the driver had deliberately rammed the car into the crowd.

German news website HNA cited witnesses as saying the driver appeared to have deliberately targeted children and had driven into the crowd “at full throttle”.

The incident comes less than a week after a man gunned down 11 people, including himself, in one of the worst racist attacks in Germany since Second World War.

Police cars and ambulances rushed to the scene in Volkmarsen, a small town in northern Hesse, 263 miles, 423km west of Berlin.

Dirk Richter, police spokesman in the nearby city of Kassel told Welt TV: “Everything we have available from the Kassel area is there.”

Carnival is hugely popular in western Germany, especially in Rhineland cities such as Cologne and Duesseldorf, where festivities peak on “Rose Monday” with thousands attending street parades featuring comical or satirical floats.

German media said the driver deliberately broke through plastic barriers around the parade area.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/10-injured-as-car-rams-into-crowd-at-german-carnival/article30906134.ece
16,2020/02/24,Germany’s AfD to return to Hamburg Parliament,"The anti-immigrant party nonetheless suffered losses compared to the last State elections in 2015, when they picked up 6.1% of the vote.

Germany’s far-right AfD party will return to Hamburg’s state Parliament by the skin of its teeth, official results showed, after exit polls from weekend elections suggested it would crash out.

Initially predicted to pick up 4.8% of Sunday’s vote in the city State, the final count put AfD at 5.3%, just above the 5% minimum required to enter Parliament under German electoral law.

The anti-immigrant party nonetheless suffered losses compared to the last State elections in 2015, when they picked up 6.1% of the vote.

Largely unpopular in the cosmopolitan port city, the AfD struggled further in the wake of a racist attack which killed nine in central German city Hanau last week.

“Getting in by a whisker is a huge success in this case because we were subjected to campaigns from the entire political establishment of the city of Hamburg,” said regional AfD leader Dirk Nockemann.

The liberal FDP party, meanwhile, also appeared to edge over the five-percent hurdle to retain its place in Hamburg’s parliament.

Final estimates put the FDP on 5% exactly, although with some constituencies yet to finalise their counts, their fate remained in the balance on Monday morning.

The liberal party was hit hard by a recent scandal in the eastern state of Thuringia where their candidate was elected state premier with the help of votes from the AfD.

The move broke a taboo on cooperation with the far right and unleashed a national scandal which also plunged Angela Merkel’s ruling CDU party into crisis.

The centre-right party also suffered embarrassment at the Hamburg polls, slipping to just 11.2% of the vote, a showing nearly five percentage points worse than in 2015.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/germanys-afd-to-return-to-hamburg-parliament/article30906058.ece
17,2020/02/24,Voting begins to find Jeremy Corbyn replacement,"Keir Starmer is the frontrunner.

Almost 6,00,000 members of Britain's main opposition Labour party began voting on Monday for a new leader to replace leftist Jeremy Corbyn in the wake of a devastating election defeat.

Three candidates — all members of Parliament — are on the ballot paper, with the final result due to be announced on April 4.

Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer is the frontrunner, viewed as more moderate than his main rival Rebecca Long-Bailey.

The third candidate, Lisa Nandy, is well-regarded in Westminster but has a low public profile.

Mr. Corbyn was elected Labour leader in 2015, after a political career spent on the sidelines of a party where few MPs share his staunch socialist views. Now 70, he drew an enthusiastic following among youth but was forced to step down after a second general election defeat in December.

Labour suffered its worst result since 1935 while Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson triumphed with his promise – since delivered – to get Britain out of the European Union.

There had been more candidates to succeed Mr. Corbyn but only three reached the required threshold of support from fellow MPs, trade unions and local Labour associations.

It is now up to the membership to decide. Postal and email ballots were sent out Monday.

There were more than 580,000 Labour party members after the election and more people are believed to have signed up since.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ynundl/article30090111.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Corbyn,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/voting-begins-to-find-jeremy-corbyn-replacement/article30905969.ece

21,2020/02/24,"In extradition bid, U.S. accuses Assange of endangering sources","Mr. Assange faces charges under the U.S. Espionage Act for the 2010 release by his whistleblowing website of a trove of files

A lawyer for the United States on Monday accused WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange of risking the lives of intelligence sources by publishing classified U.S. government documents, as his extradition hearing opened in a London court.

Mr. Assange faces charges under the U.S. Espionage Act for the 2010 release by his whistleblowing website of a trove of files detailing the realities of U.S. military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Mr. Assange spent much of the past decade holed up in Ecuador’s London embassy to avoid separate legal proceedings in Sweden, but Washington is now seeking his transfer from Britain to stand trial.

Making the U.S. government case on the first day of the extradition hearing in London, lawyer James Lewis denied the prosecution was motivated by embarrassment over the WikiLeaks release.

“It is solely where risk of harm is caused,” he told Woolwich Crown Court as Mr. Assange, who is being held in the high security Belmarsh prison next door, listened attentively in the dock.

“The United States is aware of sources whose unredacted names and /or other identifying information was contained in classified documents published by Wikileaks who subsequently disappeared.”

WikiLeaks initially worked with a string of high-profile newspapers to publish details from the leaked State Department and Pentagon files, which caused a sensation — and outrage in Washington.

One video from 2007 showed an Apache helicopter attack in which U.S. soldiers gunned down two Reuters reporters and nine Iraqi civilians in broad daylight in Baghdad.

But after falling out with their editors, WikiLeaks released hundreds of thousands of documents in their original form — including the secret identities of diplomats and local sources.

Mr. Assange and his supporters claim the prosecution is politically motivated, and the case has alarmed free speech advocates.

The Australian’s lawyer, Edward Fitzgerald, told the court that the details in the U.S. indictment were “misleading” and insisted his client was undertaking “journalist activities“.

“We do not accept that this constitutes an extradition crime,” he said.

Protesters gathered outside court holding up banners saying “Free Assange“.

The Committee to Protect Journalists has previously warned that “for the sake of press freedom, Julian Assange must be defended“.

But Mr. Lewis, for the US government, told the court, “Julian Assange is no journalist. It is inconceivable that any member of the press would disclose any of the names of their sources.”

Assange, 48, could be jailed for 175 years if convicted on all 17 Espionage Act charges and one count of computer hacking he faces.

It is the most serious phase of a long-running legal saga that has seen him detained in some form for most of the last decade.

In 2010, Assange was accused of sexual assault and rape in Sweden and after a legal battle, was ordered by a British judge to be extradited there.

He always denied the Swedish allegations and the investigation has since been dropped.

To avoid extradition, he claimed asylum in Ecuador’s London embassy, where he spent seven years until Quito gave him up last year following a change in government.

He has since served a jail term for breaching his U.K. police bail but remains in Belmarsh prison awaiting the US extradition case.

Some U.S. legal experts think Assange has a case.

“Use of the Espionage Act has a very checkered history in the century since Congress passed it,” University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias told AFP.

Many think “extradition and U.S. prosecution would have a chilling effect on press efforts to expose government information that is important to the public interest.” Mr. Assange’s father John Shipton, who attended the hearing with Mr. Assange’s brother Gabriel Shipton, decried the “ceaseless malice” of the authorities against his son.

“We’re all here to vigorously and firmly support Julian in this 10-year long oppression and political action,” he told reporters.

In a new twist last week, Mr. Assange’s defence team claimed U.S. President Donald Trump promised to issue a pardon if Mr. Assange denied Russia leaked the emails of his 2016 election rival’s campaign.

“In August 2017, Donald Trump’s administration tried to pressure Julian Assange into saying things that would be favourable to President Trump himself,” defence coordinator Baltasar Garzon said.

“When Julian Assange refused, he was charged and an extradition request was issued alongside an international arrest warrant.” The White House called the allegation “another never-ending hoax and total lie” but a judge agreed to add it to the case file.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lh2pub/article30883245.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Assange-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/in-extradition-bid-us-accuses-assange-of-endangering-sources/article30905132.ece
22,2020/02/24,Coronavirus outbreak: Iran lawmaker says 50 dead in Qom this month,"The death toll reported by the Qom representative is higher than the number of confirmed cases of infections that Iranian officials had reported.

A staggering 50 people have died in the Iranian city of Qom from the new coronavirus this month, a lawmaker was quoted as saying on Monday, even as the Health Ministry insisted that only 12 deaths have been recorded to date in the country.

The new death toll reported by the Qom representative, Ahmad Amiriabadi Farahani, is significantly higher than the latest number of nationwide confirmed cases of infections that Iranian officials had reported just a few hours earlier, which stood at 12 deaths out of 47 cases, according to state TV.

Health Ministry spokesperson Iraj Harirchi rejected the Qom lawmaker’s claims, insisting that the death toll from the virus remains at 12.

However, he raised the number of confirmed cases from the virus to 61. Some 900 other suspected cases are being tested, he said.

“No one is qualified to discuss this sort of news at all,” Mr. Haririchi said, adding that lawmakers have no access to coronavirus statics and could be mixing figures on deaths related to other diseases such as the flu with the new virus, which first emerged in China in December.

Still, the number of deaths compared to the number of confirmed infections from the virus is higher in Iran than in any other country, including China and South Korea, where the outbreak is far more widespread.

Mr. Farahani, the lawmaker from Qom, was quoted in local media saying more than 250 people are quarantined in the city, which is a popular place of religious study for Shiites from across Iran and other countries. He spoke following a session in parliament in Tehran on Monday, and was quoted by ILNA and other semi-official news agencies.

The lawmaker said the 50 deaths date as far back as Feb.13. Iran first officially reported cases of the virus and its first deaths in Qom on Feb.19.

I think the performance of the administration in controlling the virus has not been successful, Mr. Farahani said, referring to the government of President Hassan Rouhani.

None of the nurses have access to proper protective gears, Mr. Farahani said, adding that some health-care specialists had left the city. So far, I have not seen any particular action to confront corona by the administration. There are concerns that clusters of the new coronavirus in Iran, as well as in Italy and South Korea, could signal a serious new stage in its global spread.

A top World Health Official expressed concerns on Monday over the spread of virus. We are worried about the situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran and in Italy, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

It is an incredible time. Less than two months ago, the coronavirus was completely unknown to us,” Mr. Ghebreyesus said.

The past few weeks has demonstrated just how quickly a new virus can spread around the world and cause widespread fear and disruption. The outbreak in Iran has centred mostly in the city of Qom, but spread rapidly over the past few days as Iranians went to the polls on Friday for nationwide parliamentary elections, with many voters wearing masks and stocking up on hand sanitizer.

Authorities in Iran have closed schools across much of the country for a second day. Soccer fans across Iran not permitted to attend matches, and shows in movie theatres and other venues were suspended until Friday. Authorities have begun daily sanitisation of Tehran’s metro, which is used by some 3 million people, and public transportation cars in the city.

Iranian health officials have not said whether health workers in Qom who first came in contact with the infected people had taken precautionary measures in treating those who died of the virus. Iran also has not said how many people are in quarantine across the country overall.

Neighbouring countries have reported infections from travellers from Iran in recent days, prompting several to shut their borders to Iranian citizens.

Kuwait announced on Monday its first cases of the virus, saying that three travellers returning from the northeastern city of Mashhad, Iran were confirmed infected with the coronavirus.

Iran, however, has not yet reported any confirmed cases of the virus in Mashhad, raising questions about how the Iranian government is carrying out tests and quarantines. Iran has confirmed cases so far in five cities, including the capital, Tehran. A local mayor in Tehran is among those infected and in quarantine.

Kuwait has been evacuating some 750 citizens from Iran and testing them as they enter the country after saying that Iran had barred its medical workers from testing travellers at an exit terminal in Iran, despite an agreement to do so.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/i9mo90/article30904287.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24IN-IRANVIRUSOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-outbreak-iran-lawmaker-says-50-dead-in-qom-this-month/article30904172.ece
23,2020/02/24,News analysis: Is Donald Trump soft on Pakistan?,"It's interesting that Mr. Trump chose to reaffirm U.S.’s improving ties with Pakistan at a meeting in Ahmedabad with Modi

Addressing a huge crowd at Ahmedabad’s newly-constructed Motera Stadium on Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump minced no words in praising India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mr. Trump lauded India’s democratic traditions and values, promised to provide India with the “best and most feared military equipment”, and reaffirmed a commitment to fight terror together. The President also referred to Washington’s relationship with Pakistan, which he described as “a very good one”. “... [W]e are beginning to see signs of big progress with Pakistan,” he added.

It’s interesting that Mr. Trump chose to reaffirm the U.S.’s improving ties with Pakistan at a public meeting in Ahmedabad with Prime Minister Modi. It may not be an accidental reference. Both the Trump administration and Islamabad have taken sustained efforts in recent months to improve bilateral ties, despite India’s earnest attempts to isolate Pakistan over its support for terrorist groups operating from its soil. While both sides sit together for bilaterals on Tuesday, the Pakistan factor may continue to be an irritant in the larger scheme of the strategic partnership.

Peace with Taliban

Mr. Trump’s visit to India happens at a time when the U.S. and the Taliban are observing a seven-day period of violence-reduction in Afghanistan. If the test period passes without any major violent incident, both sides are expected to sign a peace agreement under which the U.S. would pull out its troops from the war-torn country.

Pakistan, which hosts the leadership of the Afghan Taliban as well as the Haqqani Network which is a key constituent of the Taliban, had played a critical role in facilitating direct talks between the insurgents and the Americans. And if the U.S. leaves Afghanistan, it will directly strengthen the hands of the Taliban in Afghanistan, which means Pakistan’s profile in Afghanistan will be lifted. This would leave the U.S. overly dependent on Pakistan to shape Afghan politics in the future.

Reset with Pakistan

While this has been the larger context of the reset in U.S.-Pakistan ties, there were specifics that can’t be ignored. After the February 2019 Pulwama attack and the subsequent dogfight between India and Pakistan, Islamabad has taken efforts to charm the Trump administration. When Prime Minister Imran Khan visited Washington in July 2019, Mr. Trump offered mediation between India and Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir crisis — in so doing, he practically endorsed the Pakistani position as India has always maintained that Kashmir is a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan.

Mr. Khan’s visit also had military dimensions. A few days prior to the visit, General Mark Milley, the highest-ranking officer in the U.S. military, had said U.S. “interests are better served if the country maintains strong military ties with Pakistan”. In December 2019, in a move that endorsed Gen. Milley’s views, the U.S. decided to resume a military training programme for Pakistan. The International Military Education and Training Programme (IMET) had been a central pillar of the U.S.-Pakistan military cooperation for years. President Trump suspended the $2-billion programme in 2018 to force Pakistan to crack down on terrorist groups. The Pulwama attack happened after Mr. Trump’s decision. Barring the court cases against Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed and his associates over money laundering and terror financing, Pakistan hasn’t taken any major hard measures against terror infrastructure on its soil. But by mid-2019, the U.S. had already started changing its approach.

No blacklisting

In the most recent example of the U.S.’s soft policy towards Pakistan, Washington and its allies along with China raised no adverse remark on Pakistan in the review meeting of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental organisation combating money laundering, earlier this month. Pakistan has already been put on the FATF “grey list” with warnings to do more to combat terror financing. India has been pushing to blacklist Pakistan, which would invite sanctions to its financial system. But the Beijing review meeting decided against the blacklisting.

So the Trump administration’s policy is to stay engaged with Pakistan with offers for limited protection, while seeking to strengthen trade, defence and strategic ties with India. A State Department official had already said before Mr. Trump’s visit, as reported in The Hindu, that Mr. Trump might take up the Kashmir issue in bilateral talks. The U.S. President has repeatedly offered to mediate between the two countries despite India’s known protests. The biggest challenge before the Indian side, while pushing to deepen ties with Washington, is to reconcile with the Pakistan factor or find ways to skirt or address it.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/aqi4ai/article30903847.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DONALDTRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/news-analysis-is-donald-trump-soft-on-pakistan/article30903848.ece

Rohitha Rajapaksa, son of Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, on Monday apologised for making distressing remarks on social media while responding to a person’s “offensive comment” about his family.

Rohitha said he made the remarks as a result of a “targeted offensive comment” and had no intention to deliberately cause distress to any individual and or community.

“I recently made a statement as a result of a targeted offensive comment. It was not my intention to deliberately cause distress to any individual and/or community. Therefore, I sincerely apologise,” he said in a tweet.

The apology came after an individual wrote to him in a tweet that “all what we have achieved is to see you three brothers get married in the same year with nine ceremonies and your in-laws become most eligible for state positions and you live out of public money...”

Rohitha responded to the tweet saying, “There is no clause I have to declare my private assets and show off. But trust me no public fund is used for our personal benefits. Why don’t you get ur self a proper job and an education so you won’t be jealous of another person’s success. Get a wife and make children.”

To another tweet he responded saying: “You seem to know a lot more than the CID, please join and make them finish these cases soon so you can find ur self a boyfriend who can keep you company.”

25,2020/02/24,Indian-origin woman in U.K. beaten up for saving her Chinese friend from racist attack,"The attack was over coronavirus outbreak. A spokeswoman of Birmingham Chinese Society said: “There has always been abuse. The virus has given some individuals a reason for that abuse.”

An Indian-origin woman, a trainee lawyer, in the U.K. fell unconscious after being beaten up by an unidentified man. She had tried to save her Chinese friend from a racist attack over coronavirus, media reports said, on Monday.

The incident took place when Meera Solanka (29) from England’s Solihull town was out with her friends, including her Chinese friend Mandy Huang (28) from London, celebrating her birthday in Midlands region.

Ms. Solanka was knocked unconscious and hospitalised after she stepped in when Mandy was told: “Take your f****** coronavirus back home!”, Birmingham Mail newspaper reported.

Mandy was accused of carrying the virus outside Birmingham’s Ana Rocha Bar and Gallery on Frederick Street in the early hours of February 9.

“I was having birthday drinks with a group of girls and guys including Chinese friends. There were a group of Asian men inside the venue – one of them kept coming up to me and harassing me. He seemed to have a problem with me being an Indian girl with a multi-racial group of friends.

“For some reason he got really angry with her [Mandy] and started abusing her calling her a dirty chink. He said “take your f****** coronavirus and take it back home. I was shocked and angry so I shouted for him to stop and tried to push him away,” Ms. Solanki was quoted as saying by the Sunday Mercury newspaper.

“He punched me in the head, I hit the pavement and was knocked unconscious,” she said.

Ms. Solanki was rushed to the hospital where she was treated for concussion. “I was so shocked and horrified by his aggressive behaviour and horrific words. As I lay unconscious he continued to threaten my friends and abuse them before walking away calmly with his group of friends who did nothing to stop him or help me,” she said.

A spokeswoman for Birmingham Chinese Society said: “There has always been abuse. The virus has given some individuals a reason for that abuse.”

A West Midlands Police spokeswoman said: “We’re investigating after a woman was assaulted after another was racially abused in Frederick Street, Hockley, around 2 a.m. on Sunday February 9. A man made racist marks to one woman and after he was asked to stop he punched another female, in her 20s, in the face. She was temporarily knocked unconscious but escaped without serious injury”.

The police said that the attacker is described as an Asian, 5ft 8ins tall, of large build and was wearing a flat cap and hoodie at the time.

According to the report, there are 400,000 Chinese people living in England and Wales.

26,2020/02/24,COVID-19: China postpones annual meeting of parliament,"China's top legislative body has formally decided to postpone the annual meeting of parliament originally scheduled to start on March 5, state TV reported on Monday, amid a coronavirus outbreak that has infected more than 70,000 in the country.

State television said the new date for the meetings, which typically last for 10 days, would be set later. The meeting would not be delayed for too long, the report added without elaborating.

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a largely ceremonial advisory body, will also postpone its meeting, which was due to start two days earlier, China Central Television said.

The gatherings traditionally see more than 5,000 delegates descend on Beijing from all over China for at least 10 days, to pass legislation and unveil the year's key economic targets.

It is the first time since the current March schedule was adopted in 1995 that the meeting of parliament has been postponed.

Five people familiar with the matter told Reuters this month that China was considering delaying the meetings as Beijing grapples with the epidemic. State media reported last week that the National People's Congress's standing committee was evaluating a proposal to do so.

The legislative body also on Monday formally decided to ban all illegal wildlife trade and consumption in China, the report said.

China's death toll from the new coronavirus rose to 2,592 on February 24, after the National Health Commission reported 150 more fatalities, all but one in the epicentre of Hubei province. Monday's death toll was a jump on the 97 deaths reported Sunday. The commission also confirmed a total of 409 new cases in China, with all but 11 in Hubei.

The coronavirus has spread to more than 25 countries and is causing mounting alarm due to new pockets of outbreaks in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.

Italy reported a third death while cases spiked, and authorities suspended football games while the Venice Carnival was cut short. Iran's confirmed death toll rose to eight, prompting travel bans from neighbouring countries.

Experts visit Wuhan

Experts from the World Health Organization have visited the locked-down central Chinese city at the epicentre of the deadly global coronavirus outbreak, Chinese authorities said Monday.

The trip over the weekend is the first reported visit to Wuhan by the WHO since the virus emerged from the city of 11 million people late last year.

The international group of experts led by the WHO inspected two hospitals during their visit, including a makeshift one at a sports centre, the National Health Commission said on Monday.

They also met with Ma Xiaowei, the director of China's national health commission, and top officials at the centre for disease control for Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital.

The WHO has praised Beijing for its handling of the epidemic. But China has been criticised at home for silencing early warnings from a whistleblower doctor who later died from the virus.

29,2020/02/24,Malaysian PM Mahathir submits resignation,"Malaysia in turmoil as Anwar denounces bid to bring down government

Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, at 94 the world's oldest leader, submitted his resignation to the king on Monday, his office said, after a bid by his political partners to bring down the government.

Dr. Mahathir “has sent a resignation letter as prime minister of Malaysia”, said a statement from his office.

Malaysian politics was in turmoil on Monday after leader-in-waiting Anwar Ibrahim denounced a ""betrayal"" by coalition partners he said were trying to bring down the government, two years after it stormed to victory.

Mr. Anwar's ""Pact of Hope"" alliance was thrown into crisis after his rivals within the coalition and opposition politicians met at the weekend reportedly to try to form a new government.

Speculation is mounting that Mr. Anwar, who had been the presumptive successor to Dr. Mahathir, and his lawmakers would be left out of any new coalition, ending his hopes of becoming premier any time soon.

File photo of Anwar Ibrahim | Photo Credit: Reuters

According to reports, the proposed new government includes Mahathir's party, the United Malays National Organisation -- the party of scandal-tainted ex-leader Najib Razak, which was ousted at the 2018 polls -- and a hardline Islamist group.

Mr. Anwar said late Sunday he was ""shocked"" at the bid to topple the ruling coalition, describing it as a ""betrayal, because there has been a promise [to hand over power to me]"".

Mr. Anwar -- a former opposition icon who was jailed for years on widely-criticised sodomy charges -- was expected later Monday to meet the king, who must give his assent to the formation of a new government.

He had teamed up with former nemesis Dr. Mahathir ahead of the 2018 elections to oust the government of Najib, who had become embroiled in the massive 1MDB graft scandal.

They led an alliance to an unexpected victory against a coalition that had ruled Malaysia uninterrupted for over six decades, and 94-year-old Dr. Mahathir agreed to eventually hand power to Mr. Anwar.

But Dr. Mahathir, in his second stint as premier after first holding the role from 1981 to 2003, has repeatedly refused to say when he will transfer power, stoking tensions within the four-party coalition.

'Malay supremacy'

The alliance's popularity had plummeted as it was accused of failing to raise living standards and protect the rights of the ethnic Malay Muslim majority, and it lost a string of local polls.

After the weekend meetings, analysts said the government stood little chance of surviving.

James Chin, a Malaysia expert at the University of Tasmania, said many Muslims were unhappy with the government and believed the argument put forward by opponents that it was being dominated by ethnic Chinese politicians.

""They want Mahathir in power, and they want Malay supremacy,"" he told AFP.

Race is a highly sensitive issue in Malaysia. About 60 % of the population is Muslim but it is also home to substantial ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities.

Many were angry, however, that the democratically elected government, which came to power partly on a pledge to push through much-needed reforms, could be replaced without an election.

The people ""will not agree to or cooperate with any 'backdoor' government formed out of the selfish, self-preservation agenda of certain MPs,"" said a statement from a group of leading activists and academics.

Some called for a snap poll, although politicians appeared to be trying to form a new government without holding an election.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nugtlg/article30785166.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MAHATHIRMOHAMAD-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/malaysia-in-turmoil-as-anwar-denounces-bid-to-bring-down-government/article30901132.ece
30,2020/02/24,Britain starts hearing U.S. case for extraditing Assange,"A ruling against Assange in the case could see the 48-year-old Australian jailed for 175 years if convicted on all 17 US Espionage Act charges and one count of computer hacking he faces.

Britain on Monday starts hearing Washington's extradition request for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in a test case of media freedoms in the digital age and the limits of US justice.

A ruling against Assange in the case could see the 48-year-old Australian jailed for 175 years if convicted on all 17 US Espionage Act charges and one count of computer hacking he faces.

Each stems from his site's release in 2010 of a trove of classified State Department and Pentagon files detailing the realities of the US campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.

One video from 2007 showed an Apache helicopter attack in which US soldiers gunned down two Reuters reporters and nine Iraqi civilians in broad daylight in Baghdad.

The files also disclosed the secret identities of diplomats and government agents in hostile environments -- as well as locals who risked their lives by cooperating with the United States.

These names were redacted by the Western newspapers with which WikiLeaks initially worked.

But a falling out with their editors prompted Assange to release hundreds of thousands of files in their original form.

The US Justice Department said last May that the ""human resources"" compromised by Assange ""included local Afghans and Iraqis, journalists, religious leaders, human rights advocates, and political dissidents from repressive regimes"".

His supporters argue that Assange's prosecution was political -- and personal -- from the start.

""For the sake of press freedom, Julian Assange must be defended,"" the Committee to Protect Journalists said in December.

Trump involvement

The case was injected with still more intrigue when the defence claimed US President Donald Trump promised to issue a pardon if Assange denied Russia leaked the emails of his 2016 election rival's campaign.

""In August 2017, Donald Trump's administration tried to pressure Julian Assange into saying things that would be favourable to President Trump himself,"" Assange's defence team coordinator Baltasar Garzon said on Thursday.

""When Julian Assange refused, he was charged and an extradition request was issued alongside an international arrest warrant.""

The White House called the allegation ""another never-ending hoax and total lie"" but a judge agreed to add it to the case file.

Assange is additionally shadowed by a rape allegation and a sexual assault claim that stem from his 2010 visit to Sweden.

He denied everything and called the case a legal pretext for Sweden to extradite him to the United States.

Assange agreed to attend hearings into the charges in London and his legal battles crossed borders yet again.

International fugitive

A UK court ruled in February 2011 that Assange could be extradited back to Sweden to stand trial.

He secured political asylum in Ecuador's London embassy instead and became international fugitive by breaching his UK bail conditions in 2012.

Yet his campaigning continued in full.

Assange struck a deal with Russia's state broadcaster RT in 2012 and began airing Skype interviews with anti-Western figures such as Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah that further infuriated Washington.

A political realignment in Ecuador toward the United States saw Assange fall out of favour and begin losing his embassy privileges in 2018.

The last protections were lifted last April and Assange was dragged kicking and screaming out of the embassy and locked up in a high-security prison next to London's Woolwich Crown Court where the case will be heard in two sessions this week and in May.

Public interest

The sex charges no longer apply because of the statute of limitations and Swedish investigators' inability to question Assange about what a top prosecutor lamented in November remained a ""credible"" claim.

But the court will consider whether ""the conduct described (by the US Justice Department) amounts to an extradition offence"".

Britain's Crown Prosecution Service says the court must also weigh whether ""extradition would be disproportionate or would be incompatible with the requested person's human rights"".

The defence claims that it would and some US legal experts think Assange has a case.

""Use of the Espionage Act has a very checkered history in the century since Congress passed it,"" University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias told AFP.

Many think ""extradition and US prosecution would have a chilling effect on press efforts to expose government information that is important to the public interest.""",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dsyf1h/article27940905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14IN-WIKILEAKS-ASSANGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/britain-starts-hearing-us-case-for-extraditing-assange/article30901009.ece
31,2020/02/24,U.S. presses Yemen’s Huthis to drop Baha’i charges,"Baha'is consider the Baha'u'llah, born in 1817 in Iran, to be a prophet, a sharp contrast from the orthodox Islamic view that Mohammed was God's final messenger.

The United States has urged Yemen's Huthi rebels to drop charges targeting the Baha'i community, which said that 24 believers of the faith will face a new trial session Tuesday.

Sam Brownback, the U.S. ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, voiced concern at reports that a court in Yemen's Huthi-controlled capital Sanaa is again summoning the the Baha'is who in 2018 were slapped with charges that include apostasy and espionage.

""We urge them to drop these allegations, release those arbitrarily detained, and respect religious freedom for all,"" he wrote on Twitter.

According to the Baha'i community, one member among the 24 to be tried Tuesday -- five of whom are already detained -- said that a prosecutor made clear that his arrest was due to his religion.

""The Baha'is that are held in Sanaa are innocent and the physical and mental torture they are experiencing is designed to force them to admit to crimes they have not committed,"" Bani Dugal, principal representative of the Baha'i International Community, said in a statement.

The Huthis are allied with Iran's Shiite clerical regime, which restricts the rights of Baha'is despite allowing freedom of religion for Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians.

Baha'is consider the Baha'u'llah, born in 1817 in Iran, to be a prophet, a sharp contrast from the orthodox Islamic view that Mohammed was God's final messenger.

Several thousand Baha'is are estimated to live in Yemen. Among them is Hamed bin Haydara, who was sentenced in 2018 to execution with appeals in his case under review.

The concern about Huthi treatment of the Baha'is comes amid widespread condemnation of the Saudi-led operation against the rebels over the heavy toll on civilians, including notoriously a 2018 air strike on a school bus.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article19715185.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INBAHAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-presses-yemens-huthis-to-drop-bahai-charges/article30900873.ece
32,2020/02/24,One protester shot dead in fresh violence: Iraqi officials,"One protester was killed in Baghdad’s central Khilani Square Sunday evening and at least six were wounded when security forces fired live rounds to disperse crowds, Iraqi security and medical officials said.

One protester was shot dead and at least six wounded in renewed violence between anti-government demonstrators and security forces in central Baghdad on Sunday, Iraqi officials said.

Separately, Prime Minister-designate Mohammed Allawi received a call from U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who congratulated him on his nomination and emphasised joint coordination between Iraq and the U.S. as relations between the two countries soured after a Washington-directed attack January 3 near Baghdad airport killed top Iranian general Qassem Solimani.

One protester was killed in Baghdad’s central Khilani Square Sunday evening and at least six were wounded when security forces fired live rounds to disperse crowds, Iraqi security and medical officials said. The clashes occurred near the Sinak bridge, which was recently reopened by security forces after protesters had blocked access for months.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.

Protesters continue to occupy central Tahrir square and adjacent Jumhuriyah bridge, which leads to the fortified Green Zone, the seat of Iraq’s government.

Over 500 people have been killed under fire from security forces since mass anti-government protests erupted in the capital and Iraq’s south on Oct. 1.

Thousands of Iraqis, mostly young people, took to the streets to decry government corruption, poor services and unemployment.

In the call, Mr. Pompeo emphasised bilateral joint action and coordination, according to a statement from the prime minister’s office, at a time when U.S-Iraq relations have seethed after the killing of Soleimani.

After the strike, Iraqi lawmakers passed a non-binding resolution to pressure the government and oust U.S. troops.

Mr. Allawi was elected Prime Minister-designate February 1 after months of negotiations between rival blocs.

33,2020/02/24,Indian shot dead at grocery store in Los Angeles,"Hailing from Karnal, Sahi had arrived in the U.S. less than six months ago and had sought political asylum.

A masked assailant shot dead Indian national Maninder Singh Sahi at a grocery store in Los Angeles in the early hours of Saturday, local police said.

Maninder, who had turned 31 last month, was married and father of two.

Hailing from Karnal, Sahi had arrived in the U.S. less than six months ago and had sought political asylum.

He was working at a 7-Eleven grocery store in the Whittier City in Los Angeles County of California.

The only earning member of his family, Sahi used to send money to his wife and two children back home, his relatives in the US said.

According to the Whittier Police Department, the incident occurred at 5.43 am on Saturday.

Preliminarily it appears the suspect entered the store with a semi-automatic handgun with the intent to commit a robbery.

For unknown reasons the suspect fired the handgun killing the clerk, the police said releasing a picture of the suspect.

The suspect fled the location and is outstanding at this time. There were two customers inside the store, both were uninjured. The suspect is described as a male black adult approximately 506-507. Suspect had his face partially covered and was wearing a dark hoody with a gray hoody underneath, police said.

The victim’s brother here has set up a GoFund Page to raise money so that the body of deceased Maninder could be taken back to India.

“He left behind, his parents, his wife and 2 small children, ages 5 and 9. I am seeking assistance to help send his body back to India so his wife and kids can view him one last time, his brother wrote in Go Fund Me page on Sunday.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/indian-shot-dead-at-grocery-store-in-los-angeles/article30900497.ece
34,2020/02/24,"S. Korea reports 161 new virus cases, bringing total to 763","Two more deaths were confirmed, raising South Korea’s death toll to seven from the COVID-19 illness, which is caused by a newly identified coronavirus that has infected tens of thousands of people, mostly in China.

South Korea on Monday reported 161 more cases of a new virus that has spread rapidly around a southwestern city, bringing the nation’s total to 763 cases a day after the president called for “unprecedented, powerful” steps to combat the outbreak.

Two more deaths were confirmed, raising South Korea’s death toll to seven from the COVID-19 illness, which is caused by a newly identified coronavirus that has infected tens of thousands of people, mostly in China.

More than 140 of South Korea’s new cases were in and near the city of Daegu, where most of the country’s infections have so far occurred. Six of the seven deaths were linked to a hospital in Cheongdo, near Daegu, where a slew of infections were confirmed among patients in a mental ward.

While officials have expressed hope they could contain the outbreak to the region surrounding Daegu, some experts noted signs of the virus circulating nationwide, pointing to a number of cases in the capital, Seoul, and elsewhere that weren’t immediately traceable.

Far from where the illness first emerged, authorities in Italy battled to contain Europe’s first major outbreak and Iran reported eight deaths - the highest toll outside of China. Some of the disease clusters identified in recent days have shown no link to China, a worrying sign of the virus spreading beyond control.

The Iranian health ministry said there were now 43 confirmed cases in Iran, which did not report its first case of the virus until Wednesday.

In Italy’s northern Lombardy region, which includes the nation’s financial capital, Milan, the governor announced Sunday that the number of confirmed cases stood at 110. Italy now has 152 cases, the largest number outside of Asia, including three deaths, the most recent on Sunday.

Venice, which is full of tourists for Carnival events, reported its first two cases, said Veneto Gov. Luca Zaia, whose region includes the lagoon city. It wasn’t immediately known if the two infected had participated in Carnival festivities.

As Italy scrambled to check the spread of the virus, authorities announced that all Carnival events had been called off as well as major league soccer matches in the stricken region. Cinemas and theaters were also ordered shuttered, including Milan’s legendary La Scala.

Warning that China’s virus epidemic is “still grim and complex,” President Xi Jinping called for more efforts to stop the outbreak, revive industry and prevent the disease from disrupting spring planting of crops.

Mr. Xi defended the ruling Communist Party’s response as “timely and effective” in a video conference with officials in charge of anti-disease work, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.

""The current epidemic situation is still grim and complex,” Xinhua cited Mr. Xi as saying. “Prevention and control are at the most critical stage.”

South Korean President Moon Jae-in said his government had increased its anti-virus alert level by one notch to “Red,” the highest level. It allows for the temporary closure of schools and reduced operation of public transportation and flights to and from South Korea.

The new school year for kindergartens, elementary, middle and high schools in South Korea was put off by one week until March 9.

Mr. Moon said the outbreak “has reached a crucial watershed,” and that the next few days will be critical. “We shouldn’t be bound by regulations and hesitate to take unprecedented, powerful measures,” he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ohncjn/article30900461.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINA-HEALTHSOUTHKOREA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/s-korea-reports-161-new-virus-cases-bringing-total-to-763/article30900462.ece
35,2020/02/24,Italy cancels Venice Carnival in bid to halt spread of virus,"The decision to call off Carnival was announced by Veneto regional Gov. Luca Zaia as the numbers of confirmed virus cases soared to 152, the largest number outside Asia.

Italy scrambled on Sunday to check the spread of the new viral disease amid rapidly rising numbers of infections in the country and a third death, calling off the Venice Carnival attended by thousands of revelers, scrapping major league soccer matches in the stricken area and shuttering theaters, including Milan’s legendary La Scala.

Also rising was concern in Europe, including by neighboring Austria, which dangled the specter of closing its border if the health emergency worsens.

The decision to call off Carnival was announced by Veneto regional Gov. Luca Zaia as the numbers of confirmed virus cases soared to 152, the largest number outside Asia.

“The ordinance is immediately operative and will go into effect at midnight,” said Zaia, whose area includes Venice, where thousands packed St. Mark’s Square. Carnival would have run through Tuesday.

Road blocks were set up in at least some of 10 towns in Lombardy at the epicenter of the outbreak, including in Casalpusterlengo, to keep people from leaving or arriving. Even trains transiting the area weren’t allowed to stop.

Buses, trains and other forms of public transport - including boats in Venice - were being disinfected, Zaia told reporters. Museums were also ordered to shut down after Sunday in Venice, a top tourist draw anytime of the year, as well as in neighboring Lombardy, which, with at least 110 confirmed cases, is the epicenter of the viral outbreak.

Authorities said three people in Venice have tested positive for the viral disease known as COVID-19, all of them in their late 80s and who were hospitalized in critical condition.

Other northern regions with smaller numbers of cases are Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont.

Italy’s first two cases were a Chinese tourist couple, diagnosed earlier this month and reported recovering in a Rome hospital.

The death on Sunday of an elderly woman, who was already suffering from cancer when she contracted the virus, raised the nation’s death toll to three, said Lombardy regional official Giulio Gallera.

Authorities expressed frustration that they haven’t been able to track down the source of the virus that is spreading in the north and which surfaced last week when an Italian man in his late 30s in Codogno became critically ill.

""The health officials haven’t been yet able to pinpoint ‘patient zero,’” Angelo Borrelli, head of the national Civil Protection agency, told reporters in Rome.

At first, it was widely presumed that the man was infected by an Italian friend he dined with and who had recently returned from his job, based in Shanghai. But when the friend tested negative for the virus attention turned to several Chinese residents who frequent the same cafe visited by the stricken man. But Lombardy Gov. Attilio Fontana told reporters they all tested negative too.

So for now, Borrelli indicated the strategy is to concentrate on closures and other restrictions to try to stem the spread in the country, which already had taken measures early on in the global virus alarm that included banning direct flights from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. Italy has also tested millions of airport passengers arriving from other places for any signs of fever.

""Worry is understandable, panic, no,” Premier Giuseppe Conte told a state TV interviewer.

Gallera told reporters in Milan that schools, museums, discos, pubs and theaters would stay closed for at least seven days. But restaurants in Milan and other Lombardy cities outside the main cluster area can still operate since, unlike at concerts and other entertainment venues, in eateries “people are not congregated in one place and there is space between tables,” Gallera said.

Lombardy’s ban on public events also extended to Masses in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation. Venice also was forbidding public Masses, while in Milan, the city’s iconic Gothic cathedral was closed to visitors. School trips inside Italy and overseas were banned.

But in the south, thousands turned out for a visit by Pope Francis in the port city of Bari. The pontiff shook hands with many of the faithful.

In Lombardy, a populous region which includes the country’s financial capital, Milan, nearly all the cases of COVID-19 were in the countryside, mainly in Codogno and nine neighboring towns. In those towns, only grocery stores and pharmacies were permitted to open, and people weren’t supposed to enter or leave the towns.

Melissa Catanacci, who lives on one of Codogno’s main roads, said in the morning, she ventured outside for a stroll along with her husband and two children, ages 10 and 13.

""Every quarter-hour or so a car goes by” on the main road, Catanacci said, speaking by telephone. With businesses closed, the usual Sunday “passeggiata” - a leisurely stroll through local streets - didn’t last very long, she said.

With school to stay shut through the week, her children were visiting their friends’ houses or inviting them over to hers to break the boredom, she said.

Sporting events were canceled, from children’s team practices to Serie A soccer matches which were to be played in northern stadiums. Those measures were ordered Saturday night by the Italian government.

Dispensers of hand disinfectant were being installed in trains run by the state railways, which also said it was supplying its crews with masks and disposable gloves.

Britain’s number of confirmed cases rose to 13, with the positive test results of four Britons who had been aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which had been moored for days at a Japanese port when the ship was quarantined.

In Austria, security official Franz Lang said the country was consideringactivating border controls to Italy. Both nations are part of the European Union’s visa- and passport-free zone, but under certain circumstances individual countries can reactivate controls. Lang said the situation would be discussed in meetings Monday, local Austrian media reported.

In Switzerland, which like Austria borders Italy, there was a call for calm.

""The news from Italy is worrisome ... but it is too early to think that a wave is rolling our way,” Daniel Koch, the head of the department for contagious diseases at the heath office, told the SRF public broadcaster

The German health ministry said it had initiated a phone conference for all European Union public health authorities about the outbreak in northern Italy on Monday.

French Health Minister Olivier Veran said that authorities were getting ready for a possible outbreak in France of the new virus. In an interview published Sunday in French newspaper Le Parisien he said he was monitoring closely the “very serious” situation, including in neighboring Italy.

Earlier this month, France reported the first death outside Asia of a person infected with the virus, an 80-year-old Chinese tourist.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/3cszzt/article30900437.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINA-HEALTHITALY-VENICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/italy-cancels-venice-carnival-in-bid-to-halt-spread-of-virus/article30900438.ece
36,2020/02/24,"Israel strikes Gaza, Syria after Palestinian rockets attacks","Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group claimed responsibility for the rocket barrages

The Israel military said early Monday that it struck Palestinian militants targets in Gaza and Syria in response to rockets fired toward southern Israel on Sunday evening, hours after Israel said it killed a Palestinian militant who tried to place a bomb along the Israel-Gaza barrier fence.

The Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group claimed responsibility for the rocket barrages. Palestinians were furious over the image of the man’s lifeless body dangling off the front of an Israeli bulldozer that crossed into Gaza to retrieve it. There was also criticism in Gaza of the territory’s Hamas rulers for not responding.

The Israeli military reported air raid sirens throughout southern Israel and said at least 20 rockets had been fired. There were no reports of damage or injuries on the Israeli side, but it was the heaviest barrage of rockets from the Gaza Strip in several months. Air raid sirens continued into the evening, and Israel’s Home Front Command ordered the suspension of classes in Israeli schools in southern Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip on Monday and prohibited large gatherings.

In response to the rocket fire, the Israeli military said aircraft struck “dozens of Islamic Jihad terror targets throughout the Gaza Strip” and a facility belonging to the militant group outside Damascus.

The Gaza health ministry reported that four Palestinians were treated at the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City for wounds caused by the Israeli strikes.

Israel and the Islamic Jihad group engaged in a heavy round of fighting last November after the Israeli military killed a top Islamic Jihad commander.

Since then, Israel and Gaza’s more powerful Hamas group have been working through Egyptian mediators to cement an informal cease-fire. But Islamic Jihad has continued to try to carry out attacks.

Islamic Jihad said the man killed along the border was a militant. Israel said the man was planting explosives along the border fence. Amateur video on Palestinian social media showed an Israeli bulldozer crossing into Gaza and then lifting up his body.

Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesman, accused the Israeli military of abusing the dead body, saying that it “bears the consequences of the ugly crime.”

The military said it was removing the body in a way that prevented further danger to those around.

But the images generated widespread anger in Gaza, where it was seen as a provocation and violation of Islamic principles that call for respect for the dead.

It also sparked criticism of Hamas on social media, with people accusing the group of appearing weak and allowing Israel to operate with impunity inside Gaza’s territory. One image on social media showed a picture of Jesus draped with a Palestinian flag hanging off the front of a bulldozer.

Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett rejected the criticism, noting that Hamas has been holding the bodies of two Israeli soldiers since they were killed in the 2014 Gaza war.

""I back the military, which killed the terrorists and collected the body,” he said. “That’s what should be done and that is what was done.”

The incident comes amid a relative lull along the security fence separating Israel from Gaza. Last week, Israel announced it would provide hundreds of additional work permits for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, in a new step aimed at solidifying an informal cease-fire with the Hamas.

Tens of thousands of Gazans used to work in Israel. But Israel virtually sealed the border when it joined Egypt in imposing a crippling blockade on Gaza after Hamas seized power in the strip from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. The blockade, along with three wars between Hamas and Israel, has devastated the economy in Gaza, where unemployment is over 50%.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israel-strikes-gaza-syria-after-palestinian-rockets-attacks/article30900366.ece
37,2020/02/24,Scientists spot 4G bug that can help hackers impersonate you,"The vulnerability, which affects virtually all mobile phones, tablets and some connected household appliances, may also hamper investigations of law enforcement agencies because attackers can not only make purchases in the victim’s name but also access websites using the victim’s identity

Researchers have found a serious vulnerability in LTE/4G mobile communication standard that can help hackers impersonate other phone users, take a streaming service subscription at your expense or publish secret company documents under someone else’s identity.

The vulnerability, which affects virtually all mobile phones, tablets and some connected household appliances, may also hamper investigations of law enforcement agencies because attackers can not only make purchases in the victim’s name but also access websites using the victim’s identity.

For example, an attacker can upload secret company documents and to network operators or law enforcement authorities, it would look as if the victim is the perpetrator, said researchers from Ruhr-Universitat Bochum Public University.

“An attacker can book services, for example, stream shows, but the owner of the attacked phone would have to pay for them,” said Professor Thorsten Holz from Horst Gortz Institute for IT Security.

Only changing the hardware design would mitigate the threat.

The team is attempting to close the security gap in the latest mobile communication standard 5G, which is currently rolled out.

“Mobile network operators would have to accept higher costs, as the additional protection generates more data during the transmission. In addition, all mobile phones would have to be replaced and the base station expanded. That is something that will not happen in the near future,” said David Rupprecht.

The problem is the lack of integrity protection: data packets are transmitted encrypted between the mobile phone and the base station, which protects the data against eavesdropping.

However, it is possible to modify the exchanged data packets.

“We don’t know what is where in the data packet, but we can trigger errors by changing bits from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0,” said Rupprecht.

By provoking such errors in the encrypted data packets, the researchers can make a mobile phone and the base station decrypt or encrypt messages.

They not only can convert the encrypted data traffic between the mobile phone and the base station into plain text, but also send commands to the mobile phone, which are then encrypted and forwarded to the provider — such as a purchase command for a subscription.

The researchers from Bochum used so-called software-defined radios for the attacks.

These devices enable them to relay the communication between mobile phone and base station.

Thus, they trick the mobile phone to assume that the software-defined radio is the benign base station; to the real network, in turn, it looks as if the software-defined radio was the mobile phone.

For a successful attack, the attacker must be in the vicinity of the victim’s mobile phone, said the researchers.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/42f81q/article30901124.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24NETHACKER,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/scientists-spot-4g-bug-that-can-help-hackers-impersonate-you/article30901125.ece
38,2020/02/24,"At Ashoka University, an art exercise for mental health","Organisations and individuals come together to facilitate a workshop around students’ mental health, culminating in a piece of art

Sahil Balmiki’s poem talks about how it isn’t easy to stand up for oneself, especially if you have to fight your own shadows. It goes on to say that other people feel he’s nothing, but he can’t believe them, and so is on a journey to find himself.

Balmiki, 18, is a student of Ashoka University on a full scholarship. He moved with his family from Kolkata to Delhi for his education and for better prospects. His parents, both unwell, are unable to work, and his brother, who works in a shop in Chandni Chowk, is the sole earning member. “I had a lot of problems. Academically, I didn’t do well. I come from a different background and culture [compared to the others in the university], and I didn’t participate in class,” he says.

Balmiki and eight other students from diverse income groups, genders, and nationality in Ashoka, were a part of a residential project of self-exploration and inner work across five days, led by Arvinder Singh, a psychotherapist. The workshop was initiated by Red Balloon that does creatively-led immersive leadership programmes with students.

As a culmination to the workshop, the students designed an installation titled Moving Out to Go Within that was pieced together by Sumant Jayakrishnan, a designer who works with scenography and installations, and who is a mentor in Red Balloon.

The work, designed as a circular structure, about 28 feet in diameter and 12 feet tall, has an outer shell of acrylic, wood and glass, held together by metal. Printed on the outer panels are writings by students that they did towards the end of the workshop. A viewer can enter the structure, the centre of which is a sort of totem pole topped with a brass eagle and rainbow-hued strings flowing out from it.

Around the poleare nine inner panels, each of which moves on its individual axis. The panels are framed outlines that the students drew of one other. The students then took their own bodymaps and did self-portraits, filling them with little bits and baubles, a representation of how they saw their inner worlds and their aspirational selves. Balmiki’s was the most colourful. Another student, grappling with body image issues, depicted herself with a crop top to show her aspiration of wearing one, and the sense of freedom she’d have from doing so.

“We weren’t looking for skills or creativity,” says Samar Singh Jodha, the founder of Red Balloon. The hope was to help the young adults look past drawing and painting, and get into a “space where they could present their own voices.”

The process of how the piece of interactive art came about is set out in an album beside the installation. When the students saw the completed work that they’d conceptualised, they were delighted. “I felt it [the installation] was mine. It had been a beautiful journey — a life-changing one,” says Balmiki.

The journey itself came about as a chain of communication, with Jodha reaching out to Jayakrishnan, who in turn spoke to Singh. She had been his therapist when he’d suffered depression and anxiety, and he’d benefited from sessions with her. “A lot of what you experience at my age (he recently turned 50) goes back to when you were young,” he says, referring to events in childhood that can have an impact later in life.

The workshop that Singh conceptualised revolved around mental health, with each day dedicated to a few activities. “There were exercises on fear for instance — what it is, how to deal with it and ways of navigating through it. There was mask-making, journaling, painting messages on T-shirts, and mirror-imaging which taught empathy,” says Singh.

All of these brought out the students’ pain, thoughts, and aspirations, while empowering them with choices.

“Restorying your story to restore your empowered self,” is the way she sees it. One reflective exercise involved the students asking themselves: ‘How are you?’ Balmiki says he broke down at this and cried for a while.

Jayakrishnan, who was involved in some parts of the process, had conversations through sessions with the students to understand their ideas for the installation. He helped weave the ideas together, with some being putting to a vote. “The core idea came from them,” he says, recalling that they went through several before they settled on this, as they held each other in a tightly knit circle. “Ideas ranged from the petals of a flower to fire and an eagle, which made it to the final design, and actually holds it all together,” he says, adding that a number of the students’ stories resonated with him.

The installation that will be taken to Ashoka University in April, is a symbol of acknowledging mental health and its significance in building leaders who will show the way through self-awareness and empathy. There’ll be a week long mental health awareness week in the university, where these nine students will lead the discussion. Balmiki says he is now able to participate in class without feeling the pressure of being ‘different’.

39,2020/02/24,How to avoid boredom?,"We need to remain connected with things around us and feel alive

A friend, senior to me in age and retired from an active work life, was lamenting on how, not having much to do, he was bored with life.

Listening to him, I was reminded of what my friend Ram once mentioned to me.

Apparently, India’s erstwhile Prime Minister, the late Indira Gandhi, in what is believed to have been her last interview, was asked by Peter Ustinov, the famous actor, who was interviewing her, ‘how she always seemed fresh and alive?’ She responded by telling Ustinov, she appeared so because ‘she was never bored’.

Little things as well as larger issues always kindled her curiosity.

She is purported to have said that she ‘loves life and all it offers; animals, birds, politics, books and everything interests her’. She therefore, is never bored.

While the quote has stayed with me, its apparent message became significant when my friend spoke of his boredom.

As I slow down and pull away from the frenetic life I have lived so far, I realise that what I need is to continue to find purpose and meaning in whatever I do.

A quote that more recently has made me wake up to this possibility says ‘do not ask the world what it needs from you, ask yourself what you need to feel alive, then go get it, for what the world needs is people who are alive’.

Agua members meet regularly over events related to self-love, poetry and so on. “Chennai is a place of tremendous empathy so we can actually do a lot with the resources we have,” says Pandian. A single mother since her early 20s, Pandian says juggling a demanding corporate career, while raising a child, has given her a different appreciation for women.

A Six Sigma Master Blackbelt certified training professional, Pandian’s career in the corporate space opened her up to the Joy of Giving month, that served as an inspiration to Agua’s toy drive — Gifting Smiles. “In 2019, we bought over 3000 gifts with the ₹60,000 we collected. Little ones in the Royapuram slum colony received the gifts, and we also sent six gift boxes to the Kalpakkam fishermen community,” explains Pandian. Feeding Souls is another initiative, started by Subha and her daughter Subiksha, that has members cooking food and feeding stray dogs in their neighbourhoods. It is conducted on a monthly basis on OMR.

The collective also supports survivors of domestic abuse. “I was spiralling down a labyrinth when I suffered third-degree burns on 50% of my body at the age of 22. At Agua, we share our poetry and pain with each other and pitch in whenever anyone needs help,” says Shrinanda Sengupta, a member of the core team.

Branched out

Agua has a number of subsets. For instance, Agua Professionals seeks to bring leadership programmes to professionals in the group, and gives first-time entrepreneurs a space to talk about their business, while Agua Next Gen, goes to colleges, for seminars on self-confidence. Agua Campus to Corporate, takes the same programme to tier 2 and tier 3 cities within Tamil Nadu. Agua Cause takes up social problems and engages in pro bono work in the community — contributing to local food banks, environmental cleanup initiatives or helping local women stand on their feet.

Road to safety During emergency, pressing the SOS button on the home page of Kavalan SOS app will automatically send the current location of the person in trouble along with a video to the Kavalan team. Within a minute, the team will contact the person. Simultaneously, the location will be sent to pre-registered emergency contacts as SMS alerts. Staff in the control room, which is manned by a private firm, receive a message and pass it on to police officers. The police locate the nearest patrol vehicle, police officer or police station to reach out to the victim. The call centre staff also alert close relatives or family members if numbers are available.

Subha explains, “We rented a small space in Semmencheri in 2013, where we identified women from lower-income groups and helped them start small businesses by buying them sewing machines and wet grinders. We help put their children through college, if they evince an interest and their grades are consistent.” Women’s safety is also an important ping on Agua’s radar. They also promote conversations about consent and abuse, especially among young adults. “We formed small focus groups and worked with mental health professionals to curate content for a session at Standard Chartered,” says Pandian.

Pandian also promotes the Mahila Police Volunteer programme, a pilot programme by Tamil Nadu police, set up in Chennai and Salem, to form a network of female volunteers in each zone. Their mandate is to report incidences of violence faced by women in private and public spaces. In March, the collective will conduct a session on women’s safety, wherein the Kavalan SOS police app will be a focal point, and a krav maga workshop will enlist self-defence techniques.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/q27tj2/article30903147.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23mpselflovegroupeventjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/this-chennai-based-womens-collective-hosts-events-related-to-self-love-and-poetry/article30903148.ece

Addressing the ‘Namaste Trump’ event in Ahmedabad in the presence of visiting U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India-U.S. relations were no longer just “a partnership, but a far greater and closer relationship”.

“There is so much that we share: shared values and ideals, shared spirit of enterprise and innovation, shared opportunities and challenges, shared hopes and aspirations,” he said.

Mr. Modi opened the mega event with chants of ‘long live India-U.S. friendship”.

“You [Mr. Trump] are heartily welcome in the largest democracy of the world. This is Gujarat, but the entire country is enthusiastic in welcoming you. I think, today, we can see history being repeated. Five months back I started my U.S. trip with ‘Howdy Modi’ and today my friend President Donald Trump is starting his Indian trip with ‘Namaste Trump’ here in Ahmedabad,” Mr. Modi said amid cheers from approximately one lakh people assembled at the newly built stadium in Ahmedabad.

Mr. Modi talked about the growing ties between India and the U.S. in a range of sectors and lauded the Trump administration for it.

Mr. Trump’s maiden visit to India and that too starting from Mr. Modi’s home State Gujarat afforded the Prime Minister a rare opportunity to display his bonhomie with the President.

Mr. Modi, who received the President at the Ahmedabad airport on Monday, gave the President six hugs during the action-packed trip in Ahmedabad.

Before the stadium event, Mr. Modi received the U.S. President at the airport and from there, they headed to Mahatma Gandhi’s Sabarmati Ashram. In the visitor’s book, Mr. Trump wrote: “To my great friend Prime Minister Modi - Thank You for this wonderful visit!” Interestingly, Mr. Trump did not write anything about Mahatma Gandhi at the ashram.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/wcqkf/article30906863.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Trump-Modi-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/its-a-far-greater-closer-relationship-says-modi/article30906859.ece

Fresh clashes broke out between anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protesters and police in the Jamalpur area of Aligarh early on Monday. Hundreds of women came out on the street to protest against police action in the Upper Court area on Sunday afternoon. Police tried to persuade them to return, but around 3 a.m. there was stone pelting from protesters following which police resorted to lathi charge and firing of tear gas shells, said Additional District Magistrate (City) Rakesh Malpani.

Around 20 civilians and half dozen policemen were injured. The old city remained tense on Monday. Ten FIRs have been lodged in connection with the Sunday clashes.

Bullet injury

On the bullet injury to a youth during Sunday clashes, Senior Superintendent of Police Muniraj G said Tanvir Munawwar could have been hit by the bullet fired by the miscreants. “Police only used anti-riots guns. It seems both the communities indulged in cross-firing. We are scanning CCTV images.” He clarified that the police did not detain anybody. “The Station House Officer, Kotwali, was with his family in the jeep when rumour spread that some persons have been detained from the protest site. The women protesters rushed towards the jeep and resorted to stone pelting, damaging a police vehicle. Police had to resort to lathi-charge and firing from anti-riot guns.”

He said the administration had problem with the protest in Shah Jamal Idgah. “They should not block the road. Also, the area near Kotwali has a mixed population and could lead to communal tension,” he said.

Haris Khan, Medical Superintendent, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, said, Tanvir’s condition was stable but not out of danger.

AMU statement

On District Magistrate Chandra Bhushan Singh’s statement on the alleged role of some AMU girl students in instigating the protesters in the Shah Jamal area, Shafey Kidwai, AMU spokesperson, said the district administration had not given any specific names. “Some students live in the old city area. Their mere presence at the protest site could not be termed illegal.

43,2020/02/24,"Identify policemen who caned students at Aligarh Muslim University, says Allahabad HC","The case pertains to “police excesses” during anti-CAA protest

The Allahabad High Court on Monday directed the Uttar Pradesh police chief to identify policemen and those of the Provincial Armed Constabulary seen in CCTV footage “damaging motorcyles and unnecessarily caning the apprehended students” of the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU).

The case pertains to the protests at the AMU against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

“The police force should be sensitised and special training modules prepared to inculcate professionalism in the personnel while handling such situations,” the court observed.

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Samit Gopal passed the order on the recommendations of the National Human Rights Commission. The court last month directed the NHRC to conduct an investigation into the allegations of police brutality at the AMU. The order was passed on a public interest litigation petition filed by Aman Khan.

On Monday, the court asked the Director-General of the CRPF to identify Rapid Action Force men who were allegedly involved in incidents of violence and excesses. “The RAF, a specialised force set up to deal with riots and handle law and order situations, should show utmost professionalism in such crisis situations, while respecting the human rights of civilians.”

The court directed the Chief Secretary to provide compensation to six students, commensurate with their injuries, on humanitarian grounds.

It also directed the Director-General of Police to make sure that the Special Investigation Team probed the case on merit and in a time-bound manner.

Another recommendation made by the NHRC was to direct the AMU Vice-Chancellor and its Registrar to establish a line of communication with students so that they were not “influenced by outsiders and rusticated unruly students”.

44,2020/02/24,Kisan Samman Nidhi target lowered to 12 crore,"Kisan Samman Nidhi will cover only 12 crore people; Centre urges West Bengal to join scheme and Bihar to expedite process.

One year after the launch of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, the Centre has revised the farmer income support scheme’s beneficiary target down to just under 12 crore from 14 crore.

In fact, empirical evidence suggests that saturation level will reach around 10 crore families. So far, almost 8.5 crore farmers have benefited.

Speaking at an event to mark the first anniversary, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar pointed to West Bengal and Bihar as the major culprits for the lag. While the West Bengal government has refused to join the scheme at all, the Bihar government’s approach of waiting for applicants means more than 60% of potential beneficiaries are yet to register.

The scheme, which gives land-owning farmer families an annual sum of ₹6,000, was launched in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, and new registrations have slowed after the election.

The Centre’s beneficiary estimate of 14 crore was initially based on the number of landholdings recorded in the agricultural land census.

The revised estimate of 11.97 crore is based on the 9.84 crore who have registered themselves on the portal so far (although only 8.45 crore have received money so far), plus an estimated 2.13 crore beneficiaries left out, mostly from West Bengal and Bihar. However, “empirical evidence suggests that saturation level will reach around 10 crore farmer families,” according to a presentation made at the event.

‘No reply from Bengal’

Mr. Tomar pointed out that of West Bengal’s 70 lakh farmers, 10 lakh have already self-registered through an online process. However, they cannot receive the cash benefit until the database is verified by the State government, he said.

“Central government officials have approached the State government about this many times and I have also written to the Chief Minister twice, urging the State to join the scheme. But we have not received any reply as yet,” Mr. Tomar said, pointing out the State’s economy would stand to benefit with a potential annual payout of ₹4,000 crore if all the State’s farmers registered themselves for the scheme.

In Bihar, the potential beneficiaries number 158 lakh. However, only 59.7 lakh farmers have uploaded their data on the PM-KISAN portal so far. “The State has adopted a beneficiary application-based approach, which is delaying identification and upload,” said the presentation.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6tm5rw/article30906605.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THFARMERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kisan-samman-nidhi-target-lowered-to-12-crore/article30906606.ece
45,2020/02/24,"Energy could replace Defence as the strongest link in India-U.S. relations, say experts","It is likely to replace defence as vital link, amid rising American oil imports

Energy deals are expected to be a key part of discussions between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday, with talks over increasing India’s imports of U.S. oil and gas, a clean energy deal including an MoU on building pipeline infrastructure for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) between American oil company ExxonMobil, gas transportation technology company Chart Industries and PSU Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL). However, a much-publicised agreement for Indian PSU Petronet to invest $2.5 billion in American LNG Company Tellurian will not be ready for signing, company officials said.

On Monday, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan met with the U.S. Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette to talk about the upcoming agreements. “We jointly reviewed the ongoing Strategic Energy Partnership between our two countries and agreed to take it to the next level,” Mr. Pradhan said in a tweet. In a speech last year, Mr. Pradhan had said that India’s energy imports from the U.S. would reach $10 billion this year.

In 2019, India increased its intake of oil from the U.S. to about 1,84,000 barrels per day (bpd) which was four times more than in 2018, and up from zero imports just four years ago. Some of the increase is due to the fact that India had to slash imports from Iran and Venezuela under threat of sanctions from the U.S., but officials say the U.S. has tried to compensate by subsidising U.S. oil transportation costs. India is now the world’s third largest oil importer, and it is estimated that every $1 change in the price of oil internationally has a $1 billion dollar impact on India’s energy bill.

“This is an area for growth. The U.S. has helped us diversify our energy sources by dealing with gulf countries, increasing its supply of energy so as to keep the price of oil under control,” said a senior official involved in the visit.

Business leaders also say that oil and gas is gaining salience in the relationship.

“Energy will soon take over from Defence as the strongest link in the Indo-U.S. relationship,” said President and CEO of the U.S. India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) Mukesh Aghi, who hosted Mr. Pradhan and Mr. Brouillette for an energy roundtable on Monday. However, he warned that the U.S. would not continue to subsidise oil transport and logistical costs for India, and that India would have to “scale up” its imports in order to make up the difference.

The Tellurian deal for future LNG imports will not be ready for an agreement during the visit, said a spokesperson. Tellurian’s top leadership Chairman Charif Souki and president and CEO Meg Gentle are in Delhi to “progress the discussions with Petronet and have had some crucial meetings toward that end”, Tellurian spokesperson Joi Lecznar confirmed to The Hindu, adding that they are “working to finalise” the agreement documentation by the end of March as they had committed in their MoU signed last September.

On Tuesday, several business chambers will host an India-U.S. business summit on Tuesday, which will discuss boosting Indian exports, the energy partnership, and defence collaborations with the U.S., which will be addressed by Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Mr. Pradhan and Mr. Brouillette. While a trade deal that has been negotiated for nearly two years, is not expected to be finalised during the Trump-Modi talks, given the absence of U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer from the delegation, some suggest the presence of Mr. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is credited with pushing through trade negotiations with China to a Phase-one deal, and the US-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA), may also play a role in nudging the India-U.S. trade talks to a conclusion as well.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/zd1tt0/article30906522.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THPRADHAN-NEW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/energy-could-replace-defence-as-the-strongest-link-in-india-us-relations-say-experts/article30906523.ece
46,2020/02/24,Trump wants to prise open Indian economy: CPI(M),"‘He is out to boost U.S. corporate interest for his re-election’

The Left parties have said the sole reason for U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit is to further exploit the Indian economy.

The CPI(M) Polit Bureau on Monday called upon Prime Minister Narendra Modi not to fall for the unilateral agenda of the U.S. “The singular intention of the U.S. administration is to further prise open Indian economy to boost the U.S. corporate interest, thus helping in Mr. Trump’s re-election bid,” it said.

The U.S. agenda, it said, was detrimental to the interests of Indian farmers, since the U.S. allowed its agribusiness to distort prices to out-compete local farmers in developing countries. Mr. Trump wanted India to remove the tariff barrier that served as a tool to protect the farmers, to ensure food security and pay out the minimum support price, it argued.

The party also accused Mr. Trump of targeting India’s health care sector and said the U.S. demanded that India remove the compulsory licensing for the benefit of its pharmaceutical corporations.

The Left parties, along with trade unions and students’ unions affiliated to them, came together under the banner of India Peace and Solidarity Organisation and staged a protest in New Delhi.

Addressing the protesters, CPI general secretary D. Raja said, “Mr. Trump is the most aggressive right-wing politician in the world today. In the name of America First, his government has been imposing imperialistic, hegemonic policies on the world. At a time when American economy is in a big crisis, the Trump administration is looking for new markets. One of the prime targets is India.”

Defence sales and cooperation featured prominently in the speeches of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and United States President Donald Trump at the Namaste Trump event in Ahmedabad on Monday. While announcing that defence deals worth around $3 billion would be signed during his visit, Mr. Trump offered a range of high-tech defence equipment to India.

“As we continue to build our defence cooperation, the U.S. looks forward to providing India with some of the best and most feared military equipment on the planet. We make the greatest weapons ever made. Airplanes, missiles, rockets, ships.... we make the best and we’re dealing now with India. But this includes advanced air-defence systems and armed and unarmed aerial vehicles,” Mr. Trump said as Prime Minister Modi looked on. “Tomorrow our representatives will sign deals to sell over $3 billion in the absolute finest state-of-the-art military helicopters and other equipment to the Indian armed forces,” he said.

The deals are for 24 MH-60R Multi-Role Helicopters for the Navy worth $2.2 billion and six AH-64E Apache attack helicopters for the Army worth $800 million. The two deals were approved by the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) last week.

Long pending proposals

The other big ticket deals in the pipeline are for armed drones, air defence system, MK-45 127mm naval guns and six more P-8I long range maritime patrol aircraft among others. While these are at various stages of procurement, the U.S. State Department has recently notified the sale of an air defence system to Delhi in a deal worth $1.8 billion.

As reported by The Hindu, the long pending proposal to procure armed Predator drones from the U.S. for the three Services is back on the table and the Qualitative Requirements (QR) are currently being finalised. Several of these deals got a push after India signed the foundational agreement, Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA), in 2018 which officials had stated on several occasions was essential to sell some of the high end equipment.

Military exercise

Referring to the first tri-Service military exercise Tiger Triumph between the armed forces of India and the U.S. last year, Mr. Trump said the partnership took a major step forward with it. “It [the exercise] was something to behold,” he said.

Mr. Trump, accompanied by his wife, daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, arrived here from Ahmedabad.

The Taj Mahal, built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal who died in 1631, has been refurbished for the visit.

The U.S. President’s visit to Agra and Taj has generated huge excitement among local residents. Some shops have even displayed their own banners, welcoming Mr. Trump to India.

Mr. Trump also took to Twitter to express his sentiments about his first official visit to India, which began with a visit to Ahmedabad.

“First lady and I have travelled 8,000 miles around the world to give a message to each citizen of this country — America loves India, America respects India, and the people of America will always be true and committed friends of the people of India,” the American leader tweeted in Hindi.

From the Kheria airbase here, Mr. Trump’s convoy of over 30 vehicles drove to Oberoi Amarvilas hotel near the Taj Mahal complex, as over 15,000 school students who lined up both sides of the route held U.S. and India flags and cheered the U.S. President as his motorcade passed by.

Massive billboards bearing greeting messages and pictures of Mr. Trump, First Lady and Prime Minister Narendra Modi dotted the nearly 13-km convoy route as street roundabouts decked up with U.S. and India flags symbolised the U.S.-India friendship.

3-layer security

An extensive three-layer security was in place and authorities had got the Taj Mahal premises cleared of visitors by noon, hours ahead of Mr. Trump’s visit to the celebrated architectural landmark.

Mr. Trump and the First Lady enjoyed the view of the marble marvel in the evening as a cool breeze added to the pleasant weather.

They also posed for pictures for photographers.

The last U.S. President to visit the Mughal-era wonder was Bill Clinton who had come to India in 2000. He had seen the Taj along with daughter Chelsea Clinton.

In 1959, then U.S. President David Dwight Eisenhower had visited Taj along with then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.

Agra had waited excitedly to welcome President Trump and authorities made arrangements to present a “lively Agra” to the visiting President, seeking to shake off the old tag of ‘city of ghosts’.

“During Mr. Clinton’s visit the city streets were deserted due to security arrangements, prompting him to call it a ‘city of ghosts’. This time the excitement can be felt in the air,” said Mohit Kumar, who works at a hotel in Tajganj area.

“I was very young in 2000 when Mr. Clinton visited. We are very excited and happy that another U.S. President has come to our city due to which the civic amenities have been improved,” he said.

Festive ambience

On his arrival at the airbase, over 250 artists drawn from different parts of Uttar Pradesh performed ‘Mayur dance’, ‘Rai folk dance’, ‘Dhobia folk dance’ as sonorous sounds of ‘bumrasia’ nagada, dholak, mridang, added to the festive ambience.

A giant billboard there featuring Mr. Trump, Ms. Melania and Prime Minister Modi greeted the couple with a message — ‘Grand welcome of India’s best friend to the City of Love — Agra.’

Mr. Trump was received at the Kheria airbase by Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.

“From the airport, the U.S. President’s convoy travelled till the Oberoi Amarvilas hotel situated near the East Gate of the Taj Mahal complex. From there the President and his family and members of the high-level delegation accompanying him moved into eco-friendly golf carts to travel into the monument premises,” a senior official said.

49,2020/02/24,Dissent against govt is not anti-national: Justice Gupta,"‘A political party getting 51% mandate in the polls did not mean the other 49% of the country ought to remain silent for the next five years’

A dissenter is not an anti-national. Holding a contrary view to that of the government does not make one an anti-national, Supreme Court judge Justice Deepak Gupta said on Monday.

“Criticism of the executive, the judiciary, the bureaucracy or the armed forces cannot be termed ‘anti-national’. In case we attempt to stifle criticism of the institutions, we shall become a police state instead of a democracy....To question, to challenge, to verify, to ask for accountability from the government is the right of every citizen...”, he said.

Justice Gupta’s speech at a lecture organised by the Supreme Court Bar Association on 'Democracy and Dissent' received standing ovation.

Justice Gupta red-flagged the hike in sedition cases against activists, lawyers and students and branding voices of dissent as “anti-nationals”. Expressing dissent to government's policies did not amount to acting against the nation.

“There have been many recent incidents where people dissenting have been slapped with terms like anti national... Majoritarianism is an anti-thesis to democracy... ”, he said.

A political party getting 51% mandate in the polls did not mean the other 49% of the country ought to remain silent for the next five years. “When those in power claim that they represent the will of all the people that is more often than not a totally baseless claim. They may be the elected government voted on the first-past-the-post system by a large number of voters, but it cannot be said that they represent the entire will of the people”, Justice Gupta said.

The judge said the superior courts were “protectors of the rights of the people and have a duty to ensure that the powers that be do not suppress dissent”.

Judge’s praise for PM

Justice Gupta's words are significant in the background of the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in various parts of the country, most prominently in Shaheen Bagh in Delhi. The Shaheen Bagh case is before the Supreme Court. These observations on the right to dissent by Justice Gupta come shortly after Justice Arun Mishra paid accolades to the “versatile genius” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to “think globally and act locally” at an international judges conference on Saturday.

Justice Gupta said governance did not mean carrying out the whims of a few, but following the rule of law. The government was not always right. Citizens have the right to come together, protest and dissent peacefully.

“Dissent is a human right. A society will not evolve unless its rules are questioned. Dissent must be encouraged. It is only through discussion that we can strive to run the country better. The government has no right to stifle a protest unless it turns violent. Dissent, after all, was the essence of Civil Disobedience movement of Mahatma Gandhi... We are only a free country when there is freedom of speech”, Justice Gupta said.

He highlighted how dissent had been a powerful tool in the hands of judges. He referred to how Justice H.R. Khanna sacrificed his Chief Justiceship to write his historic dissent championing the right to personal liberty in the ADM Jabalpur case.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3wbgev/article30905494.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DeepakGupta,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dissent-against-govt-is-not-anti-national-justice-gupta/article30905477.ece

The Congress on Monday questioned the ‘silence’ of Home Minister Amit Shah over the clashes in Delhi and demanded his resignation, as party leader Rahul Gandhi urged people to show restraint, compassion and understanding irrespective of the provocation.

The party also blamed the Delhi police for failing to maintain law and order in the city and criticised Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for having “shaken off his responsibility”, saying people of Delhi are paying the price of a political blame game.

Mr. Gandhi said peaceful protests are a sign of a healthy democracy, but violence can never be justified.

“The violence today in Delhi is disturbing and must be unequivocally condemned. Peaceful protests are a sign of a healthy democracy, but violence can never be justified. I urge the citizens of Delhi to show restraint, compassion and understanding no matter what the provocation,” he tweeted.

Clashes broke out between groups supporting and opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in northeast Delhi’s Jaffrabad and Maujpur on Monday, with protesters torching houses, shops and vehicles, and hurling stones at each other.

A Delhi Police head constable was killed and a deputy commissioner of police injured in the violence.

51,2020/02/24,CBI books Tamil Nadu-based NGO and others for FCRA violation,"Case registered on a complaint from the Union Home Ministry’s FCRA wing

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has booked Tamil Nadu-based Caruna Bal Vikas (CBV), Adhane Management Consultants, Bentinck Higher Secondary School and others for alleged violations of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA).

The case has been registered on a complaint from the Union Home Ministry’s FCRA wing, which alleges that CBV, a non-government organisation, used a part of its foreign receipts for religious activities. It had received funds from Compassion International, United States, during the check period.

‘Converting children’

“Further, CBV has, inter alia, declared its long-term objective of ‘converting poor children into fulfilled Christian adults’, and thus engaged in religious activities, including conversions to Christianity. Such activities have potential to disturb communal harmony and, therefore, are in violation of the Section 12(4)(f)(vi) of the FCRA, 2010,” the First Information Report (FIR) alleged.

According to the Income-Tax Department’s report, the FIR said, CBV used only 10% of its foreign contributions for the stated purposes, while the remaining funds were diverted to 300 NGOs in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and other States. Some NGOs were not FCRA registered, the FIR said.

Listing the alleged violations, the FIR stated that CBV transferred about ₹1 crore to the non-FCRA registered Bentinck High Secondary School during 2011-14.

I-T Dept. report

The I-T Department report “also mentions diversion of funds for conversion activities to NGOs owing allegiance to the Methodist Church, Baptist Church, Salvation Army, Christian Missionary Society and Indian Pentecostal Church, which is in violation of its charter of service to children”.

After CBV came under the I-T Department’s scanner in 2013, it is alleged that Adhane Management Consultants was set up in July 2014 “to mislead the authorities”. The CEO and directors of CBV and and the company were the same, and the two entities shared the same registered address in Chennai’s Anna Nagar East, the FIR said.

Funding shifted

After Adhane Management Consultants was registered, funding from Compassion International, U.S., which was earlier channelled through CBV, was shifted almost entirely to the company.

CBV received only ₹6.75 crore in 2014-15, as against ₹109.50 crore in 2011-12, ₹130.52 crore in 2012-13 and ₹111.71 crore in 2013-14. The company received ₹6.75 crore in foreign contributions from Compassion International, U.S., allegedly without prior permission.

“The CBI may also investigate whether the activities of these entities also attract the provisions of other penal laws....for having diverted the funds for personal benefit of the office bearer or any other individual,” the FCRA wing said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cbi-books-tamil-nadu-based-ngo-and-others-for-fcra-violation/article30904965.ece
52,2020/02/24,Twitterati surprised over Donald Trump not mentioning Mahatma Gandhi in visitors' book,"In the visitors’ book at Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad, Mr. Trump wrote, “To my great friend Prime Minister Modi. Thank you for this wonderful visit.”

A lot of eyeballs were raised on Twitter and many people expressed surprise as the U.S. President Donald Trump left a message in the visitors’ book at Sabarmati Ashram without any mention of Mahatma Gandhi.

In the book, Mr. Trump wrote, “To my great friend Prime Minister Modi. Thank you for this wonderful visit.”

Mr. Trump, who reached Ahmedabad on Monday for the first leg of his India tour, visited the Ashram along with wife Melania minutes after he landed in Ahmedabad.

After noticing no mention of Mahatma Gandhi in the message by Mr. Trump, netizens took to Twitter, comparing his note with that of the former U.S. President Barack Obama.

When Mr. Obama visited the Mani Bhavan – where Gandhi used to stay while in Mumbai – in south Mumbai in 2010, his note in the visitors’ book read: “I am filled with hope and inspiration as I have the privilege to view this testament to Gandhi’s life. He is a hero not just to India but to the world.”

Five years later, in January 2015, after visiting the Raj Ghat in Delhi, Mr. Obama wrote, “What Dr. Martin Luther King Jr said then remains true today. The spirit of Gandhi is very much alive in India today. And it remains a great gift to the world. May we always live in the spirit of love and peace among all people and nations.”

Congress leader Manish Tewari tweeted: And this is what @barackobama had to say about the Great Mahatma possibly at Rajghat or Sabarmati. The distinction can not be more stark.”

Another Twitter user Martin Joseph (@martinjmsw1) tweeted about Mr. Trump’s hand writing.

54,2020/02/24,India requests U.K. museum for ancient idol stolen from Tamil Nadu temple,"The statue of Saint Tirumankai Alvar was acquired by the Ashmolean Museum at the University of Oxford from the Sotheby’s auction house in 1967

India has made a formal request for the return of a 15th century bronze idol of a Tamil saint believed to be stolen from a temple in Tamil Nadu and currently at a U.K. museum at Oxford University after it was sold to it during an auction.

The statue of Saint Tirumankai Alvar was acquired by the Ashmolean Museum at the University of Oxford from the Sotheby’s auction house in 1967, from the collection of a collector named J.R. Belmont (1886-1981).

The museum said it was alerted to the origins of the ancient statue by an independent researcher in November last year, following which it alerted the Indian High Commission.

“Research in the photo archives of the IFP-EFEO [Institut Francais de Pondichery and the Ecole francaise d’Extreme-Orient] appears to show the same bronze in the temple of Shri Soundarrajaperumal Kovil in Tamil Nadu in 1957,” a statement from the Ashmolean Museum said on Monday.

“The Ashmolean was informed that the bronze is one of a number of bronzes in collections in Europe and the United States identified by this researcher through the IFP-EFEO archive,” the statement said.

Although there was no claim against the object, the museum officially brought the matter to the attention of the Indian High Commission on December 16 last year, requesting further information, including possible police records, that would help them establish the work’s provenance.

“We were open to holding further discussions around the possible repatriation of the sculpture,” the museum said.

Indian High Commissioner in the U.K. Ruchi Ghanashyam acknowledged the “proactive” move of the museum soon after and the matter was forwarded to the Indian authorities for follow up, with a formal request for the restitution of the idol sent to the museum earlier this month.

“In our request, we have stated that the police report furnished by the idol wing unambiguously shows that the original idol as is found in the IFP archives has been stolen and replaced with a fake one and that the stolen idol is the same one that is presently with the Ashmolean,” said Rahul Nangare, First Secretary (Trade) at the Indian High Commission in London.

“After we provided the police report along with the formal request for restitution, Ashmolean have informed that they are now carrying out further due diligence with an official [from Ashmolean] also scheduled to visit India shortly. We have requested them to expedite the same so that the final decision is taken at the earliest,” he said.

The museum, which holds some of the world’s most famous art and archaeology artefacts, said it acquired the statue in “good faith” in 1967.

“We currently have no indication of how the bronze entered his [Belmont] collection and we are continuing to investigate with the support of the Indian High Commission,” the museum said.

There have been a number of instances of stolen Indian artefacts being restored from the U.K. to India, most recently in August last year when a limestone carved relief sculpture, originating from Andhra Pradesh, and a Navaneetha Krishna bronze sculpture originating from 17th century Tamil Nadu, were handed over to the Indian High Commissioner to the U.K., following a joint U.S.-U.K. investigation involving Scotland Yard’s Art and Antiques Unit.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-requests-uk-museum-for-ancient-idol-stolen-from-tamil-nadu-temple/article30903704.ece

56,2020/02/24,"Trump calls Modi a ‘true friend’, lavishes praise on PM","“We will seal defence deals worth $3 billion on Tuesday,” said Mr. Trump.

U.S. President Donald Trump, on his maiden two-day visit to India on Monday, heaped praise on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling him a “true friend”, and said his rise from a humble background from being a tea-seller to being India’s Prime Minister “underscores India’s limitless promise”.

The U.S. President also described Mr. Modi as a “tremendously successful leader.”

Mr. Trump’s lavish praise while addressing a mammoth crowd at the Motera Stadium in Gujarat reflected the bonhomie shared by the two leaders.

“Prime Minister Modi, you are not just the pride of Gujarat. You are a living proof that with hard work and devotion Indians can accomplish anything, anything at all, anything they want,” Mr. Trump said, amid loud cheers from the audience at the mega “Namaste Trump” event.

Democracy, diversity

In his long speech sprinkled with praise for not only Mr. Modi but also for India’s democracy, pluralism and diversity, Mr. Trump highlighted the country’s achievements and what its democracy offers to citizens.

“The story of the Indian nation is a tale of astounding progress, a miracle of democracy, extraordinary diversity, and above all, you noble people. India gives hope to all of humanity. In just 70 years, India has become an economic giant, one of the largest democracies ever to exist and one of the most amazing nations anywhere in the world,” President Trump said.

On his maiden visit, Mr Trump was accompanied by his family including the First Lady Melania Trump, daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, both senior advisors to the President.

Calling India an economic giant, the U.S. President, who seeks greater access to India’s markets, said, “Since the turn of the century, the size of the Indian economy has grown over six times in size. In a single decade, India has lifted over 270 million people out of poverty.”

He then went on to mention flagship schemes and programmes of the Modi administration and said, “Under Prime Minister Modi, for the first time, every village in India has access to electricity. 320 million more Indians are right now connected to the Internet. The pace of highway constructions has more than doubled, over 70 million more households... have access to cooking fuel, 600 million more people have access to basic sanitation and incredibly, 12 Indian citizens are lifted out of extreme poverty every single minute of every single day.”

He added that India will soon be home to the biggest middle class anywhere in the world, and within less than 10 years, “extreme poverty in your country is projected to completely disappear”.

While lauding India and its democracy and its rule of law, President Trump in a subtle way made a contrast with China and said, “There is all the difference in the world between a country that seeks to claim power through coercion, intimidation, and aggression, and a country that seeks to grow by setting its people free, and unleashing them to chase their dreams, and that is India.”

“This is why, India’s accomplishment in the last 70 years is completely unrivalled, no matter where you go. Your faith in the strength of a free society, your confidence in your people, your trust in your own citizens, and your respect for the dignity of every person, is what makes India and United States such a natural, enduring friendship,” Mr Trump said.

A common enemy

According to President Trump, both U.S. and India face the common enemy that is radical Islamic terrorism which has hurt both nations.

“The United States and India are also firmly united in their iron-clad resolve to defend its citizens from the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. Both of our countries have been hurt by the pain and turmoil of terrorism and that terrorism brings,” he said, adding that his administration has unleashed the full power of the American military on the IS in Iraq and in Syria.

“Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100% destroyed, and the monster known as Al Baghdadi, the founder and leader of ISIS is dead,” he said.

He added that the U.S. would always welcome newcomers who share common values and love for people and stressed that U.S. borders will always be closed to terrorists and any form of extremism from anywhere.

He sought to defend his administration’s contentious move to screen immigrants and said that the US would continue to screen and vet the applications for entry to ensure that anyone who threatens US citizens would pay a “very, very big, costly price.”

“Every nation has the right to secure and controlled borders. The United States and India are committed to working together to stop terrorists, and fight their ideology,” said the President, whose statement on securing borders is likely go down well with the Indian government, which has amended its citizenship law to exclude Muslims from neighbouring countries from seeking India’s citizenship.

Trade deal coming

According to him, India and U.S. have common interests on trade and held that both countries will have a “big trade deal” without elaborating on differences that have cropped up between the two countries on economic and business front.

“Over the course of my visit, Prime Minister Modi and I will also discuss our efforts to expand the economic ties between our two countries. We will be making very, very major — among the biggest ever made — trade deals. We are in the early stages of discussion for an incredible trade agreement to reduce barriers of investment between the United States and India and I am optimistic that working together the Prime Minister and I can reach a fantastic deal that’s good and even great for both of our countries — except that he is a very tough negotiator.”

The US President claimed that after he took over, commerce between the two countries has increased by 40%. “Since my inauguration, commerce between our two nations has increased by more than 40 per cent. India is now a major market for American exports and the United States is India’s largest export market,” he said, adding that a booming America is a great thing for India.

Talking about his administration’s pro business measures, he said that the US under him has proven that the best way to attract jobs and opportunities is to reduce burdens on business, knock down barriers to new investment, and eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy and red tape regulation and taxes.

Space exploration

President Trump praised India’s rapid strides in space explorations and said that US and India would seek to expand partnership and cooperation into space exploration.

“The United States and India are also working closely together on the future of space exploration. You are making impressive strides with your exciting Chandrayaan lunar mission. It is moving along rapidly far ahead of schedule and America looks forward to for expanding our space cooperation with India. As you push even further you are pushing the limits and that’s a great thing, including in the realm of human space flight,” he added.

Authorities at the Archaeological Survey of India had “advanced the dates” for mud-pack treatment for the graves of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan and wife Mumtaz Mahal at Taj Mahal in view of U.S. President Donald Trump’s planned visit to the famed mausoleum on Monday, an official said.

The 17th Century monument to love, built over a period of nearly 20 years by Shah Jahan in memory of his wife after her death in 1631, is being refurbished to welcome the American leader and U.S. First Lady Melania Trump.

“The red sandstones of the Taj complex are being cleaned of stains from weather, fountains have been spruced up and extra stock of shimmering flowers added in gardens to enhance the glory of the monument,” ASI Agra Circle Superintending Archaeologist Vasant Swarnkar said.

The ASI official said the world heritage site was also getting ready to welcome Trump just like Agra was being decked up for his visit on Monday evening.

“We have already done the mud-pack treatment of the two royal graves. It is done with ‘multani mitti’ and takes a couple of days,” Swarnkar told PTI. “After the treatment, it is cleaned with distilled water. It was done in the last few days.”

Asked if the special treatment was being given after a long time, he said such works were carried out regularly and its date was due in coming time.

“But, we pre-poned the mud-pack dates keeping in view the visit of the U.S. president,” the official said.

Swarnkar said the Taj Mahal would be closed to visitors in the second half of the day, adding the tickets would be issued till 11.30 a.m. and it will be cleared of visitors by noon.

According to Agra District Magistrate Prabhu N. Singh, Trump is scheduled to arrive at the Taj Mahal at 5.15 p.m. on Monday and will spend about an hour at the complex.

“From the airport, the U.S. President’s convoy will travel till the Oberoi Amarvilas hotel situated near the East Gate of the Taj Mahal complex.

“From there, the President and his family, and members of the high-level delegation accompanying him will move into eco-friendly golf carts to travel into the monument premises,” Singh said, adding about 20 golf carts would ferry them.

As per Supreme Court directions, petrol or diesel-operated vehicles are not permitted within 500 metres of the Taj Mahal’s gate.

The architectural marvel, which entered the UNESCO World Heritage Site list in 1983, is made of white ‘makrana’ marble and red sandstones, and renowned for its intricate inlay work on the stone surface.

Asked if the chandelier above the graves had also been refurbished, he said: “Yes, we did refurbish it.”

Taj Mahal, considered one of the seven wonders of the world, stands on the bank of Yamuna and is always high on the itinerary of visiting heads of state.

In 2015, then U.S. President Barack Obama was scheduled to visit the monument during his India visit. It is said he could not do so due to security reasons.

In 2000, President Bill Clinton and his daughter Chelsea Clinton had paid a visit to the famed monument.

In all, the Taj Mahal covers an area of 60 bighas and the terrain gradually sloped from south to north towards the Yamuna in the form of descending terraces.

The monument has some wonderful specimens of polychrome inlay art both in the interior and exterior on the dados, on cenotaphs and on the marble jhajjhari (jali-screen) around them, according to the ASI.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/76fims/article30902229.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TAJMAHAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/trumps-taj-visit-royal-graves-get-mud-pack-chandelier-refurbished/article30902231.ece

U.S. President Donald Trump and his wife Melania on Monday paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi at Sabarmati Ashram, which was home to Mahatma Gandhi between 1917 and 1930 during India’s freedom struggle.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who reached the ashram a few minutes earlier, showed Trump and the U.S. First Lady ‘Hriday Kunj’, a room inside the ashram where Gandhiji and his wife Kasturba lived.

Modi explained the importance of this place in India’s freedom struggle.

During the visit, Trump and Melania also tried their hands on the khadi spinning wheel, also known as charkha.

Melania also helped Trump in weaving khadi on charkha.

Before leaving, Trump wrote a message in the visitors’ book of the ashram.

“To my great friend Prime Minister Modi - Thank you for this wonderful visit,” wrote Trump and signed the message.

It was also signed by Melania.

The Trumps were in the ashram for around 15 minutes.

Modi also presented “Three Wise Monkeys,” a larger version of the one belonging to Mahatma Gandhi, as a memento to the U.S. president.

Trump and Modi then resumed their roadshow till Motera stadium.

Ashram trustee Kartikeya Sarabhai, who welcomed Trump and Melania with a khadi stole, told reporters later that the Trumps told him how much they enjoyed their visit to the ashram.

“They said the place gave them a sense of peace. They said they understood the symbolism of this place. The Central government gifted them a statue of Gandhiji’s Three Monkeys, conveying the message of speak no evil, see no evil, hear no evil,” Sarabhai said.

60,2020/02/24,"Shared values between India-U.S. are discrimination, bigotry, hostility towards refugees: Amnesty","Amnesty International hit out at the Indian government over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act , saying it legitimises discrimination based on religious grounds

The shared values between India and the U.S. are “discrimination, bigotry, and hostility towards refugees and asylum seekers”, Amnesty International USA said in a joint statement with Amnesty International India ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to India on Monday.

Trump, accompanied by his wife Melania, daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as senior officials of his administration, landed in Ahmedabad on the first leg of his two-day visit to India.

“Anti-Muslim sentiment permeates the policies of both U.S. and Indian leaders. For decades, the U.S.-India relationship was anchored by claims of shared values of human rights and human dignity. Now, those shared values are discrimination, bigotry, and hostility towards refugees and asylum seekers, Margaret Huang, Amnesty International USA’s executive director, was quoted as saying in the statement.

It added that Amnesty International USA’s researchers travelled to Lebanon and Jordan to conduct nearly 50 interviews with refugees that as a result of the previous version of the ban have been stranded in countries where they face restrictive policies, increasingly hostile environments, and lack the same rights as permanent residents or citizens.

The statement also came down hard on the Indian government, hitting out at the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) 2019 and saying it legitimises discrimination based on religious grounds.

It criticised statements such as identify them (the protestors) by their clothes or shoot the traitors by Prime Minister Modi and his party workers. Such remarks “peddled the narrative of fear and division that has fuelled further violence”, it said.

The internet and political lockdown in Kashmir has lasted for months and the enactment of CAA and the crackdown on protests has shown a leadership that is lacking empathy and a willingness to engage.

No Congress leader will attend the official banquet, hosted by President Ram Nath Kovind, in honour of United States President Donald Trump on Tuesday, party sources said on Monday

Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad as well as Lok Sabha Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury were invited by President Kovind.

The Congress, however, decided to give the event a complete miss as Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who also heads the Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP), was not on the guest list.

The official banquet is the only engagement that Opposition leaders were to have with Mr. Trump during his two-day visit.

So far, U.S. officials have not contacted the Congress for any one-on-one meeting between Mr. Trump and Ms. Gandhi.

Congress sources claimed that Mr Azad thanked President Kovind for the invitation but decided to skip the event to protest against Ms. Gandhi’s exclusion.

Mr. Chowdhury said the Government of India should have insisted with the U.S. authorities to follow the ‘time-honoured principle’.

He told The Hindu that the decision to skip the banquet was a ‘personal’ one. He objected to Congress leaders being left out of Monday’s ‘Namaste Trump’ event in Ahmedabad.

“When the ‘Howdy Modi’ event took place in Houston, both Democrats and Republicans were invited. Why have the Opposition leaders been left out in Ahmedabad,” he asked.

“It’s been a time-honoured tradition that when visiting dignitaries come, meetings with Opposition leaders take place. When the UPA was there and former President Barack Obama visited, he met with Opposition leaders,” Mr. Chowdhury noted.

On Friday, the Congress described Mr. Trump’s visit as an important step in India-U.S. strategic relationship but its success would be measured by its outcomes.

Deputy Leader of the Congress in the Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma had said India should raise its concerns over the withdrawal of General System of Preference status to India, reduction in H1B visas and settlement of social security deposits made by Indian professionals in the U.S.

“This visit should not become an extension of the U.S. presidential campaign for the Indian diaspora. We do not become active party in the elections in another country. This mistake was made in Texas at the ‘Howdy Modi’ event and the Prime Minister ought to be careful as these are setting wrong precedents,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/b9ftma/article30890466.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MANMOHANSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/trump-visit-former-pm-manmohan-singh-to-attend-official-banquet-on-tuesday/article30901627.ece
62,2020/02/24,Shaheen Bagh interlocutors file report in Supreme Court,"‘We will list the case for hearing day after tomorrow’, says Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul

Supreme Court-appointed interlocutors senior advocate Sanjay Hegde and Sadhana Ramachandran on Monday handed over a report of their four-day endeavour to coax Shaheen Bagh protesters to shift their agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) to an alternative site, conveniently out of the way of traffic and public movement.

A Bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and K.M. Joseph took the yellow-enveloped reports proferred by the interlocutors in the courtroom. “We will go through the report. We will list the case for hearing day after tomorrow,” Justice Kaul said.

The court refused to give a copy of the report to petitioner-advocate Amit Sahni. “We are not even putting it [report] on record... Let’s go through it first,” Justice Kaul said.

On February 17, the Supreme Court upheld the fundamental right of mothers, children and ordinary people of Shaheen Bagh and Delhi to protest against the CAA but expressed its concern over their blocking public areas such as roads to voice their discontent.

“Democracy works on different views. We have no quibble on that. You want to protest, no problem. You don’t want to wait for our judgment on the validity of the CAA but want to have a social build-up against the legislation, we have no problem... We do not mind if a 1,000 sites are created, but our limited concern is whether you could protest without blocking roads and entering public areas... With every right there comes a responsibility too,” Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul had observed.

The court appointed the interlocutors in order to convey its apprehension to the protesters and suggest them to move to an area where they could continue with the protests without causing inconvenience to free movement. It also left it open for advocate Tasneem Ahmadi to talk to former bureaucrat and intervenor Wajahat Habibullah and even take up the court’s apprehensions about prolonged blockade at Shaheen Bagh with the protesters.

“The law [CAA] has been enacted by the Parliament and is facing constitutional challenge before this Court, but that by itself will not take away the right to protest of the persons who feel aggrieved by the legislation. However, the question is where and how protest can carry on without public ways being blocked. Our concern is more than this matter alone, as there may be persons of different points of view who may tomorrow seek to emulate this protest, such scenario only leads to chaotic situation. This must cease on public ways everywhere,” the court order on February 17 said.

Habibullah’s affidavit

A fresh affidavit filed by Mr. Habibullah in the court alleged that the police had barricaded numerous number of roads with no connection to the peaceful protests at the Shaheen Bagh.

He submitted that “Shaheen Bagh stands tall as a firm example of a peaceful, dignified dissent, more so, in the face of various instances of State-sponsored violence on similar dissents across India”.

His affidavit said, “We have been sad and mute witnesses to police brutality and negative typecasting of a particular community across the country. Crushing dissent instead of entering into a dialogue is the new norm, but it is alien to our Constitution”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dr26ug/article30901497.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHAHEENBAGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/shaheen-bagh-protests-court-appointed-interlocutors-file-report-in-sealed-cover-in-sc/article30901499.ece
63,2020/02/24,Namaste Trump: U.S. President arrives in Ahmedabad,"U.S. President Donald Trump arrived in Ahmedabad on Monday for the first leg of his India trip. The Air Force One plane carrying Trump and his wife Melania landed at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel international airport here at 11.37 am, officials said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who reached Ahmedabad over an hour before Trump did, was present at the airport to welcome the U.S. President at the airport.

In Ahmedabad, Trump will visit Mahatma Gandhi’s Sabarmati Ashram, take part in a roadshow with Modi and jointly address over one lakh people at a cricket stadium, before heading for Agra to see the iconic Taj Mahal with Melania.

Trump, who is also accompanied by daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner and top brass of his administration, will get a taste of India’s cultural melange during his high- optics Gujarat itinerary, after the bonhomie between the two leaders at the ‘Howdy, Modi!’ event in Houston last year.

The U.S. President and Modi will participate in a roadshow from the airport to Sabarmti Ashram and from there to the newly-built Motera cricket stadium, where over a lakh people are expected to be present for the ‘Namaste Trump’ event.

Dance groups and singers from different parts of the country will be performing on stages that are dotting the 22- km route of the ‘India roadshow’ in the city. Huge billboards of the two leaders and replicas of historic places in Gujarat have also been placed along the roads where people will greet the two leaders.

Over 10,000 police personnel, besides officials of the United States Secret Service, and personnel of the National Security Guards (NSG) and the Special Protection Group (SPG) have been deployed for the high profile visit.

Modi will accompany Trump to the Sabarmati Ashram, which was home to Mahatma Gandhi from 1917-1930 during India’s freedom struggle.

Ashram secretary Amrut Modi said Trump will spend 15 minutes at the place.

“Trump will visit the ‘Hriday Kunj’ If he wishes, he will spin a charkha (spinning wheel). We will also gift him a coffee-table book, and a book containing 150 quotations of Gandhi,” the Ashram official said.

Hriday Kunj is a room on the Ashram premises where Mahatma Gandhi and his wife Kasturba Gandhi had lived for 12 years between 1918 and 1930.

The official said the U.S. President would be briefed about Gandhiji and the importance of charkha as a symbol of self-reliance. There will be a cultural extravaganza at the Motera stadium during the ‘Namaste Trump’ event, where Trump and Modi will address the gathering.

Bollywood singer Kailash Kher and some Gujarati folk singers will perform at the stadium, officials of the Gujarat Cricket Association said.

Students of various government and private schools have also been roped in to perform at cultural events and they have been practicing for days, an official said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dj502q/article30901389.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bbc87ce5-9566-4a77-998b-cdd7349b6c15jfif,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/namaste-trump-us-president-arrives-in-ahmedabad/article30901388.ece
64,2020/02/24,"Battle against CAA, NRC, NPR to be long one: Harsh Mander","It is not a battle being fought by Muslims alone, says the social activist

Noted social activist Harsh Mander said the battle ahead against Citizenship Amendment Act, National Register of Citizens and National Population Register will be long, although the Hindu-Muslim unity on the street against the trinity is unprecedented.

“There is no categorical assurance from the government that they would not implement NRC while they are going ahead with NPR. The previous NPR conducted was never linked to NRC. Also we did not have the experience of Assam. Following implementation of NRC in Assam, everybody became aware about danger of whole process. The trinity of CAA, NPR and NRC is causing anxiety,” said Mr. Mander while addressing an intellectual meet here on Sunday.

“The CAA by itself has many problems. For the first time, a law is making distinction on basis of religious identity,” he said

To a question on some media portraying that only Muslims were in forefront of movement, Mr. Mander said, “this is not true. Most of the universities in India are not Muslim-dominated. But non-Muslim students are giving leadership to movement.”

“Muslims women gathering at protest rallies like that of Sahinbagh indicates that the Muslim community is battered. They are coming out to assert themselves. But the space in the protests being held frequently across the country is occupied by non-Muslims. Solidarity is being expressed through participation of non-Muslims,” said the activist who has been travelling across India non-stop for past two months.

“In mega rallies, about 70% to 80% are Muslims while rest 20% is non-Muslims. Since Mahatma Gandhi’s last fast, for the first time people in so many numbers are coming out for Hindu-Muslim unity. It is not a battle being fought centrally by Muslims,” he observed.

Stating that it was not Muslims who are going to be affected by the trinity, Mr. Mander said. “we have seen in Assam how much suffering the NRC has caused. Finding decades-old documents in a country which is notorious for absence of documentation is extremely difficult.”

“Poor people in Assam suffered for six to seven years without doing much productive works. They have sold their properties and run after officers and lawyers. If it happens in entire country, it will affect poor, dalits and tribals. We have urban poor, de-notified tribes, disabled people, single women and transgender,” he pointed out.

“There will be massive level of corruption if NRC takes place. Demonetisation is a very small suffering compared to this is going to unleash,” said Mr. Mander.

“We will have to fight till the provisions from the law are taken out. Till that happens, fear, uncertainty and disenchantment would not go. We have to fight for substantive citizenship whereas there is attempt to take away our right to be in the country. The battle is not going to be easy one. BJP and RSS are strongly ideologically based organisations. But for all on the street, there is a battle to fight to save the constitutions,” said the social activist.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/battle-against-caa-nrc-npr-to-be-long-one-harsh-mander/article30898404.ece
65,2020/02/24,"Melania visit: No objection to Delhi CM’s presence, says US Embassy spokesperson","U.S. Embassy clarifies on First Lady’s visit to a Delhi government school

On the eve of U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump’s arrival in the Capital, the U.S. Embassy said it had “no objection” to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia’s presence at a Delhi government school, which the First Lady is scheduled to visit here on Tuesday.

A U.S. Embassy spokesperson further said that the Embassy appreciates their “recognition” that it was “not a political event,” with a specific focus on children. According to PMO sources, no Chief Minister is part of the Trump visit.

While the Gujarat Chief Minister is not part of the roadshow, the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister is not part of the Taj visit. Besides, PMO sources said, the matter was the prerogative of the U.S. Embassy.

‘Big appreciation’

The Delhi government, in an official response issued on Sunday evening, termed the First Lady’s visit to a Delhi government school a matter of “big appreciation” and said it respected “concerns” expressed by the U.S. Embassy regarding the Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister accompanying her.

“While the U.S. embassy had no objection to the presence of the Chief Minister and the Deputy Chief Minister, we appreciate their recognition that this is not a political event and that it is best to ensure the focus is on education, the school, and the students,” a U.S. Embassy spokesperson in New Delhi said.

According to Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government officials, the U.S. Embassy had, on Thursday, reached out to them with regard to the First Lady’s wish to see the flagship ‘Happiness Curriculum’ in practice at a city school on Tuesday and was to convey the schedule regarding it on Saturday only to be told that neither the Chief Minister nor the Deputy Chief Minister would be part of the delegation receiving her.

Mr. Kejriwal and Mr. Sisodia, in his capacity as the Education Minister, were to be part of the event and scheduled to make a presentation on the initiative, which was launched by the Dalai Lama in July 2018, to the First Lady.

“It is a matter of great pride for the Delhi government, Delhi government teachers and students that honourable first lady Mrs. Melania Trump is visiting a Delhi Government school. It is a big appreciation for us that the work of AAP government in education sector, especially Happiness classes, is being recognised in the world,” Mr. Sisodia said in an official statement.

Moral teachings

The Happiness Curriculum focuses on meditation, moral teachings, and mental exercises, with the aim of turning students into “good human beings“ and is taught to all students of Delhi government schools from nursery to class VIII.

The Chief Minister and the Education Minister, the statement said further, “would have loved to personally receive” the First Lady at the Dehi government school and brief her about the concept of Happiness Classes and the “positive impact that it has had on students, during her visit to the classrooms.”

“However, certain concerns were expressed by the U.S. Embassy regarding Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister accompanying the honourable first lady during the school visit. We respect the same. We welcome honourable first lady wholeheartedly and will do our best to facilitate the tour,” the statement added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mhqbfi/article30898228.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE24MELANIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/melania-visit-no-objection-to-delhi-cms-presence-says-us-embassy-spokesperson/article30898229.ece
66,2020/02/24,Highway threatens tiger territory in Arunachal Pradesh,"A 692-km road through the Pakke Reserve has been cleared

After cutting through the Namdapha National Park, India’s easternmost tiger reserve, a new highway project has been cleared through yet another big cat reserve in Arunachal Pradesh.

Documents received in response to an RTI inquiry by Seijosa-based green activist Tana Jorjo Tara reveal that the BJP government in the State plans to build a 692.7 km highway through the 862 sq km Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) in East Kameng district.

The administrative office of the PTR is in Seijosa, a sub-divisional headquarters situated by the Pakhui or Pakke River.

Named the East-West Industrial Corridor, the highway aims to connect Bhairabhunda in West Kameng district and Manmao in Changlang district along Arunachal Pradesh’s border with Assam. The project makes no mention of compensation for people likely to be displaced.

What has set alarm bells ringing for environmentalists is a 40-km elevated stretch through the heart of the PTR as advised by a Gujarat-based firm. A high-powered committee, headed the State Assembly Speaker P.D. Sona, had on February 5 approved the detailed project report for the elevated section, estimated to cost ₹2,550 crore.

“Elevation is no guarantee against felling of trees and disturbing wildlife in the sensitive PTR. This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too,” Mr. Tara told The Hindu on Sunday.

He said the proposed highway had been realigned to bisect PTR after the NHPC turned down the original proposal to let the corridor pass near its hydroelectric project on the Subansiri River, east of Seijosa.

“I have survived seven attacks for fighting cases against illegal logging since 2016. I won’t give up until the government finds an acceptable alternative [route],” Mr. Tara said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8xti9l/article30896796.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THTIGER2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/highway-threatens-tiger-territory-in-arunachal-pradesh/article30896798.ece
67,2020/02/24,"TDP targeting govt. out of frustration, says Jagan","‘It is unable to digest the positive impact of welfare schemes on people’

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Monday alleged that the Telugu Desam Party has been indulging in mud-slinging on the government as it is afraid that people will forget its leader N. Chandrababu Naidu with the government implementing a slew of welfare schemes, including Amma Vodi and Rythu Bharosa. He said the TDP was unable to digest the remarkable change in the lives of people.

Mr. Jagan launched the ‘Jagananna Vasathi Deevena’ scheme aimed at helping polytechnic and degree students for which the government will spend ₹2,300 crore, at Ayodhya Maidan here.

He said only 23 % students in Andhra Pradesh were continuing studies after Intermediate. In contrast, it was 81 % in countries such as Russia. He hoped that the impact of ‘Vasathi Deevena’ would be felt soon with the gross enrolment picking up.

“The real wealth for youngsters is education and that is the reason we are make huge allocations for schemes. The amount directly credited into the accounts of mothers will also ensure women empowerment,” he said.

‘Artificial agitations’

Turning to politics, the Chief Minister said he was “fighting with demons” which were trying to show his government in poor light by organising agitations over issues such as the three-capital proposal, English medium education and enhancement of seats in local bodies. There was no truth in the allegation that industries were moving out of the State, he added.

Deputy Chief Minister Pamula Pushpa Srivani, Ministers Botcha Satyanarayana and P.Viswharoop thanked the Chief Minister for announcing schemes with people’s welfare at heart.

Vizianagaram MLA Kolagatla Veerabhadra Swamy urged the Chief Minister to allocate funds for the completion of pending projects.

Earlier, Mr. Jagan patted Class VI student for Abhimanyu for speaking in fluent English about government schemes.

After the public meeting, the Chief Minister inaugurated the Disha police station at the Cantonment police grounds.

Director-General of Police Gowtam Sawang and Vizianagaram Superintendent of Police B. Raja Kumari explained the facilities created in the police station.

68,2020/02/24,"Man gets death for rape, murder of 6-year-old","The incident happened in November last in a Chittoor village

The First Additional District Court in Chittoor on Monday awarded the death sentence to accused Mohammad Rafi (27) in the sensational rape and murder of a six-year-old-girl. The incident took place on the night of November 6 at a function hall at Angallu village, near Madanapalle.

Mohammad Rafi, a resident of Angallu village working as a lorry cleaner, abducted the girl from the function hall luring her with some eatables, sexually assaulted her and strangled her to death before throwing her body into a 30-foot ditch.

On complaint from the parents, the Madanapalle police launched a search around the function hall. The CC camera footage showed Rafi taking away the girl. On November 7, the girl’s body was found in the ditch nearby.

After getting vital clues from some locals in Angallu village, the police formed a 100-member team and finally arrested Rafi near Madanapalle after 10 days, after laying a trap for him, when he escaped to Chhattisgarh. The incident led to widespread protests all over the district and elsewhere in the State.

Charge sheet in 17 days

The Madanapalle police filed the charge sheet within 17 days of Rafi’s arrest under the POCSO Act, and produced him before the First Additional District Court. Statements of 41 witnesses were recorded. The accused was brought to the court twice in February. Within 90 days of filing of the charge sheet, the trial was completed, and the verdict announced.

Additional Public Prosecutor Lokanatha Reddy told the media that it was the first case under the POCSO Act in Chittoor district to be awarded the death sentence.

Judge Venkata Harinath said the date pertaining to the execution of the hanging of Rafi would be announced by the Andhra Pradesh High Court. Earlier, Rafi had pleaded with the judge that he was innocent, and that he had to look after his parents, wife and children.

SP Senthil Kumar appreciated Deputy SP Ravi Manohar Achari and his team for completing the charge sheet procedures in record 17 days.

Meanwhile, the family members of the victim paid homage to her portrait at their residence in their village, and hailed the Madanapalle police and Chittoor court for doing them justice in a record time.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/man-gets-death-for-rape-murder-of-6-year-old/article30907053.ece
69,2020/02/24,CPI(M) opposes move to sign MoU with U.S. over nuclear reactor,"Party leader urges Centre to protect the country’s security

Demanding dropping of nuclear power plant proposed by Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL) at Kovvada in Srikakulam district, CPI (M) State Secretariat member Ch. Narsinga Rao on Monday said United States President Donald Trump was on a visit to India to pursue supply of reactor to the plant, among other things.

He told reporters along with Greater Visakha unit president of CPI (M) B. Ganga Rao that the Government of India should be aware of the fact that Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner had ‘vested interest’ in the supply of the reactor to Kovvada plant.

Mr. Narsinga Rao said Westhouse company, which agreed to supply the reactor to Kovvada, had been acquired by Brookfield Asset Management, an investment company in which Qatar Investment Authority is a major stakeholder.

The CPI (M) leader said Mr. Kushner was an investor in Qatar Investment Authority.

Mr. Trump might be keen on proceeding with the MoU on Kovvada, he alleged and asked the Centre to protect the country’s security by rejecting America’s plea to supply the rector to NPCIL.

He said originally nuclear power plant was proposed at Mithivirdi in Gujarat and due to public protest, it was later decided to set up the plant at Kovvada. He said the Kovvada plant would be expensive and unviable and banks funding it were bound to turn bankrupt.

Mr. Rao said former Union Power secretary E.A.S. Sarma had also strongly opposed the move to sign MoU with the US for supply of six reactors for Kovvada from the erstwhile Westinghouse company.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cpim-opposes-move-to-sign-mou-with-us-over-nuclear-reactor/article30906879.ece
70,2020/02/24,"Won’t be cowed downby threats, says Naidu","Former Chief Minister calls Jagan ‘Tughlaq’

Former Chief Minister and TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu has reiterated the party’s commitment to fight for the cause of ‘Amaravati as one and only capital’ and to stand by the people to counter what he called ‘the betrayal’ of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy.

Participating in the party’s ‘Praja Chaitanya Yatra’ at Kuppam, the constituency which he represents, on Monday, Mr. Naidu said that he would not be cowed down by the threats of the YSRCP leaders in his mission for Amaravati. Terming Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy as ‘Tughlaq’, Mr. Naidu said that it was ridiculous that for the first time in the world, he (Jagan Mohan Reddy) resorted to the three-capital move.

Mr. Naidu said that the YSRCP leaders were spreading Pulivendula-mark rowdism in the State, and leading physical attacks and forcing false police cases against the TDP activists and leaders. “I know how to fight. I am not a coward like Jagan Mohan Reddy,” he said.

The TDP chief said that when the daughter of Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy was demanding for a CBI inquiry into her father’s death, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy was making move against it, though he too had demanded for CBI inquiry before the elections.

Mr. Naidu deplored that the YSRCP government had betrayed the people by watering down the TDP government’s schemes, including Anna Canteens.

Referring to the incident of burning his effigy at Dravidian University at Kuppam recently, Mr. Naidu said that if he would prompt his cadres to retaliate, it would be difficult for the government to control them. “Both Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy and Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy undertook ‘padayatras’ during my regime as Chief Minister, but we never stooped to the level of creating hurdles to them,” he said.

Mild tension

Earlier, mild tension prevailed at 7th Mile Junction near Shantipuram mandal headquarters in the afternoon, when some YSRCP cadres tried to block the convoy of Mr. Naidu. The TDP cadres rushed to the spot, and entered into heated argument with them. The police intervened and pacified both groups.

According to a release, the IAL extended its full support to the people's opposition to such ‘projects’ and called upon all patriotic citizens to participate in the peaceful movement to save the nation.

Further, the IAL stressed the need for the people to strive to reclaim the Republic, saying that no patriotic Indian could afford to remain a bystander as attempts were made to subvert the Constitution.

73,2020/02/24,YSR Cong. MP allegesTDP hand in attack,"The alleged incident took place near the temple town of Amaravathi

Bapatla MP Nandigama Suresh has alleged that he along with other YSRCP leaders were assaulted by TDP activists disguised as protesters, at Lemalle village in Amaravathi late on Sunday night.

Tension prevailed at the temple town after two groups clashed after the rathotsavam at the Amareswara Swamy temple in Amaravathi. The Joint Action Committee of Amaravati alleged that followers of the MP had assaulted the protesters, but the claim was refuted by Mr. Suresh.

The MP told media persons at the party central office on Monday that he along with party leader Lella Appireddy were returning to Guntur after attending the rathotsavam, when they were stopped by a group of slogan-shouting protesters. He then boarded the car of Mr. Appireddy. While he was trying to get back into his car at Lemalle, a group of ten women sprayed chilli powder on him. “They attacked my driver and personal security,” he alleged.

“I believe that those who took part in the attack are not from the region, they were hired by the TDP. I think they were following me in a bus right from the time I started from my residence. I am being targeted as I am a Dalit,’’ said Mr. Suresh.

The MP, who is from Uddarandyunivaripalem village, was given the ticket from Bapatla, and won over by a majority of more than 35,000. Mr. Suresh had earlier alleged that he was subjected to harassment by the police when the TDP was in power after being implicated in a case relating to torching of banana plantations in the Capital region.

Collector talks tough

Meanwhile, Collector and District Magistrate I. Samuel Ananda Kumar said stringent action would be taken against those who are trying to intimidate public representatives or obstruct public servants from discharging their duties.

Mr. Samuel Ananda Kumar told media persons here that some protesters were trying to force public representatives to express support to them and warned that such elements would not be spared.

“We urge all those who are agitating to do so in a peaceful manner. It has come to our notice that some protesters tried to manhandle an MP. If such protests continue, we will explore the possibility of imposing prohibitory orders in the region,’’ said the Collector.

Aurobindo Pharma Limited urged Srikakulam district administration to ensure peaceful work atmosphere in and around the factory located at Pydibhimavaram while alleging that the trade unions were trying to create industrial unrest in spite of payment of salaries and wages promptly with the directive of the Labour Department.

In a press release on Monday, the company’s spokesperson and Deputy General Manager (Industrial Relations and Administration) N. Venkata Rao said that IFTU and CITU leaders had differences and were organising protests frequently to prove their existence. “The management is unable to hold talks as both the unions claim majority. The company is paying minimum wages plus ₹100 per day for technicians and ₹90 per day extra for helpers. It is also helping the workers’ children with scholarships and other facilities,” said Mr. Venkata Rao.

‘Protest tomorrow’

Meanwhile, the CITU alleged that the management had failed to implement charter of demands for the last two years in spite of the direction from the Labour Department and protests from workers. He said that CITU would organise protest at the Srikakulam Collector's office on Wednesday and highlight the injustice meted out to the workers.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ensure-peaceful-atmosphere-around-factory-pharma-company-urges-officials/article30905313.ece

77,2020/02/24,HRF favours decentralisation,"The forum seeks a fair deal to Amaravati farmers

Members of the Human Rights Forum have termed the decision of the previous TDP government to establish the State capital in Amaravati as a disaster in the making. It has led to a slow death in the political economy of 29 villages earmarked for the capital. The farmers further woke up to a rude shock when the present government decided to reduce Amaravati into a legislative capital and it has created a new set of problems for them, according to K. Sudha, HRF State general secretary. The three-member team of HRF was speaking to a section of the media after a recent fact-finding tour to Amaravati.

“The forum is in principle in favour of decentralisation of development and governance and is of the firm belief that it helps, among other things, address the problem of regional imbalance that the State is confronted with time and again. In 2014 itself, we opposed setting up of the capital in Amaravati. But there have been reports of a special package to the local people from the present government, but there has been no official notification to that effect. For instance, it promised that pension for the landless poor families will be enhanced from ₹2,500 to ₹5,000, but they have not even been paid ₹2,500 for the past three months,” she said.

Forum State president U.G. Srinivasulu said that in the name of capital formation, the previous government managed to obtain lands from the dalits and other marginalised communities. People, who were earlier working their own fields began to be engaged in construction work after the capital region development started.

‘Ryots in distress’

“But soon after the formation of the present government, it cancelled the old contracts and did not enter into new ones. The local workforce thereby lost labour in the villages and have been left with no alternative but to seek work elsewhere. They even lost the rental income, due to this,” he said.

The forum strongly urged the government to rise to the occasion and bail out the people of the area who are under a lot of pressure.

It demanded that the government provide livelihood to the landless poor, build labour intensive small-scale and cottage industries, hand over cultivable land with immediate effect, restore cultivable land, engage the landless poor in such restoration work and in building of roads and a bridge on the Krishna river.

“The government must provide necessary infrastructure, take immediate short- term and long-term measures so as to restore the economy, peace and normalcy in that region,” said G. Rohith, HRF State executive committee member.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hrf-favours-decentralisation/article30904017.ece
78,2020/02/24,Indian Navy sailors booked for espionage leaked vital information to Pakistan: NIA,"The NIA, Naval Intelligence, A.P’s Counter Intelligence and Central intelligence agencies found bank transactions

The Indian Navy personnel, who were arrested on charges of passing information to a Pakistani handler, have reportedly leaked highly sensitive information of the Indian Navy to the Pakistan Intelligence Operatives (PIOs).

The National Investigation Agency (NIA), Naval Intelligence and the Counter Intelligence of the Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) so far arrested 13 sailors of different States on charges of espionage.

The agency found that huge amounts had been transferred to these Navy men who have passed on crucial information to PIOs. The agents are grilling the banks about why these suspicious transactions were not flagged and the concerned authorities alerted.

Operation Dolphin’s Nose

“We began the operation named ‘Dolphin Nose’ a few months ago and kept a vigil on the movements of suspects in Indian Navy of different bases, their mobile phones and social media contacts. More suspects are still under watch,” an investigation officer told The Hindu.

The arrested Navy personnel reportedly revealed the names of the ships and submarines, top level officers, routes they operate, details of other colleagues recruited recently from various naval bases. They also disclosed about some vital locations, movements of warships and submarines.

Money and honey-traps

“Through the Pakistani handler, who introduced himself as a businessman, the PIOs transferred huge amounts into the bank accounts of the arrested sailors. The young Navy personnel were honey-trapped by women through various social media groups and this has been happening for the last one year,” the investigation officer said.

NIA is probing into whether any terror groups were involved and the plan behind gathering this intelligence. The investigating agencies are checking if terror groups were planning to target the Indian Navy, or to carry out a major operation through the sea route.

Bank books and chats

The Naval Intelligence, NIA and the State and Central agencies, who collected the bank transactions and the chats between the sailors and the women reportedly arranged by the Pakistani handler, confirmed that the transactions were made repeatedly and are questioning the officials of the financial institutions in this regard.

“We have arrested 13 Navy personnel so far. Investigation agencies are trying to find out on with how many persons of the Navy, the Pakistani handler is in contact in the last one-and-a-half year, and how much vital information has been revealed. The PIOs developed relationship separately with the sailors and extracted key information from them,” the investigation officer said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mh0psu/article30634807.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-NIA-SUDERSHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/indian-navy-sailors-leaked-vital-info-to-pakistan/article30903584.ece

A 35-year-old woman Aruna, pushed her three daughters into an open well, and she too jumped into it near Pedda Kammavaripalli tank on Sunday evening. While those near the well could save Aruna, her seven-year-old daughter Chandana died at the Puttaparthi Government Hospital.

Aruna’s two elder daughters, Bhavya and Bhargavi - both eight years old - were still untraceable. Fire Services personnel, along with police officials were searching for the twin sisters at 11 p.m and their chances of survival appear very bleak.

Family dispute

Puttaparthi Deputy Superintendent of Police said Aruna was married to auto-driver Gurumurthy, and the cause for taking the extreme step was some difference of opinion between the couple.

Hailing from Dommari Gudiselu (ropedancers’ colony), Aruna had attempted to end her life in the past too, family members said.

81,2020/02/24,Release of ₹35 cr. sought for setting up pushkar ghats,"With the river festival seven months away, officials are told to start the work at the earliest

The district irrigation authorities have written to the higher authorities asking for a release of ₹34.9 crores for constructing ‘Pushkar Ghats’ for the Tungabhadra Pushkaralu scheduled to begin from November 20.

When the mega event was last held in 2008, the authorities had started constructing the ghats three months before the commencement of the fete. Keeping in mind the timeline, the irrigation officials have sent in a request to start the work at the earliest.

As per reports, a total of 21 locations have been identified for setting up the ghats, most of which fall on the banks of Tungabhadra river or the Kurnool-Cuddapah (KC) Canal. The most expensive ghat, costing around ₹5.6 crores, would be located a little downstream of Sunkesula Barrage, at Sunkesula village. The second most expensive one would come up at the old pump house in the city, costing ₹3.2 crores. Two more are proposed to be set up near the NH-44 and It would cost ₹3 crore each.

Speaking with The Hindu, an irrigation official said the district authorities wanted to have the ghats constructed at an expansive budget of ₹200-₹250 crores. However, with the State being debt-ridden, the authorities decided to step up pressure on the State treasury.

He said the authorities have only sent in the estimated costs as of now. Post receipt from the concerned officials, they would send in the detailed estimate for constructing the 21 ghats.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/release-of-35-cr-sought-for-setting-up-pushkar-ghats/article30898676.ece

The government will tap solar power in a big way to make the State power surplus, Energy Minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy said on Sunday.

He said the YSR Congress Party government had prepared an action plan to generate 10,000 MW of power from the renewable source of energy. This includes an installed solar power capacity of 2,000 MW in Prakasam district.

“The State government has chalked out a plan to attract ₹36,000 crore investments in the sector,” he said.

He was speaking after performing ‘bhoomi puja’ for an underground power cable system worth ₹56 crore. He was joined by his cabinet colleagues Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao and A.Suresh.

He accused the previous TDP government of mismanaging the power sector and saddling the power utilities with a debt of ₹30,000 to ₹40,000 crore. He, however, ruled out any power tariff hike, saying, “Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is very particular not to put financial burden on the common people.” The problem would be overcome by several cost-cutting measures including reducing power generation cost, he said.

83,2020/02/24,Dial 100 comes to the rescue of devotees stranded in forest,"They had ventured into it to attend Sivaratri festivities at a temple atop Veeranna Hill

The Valmikipuram police of Madanapalle division late on Saturday evening rescued a group of five devotees in the forests of Veeranna Hill. The devotees lost their way on downward journey, straying towards Madanapalle range.

The rescued included a 28-year-old woman, her 7-year-old son and three girls of the neighbourhood aged between 15 and 18.

According to information, the five persons of Gandhipeta in Valmikipuram mandal headquarters reached the temple of Lord Veerabhadra Swamy atop the hill on February 21 evening to take part in the Sivaratri festivities.

A far-flung temple

The temple turns into a devotional frenzy only on Sivaratri day, and remains desolate all year round, giving way to thick vegetation and wild grass, where all foot trails get obliterated.

After a night stay and lunch the next day (Saturday), they were on their return journey, when they chose a “short-cut route” suggested by a devotee to climb down the hill and lost their way.

They strayed far away into the thickets on the hillocks towards Madanapalle. With only a couple of hours left for the dusk to fall, they were a bundle of nerves.

But one in the group, Haritha (18), suggested that they use ‘Dial 100’ and seek help. When she made the distress call, information was passed on to Valmikipuram SI Venkateswarulu, who in turn alerted the station personnel. Soon, about half a dozen cops trekked the hillock, leading the search trail in four directions.

The rescue party traced the lost devotees at a valley point towards Madanapalle. All of them were brought to the police station at Valmikipuram. .

The woman said that the police personnel had reached them exactly at a time when the last drop of water in a bottle with them was spent. “After contacting Dial 100, we remained absolutely confident of the rescue and the fear had slowly left us,” Haritha said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/gcp0ob/article30898612.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24VJONGPAGE2DIAL100,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/dial-100-comes-to-the-rescue-of-devotees-stranded-in-forest/article30898613.ece

Drugs, lab equipment and furniture were reportedly lying unused in many Employees State Insurance (ESI) dispensaries and hospitals across the State. The Vigilance and Enforcement (V&E) officials were shocked to see ‘drugs in huge quantity lying unused in many hospitals’.

The V&E officials, who formed teams and investigated the alleged irregularities in the ESI Scheme, inspected the hospitals, dispensaries and diagnostic centres. They spent about three months verifying the records, indents, bills, stock registers and the payments made to different firms in the last five years and submitted a report to the government on their observations.

V&E officials interacted with the officers and staff and representatives of various firms who supplied medicines and material and recorded their statements. A few employees reportedly confessed doing undue favours to some companies and officers.

“The ESI officers and employees said that they awarded contracts to some companies based on the recommendations of two Ministers during TDP regime. The authorities paid some crores of rupees to the firms causing huge revenue loss to the government,” the V&E officials said.

Cartons untouched

Medicines worth crores of rupees were not despatched to the dispensaries and lab equipment and furniture were rusting in the storerooms. In some hospitals, drugs packed in cartons were not even opened for the last few years, they said.

“We found medicines packed in cartons in the ESI Hospital at Gunadala in Vijayawada. When asked about storage of drugs for a long period and consequent expiry of the medicines, the staff concerned couldn’t give a proper reply,” a vigilance officer said.

87,2020/02/24,Farmers undertake trek to Amaravathi temple,"‘Women accompanying us in vehicles were forced by police to walk three km’

On the 68th day of the ongoing protest by farmers of Amaravati region who want Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to drop the idea of shifting the capital to Visakhapatnam, they walked to the Amaralingeswara Swamy temple at Amaravathi town to take part in ‘rathotsavam.’

Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi Joint Action Committee (JAC) leaders said women proceeding towards Amaravathi in vehicles were stopped by the police on the way forcing them to cover the remaining 3 km distance by walk. “There is a belief that if you pull the ratham (chariot) on this day and make a wish, it will be fulfilled,” said a young farmer participating in the padayatra.

At Amaravathi temple, slogans of “Jai Amaravati” rent the air with a large number of farmers and their supporters gathering there.

JAC leader Srinivas said a farmer sustained a foot injury when farmers tried to stop the convoy of Bapatla MP Nandigama Suresh but he drove away without paying attention that his vehicle had hit a farmer.

Slogans, counter-slogans

At the Amaralingeswara temple, he said their slogans of “Jai Amaravati” were met with counter-slogans of “Jai Jagan” and “Jai Pulivendula.” Mr. Srinivas said fearing for the safety of women members, the venue of dharna was shifted to the statue of Dhyana Budha.

He said a bus of women members returning from here was again stopped at Lemalle by the MP’s supporters and that the farmers and JAC members had to rush to their rescue.

Meanwhile, women JAC members, drawn from different parties — P. Durga Bhavani ( CPI) , Sunkara Padma (Congress), Manasi (Lok Satta) and A. Sunitha (TDP) participated in a protest in one of the villages.

They said they would visit all 29 villages in the capital region to express solidarity with the protesting farmers and women.

Members of the Amaravati Parirakshana Yuvajana JAC participated in ‘Pedal for Capital”, a cycle rally from Chebrolu Hamumaiah grounds to Hindu College in Guntur demanding that the government withdraw the three-capital proposal.

89,2020/02/24,‘CM not getting an invite for banquet a non-issue’,"TDP making a mountain out of a molehill: Muttamsetti

Minister for Tourism and Sports Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao on Sunday asked the TDP not to make an issue out of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy not getting an invite for the banquet being hosted by the Rashtrapati Bhavan in honour of visiting U.S. President Donald Trump.

“It has become a habit for the TDP to make a mountain out of a molehill,” Mr. Srinivasa Rao said referring to the invitation extended to some Chief Minister, who included Telangana’s K. Chandrasekhar Rao.

“How will it be possible to extend an invitation to all the Chief Minister?” he asked.

The Minister was here to declare open the State-level kabaddi tournament and take part in the programme to launch works on the underground power cable network. His Cabinet colleagues Balineni Srinivasa Reddy and A. Suresh were present.

‘Disinformation campaign’

He accused the TDP of unleashing a disinformation campaign against decentralisation of the capital.

The YSRCP government was against capital-centric model of development in view of the adverse effects of the Hyderabad model on Seemandhra. Investments would be spread across the State, including Amaravati, to ensure decentralised development and ensure there were no demands for further division of the State in the future.

“What people of the drought-prone Prakasam district need the most is water and not capital, and this will be ensured by early completion of the Veligonda project,” the Minister said.

Insider trading

Denying any “political vengeance” behind the constitution of a Special Investigation team (SIT) to probe alleged insider trading in the purchase of lands in the Amaravati region, Mr. Srinivasa Rao asked the TDP leaders to come clean as the due process of the SIT filing cases after a thorough probe and courts deciding on the charges would be followed.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hethdb/article30897685.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24VJPAGE4MUTTAMSETTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cm-not-getting-an-invite-for-banquet-a-non-issue/article30897686.ece
90,2020/02/24,"Rainfall to increase over next 100 years, shows IISc paper","Climate model simulation shows role of water vapour in change in quantum of rainfall

Increasing temperatures result in increase in water vapour in the atmosphere, which causes an increase in the quantum of rainfall. This answers as to why the Indian monsoon rainfall increased from the last glacial maximum to the present.

With the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere going up, resulting in more water vapour, rainfall is expected to increase in the next 100 years.

The paper published in Nature, titled ‘Modulation of Indian monsoon by water vapor and cloud feedback over the past 22,000 years’ has been authored by Chetankumar Jalihal, Jayaraman Srinivasan, and Arindham Chakraborty from the Divecha Centre for Climate Change, Indian Institute of Science.

An excerpt of the paper states that over 22,000 years ago, the monsoon was around 3.3. mm/ day. It then increased to 6.6 mm/ day around 14,000 years ago, and then decreased to 6 mm/ day in the 20th century. The change in monsoon rainfall was attributed to changes in the amount of solar radiation incident on India during the summer monsoon. A simple climate model simulation showed, for the first time, the role of water vapour and clouds in amplifying the effect of solar radiation on monsoon rainfall. The concentration of carbon dioxide in atmosphere has increased from 180 ppm to 280 ppm over the last 22,000 years. This is one of the main causes for increase in water vapour, which has led to the doubling of monsoon rainfall.

Due to anthropogenic activities, the carbon dioxide increased by about 100 ppm in the last 100 years. It will increase further in the near future and the diagnostic model can be used to understand how rainfall will change, the excerpt read.

Prof. Srinivasan told The Hindu that the study was based on model simulation. “One of the major reasons for the variation in monsoon is the increase in water vapour due to increase in temperature. In the next 100 years, the water vapour is also likely to increase, which will result in increase in rainfall,” he said and added that to understand change in rainfall patterns, it was important to understand the past.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/d463ug/article30907008.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BGRAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/rainfall-to-increase-over-next-100-years-shows-iisc-paper/article30907009.ece

92,2020/02/24,Protests prevent lawyers from filing bail plea of three Kashmiri students,"They are set to approach High Court today

Despite tight security provided by the police as per the directions of the High Court of Karnataka, the Principal District and Sessions Court in Dharwad witnessed high drama on Monday following protests by local advocates, which prevented a seven-member team of lawyers from filing a bail petition for the three Kashmiri engineering students who have been booked for sedition.

They would now approach the High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday.

According to the counsel who had come to appear for the Kashmiri students from Bengaluru, Dharwad and Gadag, they were heckled continuously by the local lawyers. They claimed that stones were pelted at their cars too.

The three Kashmiri students have been remanded in judicial custody till March 2 and the Hubballi Bar Association had passed a resolution against any member of the Bar appearing on their behalf.

Speaking to The Hindu over telephone senior counsel B.T. Venkatesh, whose colleagues from Bengaluru had come to Dharwad along with two others from Gadag and two local advocates, said that the advocates were not allowed to file the bail application.

As per the procedure any bail petition before the sessions court has to be filed before the Principal District and Sessions Court, which in turn will allot the case to one of the two additional sessions court in Hubballi. So the advocates had gone to Dharwad to file petition.

“By the time they (advocates) reached Dharwad, there was already a crowd which first tried to prevent them from entering the court premises. Although they entered with the help of police, they were not allowed to file the petition. Subsequently, when they tried to contact the Principal District and Sessions Judge, a group of lawyers barged into the court hall, raised slogans and urged the judge to dismiss the petition on the threshold itself. I’m told the judge said that any protest should be done outside the court hall,” Mr. Venkatesh said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/a3e9v9/article30906980.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BGADVOCATES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/protests-prevent-lawyers-from-filing-bail-plea-of-three-kashmiri-students/article30906981.ece
93,2020/02/24,"Mahadayi project cost skyrockets by 1,674% since inception","Application to release 258 hectares of reserve forest area for the Kalasa project that falls under the reservoir’s catchment area is pending before MoEF

As the Kalasa-Banduri Nala project in the Mahadayi basin drags on over the inter-State river water dispute, the cost over the last 20 years has risen steeply from about ₹94 crore in 2000 to ₹1,677.30 crore now. Only a section of the project is nearing completion, with work on both reservoirs yet to be taken up owing to forest clearance.

Two canals

When the State government on August 22, 2000 gave its administrative approval to the project — conceived to supply drinking water to areas in Bombay Karnataka region — the estimated cost of Kalasa Nala was ₹44.78 crore, while that of Banduri Nala was ₹49.2 crore. A latest estimate prepared by the Water Resources Department has put the cost at ₹885.8 and ₹791.5 crore, respectively, taking the total to ₹1,677.3 crore. In 2013, when the expenditure on the project was revised, it was estimated to cost ₹840.52 crore.

From 2000 till now, the jump has been 1,674% and since 2013 when the estimates were revised, the increase has been by 93.98%.

Sources said that while the Supreme Court has asked the Union government to notify the Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal’s award, the State is now looking to seek its notification, and forest approvals. Since it is a drinking water project, the Environment Impact Assessment requirement has been waived. According to government sources, the application to release 258 hectares of reserve forest area for the Kalasa project that falls under the reservoir’s catchment area is pending before the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF). Similarly, an application to release 242.51 hectares of forest area for the Banduri project is also pending before the MoEF. “We expect approvals for these applications after the notification,” sources said.

Awaiting sanction

Sources said that the reservoir and the canal under the Banduri section are yet to be taken up as most of the project area comes under forests, and the State is yet to get sanction from the Central Water Commission and MoEF.

Government sources also pointed out that in the Kalasa project, the 5.15 km-canal has almost been completed after a long delay owing to challenging conditions that involved loose soil and work taken up for only four months in a year. Since the reservoir catchment falls in forests, work is yet to be taken up, sources said. So far, ₹244.89 crore has been spent on the Kalasa canal.

Delegation to meet Union Minister

A delegation from Karnataka, led by Major and Medium Irrigation Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, is set to meet Union Water Resources Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Wednesday with the demand to notify the Mahadayi River Disputes Tribunal’s award immediately, so that the State can complete work on the Kalasa-Banduri Nala project.

On Monday, the Minister chaired a high-level meeting to discuss the issue arising out of the Supreme Court’s direction to the Centre to notify the tribunal award. Sources said that the decision to meet the Union Minister comes in the wake of reports that Goa is expected to go to the Supreme Court on an appeal against Thursday’s court direction.

Meanwhile, senior Congress leader H.K. Patil also urged the State government to move swiftly to get the gazette notification. He pointed out that Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant has already announced the State’s intention to appeal against the order, and that the State government should bring pressure on the Centre to issue the gazette notification. Urging Mr. Jarkiholi to take an all-party delegation to the Union Minister, Mr. Patil also urged Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to set aside money for early completion of the project that has become a victim of politics.

200 tmcft currently unused

An estimate by the Water Resources Department says that barring a fraction, about 200 tmcft of water from the Mahadayi basin is going unused.

Ravi’s statement on casinos to boost tourism does not deserve much attention. “All that he said without applying his mind cannot be State’s policy,” he told reporters here.

The Minister said the State Cabinet had not decided on this. “What the Tourism Minister said was not the government’s statement. Can we allow Bengaluru to become Goa,” he asked.

Reacting to Congress leader C.M. Ibrahim’s statement that a BJP Minister would resign, Mr. Madhuswamy said he had been living in an illusion. “There may be some differences among leaders in the ruling party. But, no one would quit,” he said.

On reactions that Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s son Vijayendra was acting like ‘super CM’, the Minister said such statements were baseless. “There is no super CM.

95,2020/02/24,‘Magisterial probe into Mangaluru firing will be over by March 24’,"The magisterial inquiry into the police firing during an anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protest in Mangaluru on December 19, 2019 will be completed by March 24, Udupi Deputy Commissioner and district magistrate G. Jagadeesha, who is conducting the inquiry, informed the High Court of Karnataka on Monday.

A submission in this regard was made by the Advocate-General before a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar during the hearing on a PIL petition.

In his affidavit, Mr. Jagadeesha said that in response to a public notice issued on the court’s direction, asking the public to submit video footages of the incident, one person had given a compact disc and the police submitted a pen drive containing video clips. Another pen drive, submitted by a person, containing video clips from social media was rejected as it was not possible to ascertain its genuineness, the affidavit stated.

Meanwhile, Mangaluru City Police Commissioner Harsha P.S., in his affidavit, said no mediapersons had submitted video footages despite a request made through the Department of Information and the Mangaluru City Corporation has informed the police that there was no CCTV cameras installed in and around the place of incident.

However, Dr. Harsha said that the police have seized 20 digital video records from CCTVs cameras installed in private shops and establishments in and around the place of incident and the same were reported to a magistrate court in Mangaluru, which later permitted it to transfer to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which took over probe from the city police.

On the actions taken on complaints lodged against the police, the Commissioner said that in many cases endorsement was given that their complaints were tagged to the original complaint registered by the police themselves. However, in a few instances, the complaints were closed following initial inquiry. The Bench said that prima facie the two complaints — one related to the alleged video shooting by some persons in a hospital where some of the accused injured in the incident were being treated, and another by a woman alleging assault on her husband by the police — could not have been closed without registering First Information Reports.

However, the Bench said that action of the police appears to be correct in tagging many of the complaints related to the incident to the main FIR registered in this connection. As petitioner’s counsel wanted to file response to the Commissioner’s affidavit, the Bench adjourned further hearing till March 17.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/magisterial-probe-into-mangaluru-firing-will-be-over-by-march-24/article30906901.ece
96,2020/02/24,Farmer suicides: Study shows plight of women left behind,"‘Only 41.9% of families in last 3 years compensated’

The Mahila Kisan Adhikaar Manch, a forum for women farmers’ rights, has demanded that the State government look into the plight of women from families that have seen farmer suicides and announce necessary interventions in its budget proposals on March 5.

The forum has released the findings on the status of women farmers in such families from a survey in six States conducted during November-December 2019.

One of the founding members of the forum, Kavitha Kuruganti, speaking to presspersons here on Monday, said: “Our study points out that Karnataka constitutes 18-23% of all farm suicides across India in recent past. Going by the farm suicides recorded by the Police Department, only 41.9% of affected families in the last three years were compensated.”

No database

She said the study found that 14% of farm suicides in Karnataka are of women. However, there is no database of the women farmers in these families that the government maintains, nor any coordination between agencies that are supposed to support them with compensation, or free education or pension. She argued for better coordination between agencies involved in setting up of committees to monitor and ensure that all entitlements are given. “There should be special ID cards issued to the women farmers in these families, as is being done in Maharashtra. We also want effective helplines to be set up similar to Telangana government’s efforts in three districts there,” Ms. Kuruganti added.

All-woman household

Neelamma Munivenkatappa from Kolar, a sericulturist, described her plight of having to repay outstanding debts left behind by her husband who ended his life in 2018. “Between three sisters-in-law in our family, all of whom are single, we just about recover our cost of production of sericulture. There is no way we can repay the outstanding debts with banks and cooperative societies and I’m now receiving notices from these lenders,” she said.

Kavitha Srinivasan of the forum said: “We need a mechanism by which the women are freed from the outstanding debts, which have not been borrowed by consulting them in the first instance. The government has to set up a debt-relief system so that the women become eligible for fresh loans if needed and are not burdened with outstanding debts.”

The after-effects

Jyothi Raj of Bhoo Shaakti Kendra, Tumakuru, said that the study showed that numerous changes happen in the families after a farmer ends his life. The study showed that land ownership in the same households declined after the suicide, by about 18% in terms of extent. Livestock ownership also declined significantly. In several cases, children have been pulled out of education or employment in cities. In 16% of the sample cases studied, the women farmer shifted to agricultural labourer status from being a cultivating farmer. The women in the families seem to be affected, anxious and mentally stressed in many cases and this requires the urgent attention of the State and civil society, she added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ccj6bn/article30906880.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGNNEELAMMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/farmer-suicides-study-shows-plight-of-women-left-behind/article30906881.ece

Claiming that the recently circulated anonymous letter that sought the “honourable exit” of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had been written by a “mentally unsound” person, his political secretary M.P. Renukacharya on Monday said the identity of the person was known and would be revealed in due course.

“The letter was written with an intention of grabbing power by a mentally unsound person,” he said and added that though the goal of the letter was to destabilise the government, Mr. Yediyurappa will complete the rest of the term.

Asked if the letter came from a BJP legislator, he claimed that the person was neither a BJP man nor a legislator. “I will not talk about it now. When the time comes, I will reveal the identity. He is a desperate person.” Asked if they would approach the police since the letter was against the Chief Minister, he refused to elaborate further.

Meanwhile, clarifying the alleged threat by Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi to resign, Mr. Renukacharya said that his statement was taken out of context.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/we-know-who-wrote-unsigned-letter-on-cm-renukacharya/article30906878.ece
98,2020/02/24,Karnataka is among nine States that accounts for 65% of tuberculosis cases,"With nine States, including Karnataka, accounting for 65% of the total tuberculosis (TB) cases in the country, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has stepped up measures in these States to eliminate TB by 2025, well ahead of the Sustainable Development Goals target year of 2030.

Assam, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal are the other States where TB cases are high. While 24.02 lakh new cases were detected in 2019, 21.59 lakh cases were detected in 2018 across the country, said Vikas Sheel, Union Joint Secretary (Policy) in charge of the National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme.

“Of the 91,318 TB cases notified in Karnataka in 2019, 71,998 cases have been notified from the public sector. The annual total TB notification rate in Karnataka is 135 cases/lakh/year in 2019 and all measures are being taken to ensure no TB case is missed,” the official said.

Internal audit

Replying to queries regarding “suspicious transactions” in the transfer of direct cash benefit for nutrition to TB patients following which the cash transfer had been stopped for some time, the official said the process had resumed after an internal audit.

“We did an internal audit and found that some transfers were done in the name of NGOs and trusts. We noticed that it was because homeless people, who do not have a permanent address and cannot have a bank account, were under the care of these organisations. The transfer was done to the bank account of these organisations and was being used for the patients. The doubts have been cleared now,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-is-among-nine-states-that-accounts-for-65-of-tuberculosis-cases/article30906653.ece
99,2020/02/24,Comprehensive health care in wellness centres soon,"Elderly and palliative care apart from management of mental health ailments will be offered at health and wellness centres

Soon, Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) set up under Ayushman Bharat to provide preventive, promotive, rehabilitative, and curative care will expand their services to offer elderly and palliative healthcare services. Basic oral health care and care for common ophthalmic and ENT problems apart from screening and basic management of mental health ailments will be available at these centres.

Mid-level healthcare provider and community health workers, who will be trained to offer these services, will also facilitate tele-consultation with a doctor at the nearest Primary Health Centre for those who require specific treatment, said Vikas Sheel, Union Joint Secretary (Policy), here on Monday.

Mr. Sheel, who looks after National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme and Ayushman Bharat-HWC Programmes, said now the HWCs are providing preventive, promotive, rehabilitative and curative care for a range of services encompassing reproductive and child health services, communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, and reproductive health care services.

The Health Ministry had set itself a target of establishing 1.5 lakh HWCs by 2022 and nearly 9,000 of these will be from Karnataka. As of now, 1,930 sub-centres in Karnataka have been transformed into HWCs and 364 of these are in urban areas, including Bengaluru, he said. The official said nearly 40,000 of the 1.5 lakh proposed will become functional by the end of March. “This April will mark the second anniversary of HWC programme under Ayushman Bharat. These transformed centres are aimed at providing free and accessible comprehensive primary healthcare, focusing on bringing preventive and promotive care closer to the community,” he said.

The primary healthcare team at these AB-HWCs have also focussed on the screening of communicable diseases such as Tuberculosis and Leprosy, he asserted.

Preventive healthcare through wellness activities is the important feature of these AB-HWCs and more focus is being given on lifestyle changes for creating behavioural changes in the communities. “Regular sessions of yoga and other physical activities at these AB-HWCs have attracted the community. Over seven lakh wellness and yoga sessions have been conducted so far,” Mr Sheel said.

Lauding Karnataka, he said: “In addition to non-communicable disease screenings, Karnataka prioritised the need for community well-being by conducting more than 40,000 wellness as well as yoga activities.”

OPTIONAL CUT: Among the other States with well-performing HWCs are Tamil Nadu, Manipur, Gujarat, and Kerala. As per the latest data updated from the States in the AB-HWC Portal managed by the Union Ministry, as many as 30,690 HWCs are functional across India as of February 2020.

Food safety testing kits

The Union Ministry will soon provide food safety testing kits to all Health and Wellness centres designed by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). “These kits will enable anybody to test food at the centres. The idea is to create awareness about safe eating and also act as a deterrent to retailers,” said Vikas Sheel, Union Joint Secretary (Policy).

Payment for ASHAs only incentive-based, cannot be given salaries

Replying to queries as to why Accredited Social Health Activists cannot be given fixed salaries when their responsibilities are increasing by the day, Vikas Sheel, Union Joint Secretary (Policy), said their payment is incentive-based. “The Health Ministry cannot give them salaries as their service is part time and voluntary. They are not employees. The States are more than welcome to supplement the incentives from their (States) resources,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/uwwfij/article30906309.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BGELDERLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/comprehensive-health-care-in-wellness-centres-soon/article30906310.ece

The Passenger Amenities Committee (PAC) of the Indian Railways inspected Mysuru station on Monday and gave a thumbs-up to the amenities and services available.

Chairman P.K. Krishnadas and four members inspected the waiting rooms, current booking and advanced reservation offices, pay-and-use toilet in the circulating area, parking facilities, foot overbridge, escalators and lifts, security and surveillance system, catering and miscellaneous stalls, etc.

The Committee expressed satisfaction over the scale of amenities and the standard of cleanliness maintained and later interacted with the rail-users to get a first hand feedback about the facilities provided.

Speaking on the need to lay greater emphasis on women’s safety on railway premises and on board trains, the Committee wanted the railways to step up vigil in areas such as subways by deploying more number of women Railway Protection staff and also enhance ticket checking staff to instil confidence in rail-users.

Later in the day, the Committee held discussions with Divisional Railway Manager Aparna Garg.

The DRM informed the committee that the failure of the Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation Ltd. (IRCTC) to finalise the contract for setting up a food plaza in the station was the main reason for the station still not having full-fledged round-the-clock-catering services.

She said it was pending since September 2019 and affecting passengers comfort. The DRM also said that completion of passenger amenities has been affected due to shortage of grant. Mr. Krishnadas said he will take up these issues with the higher authorities.

There was also an inspection of the Srirangapatna station where several representations were submitted seeking stoppage of trains at the station. The Committee said these issues would be examined after taking into account the operation and safety issues involved.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/a-pat-for-mysuru-rly-station/article30905939.ece
101,2020/02/24,‘Reclaim land allotted to BEML in Mysuru’,"Industry bodies request State govt. to make it public property in the wake of Centre’s decision to divest in the company

Industry bodies in Mysuru have begun bringing pressure on the State government to withdraw the 100 acres of land handed over to Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML) in the city in the wake of the Centre’s decision to disinvest in the public sector company.

At an interactive session with Minister for Large and Medium Industries Jagadish Shettar in Mysuru on Sunday, former MLA and President of Mysuru Industries Association (MIA) Vasu said the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB) had allotted 100 acres of land to BEML for the company's housing project a couple of years ago.

The land had not been used by the public sector company and is lying vacant as its employees were given sites through a housing co-operative society formed for the purpose.

With the Centre deciding to divest a good portion of its stake in the public sector company, the land parcel allotted to BEML will also go to the private entity as part of the disinvestment process, Mr. Vasu said while urging Mr Shettar to withdraw the allotment. The land is situated near the Outer Ring Road.

BEML, which manufactures mining equipment, has also diversified into producing rail coaches and defence production. The public sector company’s Mysuru unit manufactures heavy duty diesel engines for earth moving, mining and construction machinery and defence equipment, besides dumpers of 35 to 100 tonne capacity and a range of motor graders and water sprinklers.

MIA Secretary Suresh Kumar Jain said the land was allotted to BEML in 1990s through lease-cum-sale at a throwaway price for the specific purpose of providing housing facilities to its employees.

With BEML employees preferring sites which they could own, through a co-operative society, instead of residential quarters which they would have to vacate, the housing project had been dropped, Mr. Jain said.

The allotment of land to BEML should be withdrawn in the same manner as the KIADB reclaims industrial land when the allottee fails to use it for the purpose for which it has been given. “When you can withdraw land allotted to industrialists if they don’t implement the project in two years, you can also withdraw the land allotted to BEML”, he said.

“If the land is withdrawn, it will become public property and will be available for public use. Or else, it will be of real estate value”, he said.

Meanwhile, the scarcity of land for industries in Mysuru has led to demands for withdrawal of unused land allotted to different companies. A similar demand was made at the interactive session to withdraw 100 acres of land allotted to Wipro by representatives of different industry bodies.

However, Mr. Jain said sought to draw a distinction between land allotted to BEML and Wipro. BEML was allotted land from the land bank already acquired by KIADB whereas the land allotment to Wipro was after the company made the payment for acquisition of available land for setting up a single unit complex. Even the development charges of the land had been borne by Wipro, Mr. Jain said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/5ekwot/article30905930.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24MYSBEML,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/reclaim-land-allotted-to-beml-in-mysuru/article30905931.ece
102,2020/02/24,HC tells State to release ₹5.95 cr. for LSD patients,"Coming to the rescue of children suffering from Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs), the High Court of Karnataka on Monday directed the State government to release ₹5.95 crore to treat 25 children at Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health (IGICH), Bengaluru, for the next four months. The government has to release the amount in four equal monthly instalments till June.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar passed the interim order while observing that the court would be failing in its duties if it did not interfere in this case when the State and the Union governments have locked horns over the manner of sharing huge amounts required for the treatment LSD patients.

Of the total 45 children diagnosed with LSDs, 13 are being treated under Charitable Access Programme, seven were being supported by the Employees State Insurance, and a total of ₹5.95 core was required for treating 25 children for the next four months, the Bench noticed from the statement made by IGICH Director.

Right to health

Citing the apex court’s judgments declaring that the right to health is an inalienable component of fundamental right to life under the Constitution, the Bench cautioned that both the State and Union governments would be responsible if any untoward incident happens with the children due to failure to release the amount.

The Bench said that the State government gave representation to the Central government to release substantial money for treatment or permit it to use the amount for this purpose from the allocation made for health sector.

As its earlier policy of providing 60% of the amount required for treatment of rare diseases was kept in abeyance, the Centre said that it cannot release the amount till further orders or formulation of new policy for treating rare diseases, while indicating that the State government could use funds from the allocation made to the health sector.

About ₹902 crore remained unspent with the State government from the total allocation of ₹2,401 made for the health sector for 2018-19, data indicated. On its part, the State government said it cannot change or re-appropriate allocated funds without approval from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

Insufficent funds

The Bench also noticed that ₹17 crore corpus fund was provided to the IGICH by the government to treat LSD patients but only the interest amount could be utilised for procuring drugs and the interest amount was not sufficient to provide treatment at regular interval.

The medicine required depends on weight of the patient and requires about ₹40 lakh per year per child weighing about 10 kg, and the cost of treatment increases by about ₹2 to ₹3 lakh for every extra kilo, the Bench noted.

Meanwhile, the Bench ordered issue of notice to two companies which supply medicine for LSDs, to appeal to them to explore the possibility of providing medicine at concessional rates or for free in some cases. The order was passed during the hearing of a PIL petition filed by Lysosomal Storage Disorder Society of India, Bengaluru.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hc-tells-state-to-release-595-cr-for-lsd-patients/article30905883.ece
103,2020/02/24,Police have no prior complaint of Amulya’s link with Naxals,"The police have not received any complaint against either Amulya Leona, who in jail on sedition charges for raising “Pakistan Zindabad” slogan at a pro-CAA rally, or her family members for supporting Naxal activities in Chikkamagaluru, her native district.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, last week, had said that Amulya had links with Naxals and it should be probed.

When The Hindu enquired with the police in Chikkamagaluru if there were complaints against Amulya, senior officials said that there were none. According to official sources, the police had checked the antecedents of Amulya’s father and other family members.

Interestingly, Wazi Noronha, Amulya’s father, had provided surety for one of the former Maoists, who had joined mainstream as part of the State government’s policy to assimilate them. The policy was, in fact, part of an initiative to fight the spread of Naxalism, the police say. It is said that the Chief Minister’s statement was based on this information.

Mr. Noronha has been involved in other kinds of social work as well.

105,2020/02/24,ASI planning barricade around famed stone chariot at Hampi,"The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is contemplating installing a wooden barricade around the stone chariot inside Vittala Temple complex at the UNESCO World Heritage site of Hampi in a bid to protect it from vandalism.

Vittala Temple is not only among the most-visited protected monuments at Hampi, but is also the most photographed. Art historians say it reflects a high degree of craftsmanship of the temple architecture that reached its zenith under the Vijayanagara rulers who reigned from 14th to 17th century CE.

According to a few officials in the ASI wooden barricade has been thought of since a long time given the behaviour of some of the tourists, who tend to be disrespectful towards the monuments.

M. Kalimuthu, Deputy Superintending Archaeologist, Hampi Mini Circle, admitted that the wooden barricading has been in he pipeline but no proposal had been submitted so far. “We will take the advice of the Director-General of Archaeology in Delhi,” he said, adding that there were many issues that needed to be addressed, including the barricade design that had to be in sync with the monument.

The proposed move has triggered a debate among conservationists, heritage activists and locals, some of whom are critical. “While some locals say the ASI is not doing enough to protect the monuments, the same lot also criticise the proposed move to install the barricade,” said Mr. Kalimuthu.

Though the site is guarded there are always some tourists with a streak for vandalism who find a “window of opportunity” when the attention of the security personnel is drawn elsewhere.

N.S. Rangaraju, retired professor of Department of Ancient History and Archaeology, University of Mysore, said during a visit, he saw tourists hoisting children atop the wheels and elephant sculptures, while elders leaning against the chariot as if pushing it and getting photographed, ignoring its sanctity. “This is a common phenomena across the country, where people scribble, proclaim their love on the walls of monuments. There is lack of awareness among the public that the monuments stand testimony to culture and heritage,” said Mr. Rangaraju, who was supportive of installing barricades around the stone chariot at Hampi.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ji20sc/article30905538.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGHAMPI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/asi-planning-barricade-around-famed-stone-chariot-at-hampi/article30905539.ece

108,2020/02/24,Investors will be wooed to tier-2 cities: CM,"At job mela, he also assures young entrepreneurs of easy access to credit

On the model of Pradhan Manrti Mudra Yojana (PMMY), the State government in its budget of the year 2020-21 would launch a scheme to ensure easy access to credit for youths interested in entrepreneurial ventures and for medium, small and micro enterprises (MSMEs), Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has said.

Speaking after inaugurating an employment mela in the city on Monday, he said that lack of access to credit should not become a deterring factor for entrepreneurs who have the potential to create jobs.

Mr. Yediuirappa said that at the World Economic Summit held in Davos, Switzerland, the investors were apprised of the economic potential of moffusil centres in Karnataka. It is necessary to adopt a decentralised approach towards industrialisation and attract the industrial investment for tier-2 cities such as Shivamogga, Hubballi and Belagavi. The State government would soon announce a slew of benefits and relaxations for the investors who venture to set up industries in these places. The connectivity and infrastructure would also be upgraded in tier-two cities to attract the investment.

Terming the ‘Invest Karnataka-Hubballi’ meet held in Hubballi recently as a grand success, Mr. Yediyurappa said that similar events to attract investment in tier-2 centres would be held across the State shortly.

He said that the priority would be accorded for balanced growth of all the sectors of the economy in the budget. “Both agriculture as well as industrial sectors should perform well for balanced economic growth. Ample funds would be allocated in the budget for extension of the area of irrigated land in the State,” he added.

116,2020/02/24,Malnad Gidda research centre to come up,"The zero-maintenance dwarf variety of cattle is endemic to Malnad region

The Department of Animal Husbandry will establish a centre dedicated for research on Malnad Gidda, the zero-maintenance dwarf variety of cattle endemic to Malnad region, in Andavalli village in Sorab taluk of Shivamogga district.

The average height of an adult Malnad Gidda is around 90 cm and its average weight is around 150 kg. Unlike hybrid and cross-breed cattle, there is no cost involved in maintenance of Malnad Gidda. They are free-range cattle and graze in the forests near human habitat from dawn to dusk. Paddy grass, kitchen scrap and leftovers are offered as feed for them in cowsheds and they yield around three litres of milk a day.

Role in farming

Malnad Gidda play an important role in farming in the Western Ghats region of Karnataka. The well-built males are castrated and used for tilling land. They can till the land even in the heavy rain the region receives from July to September.

The cattle are accustomed to the harsh climate here and can easily graze on steep terrain. They also show a high degree of immunity to diseases.

More economical

Swamy Rao, a farmer from Anandapuram village who owns eight Malnad Gidda, told The Hindu that if the value of milk yield from Malnad Gidda is calculated against the input cost, rearing it is more economical compared to cross breeds and hybrids. The milk and milk products of Malnad Gidda are known for a unique taste and creaminess. As the role of chemical input in rearing them is minimal, their milk is considered chemical-free. Their milk and milk products can thus be sold at a premium price in urban areas, he said.

The National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR), a unit of Indian Council of Agriculture Research, had approved and registered Malnad Gidda as a breed in 2012. According to the 2018 livestock census, there were more than 12 lakh Malnad Gidda in Karnataka.

Akhilesh Chipli, an environmentalist, rues that farmers were losing interest in rearing Malnad Gidda now. There is dearth of grazing space owing to encroachment of gomala, the common grazing ground.

Cropping patterns

The change in cropping pattern in Malnad is considered another reason for the dwindling interest among farmers towards its rearing. Mr. Chipli said that commercial crops like arecanut and ginger with high returns are preferred over paddy resulting in shortage of fodder.

Mr. Rao says that rearing Malnad Gidda can be turned into a profitable venture by enhancing its lactating capacity.

This can be done by selecting healthy and sturdy bulls and cows with high milk yielding capacity for reproduction, he said and expressed optimism that the proposed centre in Andavalli would take up such projects.

T.M. Sadashiva, Deputy Director, Department of Animal Husbandry, told The Hindu that, as per instruction from the State government, a proposal was submitted in January seeking 200 acres of land near Andavalli for the establishment of Malnad Gidda Research and Conservation Centre. The research work on enhancing milk yielding capacity would be taken up and farmers would be trained on rearing and marketing milk products here.

According to a preliminary estimate, an amount of ₹70 crore is needed to create infrastructure for the proposed centre, he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/3328vk/article30898543.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGMALNADGIDDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/malnad-gidda-research-centre-to-come-up/article30898544.ece
117,2020/02/24,M.M. Wildlife Sanctuary to be tiger reserve soon,"Once notified, Chamarajanagar district will have three tiger reserves

Decks have been cleared to notify the Malai Mahadeshwara Wildlife Sanctuary as a tiger reserve. The approval from the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) is expected any time now.

A presentation of the final proposal was made before the NTCA early this month and the final notification will be made by the State government once the NTCA gives its formal approval.

Once notified, Chamarajanagar district will have the rare distinction in the country of harbouring three tiger reserves. It already has Bandipur and Biligiri Ranganatha Temple (BRT) Tiger Reserve within its territorial limits.

Also, with this, Karnataka will have six tiger reserves, the others being Nagarahole, Bhadra, and Anshi-Dandeli, apart from Bandipur and BRT Tiger Reserves.

The sanctuary will be renamed as Malai Mahadeshwara Hill Tiger Reserve (MMH TR) with a core area of 670.95 sq km spread across Malai Mahadeshwara Reserve Forest, Hanur Reserve Forest and Yediyarahalli Reserve Forest. The buffer will be spread over 235.19 sq km.

V. Yedukondalu, Deputy Conservator of Forests, MM Hills, told The Hindu, that the State Board for Wildlife had given its concurrence to declare M.M. Hills sanctuary as a tiger reserve in January 2019. A proposal was submitted in May 2019 but it was returned as additional clarification was required with respect to the delineation of the boundary in the core area, list of existing settlements and the need to spell out the religious and tourism zone, etc. Hence, a revised proposal was submitted in January 2020 and a presentation made before the NTCA in Delhi, said Mr. Yedukondalu.

The sanctuary presently has about 20 tigers as evident in photographs from camera traps in Hanur, Ramapura, P.G. Palya, Hoogyam, M.M. Hills and Palar ranges, and wildlife experts vouch for its potential to rival the Bandipur-Nagarahole-Wayanad-Mudumalai landscape in the years ahead.

This optimism stems from the fact that the MM Hills wildlife sanctuary – which is spread over 906.18 sq km – is contiguous to BRT Tiger Reserve (584 sq km) on one side, Satyamangalam Tiger Reserve (1,412 sq km) in Tamil Nadu on the other, while the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary (1,027 sq km) also borders it, thus providing a contiguous forest cover of over 3,500 sq km that can act as a sink to absorb surplus tiger population and help increase their numbers.

Implementation of strict wildlife management and protection measures will enhance the landscape value in increasing the tiger densities as the forests has an abundance of prey species like gaur, sambar, chital, four-horned antelope, wild boar, etc., according to authorities who say that studies have proved that the prey density was 5.05 animals per sq km.

Being part of Mysore Elephant Reserve, these forests also support nearly 300 elephants.

Anti-poaching camps may increase

Mr. Yedukondalu has said there are 39 anti-poaching camps in MM Hills Wildlife Sanctuary and the plan is to double their number once it is elevated to the status of a tiger reserve. This sanctuary and the adjoining landscape – which was once Veerappan’s den and out of bounds for the forest department – had a history of poaching by local community for meat, especially along the forest boundary and fringes. But it has been curtailed over the years thus increasing the density of the prey, he added.

In the justification to declare the sanctuary a tiger reserve, the authorities have stated that this is a unique geographical zone that acts as a bridge between the Western and Eastern Ghats. There are about 285 bird species documented in this landscape as per a 2014 survey. The forests are important not only for tiger, elephants and leopards but also chitals, honey badgers, smooth-coated otter, striped hyena, wild dogs, sloth bear, grizzled giant squirrels, Mahseer fish, etc.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yuj59u/article30898526.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGMYSMMHILLS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mm-wildlife-sanctuary-to-be-tiger-reserve-soon/article30898527.ece

119,2020/02/24,No more endless wait for water tankers,"A simple management mechanism has made life easier for many in Vijayapura

For several years, Gangubai Rathod’s daily chore has been to wait for hours in long queues to fetch water from tankers even during non-summer months. A farm labourer in Tamba village of Indi taluk in Vijayapura district, the 37-year-old had to sacrifice her daily wage every alternate day to fetch water. “Despite the wait, we sometimes ended up not having enough water for daily needs,” she says.

This year, however, Ms. Gangubai is relieved as she does not have to do this. In fact, Vijayapura district as a whole has not been supplied water through tankers from the last quarter of 2019, thanks to a simple water management mechanism.

Deputy Commissioner Y.S. Patil told The Hindu that a coordination committee of Krishna Bhagya Jala Nigam Ltd. (KBJNL) officials, ZP and departments of Revenue, and Police, had ensured the effective management of release of water from canals to tanks. This mechanism was put in place after the district administration found out that lack of coordination between departments was the reason for water woes.

The committee ensured there was basic coordination between KBJNL and Rural Development and Panchayat Raj (RDPR) Department. The committee kept a watch on the water status, prioritised drinking water and reviewed the situation every 15 days. A strict direction on filling up all tanks used for drinking water also did the trick.

“Tanks are the primary sources of water in rural areas where the multi-village scheme is implemented. Earlier, KBJNL was releasing water to these tanks through canals from Almatti dam, but there was no system to monitor the required quantum of water to these tanks,” Mr. Patil said.

As per data, the district administration supplied water through 30,000 tankers with over 88,000 trips by spending over ₹5.38 crore last year. “This year, the effective management helped us save a good share of public money. We have not spent anything on tankers,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/d1uixi/article30898486.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BGVIJAYAPURATANKER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/no-more-endless-wait-for-water-tankers/article30898487.ece
120,2020/02/24,PG medical fees in private colleges may rise by 15%,"Last year too, the fee was hiked by 15% in private colleges and minority institutions

Students enrolling in postgraduate courses in private medical colleges may have to cough up a higher fee from the coming academic year as the government is likely to increase the fees by about 15%.

The hike is expected to be applicable to the government quota as well as the institutional quota seats in private medical colleges.

Medical Education Minister K.Sudhakar said that senior officials of the Medical Education Department had formed a committee and had conducted several meetings with different medical college associations and recommended a hike. “The State government will, however, take a call on the matter. I am likely to receive this file next week and take a call after studying the recommendations of the committee’s report,” he said. He added that he would meet with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and seek his advice on the matter.

‘Steep hikes’

But students say that the hike in postgraduate medical course fees has been steep year after year, making it difficult for those from middle class families.

Last academic year too, the State government had hiked the fees by 15% and it was applicable to private medical colleges as well as minority institutions. For the 2019-20 academic year, the fee structure was in the range of ₹72,737 to ₹5.81 lakh for government quota medical seats, while institutional quota seats were priced between ₹1.09 lakh and ₹8.72 lakh.

Students threaten strike

Subhashini S., a PG medical seat aspirant said, “If the fees are hiked then we will take up a Statewide agitation till the government rolls it back. Increasing fees every year is not acceptable.”

121,2020/02/24,Dentist’s death shrouded in mystery,"He had been questioned over his wife’s death

Chikkamagaluru Superintendent of Police Harish Pandey has said it is not yet clear if Revanth, a dentist, from Kadur committed suicide following the death of his wife or was depressed over police interrogation. However, Mr. Pandey made it clear that the police only collected details at the crime scene and Dr. Revanth cooperated with the investigation.

The murder of Kavitha, a housewife, reported in Kadur on February 17 is suspected to have led to two more deaths. Her husband, Dr. Revanth, was found dead on a railway track on Saturday. The same day, at night, Harshitha, with whom Dr. Revanth was allegedly in constant touch, also reportedly committed suicide at R.R. Nagar in Bengaluru.

Mr. Pandey, at a press conference in Chikkamagaluru on Sunday, said that initially the police suspected it to be a murder for gain, as valuables worth over ₹4 lakh were missing from her residence.

However, they later found material suggesting it could not have been a murder for gain. The post-mortem of Kavitha noted two punctures near her belly button.

“The punctures could be to inject anaesthesia,” he said. The accused had taken extra care to ensure that blood from her body did not flow towards adjacent rooms, which was not expected in a case of murder for gain.

“We collected CCTV footage of all cameras in the area but did not find anyone moving suspiciously nearby on the day. We are in no position to conclude who committed the murder,” he said.

Interrogation

Mr. Pandey said the police had questioned Dr. Revanth, the complainant. He cooperated with the police. “By then, we had collected information that Revanth was in constant touch with Harshitha at R.R. Nagar in Bengaluru,” he said.

A sub-inspector was sent to Bengaluru to talk to Harshitha. “But before the officer could reach her place, we learnt that she had committed suicide and a complaint was registered in Bengaluru accusing her husband and others of abetting her suicide,” he said.

The officer said it was clear the doctor and Harshita had talked to each other on the phone several times even after Kavitha’s murder. “The investigation is on,” Mr. Pandey added.

124,2020/02/24,Consumers chickening out owing to COVID-19 rumours: Poultry association,"‘Consumption has gone down by nearly 50%‘

The Karnataka Poultry Farmers and Breeders’ Association has claimed that rumours about COVID-19 have hit the sale of poultry products.

Sanjiv Deshpande, member, told presspersons here on Sunday that some vested interests were harming the poultry sector by spreading rumours about the virus being spread by the consumption of chicken, and poultry products.

“We have done some fact-checks and found that all such messages are false and misleading. Poultry products are not even remotely connected to the spread of the virus, but we are being made the targets,” he said.

“There is a lot of fake news on social media connecting chickens and the virus. There is absolutely no connection between the two. But owing to such misleading messages, chicken consumption has gone down by nearly 50%. Nearly 80 lakh birds are produced every month in Belagavi, and Kolhapur areas. There are over 2,500 farms in the region which have been suffering losses for two months now,” he said.

“The prices of the birds have fallen by nearly half in the local markets,” he said.

“Poultry meat is safe for consumption. The Union government has released clarifications about this already,” said poultry expert Mahendra Choudhary.

He said that consumers were losing confidence owing to the rumours and misinformation on social media, and urged the mainstream media to help combat the menace of fake news.

Scientist Subramanyam Bhatt said the virus spread from humans to humans and not from animals or birds. “As per Indian cooking habits, chicken is completely boiled before consumption. This removes all chances of infection,” Dr. Bhat said.

125,2020/02/24,District panchayat lends a hand to renal patients,"Swaraj Trophy prize money to be used to purchase medicines

The Kannur District Panchayat has decided to utilise the prize money of ₹20 lakh it received for being the second best district panchayat in the State, to procure medicines for kidney transplant patients.

District Panchayat President K.V. Sumesh said the civic body had won the Swaraj Trophy.

However, considering the plight of several renal patients who were struggling to buy medicines post-kidney transplants, it was decided to utilise the prize money to help them.

He said ₹50 lakh had already been set aside for treatment or renal patients in the annual budget of the panchayat. However, the prize money will be added to the budget allocation in view of the huge number of applications from patients seeking aid, he added.

240 beneficiaries

Mr. Sumesh pointed out that each patient spent between ₹4,000 to ₹20,000 a month on medication. There are 240 beneficiaries in the district. In addition, around 150 applications are under the consideration of the district panchayat.

Patients who have undergone kidney transplant and do not receive assistance under other programmes will get help from the civic body, he clarified.

The initiative is estimated to cost ₹1 crore a year. Funds will be mobilised from the public for the programme, he said.

126,2020/02/24,"Centre, State adopting anti-people policies, says Chandy","‘Controversies being created to divert attention from real issues’

Both the Narendra Modi government at the Centre and the Pinarayi Vijayan government in the State seemed to be competing with each other in adopting anti-people programmes and policies, said Congress leader Oommen Chandy here on Monday.

He was addressing the valedictory function of a month-long march led by District Congress Committee president Satheeshan Pacheni against State and Central policies.

Mr. Chandy said the policies implemented by the BJP government had left the people suffering. He said the policies had huge repercussions on the economy and the country as a whole. There was high inflation, job loss and economic stagnation. However, instead of addressing them, the Modi government had tried to create controversies. This was to divert the attention of the people from real issues, he opined. People were totally neglected, he said.

In the State, the treasuries were not functioning and most of the projects and schemes were on hold as local bodies and departments were unable to withdraw the allocated funds.

Citing the Shuhaib murder case, he said the government was trying to help the accused, mostly belonging to the ruling party, by spending huge amounts of money. It had declined to hand over the case to the CBI. Instead of utilising the services of government advocates in the High Court, the government was bringing in senior advocates by paying huge fees to defend the accused. The fees of the advocates were paid from the treasuries, he said.

“While on the one hand, the LDF government supported the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, on the other hand, it has registered non-bailable cases against members of the Youth Congress, Kerala Students Union and others who have participated in the protest against CAA”. This only showed the double standard of Mr.Vijayan, he said.

He observed that the Kerala government was dealing with the CAA protest in the same way as was done by BJP-ruled States. The actions taken by Mr. Pinarayi were only to please Mr. Modi, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mxl71c/article30907100.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/rally4,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/centre-state-adopting-anti-people-policies-says-chandy/article30907101.ece

128,2020/02/24,KC(M) to discuss Kuttanad candidature,"Sub-panel of Mani faction to hold talks

Amidst rumours that the Congress would contest on behalf of the United Democratic Front (UDF) in the Kuttanad Assembly segment to avoid a crisis, the Kerala Congress (M) faction led by Jose K. Mani has decided to go ahead with its plans to field a candidate there.

A decision in this regard was made at a meeting of the party high power committee here on Monday.

As part of it, a subcommittee headed by Thomas Chazhikkadan, MP, will hold discussions with party workers and leaders in Alappuzha on February 26.

Other members

Joseph M. Puthussery, former MLA, V.T. Joseph, V.C. Francis, and Jacob Thomas are the other members of the committee.

While a couple of names are being considered by the Mani group, Shaiju Kandakkudy is regarded as the frontrunner.

Mani commemoration

Earlier, the KC(M) faction led by P.J. Joseph said it would field Jacob Abraham as the UDF candidate in Kuttanad.

The high-power committee also reviewed the primary level preparations of the K.M. Mani Smrithi Sangamam to be organised in Pala on April 29 as part of the first death anniversary of the party stalwart.

129,2020/02/24,BJP to act tough against schism,"Many leaders were absent when K. Surendran assumed office

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national leadership is reportedly gearing up to crack the whip on the discontent and factional feud in the State unit of the party following the recent change of guard.

The conspicuous absence of certain leaders, except those who had prior commitments, on the day incumbent K. Surendran assumed office here has irked the national leadership that had repeatedly warned against the schism that is threatening to destabilise the organisational apparatus in the State, party sources said.

The BJP national leadership is understood to have given the go ahead for Mr. Surendran to act tough and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh too has endorsed it.

Revamp soon

Organisational revamp is expected to be completed in a fortnight. RSS leaders Valsan Thillenkeri and C. Sadanandan may get prime organisational positions in the revamp. BJP State spokesperson M.S. Kumar and Palakkad municipal vice-chairman C. Krishnakumar are tipped to be State general secretaries, sources said.

In an attempt to stave off the top leadership’s ire, some of the dissident leaders chose to meet Mr. Surendran before he reached the office and some others registered their presence by arriving late.

The absence of such leaders at the function and their alleged indifference had drawn media attention and triggered discussions. Such discussions have led to a feeling that changes at the helm are inadequate to unify the party, even in the run up to the crucial local body and Assembly elections.

The leadership claims that the party wields considerable clout in a number of local body wards and hopes to improve its tally in the local body elections due within the next six months.

NDA in disarray

Moreover, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is in a state of disarray in the State and stitching it up again into a cohesive whole is a major challenge for Mr. Surendran. The next attempt is for reviving the alliance, sources said.

At a Meet-the-Press here on Monday, Mr. Surendran, however, dubbed reports about factionalism as baseless.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/qa65fc/article30909882.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25TVSURENDRAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bjp-to-act-tough-against-schism/article30906991.ece
130,2020/02/24,2 Customs officers dismissed from service,"Accused of attempting to smuggle gold through airports in capital, Kannur

The Customs Preventive Commissionerate here has removed two officials from service, sending out a strong message to its officials against abetting smuggling.

Sumit Kumar, Customs Commissioner (Preventive), Cochin, issued the dismissal orders of Radhakrishnan B., Superintendent of Customs, on February 18 while Rahul Pandit, Inspector of Customs, was dismissed the day after.

Radhakrishnan stands accused of attempted smuggling of nearly 25 kg of gold worth around ₹8.17 crore through the Thiruvananthapuram international airport on May 13, 2019.

Rahul and three other Customs officials were charged with attempted smuggling of over 11 kg of gold through the Kannur airport on August 19, 2019.

Both were arrested by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and suspended from service, which had been extended multiple times since then by a Customs Committee.

Detention order

The duo initially managed to secure bail but went absconding as soon as the Central Economic Intelligence Bureau issued a detention order under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act.

“Absconding is an offence in itself since an officer under suspension is not supposed to leave the station without permission,” said Mr. Kumar.

One arrested

The DRI eventually nabbed Radhakrishnan when he turned up before the Additional SP of the Central Bureau of Investigation, Kochi unit, which had also a case registered against him and was about to attach his properties under the Cr.PC. Though put behind the bars, he continued to influence the witnesses and the investigation officer from the prison, sources said. Rahul is still absconding.

“A call was made to dismiss them after due process of law under Rule 19 of the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965. Dismissals in less than a year is unprecedented and will serve a strong message that job loss and other punishments are a certainty if the staff abet smuggling,” said Mr. Kumar.

Charges

131,2020/02/24,"Bride gets Constitution, Koran as ‘mehr’","Malappuram groom hands over the copies to the bride at Nikah

When P.A. Nishad from Angadipuram in the district gave the Indian Constitution as mehr to his bride Najma Thabsheera last week, it set a new milestone in the history of Muslim marriages and in the ongoing protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Mehr is an obligatory gift given by a Muslim man to his bride. Mr. Nishad, a lawyer practising at the Kerala High Court, did not think twice when Ms. Thabsheera, an LLM student at Calicut University, demanded a copy of the Constitution and the Koran as her mehr.

Family hesitant

Mr. Nishad said he had a tough time convincing his orthodox Sunni family. But perceptions changed when he stepped on to the Nikah venue carrying gilded copies of the Koran and the Constitution.

Muslim spiritual and political leader Syed Hyderali Shihab Thangal solemnised the marriage, and praised him for initiating a move that can ring in a revolution in the Muslim marriage system in Kerala. Soon congratulatory messages started pouring in. In the orthodox Muslim community in the State, the non-Islamic dowry by the bride to the groom is widely practised. The mehr given by the groom is usually in proportion to the dowry given by the bride’s family.

“Apart from sending home the message against dowry, we wanted to tell the people that the Constitution is as important as the Koran for Muslims in India. It is the Constitution that protects the Koran in our country,” said Mr. Nishad, district secretary of the Muslim Students Federation and coordinator of the Valluvanadan Samskarika Vedi.

Several dignitaries, including High Court judge N. Nagaresh, attended his wedding largely because of it being different. But Mr. Nishad gives the credit to Ms. Thabsheera. “I salute her for being bold. It was her choice. If we can inspire youngsters, it will be a great blessing from God,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dw8l63/article30906947.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25tvmpm-Constitution,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bride-gets-constitution-koran-as-mahr/article30906948.ece
132,2020/02/24,"Students miss exam, school officials held","School lacks CBSE affiliation

Even as Class X students of CBSE schools across the State were busy writing the board examination that began on Monday, 29 students of Arooja’s Little Stars School at Moolamkuzhy, near Fort Kochi, were restrained from appearing for the examination owing to the non-affiliation of the school with the CBSE.

As the protest against the school management soared with youth outfits of almost all political parties taking out marches to the school, the Thoppumpady police arrested two members of the management. The arrested were identified as Maggi Arooja, 55, school manager, and her husband Melbin Dcruz, 59.

They were produced before the court and remanded. The police are likely to arrest the Principal as well.

The case was registered following petitions filed by parents of students. The police charged the arrested with IPC Sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention).

Since the school does not have CBSE affiliation, the management has been making arrangements for the past seven years at various schools for the students to take the examination. Parents and teachers had presumed that a similar system would be in place this year as well, but they recently learnt that the management of other schools had rejected the request to allow students to write the exams through their schools.

Though parents and teachers had been enquiring about hall tickets for the past few weeks, they were allegedly kept in the dark about the imbroglio. It is alleged that the management would have known at least by October last year that the students were not registered, and that their request to the CBSE Board to conduct exams directly were rejected.

It is learned that the district education officials had rejected the school’s application for No Objection Certificate (NOC) for CBSE affiliation many times as the school did not meet the requirements. In fact, the Deputy Director of Education (DDE) had issued notice for closure of the school, which the management did not comply with.

Suhas urged parents to check the credentials of educational institutions before enrolling their children.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/students-miss-exam-school-officials-held/article30906942.ece
133,2020/02/24,COVID-19: State ponders over next step,"Focus of surveillance to be on detecting possible community-level virus transmission

As the COVID-19 epidemic spreads across countries the State, too, is bracing to launch its next phase of surveillance to pick up any virus transmission in the community. Kerala’s initial response to COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan and the possibility of the infection being imported to the State was pre-emptive and focussed.

Given the manner in which the situation surrounding COVID-19 has rapidly changed across the globe, the State’s initial strategy of aggressively isolating and imposing quarantine on all travellers from Wuhan seems to have been spot-on.

However, now that the risk stratification has changed and there is on-going local transmission of COVID-19 in not just China, but Singapore, South Korea and Italy, there is a lot of confusion regarding the steps that the State should adopt.

Best response

With even the WHO now accepting that the “window of opportunity” for the containment of the virus is as good as lost, the crucial question would be whether Kerala can sustain the aggressive response it launched in the first phase and manage to check a possible community-level transmission.

“Kerala’s response in the initial phase has been the best because we did not wait for a case to surface in community before initiating containment measures. Against all advisories by WHO and ICMR, we isolated and quarantined Wuhan-returnees ahead and then tested them to identify cases. Kerala’s all three COVID-19 cases were already in isolation in hospitals when they developed the mildest of symptoms (day 1 or 2), which is why we could prevent a secondary spread. Not even a single family member of the positive cases contracted the infection from them,” said a public health expert.

“In the next phase, our focus should be on detecting possible community-level transmission at the earliest. We have proposed that our response be scaled up by initiating hospital-based surveillance and investigation of all cases of viral pneumonia with bilateral lung infiltration, even if the patient has had no history of travel,” R. Aravind, Head of Infectious Diseases, Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Thiruvananthapuram, said.

“The Outbreak Monitoring Units in MCHs are already flagging and investigating all cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia, encephalitis, diarrhoea or hepatic failure without diagnosis. We need to scale up this system across the State, in major government hospitals and rope in private hospitals too,” he said.

Infections in hospitals

SARS-CoV-2 has been estimated to have caused about 41% infections inside hospitals. So all hospital employees with mild fever, dry cough and fatigue, should be closely monitored and followed up. The State could also go through the records of at least sentinel hospitals in the past three years to examine the general trend of the incidence of viral pneumonia, to pick up any change in the pattern.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-state-ponders-over-next-step/article30906935.ece

135,2020/02/24,MVD seeks to ensure pedestrian safety,"The department shoots off a letter urging the district administration to clear wayside encroachments

Taking note of the rising number of road accidents involving pedestrians, the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) has approached the Kottayam district administration with a request to clear off the wayside encroachments.

The letter, undersigned by Tojo M. Thomas, Regional Transport Officer (Enforcement), stated that the presence of unauthorised shops along all major streets of the town had severely affected the safety of pedestrians.

Besides encroaching on the public space, they deprived the pedestrians of the footpaths, forcing them to walk on the roads near the Seematti Round, the Thirunakkara bus station, and the junction where the Kurian Uthup Road meets the Sasthri Road.

Need for classification

The letter further pointed out a decision taken at a meeting on January 16 to classify the Kottayam municipal area into vending and non-vending areas and requested the Collector to issue necessary directions to the civic body and the Public Works Department to expedite its implementation.

Commenting on the letter, Mr. Thomas said the letter sought to highlight that the safety of people and vehicles was a shared responsibility of all agencies and not just the MVD and the police.

Though the Motor Vehicle Rules gave the first priority to pedestrian rights even at uncontrolled pedestrian crosses, it had neither been respected nor enforced.

Threat

“These unauthorised shops pose a threat to not just the pedestrians but the vehicles that ply on these roads. There are even points where the roofs of such illegal shops protrude onto the road, forcing the vehicles to take a sudden drift to the right side and raising the spectre of accidents,’’ he said.

A joint survey carried out recently identified over 230 wayside encroachment in and around the Kottayam town.

Meanwhile, the MVD also sought to enforce lane discipline norms on the major roads including the Main Central Road and the National Highway to bring down the accidents.

Interceptor vehicles would be deployed at different locations for the purpose and stern action would be initiated against the heavy vehicles including the KSRTC buses violating the norm.

“Majority of the accidents in Kottayam have taken place due to violation of the lane norms, especially by the heavy vehicles. While the drives will be imposed fines in the first offence, suspension of licence and prosecution will follow in case of repeated offences,” said an official.

Latest victim

The latest victim of road accidents in Kottayam was a 38-year-old school teacher, identified as Bijimol of Ettumanoor.

The accident took place on Saturday night when the two-wheeler she rode was hit by a KSRTC bus from behind.

Bijimol’s husband Jomon and their two-and-half-year-old daughter Elizabeth, who were riding pillion on the two-wheeler, sustained injuries.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mvd-seeks-to-ensure-pedestrian-safety/article30906906.ece

The State government has decided to clean 20,000-km-long stretches of canals in the State before Onam, Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac has said.

He was inaugurating a project for the cleaning and deepening of Karikkathodu in Mararikulam North grama panchayat on Monday.

MGNREGS

“The local bodies should join the State government in this effort. The panchayats should utilise the labour force under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) for removing silt from canals. Coir geotextiles should be laid to protect its banks,” Dr. Isaac said.

According to officials, the renovation work of Karikkathodu will be carried out jointly with the Irrigation Department. A sum of ₹88 lakh has been earmarked for removing silt and deepening the waterbody.

Project prepared

Besides, Karikkathodu, the panchayat prepared a project for cleaning and deepening of two other canals — Valiyathodu and A.S. Canal.

The beautification of Valiyathodu will be carried out at a cost of ₹1.67 crore.

An amount of ₹3 crore has been set aside for the cleaning and deepening of the AS Canal.

Speaking at the function, D. Priyesh Kumar, president, Mararikulam North grama panchayat, said three centres for distributing midday meals would be launched in the local body from March 1.

NSO field officers have been facing non-cooperation in several places in the State with people fearing that the surveys are somehow linked to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act [CAA] and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The NSO sample surveys were unrelated either to the population census or the National Population Register (NPR), Ms. Bhaskar pointed out.

At the same time, data collected by the NSO were critical for the determination of poverty line, assessment of government programmes, consumption and expenditure patterns, entrepreneurial activities, estimation of unemployment rates, status of agricultural households and evaluation of facilities in health and education sectors.

With the protests threatening to derail its data collection, NSO is seeking to generate awareness about its surveys. It has also formally appealed to the State government for support. While NSO has not demanded police protection for its field officers, it has requested the police department to ensure a smooth working environment for them.

At the moment, a number of surveys were under way in the State, she said. Among others, this included the 78th round of socio-economic survey focusing on domestic tourism expenditure and multiple indicators, the periodic labour force survey, the 7th economic survey and the annual survey on unincorporated sector enterprises. The success of these surveys depended chiefly on the co-operation of the public, Ms. Bhaskar said. For the data collection, trained officers of the NSO would visit villages/urban blocks chosen on the basis of a scientifically-designed sample technique.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nso-seeks-public-support-for-sample-surveys-in-kerala/article30906821.ece

139,2020/02/24,Tribal girl allegedly raped by relative in Wayanad,"Police say uncle molested minor at knifepoint

A minor tribal girl was raped allegedly by a close relative at knifepoint under the Sulthan Bathery police station limits in the district on Monday morning.

The 14-year-old was raped by her uncle, who went absconding after her parents approached the police, M.D. Sunil, Circle Inspector, Sulthan Bathery, said.

Threatened

The accused, aged 35, had taken the girl to a remote forest area and raped her at knifepoint.

The incident came to light after a group of children of the settlement told their relatives that they had witnessed a man taking the girl to a nearby forest by threatening her with a knife around 8 a.m.

3-hour search in forest

The girl was rescued after a three-hour search by the police and the Forest Department officials, Mr. Sunil said. In the medical examination that followed, doctors confirmed rape, he said.

The girl would be sent back to the settlement with her parents after recording her statement before the First Class Judicial Magistrate at Sulthan Bathery, Mr. Sunil added.

A case has been registered under various Sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act against the accused, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tribal-girl-allegedly-raped-by-relative-in-wayanad/article30906802.ece
140,2020/02/24,Division Benches recuse themselves from hearing,"Govt. appeal against takeover of church

Two Division Benches of the Kerala High Court on Monday recused themselves from hearing an appeal filed by the State government against a single judge’s verdict directing the Ernakulam District Collector to take over the Kothamangalam Cheriyapally, its precincts, and all its movable properties and hand them over to the vicar of the Orthodox faction after removing the protesters on the church premises.

The Bench comprising Chief Justice S. Manikumar and Justice Shaji P.Chali recused from hearing the appeal. Later it was posted before the Bench comprising Justice C.K. Adbul Rehim and Justice T.V.Anilkumar, which also recused from hearing the appeal. It will now come up for hearing before another Bench.

SC verdict

The government in its appeal said the directive was against the judgment of the Supreme Court relating to the church.

The Supreme Court had held that the church and the cemetery could not be confiscated by anybody. It had to be with the parishioners.

Parishioners’ role

In fact, the single judge did not take into consideration the State government’s submission that before implementing the Supreme Court judgment, it was necessary to identify the parishioners and who continued to have faith in the Malankara church.

In fact, it was not possible to remove the parishioners from the church and the cemetery before identifying them. It was probable that a law and order situation might arise if the Orthodox faction was allowed to enter the church before properly identifying the persons entitled to participate in the religious ceremonies.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/division-benches-recuse-themselves-from-hearing/article30906787.ece
141,2020/02/24,Idukki on guard against wildfire,"Unprecedented rise in temperature a concern

Two devastating wildfires that ravaged the forests in Idukki were the one at Kurangini forests bordering Tamil Nadu in March 2018 and that at the Kurinji sanctuary, Vattavada forests, and Pampadum Shola in April 2019.

While the Kurangini fire claimed 18 lives, nearly 300 acres of forestland was destroyed in the latter case.

Common occurrence

Forest fires are a common occurrence every year with its severity ranging from case to case. Though the district has been free of major incidents this year, forest officials are on alert to its threat perspective in the light of the unprecedented rise in temperature over the past 15 days. Most forest grasslands have already dried up and vulnerable to fire. They said focus was on participatory management of fire-control measures involving forest-dependent communities this year. As only a meagre allotment was made for fireline clearance, there were more chances of forest fires.

However, Assistant Conservator of Forest (Social Forestry) Saby Varghese said controlled burning was done and found more effective in reducing the risk of forest fires.

While it countered chances of forest fires, it also helped in growing more green grass as fodder for the wildlife.

Mr. Varghese said while the forest-dependent communities were involved in the counter measures, the public also had a role in preventing wildfires. Stubble burning in farmlands left forests vulnerable as sparks may move with the wind, he said stressing the need for the public to be sensitised about the issue.

“In the wake of Amazon fires one can imagine the magnitude of damage fire can cause once it goes out of control.” He said almost all sanctuaries and reserves in the district were prone to wildfires.

However, at the Eravikulam National Park and the Periyar Tiger Reserve, controlled burning was being done systematically to reduce the risk of forest fires, officials said.

“When the threat of fire looms large, new strategies need to be adopted. If we do not receive summer rain soon, there is a threat of forest drying up affecting the wildlife too,” they said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/r3kfcx/article30909866.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24tv-fire,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/idukki-on-guard-against-wildfire/article30906781.ece
142,2020/02/24,IITs and IIMs join hands,"Consortium launched to boost Indian entrepreneurship ecosystem

Premier technical and management institutions in the country — IIT Madras, IIT Bombay, IIM Bangalore, IIM Calcutta and IIM Kozhikode — have joined hands to launch a consortium to boost Indian entrepreneurship ecosystem through high quality research in innovation, venturing and entrepreneurship.

Called ‘Innovation-Venturing and Entrepreneurship in India Network (iVEIN),’ this network of institutions will leverage strengths of the partners and will work with other stakeholders such as incubators, government and investors to generate and disseminate knowledge.

iVEIN was launched on the sidelines of ‘Dialogue with Stakeholders’ event held by SINE (Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship) at IIT Bombay, last week, a release said here.

Objectives

The objectives of iVEIN network include the creation of an interdisciplinary body of knowledge synthesising multiple perspectives, which would meet the requirements of policy makers, academic researchers, students, innovators, entrepreneurs, investors and all those interested in innovation and ventures.

Besides, tracking the contours of the vibrant innovation, venturing and entrepreneurship segment in the country and develop a holistic and analytical narrative on the dynamics that drive the development in these areas. Also, helping in effective policy formulation at multiple levels; develop thought leadership for practice and seed the creation of a society that will organise annual conferences, publish a journal, and design a data repository in the areas of innovation and entrepreneurship.

Report

The immediate activity that would be taken up by iVEIN would be to publish the India innovation, venture and entrepreneurship report.

Conceptualised as a biennial publication, the first report would be published in 2020 with the theme: ‘creating successful ventures’.

Institutes, organisations and individuals, especially policy makers, investment managers, practitioners and entrepreneurs with active interest in entrepreneurship, innovation and venturing have been invited to join the network to facilitate and promote collaborative research.

Prof Debashis Chatterjee, Director, IIM Kozhikode said that this initiative of launching a consortium was a pioneering concept being offered by world class Indian institutions possessing the richest legacy in the field of technology and management.

Forging a close linkage between academic and R and D institutions on the one hand and industry on the other hand would not only enable and empower the future entrepreneurs but also open up previously unexplored avenues for resource sharing, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/iits-and-iims-join-hands/article30906758.ece
143,2020/02/24,A shot in the arm for coastal shipping,"Incentive for vessel operators in Kollam, Beypore and Azhikkal ports

The operational incentive for vessel operators has been enhanced by the government as part of promoting coastal shipping in the State.

The operational incentive will be 50% of the road transportation cost per loaded containers of 20 feet and will be applicable to the ports of Kollam, Beypore and Azhikkal at the rates prevalent in Cochin port and Vallarpadam container terminal.

The reference rates will be those decided by the respective Port authorities.

An enhanced operational incentive of 30% to be above rates will be applicable to the 40 feet containers.

The decision to enhance the operational incentive is based on the recommendations by a committee that was asked by the government to look into the suggestions of Director of the Ports and the proposal given by the Chief Executive Officer, Kerala Maritime Board.

While setting up the committee to look into the proposals, the government was of the view that a State policy could not be formulated without scientific study.

The revised operational incentive has been notified and government will review the impact and effectiveness of the scheme after six months, sources said.

The Kerala Maritime Board had been asked to do scientific study on the incentives to be given to promote coastal shipping services in the State and to submit report in three months.

The incentives are to be disbursed and settled every fortnightly and should be released after adjusting any port charges due from operator. The amount of port charges so adjusted and due to the Kerala Maritime Board will be reimbursed to them.

Operating procedure

The government has also asked the maritime board to prepare and implement a standard operating procedure for enhancing port productivity and reducing the turnaround time of vessels at the ports.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/5yqm77/article30909872.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25tv-coastal-shipcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/operational-incentive-for-coastal-shipping-enhanced/article30905281.ece
144,2020/02/24,People should get timely justice: judge,"A. Mohammed Mushtaq, judge, High Court of Kerala, has said that people should get justice in a timely manner. He was delivering the keynote address at the foundation stone laying of the Payyannur court complex here on Sunday. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan laid the foundation stone. There is a perception among people that they do not get justice in a timely manner, he said.

“Judges and lawyers have lost the sense that the courts are for the people. We have judges sitting in ivory towers. It is sad,” he said.

When judges and lawyers do not intervene according to the people's problems and circumstances, the time when society rejects them is not remote, warned Justice Mushtaq. That is the lesson that Hyderabad offers, he added.

He further observed that the lawyers were once the correctionalists, they are liable to point out the degradations of the judiciary. But many are hesitant about it, he said.

The justice opined that the judiciary must change over time. Technology must be used efficiently. But in our country, including the clerks, they are taking a backward approach, he said and added that they try to stay the same old fashioned way.

He said that there is a lot of support from the government for reforms. But the system does not agree to change. The issue is between lawyers and judges. The virtual court system was an attempt at this change. By switching to online the effort was to reduce the work of the Clerk. But they couldn't even recognize it, he pointed.

147,2020/02/24,Kuttanad school grows Wayanad’s rare paddy crops,"11 varieties cultivated in 4.5 cents on the campus of St. Aloysius LP School will be harvested soon

It is that time of year again. After battling odds, paddy farmers in Kuttanad, the rice bowl of Kerala, are eagerly waiting for another bumper harvest.

Joining some 35,000 paddy farmers in ‘Koythu Utsavam’— the harvest of the ‘puncha’ crop — are 180 students and teachers of St. Aloysius Lower Primary School, Edathua, in Kuttanad.

The school has cultivated 11 rice varieties, including rare and indigenous species, in 4.5 cents of land on its campus. In the coming days, there will be a bountiful harvest of ‘Rakthashali’, a nearly extinct variety of rice with high medicinal value. Apart from farming Rakthashali in 2.75 cents, they have grown Jeerakasala, Koduveliyan, Chomala, Mullankaima, Gandhakasala, Thavalakannan, Mundakan, Kanali, Kanakam and Okkan puncha. A majority of them are traditional rice varieties of Wayanad and largely unknown to Kuttanad.

Inspiration

Sister Lins Mary, headmistress of the school says that the initiative took inspiration from ‘Padam Onnu Padathekku’ project of the State government. “Cooperation from students, parents, and teachers has helped us script a success story,” she says.

To cultivate different varieties of paddy, the school transformed a portion of its playground into a field with the help of a digger machine. The seeds were collected from Cheruvayal Raman, a traditional farmer from Wayanad. Organic farming methods were adopted and only bio-fertilizers were used. A bio-fence was created around the field using marigold plants.

“Most of the students in the school are from agricultural families or with farming backgrounds. Through the venture we have inculcated in students the skill and knowledge of agriculture. Beyond this, our children can have pesticide-free meals at least a day,” says Thomas Mathew, a teacher at the school.

Star of the initiative

Mr. Mathew says that the focus was on the cultivation of ‘Rakthashali’. “The majority of the farmers in Kuttanad are cultivating Uma rice variety. Rakthashali with red husk and grain is considered uneconomical compared to high-yielding rice varieties. But, we are expecting a good harvest. Upon seeing Rakthashali at the school, a lot of farmers in the region are evincing interest in cultivating the variety. We are also planning to extend the area of paddy cultivation in the school in the coming season,” he says.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/xk0qrg/article30898002.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24tval4-schoolpaddy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kuttanad-school-grows-wayanads-rare-paddy-crops/article30898003.ece

Day temperatures are likely to be two to three degrees above the normal on Monday in Alappuzha, Kottayam, Kozhikode and Kannur, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has warned.

The warning was applicable to the four districts on Sunday also. With the summer closing in, maximum temperatures were higher than the normal by over two degrees in most districts on Saturday.

Kottayam had reported a departure from the normal day-time temperature by 3.6 degrees.

In view of the heat alert, the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) has urged the public — especially the aged, pregnant women and children — to avoid direct sunlight between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. and drink lots of water to prevent dehydration.

It is also advisable to carry umbrellas and caps while travelling, KSDMA said.

149,2020/02/24,Overloaded heavy vehicles pose threat,"Absence of enforcement of load compliance contributes to violation of rules

The increase in the permissible truck axle load for existing vehicles and new vehicles hitting the road and the decision not to check container lorries at the checkposts of the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) in the State have raised safety concerns in the wake of the Avinashi road accident which claimed 19 lives. The amendments were made by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) to increase the carrying capacity of goods vehicles by 20 to 25% and lower logistics costs by about two per cent.

The amendments, aimed at promoting commercial transport in the country, also lay down that the gross vehicle weight (GVW) should not exceed the total permissible safe axle weight.

In the absence of adequate enforcement of rated load compliance in the road corridors, official sources say practice of overload by heavy vehicles plying in the State and operating on the inter-State corridor is a serious road safety threat.

Upgraded tyres

Higher loads on heavy vehicles require upgraded tyres and new specifications of the axles. The existing heavy vehicles on the road are not certified for safety with the higher-axle loads, it has been pointed out. These overloaded vehicles may not be able to meet the mandatory braking and steering performance requirements as they are designed only for the Registered Laden Weight (RLW).

“This is a serious concern and the policymakers should take a look into the amendment of the rule by MoRTH to increase the axle load that is being misused by truck operators. The wear and tear caused to the roads is also being ignored,” the official said. The decision at the government level not to carry out checking of container lorries at the checkposts is also turning out to be a threat to the road users.

A top MVD official admitted that the checking of container lorries for fitness of the vehicle, driver and goods and whether they were overloaded had been stopped.

“The checking of these trucks were stopped on the basis of the complaints that checking leads to delay of transport of goods to International Container Transshipment Terminal at Vallarpadam and to Tuticorin,” he said. At present, only verification of papers is being carried out at the checkposts.

With the roll-out of the Goods and Service Tax (GST) in the country, these trucks neither stop at the GST checkposts nor at the checkposts of the Excise Department. It is only on tip-off that they are stopped at the checkposts.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/qshsm2/article30900847.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24TVOVERLOAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/overloaded-heavy-vehicles-pose-threat/article30897737.ece
150,2020/02/24,Stigma-free campus,"St. Mira’s College, Pune, has initiated a programme to normalise the talk around mental health, making it easier for students to seek help

The Asian Journal of Psychiatry recently reported that 37.7% of students suffer from moderate depression in Indian universities. India also has one of the highest student suicide rates in the world, and according to the National Crime Records Bureau, on an average, a student commits suicide every hour. Students undergo a range of emotions such as stress, anger, anxiety induced by factors including peer pressure, academics, phone addiction, body image issues, relationship issues, and loneliness, thus triggering thoughts about suicide and self-harm.

This is the prime reason why a student’s mental wellbeing is of the utmost importance. Unfortunately, mental health awareness in higher education is facing a crisis, and there is a need for a programme that is primarily preventive in nature and organically integrates as an intervention model.

This is exactly what St. Mira’s College, Pune, has done. The college’s Department of Psychology has initiated a programme for students that is run by trained counsellors and clinical psychologists to support and nurture their wellbeing.

Inclusive

It all started with a survey that was conducted to explore existing beliefs, help-seeking behaviours and mental wellbeing concerns faced by its students. “As many as 860 students participated in an online survey which reflected that a majority of them were facing several mental health concerns and they stated that they would access services if the college provided it,” explains Prof. Gidwani, Principal.

The curriculum of the programme was developed keeping the survey results in mind. It features a three-tier approach of awareness sessions, group therapy and individual counselling. The programme has been integrated into the existing curriculum, across streams and classes.

The awareness sessions are primarily designed to make students aware of what they are experiencing and critical signs of distress to be noted so that they know when to seek help. Students are active participants in organising sessions and are encouraged to create a supportive environment and create safer classrooms which are free of judgement and stigma.

Prof. Jaya Rajgopalan, head of the psychology department, asserts that a healthy college is where students feel empowered to take control of their daily routine, feel involved and are able to work towards personal wellbeing and growth. This requires teachers and staff with the right knowledge, skills and resources. “Sessions are conducted for teachers to ensure that they have the necessary information and knowledge to identify students and reduce stigma and discrimination in classrooms. And that is the reason why this programme is a major component of the entire academic year for our college,” she says.

Having full-time counsellors and psychologists on campus, readily accessible to students, has helped in breaking the stigma around mental health and seeking help. Today, the programme is well-integrated into the college’s system with corridor talks, small conversations in the canteen, and so on, making it more student-centric and helping them normalise the idea of mental wellbeing.

Important three

There are three major arms to the mental wellbeing programme: Promotion, Prevention and Intervention.

Mental health promotion is any action taken to maximise mental health and wellbeing among students. College platforms such as notice boards and classroom discussions are used to promote the need and importance of mental wellbeing. The need of the hour is programmes that support and strengthen coping strategies, that promote awareness and acceptance of cultural diversity.

Prevention refers to interventions that occur before the initial onset of a disorder to prevent its development. The focused group therapy sessions and workshops aim at identifying risk factors for a student’s mental health and enhancing protective factors such as peer support, sense of trust, and so on, that promote mental wellbeing.

Early intervention are appropriate and specifically target people displaying early signs and symptoms of a mental health issue to enable timely, effective and appropriate treatment.

“This is a platform designed and curated for start-ups based out of tier-2 and tier-3 towns and those from the rural pockets. Over the long term, the idea is to churn out 1,000 entrepreneurs over the next ten years,” said R. Sivarajah, Director of Winways Systems Private Limited and Director of Nativelead.

Madurai-based Nativelead in association with the Entrepreneurship Development and Innovative Institute (EDII) are cherry picking start-ups that would make it to the top 100. EDII was constituted by the Government of Tamil Nadu as a not-for-profit society and is administered by the Department of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME).

To identify the 100 start-ups, a programme called Thedal (in search) has already commenced across Tamil Nadu. “We are going to each town and picking start-ups that will enter the finals. The short-listed start-ups will also attend a boot camp to understand the nuances of the business,” Mr. Sivarajah added. According to him, the objective of this event is not just funding but creating an ecosystem for start-ups in the State.

Technology Entrepreneur Suresh Sambandam, the CEO of Kissflow and founder of Orangescape, said that Tamil Nadu has done well in executing master strokes around primary education and higher education that have led to a largw amount of professional talent but the State had not done anything to increase jobs. “If we need to create more jobs it can only be done by creating more entrepreneurs.

154,2020/02/24,"On SSI murder trail, NIA conducts searches in T.N.","Sleuths of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), probing the murder of Special Sub-Inspector of Police Y. Wilson at Kaliyakkavilai check-post on January 8 and other cases, conducted simultaneous searches across the State on the premises of suspects early on Monday.

The focus of the investigation was to find out how the suspects already arrested or those on the run managed to procure SIM cards. It is suspected that retailers helped them in activating the SIM cards on the basis of documents provided by other customers.

In Cuddalore, police sources said a team searched the residence of Kaja Moideen, prime accused in the murder of Hindu Munnani leader K.P.S. Suresh Kumar in 2014. Moideen had skipped trial in the murder case in December and disappeared from the police radar. He was accused of planning a terror strike in Delhi and was arrested by the police in January.

The team conducted searches at the houses of Moideen’s family members at Kollumedu in Kattumannarkovil and Block 7 in Neyveli and reportedly seized a laptop and cell phones. The team also conducted searches at the residence of Moideen’s associates Jaffar Ali in Pattambakkam and Abdul Samad in Parangipettai for their alleged role in the murder of SSI Wilson.

In Salem, searches were conducted at the residence and shop run by an accused, Abdul Rahman, in Mohamed Pura, police sources said. Rahman was arrested recently on charges of providing SIM cards to those involved with a terror module. Rahman’s relatives said that the police took away an old passport, a few publications and photocopies of ID proof submitted by customers for getting SIM cards.

NIA sources said that in Thoothukudi searches were conducted at a house in Kaayalpattinam near Tiruchendur in connection with Wilson’s murder. A mobile phone and some documents were seized.

Since the accused in the murder of Wilson, Abdul Shameem of Thiruvithancode and Thoufiq of Elankadai near Nagercoil, reportedly visited the house of one Syed Ali Nawaz, who is in jail in connection with the murder of the Hindu Munnani leader, at Kaayalpattinam before gunning down the police officer, his house was searched.

The NIA team, led by Sub-Inspector of Police Sivakumar, searched for evidence Nawaz’s house in the presence of his second wife Mohideen Fatima, and seized a mobile phone without a SIM card from her. The team also questioned her about calls she had made to a few numbers.

“The NIA team suspects that Thoufiq and five others came to the house of Syed Ali Nawaz on December 11. Hence, the investigators want to know the purpose behind their visit and also about the persons who accompanied Thoufiq,” the police said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/94lpc4/article30901244.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/nia-conducts-searches-at-salem/article30901068.ece

157,2020/02/24,Aptel sets aside tariff order for biomass plants,"Producers’ association finds capital cost of ₹ 5.50 crore per MW extremely low

Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (Aptel), New Delhi, has set aside the components of tariff determined by the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC) for biomass plants in 2016.

Biomass is an industry term for organic material from plants and animals used as fuel. The Biomass Power Producers Association, Tamil Nadu, had challenged the components of the generic tariff for biomass-based generating stations issued by the TNERC on March 31, 2016, before Aptel. It had named the TNERC and Tangedco as respondents. The association pointed out that the capital cost of ₹5.50 crore per MW was extremely low, while the TNERC and Tangedco justified it on the ground that it was 24% more than the previous order.

However, Aptel rejected the TNERC’s plea that it has to follow its own regulations and database for arriving at various parameters to be allowed to the biomass plants.

“In fact, the determination of tariff has to be undertaken by State Commissions as per their own regulations, but the various parameters influencing the capital cost have to be based on certain realistic data and its due analysis. Pending such collection of data and prudent analysis, the State Commissions could make reference to the data and analysis of the Central Commission, which is referred to by almost all State Regulatory Commissions,” it said.

The Aptel said there could not be a uniform capital cost for biomass plants using different technologies. The capital cost of ₹6.10 crore per MW as determined by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) at that time for rice straw and juliflora (plantation) based biomass plants with water-cooled condensers, may also be considered for the power plant of the Biomass Power Producers Association in Tamil Nadu using same technology. Noting that determination of various parameters for setting the tariff for biomass plants by the State Commission as inadequate, Aptel said the same must be looked into afresh by the State Commission. It is directed to pass an appropriate order within three months, it said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aptel-sets-aside-tariff-order-for-biomass-plants/article30898896.ece
158,2020/02/24,Tamil bags first place in online contest,"Twelve out of 62 participants were first-time contributors

In an intensely fought competition among Indian languages, Tamil has bagged the first place in the second edition of ‘Project Tiger’, organised by Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) and Google, with a total number of 2,959 articles contributed by 62 participants.

Experts say the well-researched articles, which have helped increase Tamil content online, will act as a database. Google and WMF launched the competition in 2018 with an aim to increase the online content of vernacular languages by motivating participants to contribute articles to Wikipedia. The second edition of the three-month-long competition commenced on October 10 and the results were announced recently.

In the first edition of the competition, Tamil lost the first place to Punjabi in a closely-fought contest. But, this time, with the highest number of participants as well as articles contributed by them, Tamil has secured the first spot.

“It is important to note that 12 out of the 62 participants were first-time contributors. This shows that there are more people who are interested in contributing Tamil content online,” says S. Rajaraman, a software engineer, and one of the admin of Tamil Wikipedia, who goes by the pen name ‘Neechalkaran’.

Explaining the importance of the performance, Mr. Rajaraman says articles were written on important topics suggested by Google. “Articles have been mostly written on important places, personalities and on entertainment. Also, only articles with proper references were approved. Hence, the focus was not only on the number of articles written for the competition, but also on their quality.”

Couple’s contribution

A couple from Salem, S. Balasubramanian, Superintendent at the School Education Department, and his wife V. Vasantha Lakshmi, have contributed a total of 899 articles. “These articles will be highly useful for Tamil medium students and scholars, as Wikipedia is the first tab that appears when a topic is searched on any search engine,” he says.

Keerthi Jeyaraj, Director of EduRight Foundation, a non-governmental organisation, which also focuses on the skill development of Tamil teachers, says the victory shows how participants have contributed creative content in Tamil. “This win will motivate more people to contribute creative content in the future,” he says.

The organisers will conduct a training programme for the winning team.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-bags-first-place-in-online-contest/article30898887.ece
159,2020/02/24,Chromium waste remains a threat in Ranipet,"Water in five major waterbodies contaminated by the waste dumped in TNCCL unit

The exchange of letters and a long haul of protests have failed to draw attention of the authorities concerned to the problem of water contamination in Ranipet, which has now become a district headquarters.

Residents of Ranipet pointed out that the chromium-bearing waste lying on the open land on the premises of Tamil Nadu Chromate and Chemicals Ltd. at SIPCOT Industrial Complex has been contaminating groundwater in the 30-km radius. Promises by elected representatives and assurances from officials who visit the place whenever there are strong protests have become a routine affair.

Commissioned in 1976, the TCCL was involved in the production of sodium dichromate, basic chromium sulphate and sodium sulphate. It stopped its operations in 1995 and has been abandoned since then. An estimated 1.5 lakh tonnes of chromium-bearing waste remains at the site. This has rendered 600 acres of agricultural land barren, according to farmers associations.

According to a report submitted by Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board in 2016, the soil and the groundwater in the surroundings of the site have been contaminated with chromium. The waste pile-up occupies about two hectares of land. The Geological Survey of India had reported that hexavalent chromium contamination had spread in the southern direction up to a distance of 2-2.5 km. The report, titled ‘Predominant sources contributing to various pollutants’, mentions the chromium waste deposits as one of the main reasons, farmers say. “Twenty villages located around the factory site have been affected by the chromium effluents,” said L.C. Mani, a farmers' leader, from Lalapet. He said, “Five major lakes, including Thandalam and Manianpattu, have been contaminated to such an extent that the water cannot be used for any purpose.” Several representations were made to the Union and State government departments and agencies, but to no avail.

He added that in a reply to his petition submitted at farmers grievance meeting, TNPCB had replied that Central Pollution Control Board had made efforts to remove this mound of residue through National Clean Energy Fund. A consultant appointed by the CPCB had submitted an interim report. The TNPCB was monitoring the water pollution levels arising out of the mound.

It is clear that the Union and State governments should jointly bear the expenditure of the clean-up operation, Mr. Mani said.

Ranipet District Collector S. Divyadharshini said that both the CPCB and the TNPCB were working to find a solution as suggested by the report of the consultant. She said that the district administration was striving to reduce the level of contamination.

Political will is required to resolve this long-pending issue which has been causing hardship to the people of the area for several years, say members of Vellore Farmers Association.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/r7j6us/article30898351.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THVELLORECHROMIUM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/chromium-waste-remains-a-threat-in-ranipet/article30898352.ece
160,2020/02/24,Vaiko urges PM to sack Animal Husbandry Minister,"MDMK chief cites Giriraj Singh’s controversial remarks

MDMK founder Vaiko on Sunday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to sack Union Minister for Animal Husbandry Giriraj Singh for “constantly making controversial remarks”.

He was reacting to the Minister’s statement that “our forefathers” did not send Muslims to Pakistan during partition in 1947 and, as a result, “we paid a heavy price”.

In a statement, Mr. Vaiko urged the BJP to clarify whether the Minister’s remark reflected the party’s stand on the issue. He said the Minister was acting against the constitutional oath he had taken and was ignoring his party leaders’ advice not to make such remarks.

In another statement issued in response to the AIADMK government’s decision to cancel a notification on the creation of a Petroleum, Chemical and Petrochemical Investment Region (PCPIR) in Cuddalore and Nagapattinam, Mr. Vaiko claimed the move represented a victory for his party.

The MDMK leader said he had been consistently seeking the withdrawal of the notification ever since it was issued in July 2017. The MDMK had held protests demanding the withdrawal of the notification, he noted. He reiterated his party’s demand for cancelling an agreement signed by the State government with Haldia Petrochemicals for a petrochemical project in Cuddalore district.

Mr. Vaiko also highlighted his demand for cancelling the nod given to Vedanta Group and ONGC for hydrocarbon exploration, in order to ensure that the Cauvery delta region remains a protected agricultural zone.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/vaiko-urges-pm-to-sack-animal-husbandry-minister/article30898308.ece

162,2020/02/24,Withdraw or slash import duty on gold: Ramadoss,"Move needed to keep prices in check, says PMK leader

The import duty on gold should either be withdrawn or drastically reduced to keep prices in check, PMK founder S. Ramadoss has said.

In a statement, he pointed out that in 2012-13, then Finance Minister P. Chidambaram introduced a 2% import duty on gold, which was gradually increased to 10%.

“At the time, we were given an assurance that the import duty would be withdrawn when the current account deficit falls. However, the Congress-led government did not keep its promise. Narendra Modi had also pledged to scrap the import duty if the BJP-led NDA came to power. However, that promise has not been kept, and the import duty has been increased to 12.5%,” Dr. Ramadoss said.

Further, the GST and wastage charges levied by jewellers were increasing the cost to customers. For instance, customers were spending ₹8,455 extra to buy 8 grams of gold as a result of the import duty, taxes and wastage charges, which will hit the poor, he said.

Reducing the import duty will help curb gold smuggling, increase government revenue and bring down the cost of purchase to the end customer by at least ₹5,000, he added.

Dr. Ramadoss alleged that jewellers were exploiting customers on the pretext of levying wastage charges, which should be stopped.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/withdraw-or-slash-import-duty-on-gold-ramadoss/article30898299.ece

164,2020/02/24,Bridge across Moyar a threat to ecosystem: conservationists,"Residents in the area have built the temporary structure without permission, says Forest Department

An illegally constructed bridge along the Moyar River in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) by a section of residents of Thengumarahada village will have a huge impact on the ecosystem and could lead to a boom in tourism in the region, warn conservationists.

The bridge built with stones across the river has not been approved by the Forest Department, officials confirmed. “First, the bridge blocks the natural flow of water along the Moyar, one of the two rivers emptying into the Bhavani Sagar dam. This will impact the riverine ecosystem, home to otters, marsh crocodiles and a variety of unique species of fish and other aquatic life,” said a conservationist requesting anonymity. He demanded that the illegally-built bridge be demolished.

“Not even the Forest Department can grant permission to build a structure without the clearance of the Ministry of Environment and Forest as the area is in a tiger reserve,” said the conservationist. The village of Thengumarahada is still classified as a reserve forest and non-forest activities are completely prohibited.

‘Secluded location, hard to monitor’

The village is only accessible via Erode district and borders the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve, while it is located in the MTR buffer zone. “There is a steady footfall of tourists illegally visiting Thengumarahada. The bridge will only help promote illegal tourism in the area,” said the conservationist. Due to its remoteness, the area is a challenge for the Forest Department to monitor closely, he said.

Thengumarahada, located along a vital elephant corridor in the foothills of the Nilgiris, came up in 1948 when residents of Kil Kotagiri were given land along the river for growing agricultural crops. Though the land is still classified as a “reserve forest,” it was allotted to the Thengumarahada Cooperative Farming Society.

Over the years, houses have been built illegally and only a few members of the original members of the society are said to be residing there. Lands are reportedly being sub-leased to people from other parts of the Nilgiris, Coimbatore and Erode districts, who have illegally moved in to the area and have constructed houses there.

No demolition plan yet

When contacted, Forest Department officials in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve said they were aware of the bridge, but said they had no plan to demolish it.

“It is only a temporary structure and will be washed away in the next rains,” said an official. The Forest Department was also ascertaining the composition of residents in Thengumarahada. “We are checking how many of them are original members of the society, and how many moved in recently,” said the official.

The bridge was built as people could not cross the river using coracles. “Due to rains last year, the flow of water in the Moyar is stronger than usual, so the villagers felt using coracles was dangerous, and built the bridge,” he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/381vhg/article30898161.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THMOYARRIVER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/bridge-across-moyar-a-threat-to-ecosystem-conservationists/article30898162.ece
165,2020/02/24,"Drop NPR, scrap CAA, says Chidambaram","India’s reputation on the world stage has taken a beating, claims former Union Minister

The National Population Register must be dropped and the government should only carry out the Census, as queries regarding ancestry and other details have been added to the NPR by the BJP-led Central government with an evil intent, former Union Finance Minister and Congress leader P. Chidambaram said in Chennai on Sunday.

He said the intention behind seeking details of the ancestry of one’s parents and forefathers and other details in the NPR was to throw people out of the country if the government was unable to target their citizenship directly.

With the Citizenship (Amendment) Act seeking to divide people on religious lines, India’s reputation on the world stage had taken a beating, he said. “Almost every country in the world has started questioning the [rationale behind] CAA. In the last three months, India’s reputation has taken a beating,” he said.

“The Ministers are lying [when they say] that no Indian citizen will be affected by the CAA. If no one is going to get affected, why do you need a new law? Any law will benefit some and will affect some,” Mr. Chidambaram said while speaking at the ‘Save Constitution, Save Democracy’ meeting, organised by the Forum for Protection of Constitution at the Madras Kerala Samaj. “If no one is going to be affected, why are lakhs of people coming out on to the streets and protesting; why are the courts hearing the matter?” he asked.

“We will know who this Act will affect and who [it] will not affect at the courts. The NRC is definitely not needed, the NPR should be scrapped and the CAA should be cancelled or the Supreme Court should hold it invalid,” Mr. Chidambaram said.

Assam NRC

The Rajya Sabha member said the Assam NRC was a failure. “Nineteen lakh people were declared foreigners, of which 12 lakh were Hindus and 7 lakh were Muslims. Where will you evict them? How will you evict them?” he asked.

Mr. Chidambaram said nowhere in the world had illegal immigrants been evicted. “There are countries in the world that have stopped illegal immigration. But there is no country that has evicted 19 lakh people. If [Prime Minister] Mr. Modi has any doubt, he can check with [U.S. President] Mr. Trump on this. Mr. Trump has been saying illegal immigrants from Mexico must be evicted. Have they been able to evict even one [person]?” Mr. Chidambaram asked. He said people will oppose the CAA till their very last breath, and expressed the hope that the Supreme Court will uphold the Constitution and hold the CAA unconstitutional and invalid.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/itamyq/article30730464.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THTNCHIDAMBARAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/drop-npr-scrap-caa-says-chidambaram/article30897957.ece
166,2020/02/24,CAA was enacted to prove that our Constitution has no value: hol. Thirumavalavan,"If NPR is implemented, around 8 crore people will be rendered stateless: VCK chief

Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol. Thirumavalavan has accused the BJP government at the Centre of having brought in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act to prove that it is possible to enact an anti-secular legislation notwithstanding the country’s secular Constitution. Excerpts from an interview:

The Central government has not moved an inch on the CAA and the National Population Register despite protests by the Opposition, including the VCK. How do you view the situation?

The Prime Minister’s firm stand on the issue tells us that a continuous fight is necessary. Our protests will continue till the government repeals the Act — and this may take years. The VCK will join hands with democratic forces at the national level to take the struggle forward.

The position of the Centre and the State government is that the CAA does not affect any Indian citizen, including Muslims…

The CAA is one aspect and the NPR is another. The NPR will target not just Muslims, but all sections of society. If the NPR is implemented, around eight crore people would be rendered stateless. They (the authorities) are planning to construct 27,000 detention camps at an estimated cost of ₹12 lakh crore, at a time when the country is going through severe economic difficulties.

Once the NPR exercise is carried out, it will pave the way for the National Register of Citizens. It will categorise the population into citizens, non-citizens and doubtful citizens. The doubtful citizens will also include Hindus. It will create tension in society and may lead to a civil war. The most dangerous issue facing the country today is the NPR. But Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami is not ready to discuss it.

What about the assertion that the CAA is not against Indian Muslims?

The CAA is out-and-out communal and anti-Constitution. There is a hidden agenda [behind it]. By implementing the Act, the government wants to alienate Muslims. It is targeting Muslims and seeking to portray all of them as terrorists and anti-nationals and others as law-abiding citizens. This agenda will have a psychological effect on Indian Muslims. In the long-run, it will create an unbridgeable divide between Muslims and non-Muslims.

The objective of the BJP government at the Centre is to dilute the Constitution. It wants to prove that the present Constitution has no value and is planning to get rid of it. It likes to send across the message that an anti-secular law is possible even though the Constitution is secular.

What is your stand on the granting of Indian citizenship to Sri Lankan Tamils?

The government has not handled the refugees issue in a genuine manner. All those who have infiltrated into the country or sought asylum or overstayed here should be treated as refugees, and a humanitarian approach is the basic way to deal with refugees. But the government is using religion as a yardstick. More than one lakh Sri Lankan Tamils are here. The idea of dual citizenship for Sri Lankan Tamils, 90% of whom are Hindus, is humbug. It can be implemented only if the Sri Lankan government gives its consent. The BJP government at the Centre does not seem to have any affinity with the Hindus of Sri Lanka.

The Dravidian Movement and Dalit parties have been accused of singling out Hinduism for criticism…

Our struggle is only against the principles of sanatana dharma and not Hindu society as a whole. As per my certificate, I am also a Hindu, and 80% of VCK cadre belong to this religion. They undertake pilgrimages to Sabarimala and tonsure their heads in Tiruttani and Tirupati. How can we be against the Hindu community? Whether it is the VCK, the DMK or the Left parties, a majority of the cadre are Hindus. We are against the BJP and the Sangh Parivar. They seek to portray us as anti-Hindus.

What is your view on DMK MP R.S. Bharathi adopting a patronising tone when it comes to Dalits?

It is a common mindset of the Hindu community, and not an individual mindset. Actually, he made those remarks in response to those who attack the Dravidian Movement. The intention is not to insult Dalits or Dr. Ambedkar. We need to correct the mindset.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/e28v7i/article30897948.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24THOLTHIRUMAVALAVANVCK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/caa-was-enacted-to-prove-that-our-constitution-has-no-value/article30897949.ece
167,2020/02/24,AIADMK govt. has let people down: Stalin,"Former Minister Raja Kannappan rejoins DMK with his followers

Accusing the AIADMK government of having let the people down in all spheres, DMK president M.K. Stalin on Sunday described as a drama the notification declaring the Cauvery delta region a protected agricultural zone.

Addressing a well-attended public meeting in Madurai, during which former AIADMK Minister Raja Kannappan rejoined the DMK along with his followers, Mr. Stalin said the current AIADMK government had failed on all fronts. “There is utter chaos in the State. The Budget presented by Finance Minister O. Panneerselvam in the Assembly is itself a reflection of the fact that Tamil Nadu’s economy is in a state of coma,” he said.

The notification of certain delta districts as being part of a protected agricultural zone was nothing but a ploy to buy peace with the people living in the belt, he alleged.

""I have a strong suspicion that this is nothing but an attempt to give an impression that the AIADMK is with the people and for the people,” he said.

Mr. Stalin claimed some media houses were praising the State government on the issue with an ulterior motive. This was unethical, he said and urged the people to ponder over it.

Commenting on the State’s finances, Mr. Stalin said government borrowing was on the rise. “There is corruption all around, and the economy has shrunk due to a rise in unemployment,” he said, adding that this was mentioned by the Finance Minister while presenting the Budget.

The Palaniswami government’s announcement that February 24, which marks the birth anniversary of former CM Jayalalithaa, will be observed as the ‘State Girl Child Protection Day’ was also a drama, the DMK leader said. “When the government has not condoled the death of Subasri, an employee of a software firm, in an accident involving an AIADMK banner, and has not even offered compensation to the bereaved family, such an announcement is nothing but misleading,” he said.

168,2020/02/24,"Two tamers, including student, killed in two jallikattu events","Several injured during the bull-taming spectacle in Coimbatore and Dindigul

A bull tamer was gored to death in a jallikattu event in Coimbatore, while another — a Class XII student — was killed in a separate event in Dindigul on Sunday.

In Coimbatore, several people were injured when 800-odd tamers took on more than 1,000 bulls in the presence of thousands of spectators at an event on the outskirts of the city.

P. Subash, 23, a native of Pudukottai, died after a bull he was trying to tame pierced his chest with one of its horns. Though he was rushed to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) after being administered first aid, doctors declared him ‘brought dead’. A hardcore jallikattu enthusiast, Subash was staying near Chettipalayam, reportedly after his family sent him there for work.

Another tamer was admitted to a private hospital after a bull pierced his throat with its horn.

Organisers said Murugan, a bull owner from Salem, suffered a serious injury after a bull attacked him when he was loading his animal on to a vehicle near the exit of the vadivasal.

Rise in numbers

According to Health Department officials, 17 persons who suffered serious injuries were admitted to the CMCH and a private hospital, while more than 300 persons were administered first aid at the venue.

Municipal Administration and Rural Development Minister S.P. Velumani opened the vadivasal for the third edition of the event held at Chettipalayam since 2018. He said the number of tamers and bulls had gone up this year when compared to the turnouts in the previous editions.

Jointly organised by the district administration and the Kovai Jallikattu Peravai, the event drew the participation of bull tamers and bulls largely from Madurai, Theni, Dindigul, Tiruchi, Salem, Pudukottai, Perambalur and Ariyalur districts.

In Dindigul, a Plus-Two student, P. Nagaraj, was gored to death by a bull at an event organised by St. Antony’s Church at Nallamanaickenpatti.

The police said the boy, hailing from Vellakuttu near Natham, was studying at a Government Higher Secondary School.

He was gored to death when he tried to tame a bull after getting into the arena.

‘Lacked experience’

“The incident took place within 20 metres of the vadivasal. As the bull rushed into the arena, the boy, who seemed inexperienced in jallikattu, was caught unawares, and the bull gored him on his back,” Dindigul Superintendent of Police R. Sakthivel said.

The victim was rushed to the government hospital in Dindigul. However, he succumbed to injuries.

The police said the boy had duly registered his name for the event. However, a police source raised the suspicion that he may have fudged his age in order to become eligible for the event.

“Only those who were aged 18 years or above and had a healthy physique were allowed into the arena after a health check-up by a team of doctors,” the officer said.

After the boy was declared dead, the event was brought to an abrupt end.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dim3sm/article30897851.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24JALLIKATTU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/two-tamers-including-student-killed-in-two-jallikattu-events/article30897852.ece

170,2020/02/24,"The biggest Kollywood battle: Not ‘Thala’ vs ‘Thalapathy’, but Raaja vs Rahman","Move over Ajith and Vijay, let's discuss a debate that really matters now

Why Ilaiyaraaja is the truth

There is a song for every human emotion and everyday chores of life. There is a song for every mood, every genre. There is a song for every religion, every community. His music, in short, is everywhere. And the man behind these compositions is not just a maestro, but a blessing from Nature itself.

He takes the human form in the name of Ilaiyaraaja.

What more can one write about Raaja that has not been written already, that too in a crisp 250 words? Should we discuss how conveniently his music has permeated our lives? Or should we talk about the therapeutic nature of his songs?

Let’s not, even for a moment, commit the mistake of trying to ‘decode’ the complexities of his compositions. Take a simple ‘Rasathi Unna’ from Vaithegi Kathirunthal, for instance. Plug in your earphones and observe how the song has been arranged. The opening lines are gentle and welcoming, but you wait for Raaja to kick in. And when that happens, it produces an almost oscillating effect on you. It is bliss. It is life.

There is music that leaves you with a lingering sense of lightness — like ‘Raguman’s’ music would do. And there is music that has the power to cleanse your soul and make you a better person with each sitting.

Ilaiyaraaja has been doing that soul cleansing work for close to five decades now.

— Srivatsan S swears by Ilaiyaraaja because…‘Raaja kaiya vecha, adhu wrong-ah ponathu illa’

But A.R. Rahman changed the idea of music forever

When I first heard the songs of Roja, way back in 1992 in a transistor at home, it was like nothing I had heard until then. My ears perked up. I was an immediate convert.

I remain one till date. That ARR changed the paradigm of Tamil music, and later Indian music, is an opinion no one, not even die-heard Ilaiyaraaja fans, will dispute. He changed the way we thought about music itself.

ARR brought music closer to the common man, he made us dance, sing along and discover the singer within each of us.

If a school-going kid grooved to ‘Chikku Bukku’, he would have grown up to woo his college sweetheart with ‘Enakku Oru Girlfriend’ (Boys) and subsequently, landed a plum IT job abroad, only to listen to the goosebump-inducing ‘Yeh Do Des Hai’ (Swades) and feel nostalgic. As a ‘90s kid, you grew up with ARR.

If Ilaiyaraaja and his music came across as a brooding headmaster, ARR’s work was that friend (and later, friendly uncle) that you could hang out with.

If Ilaiyaraaja got people to get together in a mofussil bus in interior Tamil Nadu, ARR made it a truly delicately personal experience — one that would seep into yours ears through Walkmans, and later headphones, and be more than happy to be your companion.

In my eyes, that kind of “friendship” is worth much more than the composer’s two Oscars.

171,2020/02/24,"'Raahu', a concept thriller with an intriguing premise","Debut director Subbu Vedula is confident about the story of his Telugu film, that releases this week

Subbu Vedula moved to Hyderabad six years ago, giving up a well-paying job in the banking sector in the US, for the love of cinema. He wanted to make concept-oriented Telugu films and was determined not to give it a shot, even if it meant roughing it out without the financially secure life he had gotten used to.

His debut directorial venture Raahu, a thriller, is slated to release on February 28. Subbu grew up watching and admiring the work of veteran Telugu filmmakers like Bapu and K Vishwanath, has read the works of Telugu writers extensively, and was equally drawn to world cinema and can talk at length about Coen brothers. He’s confident that the coming together of world cinema sensibilities and the native Telugu flavour will make his film stand out.

Raahu stars Abhiram Varma, Kriti Garg, and Kalakeya Prabhakar among others and the title is a metaphor for a situation the leading lady grapples with. “In the film, Kriti suffers from ‘conversion disorder’ that makes her momentarily blind under severe stress,” explains Subbu.

He has termed the condition as ‘hysterical blindness’ to explain how she loses her vision temporarily when she sees blood. A turn of events warrants her to work around that fear and fight her enemy.

“Darkness prevails when ‘raahu’ takes over the sun. I used the analogy to explain the darkness the girl faces,” says Subbu. He stumbled upon conversion disorder when he was researching another health topic and felt it could be used for an intriguing story. It’s a different way of looking at a house invasion format, he says: “She gets trapped in the villain’s hideout and he’s outside, trying to break in and kill her. About 45 to 50 minutes in the later half of the film works like an extended climax.”

It took Subbu barely 20 days to write the script and the dialogues, but the project took two and a half years to take shape. Like every aspiring filmmaker, he had his ordeals in finding help with production. When he left the US, he knew he was taking a risk. He had taken up a course at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts and wanted to pursue a career in cinema. “If push comes to shove, I know I have a back-up plan in my banking career as a front office trainer. But I want to tell the stories I believe in,” he says, mentioning that a few more scripts are ready with him.

Most of his scripts are thrillers and he mentions among his favourite Indian thrillers, Chandra Sekhar Yeleti’s Anukokunda Oka Roju. “The thriller space hasn’t been explored enough in Telugu cinema and I find it fascinating,” adds Subbu.

Muted tones

For Raahu, he chose a colour palette of browns, blacks and desaturated greys to create a gritty atmosphere that’s accentuated with music.

He credits actors Abhiram Varma and Kriti for carrying off their roles effectively. He particularly lauds Kriti. “Hers is a tricky part. There are scenes where she uses a pen and begins counting to get over her fear. If such a scene is not performed well, it can end up looking comical.” Subbu adds that Kriti’s part has substance. “She plays an automobile engineer and it’s not a profession assigned to her character for the heck of it. When she’s trapped, she uses her knowledge to try and save herself.”

Raahu is a test for Subbu but he exudes confidence and says, “We have one big name backing our film — the story,” explaining why they are promoting the film on social media with the hashtag #NameIsStory.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/8li07o/article30903195.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Raahu-Subbu-3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/debut-director-subbu-vedula-is-confident-about-his-telugu-concept-thriller-raahu/article30903197.ece

173,2020/02/24,'iShmart Jodi': Of unscripted love and celebrity couples,"Ohmkar is back on the small screen, this time with a celebrity couple reality show

Dressed in a white suit, leaning against a background of red roses, host-director Ohmkar gives away the twist in his new TV show iShmart Jodi , which premièred on February 23. The show on StarMaa brings 12 celebrity couples together on weekends. “It is a reality show with a difference,” smiles Ohmkar.

His earlier game show Sixth Sense, two years ago on StarMaa, preceded the channel’s plans to launch Bigg Boss. Now after the completion of its Big Boss’ third season, Ohmkar is back with iShmart Jodi. He initially planned to do a dance show but instead created this series on couples on the request of StarMaa. In this series, 12 real celebrity jodis test the strength of their love, showing that love needs no recipe. “Only a new pattern will bring in younger audiences. I took the channel’s concept on couples but planned the series in my own unique way,” says Ohmkar, adding Prabhakar P, choreographers Yashwanth and Sandeep, Ashmita Asrani, Siva Jyothi, Indraneel and Meghna are some of the show’s participants.

Celebrities from different fields — acting, dancing and choreography — bring their spouses to the show. “We never see the spouses of celebrities. It is an opportunity to meet the person behind the star,” he says. The first ‘wedding’ round recreates the couples’ wedding day: they arrive in a grand set, wearing their wedding attire. “Couples married for three decades to those married for just three months will all arrive in the clothes they wore on their wedding day. That episode will be filled with special memories,” he explains, adding how the team took care to not make it look like a wedding video. “The themes have to be presented in an entertaining way. There is romance but we ensure it doesn’t look indecent, so that the family audience also watches our show comfortably.”

Unlike other reality shows, where judges score the talent and pass comments (some of them inevitably nasty), iShmart... will not have any judges. “Members will be tested by the co-participants. A choreographer is an expert in the dancing round but what happens if his wife is not able to match his steps? How do partners handle the situation when their spouses are not strong in competitive rounds,” says Ohmkar pointing out this will be a test of companionship. “Emotions are spontaneous, not scripted.”

Constantly oscillating between films and television, Ohmkar says he finds TV more challenging. “Movies are a different ball game and give you the luxury of time. In movies, I am only a director and have a team of people working with me in other fields. But here I am a one-man army, hosting, writing, producing and directing; I also have to create a unique look for the show.”

Commenting on changing viewer habits, he jokes that the mobile phone is his main competitor. “People watch shows on phone at their own time, place and pace. Even television audiences can switch channels within a second if a show doesn’t interest them,” he says, adding “Even with web series and reality shows, the first few minutes and novel content are important to hold the attention of viewers.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/9u9ojf/article30901709.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym24ohmkar,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ohmkar-reveals-ishmart-jodi-is-a-celebrity-couple-reality-show/article30901710.ece

175,2020/02/24,CAT hearing on ADGP suspension continues,"Centre informed of reasons, says AP government

All the details relating to suspension of Additional DGP A.B. Venkateshwara Rao were communicated to the Centre on this February 12, the Andhra Pradesh government said in an affidavit filed in Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) here on Monday.

The provisions of the law under which action was initiated against Mr. Rao was informed to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs through e-mail and speed post service, the affidavit filed by General Administration Directorate deputy secretary J. Venkata Murali stated. Further a comprehensive report was sent to the Centre on February 19 on the matter.

Since the Crime Investigation Department (CID) was already conducting a probe into procurement of unmanned aerial vehicle drones involving Mr. Rao, no stay order can be granted on Mr. Rao’s suspension order, the affidavit said. The petition filed by the ADGP following his suspension came up for hearing on Monday before a bench of the CAT comprising Justice L. Narasimha Reddy and member B.V. Sudhakar.

The petitioner’s counsel G. Vidya Sagar contended the disciplinary action and the suspension order were not in conformity with the All India Service Rules. High Court senior counsel and former Advocate General D. Prakash Reddy, appearing for AP government, said Mr. Rao had not challenged the rules under which he was suspended.

However, the CAT bench consented to amend the petition after the petitioner’s counsel sought permission to do so. In the affidavit filed by the AP GAD, it was stated that Mr. Rao’s action were conducive to damage the interests of the State in the procurement of drones. The tender was finalised to be given to a company headed by Mr. Rao’s son, the affidavit stated.

This amounted to violation of the guidelines and rules of the tender. The DGP found fault with finalisation of tenders in this regard and rejected the same. The affidavit stated that, however, Mr. Rao tried to procure the drones from the same company.

On learning this, the government ordered for a preliminary inquiry into the matter. On receipt of the preliminary report, disciplinary action was taken against Mr. Rao resulting in his suspension, the government contended. The petitioner’s counsel said that none came forward to file tenders to procure drones when State Trading Corporation issued notification twice.

Mr. Rao attended a meeting relating to procurement of drones in the capacity as member of the Tenders Committee. Except this, he had no role in procuring the equipment, the counsel said. The matter was posted to March 6 for next hearing.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/yvxcdb/article30907394.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25VJABVRAO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/cat-hearing-on-adgp-suspension-continues/article30906406.ece

Ms. Sridevasena took a walk around the ward which, incidentally, happens to be represented by Municipal chairman Jogu Premender in the Council who is son of MLA Jogu Ramanna and a resident. The ward presented a pathetic picture with several leakages in the drinking water pipeline and precious water being wasted for lack of taps to the connections.

Pattana Pragathi, an ambitious programme envisaging all-round development of urban areas, commenced in all the 140 municipalities and municipal corporations spread across Telangana on Monday.

Conceived on the lines of Palle Pragathi, the programme for strengthening the basic infrastructure in villages, which received enthusiastic response from the people at the ground level, Pattana Pragathi would continue for 10 days till March 4 in more than 3,400 wards and divisions with Ministers and officials at various levels participating in it. A brain child of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, the programme envisages sanitation drive and green initiatives in addition to strengthening the infrastructure like creation of dump yards and educating people about segregation of solid and liquid wastes for effective disposal.

Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao, accompanied by Minister V. Srinivas Goud, formally launched the programme in Mahbubnagar while his Cabinet colleagues T. Harish Rao, A. Indrakaran Reddy, Puvvada Ajay Kumar, Sabita Indra Reddy and others participated in the programme in their respective areas. KTR who formally launched works pertaining to infrastructure development in Mahbubnagar warned officials concerned against complacency.

He said the new Municipal Act had provisions paving the way for action against those who were found wanting in meeting the goals set under the new legislation. Mr. Harish Rao who participated in Pattana Pragathi at Sangareddy said the new Municipal Act encompassed both rights and responsibilities of residents and they should accordingly plan the developmental works in their respective areas.

Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar led the officials by participating in the Pattana Pragathi in Ibrahimpatnam municipality on city outskirts. After interacting with the residents and launching some works in the area, he said the government had earmarked 10% of budgetary allocation of municipalities for enhancing the green cover. It was the responsibility of the elected representatives and officials concerned to ensure survival of at least 85% of the saplings that were planted during the green drives conducted from time to time.

With a view to enhancing the participation of residents in planning and development of their areas, the government had decided to constitute four committees with 15 members each in all the wards for effective implementation of the works. The Chief Minister, he said, would soon announce a special drive to improve literacy levels across the State as a recent study had revealed that though the State was ahead of others in terms of welfare and developmental activities, it could do better in terms of literacy rates.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/pattana-pragathi-gets-under-way/article30905932.ece
179,2020/02/24,Marginal decline in female sex ratio in Telangana,"950 girls for 1,000 boys against national average of 925

The female sex ratio in Telangana has shown a marginal decline till January end in 2019-20 as compared to the 12 month period of the previous year though the figures are far better than the national average.

The performance of key indicators of Health Management Information System of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare suggest that against 957 girl children born in Telangana in 2018-19 for 1,000 boys, the birth rate of girls in 2019-20 was 950. The national average of girl children was 925.

A total of 5.3 lakh children, both male and female, were born in Telangana in 2018-19 and 4.82 lakh till January this year. Of concern was the increase in reported still births by over 450 this year but this was attributed to the role of institutional deliveries following the implementation of KCR kits programme of government. The deliveries at government hospitals went up after the programme was launched which resulted in recording all cases of still births. Otherwise, they went unnoticed at private hospitals.

Girls born

The highest number of girls were born in Khammam and Peddapalli districts in both the years. The lowest was in Yadadri-Bhongir district this year. Girl children born in Khammam in 2018-19 was 1,057 but it rose to 1,177 this year. On the other hand, their rate slid from 1,031 last year to 1,012 this year in Peddapalli.

The Superintendent of a hospital said the craving for a baby boy in small family norm drove the parents to discourage girl children. Hence, the problem of foeticide. A business community only wanted male children while another community sought large size of families irrespective of sex. The prospect of shelling down huge amounts as dowry in marriage was another factor which went against girls. In fact, a matrimonial service invited applications to fix marriage alliances only if the parents of girls owned property worth ₹ 2 crore and had a monthly income of ₹ 2 lakh.

Maternal deaths

The year 2019-20 also saw an increase in maternal deaths after delivery and abortions. Medical fraternity has generally welcomed abortions as a tool for population control, but they were also a result of unwanted pregnancy.

The percentage of pregnant women who tested positive among all women screened for HIV has come down this year from 2.1 in 2018-19 to 1.7 this year. The total number of infants deaths reported also came down from 3,675 to 2,408.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/pfxznc/article30905700.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy23Sex-Ratiocol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/marginal-decline-in-female-sex-ratio-in-telangana/article30905406.ece

The senior teacher-leader said it was not his first experience and umpteen requests for a ‘free-tag’, an entitlement, were not acknowledged, pushing him to stage a protest at the toll plaza.

Mr. Narsi Reddy who was going to Hyderabad from Nalgonda on Monday morning was stopped by toll personnel at Panthangi plaza for payment. Although he pointed to the windshield sticker — Telangana State MLC–Teachers — and produced his State MLC identity card to officials, he was not allowed, he said.

“They are doing this for at least the dozenth time. I gave my number several times, also applied for a FasTAG under people representatives’ category 40 days ago. But there has been no response. Toll personnel can’t say I am not an MLC since I don’t have a gunman,” he said, speaking to press from the vehicle bay.

Mr. Narsi Reddy said it was his choice not to have an armed personnel by his side, but toll officials should not identify people representatives by accompanying gunmen and condemned their attitude. The officials at the toll plaza were giving free rides to many vehicle users who were neither people’s representatives nor qualified for an exemption, he charged.

Following the protest, senior toll officials and local police reached the scene. The protest which was on for almost an hour till about 11.15 a.m., was withdrawn after officials apologized for the mistake. They assured the MLC that such incidents would not recur.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/2tp0nt/article30907337.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY25MLCPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/mlc-protests-as-toll-officials-refuse-exemption/article30905301.ece

182,2020/02/24,BJP seeks probe over reports of Rohingyas securing Aadhaar,"BJP on Monday demanded that a probe be conducted in all districts in Telangana

Alleging that several Rohingyas have secured Aadhaar cards in Telangana by producing false documents, the BJP on Monday demanded that a probe be conducted in all districts of the state with an objective to weed out all the illegal immigrants.

Non-Indians securing all such cards is a matter of serious concern, but unfortunately, the state government, it appears, has not viewed the issue with adequate seriousness, the party said in the memorandum.

Whenever the BJP has raised the issue, for reasons best known to the administration, their submissions were not given due importance, the BJP said in a memorandum submitted to the state DGP.

“However, there have been revelations in the recent past that over 127 people secured Aadhaar cards producing false documents and cases have been registered against them at the behest of UIDAI.

It further came to be known that of the 127 people, to whom notices have been served, 124 are Rohingyas,” it said.

The BJP claimed 124 is not even a miniscule of the number of the illegal immigrants staying in Telangana.

According to the party, there are credible reports that thousands of Rohingyas all across Telangana have secured Aadhaar, voter ID and ration cards.

Some of the illegal immigrants may come under the influence of anti-national forces such as ISI, and may carry out operations to disrupt peace and progress and to destabilize the nation, the memorandum said.

The issue of Rohingyas’ illegal stay, therefore, is inextricably linked to the safety and security of the nation, it said.

“Under the circumstances, the BJP demands a comprehensive probe with a dedicated team of officers in all the districts of Telangana with an objective to weed out all the illegal immigrants including the large chunk of Rohingyas,” the BJP added.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/gh6lac/article30904875.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ROHINGYAMUSLIMS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bjp-seeks-probe-over-reports-of-rohingyas-securing-aadhaar/article30904876.ece
183,2020/02/24,Pattana Pragathi for all-round development of urban areas: KTR,"Minister calls upon people to participate in development process

Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao has exhorted the people to cooperate in the all-round development of urban areas without political considerations.

The Minister, who formally launched the Pattana Pragathi programme for integrated development of urban areas in Mahabubnagar, on Monday said there were no political motives involved in the programme and that it was aimed at integrated development of towns and cities cutting across political lines. Cooperation of people was key to ensuring all-round development of urban areas and it was the responsibility of the councillors and ward committee members to chalk out plans for the development of their respective areas.

He exhorted the councillors and the ward committee members to prepare ward-wise sanitation plans with primary focus on segregating dry and wet wastes. The elected representatives should also sensitise people on the need for segregating wastes for their effective disposal and this would go a long way in avoiding scope for spread of swine flu, dengue and other such contagious diseases.

Power from waste

He said segregation of wastes in Sircilla Municipality helped the urban local body raise ₹ 3 lakh through power generation from the solid wastes and given its dimensions, Mahabubnagar could raise much higher amounts annually. The government on its part had introduced several reforms, including biometric attendance system for sanitation workers, and it was for the people to strengthen these initiatives for the development of their respective wards.

In this context, he said the department had introduced Parichayam scheme in GHMC envisaging the sanitation workers to meet the households in the areas which were assigned to them on a regular basis. This initiative had not only ensured regular upkeep of areas but helped in strengthening human relations.

New legislation

The government had enacted the new Municipalities Act with citizen services as primary responsibility and at least 10% of the budgetary allocation should be utilized towards green initiatives. In this context, he cautioned the officials concerned and elected representatives that necessary provisions had been incorporated in the legislation to initiate action against those failing to achieve targets like ensuring survival rate of at least 85% of trees planted as part of the green initiatives.

Mr. Rama Rao, accompanied by Minister V. Srinivas Goud earlier laid foundation stone for an integrated market complex and launched works relating to construction of toilets. He participated in a padayatra in Mahabubnagar town. He interacted with senior citizens and enquired about the implementation of different schemes like Kalyana Lakshmi at the ground level. He wanted the officials concerned to ensure availability of adequate number of autorickshaws for transporting dry and wet waste.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/pattana-pragathi-for-all-round-development-of-urban-areas-ktr/article30904243.ece

Bharatanatyam exponent Rama Vaidyanathan and her troupe held classical dance connoisseurs in a thrall as they presented her composition, Shivoham, at the historic Elgandal fort here on Saturday night.

The fort, which had been colourfully lit up, served as the perfect backdrop for the performance that lasted about three hours.

Organised by the Telangana State Tourism Department and Parampara, the performance drew a roaring applause from the audience which included the likes of Collector K. Shashanka, Jagtial SP Sindhu Sharma, Commissioner of Police V.B. Kamalasan Reddy, Choppadandi legislator Sunke Ravishankar, Municipal Commissioner Valluru Kranthi and tourism officer Venkateshwar. Film star Nandamuri Balakrishna’s wife Vasundhara Devi also witnessed Shivoham.

Appreciating Parampara for the promotion and protection of ancient temples and historic structures, the Collector said he was awestruck by the performance. “It was a really great evening for the people of Karimnagar to witness such a marvellous programme at the historic fort,” he added.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/rvbsx7/article30898210.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY23-BHARATNATYAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/elgandal-fort-comes-alive-with-bharatnatyam-recital/article30898200.ece
185,2020/02/24,"Link employment with local languages, says Venkaiah","Vice-President calls for promoting use of mother tongue

Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu has urged the Central and State governments to link employment opportunities with local languages to promote the use of mother tongue. He also emphasised the need to promote the use of Indian languages in administration to bring it closer to the people and help in “preservation of our rich linguistic heritage”.

Mr Naidu was here on Sunday to deliver the inaugural address of the platinum jubilee celebrations of Andhra Vidyabhi Vardhani (AVV) Educational Institutions. He released the souvenir of the institute and lauded the contributions of philanthropist and founder of AVV, Chanda Kanthaiah.

The Vice-President said that unless a child understands the language of instruction properly, he will not be able to understand the subject being taught in that language. He highlighted the need for value-based education and the role of teachers in shaping a child’s life.

He appreciated India’s rich spiritual heritage, saying ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ means the ‘Jai of 130 crore Indians’. He exhorted the youth to develop 4Cs – character, capacity, conduct and calibre, and asked them to work hard and be disciplined to achieve success in life. He also advised them to shun a sedentary lifestyle and stay physically fit.

Stressing that peace was a prerequisite for development, Mr. Naidu said that in a democracy, everyone has the right to dissent and protest, but it should be done in a peaceful manner. He asked the youth to develop a positive attitude in life and be constructive in their approach.

Meanwhile, he expressed concern over the fast depleting water resources.“Earlier, every village used to have different water bodies for different purposes, but we neglected these traditional water conservation methods,” he said. He also appreciated the work being done by the Telangana government for irrigation development in the State.

187,2020/02/24,Police identify 84 accident-prone spots in Khammam district,"To implement remedial measures to prevent accidents

After identifying as many as 84 blackspots in the district’s road network, the police department has swung into action to implement remedial measures to fix them and prevent road accidents through a collaborative approach.

The accident-prone locations were identified based on an in-depth analysis of the number of fatalities, road accident related injuries besides various other factors including the nature and causes of road mishaps. Based on a detailed evaluation of the accident-prone stretches and data, the department has identified a total of 84 blackspots, mostly located on different stretches of the National Highway 365BB (Suryapet-Aswaraopeta).

These spots fall under the limits of Khammam rural, Khammam one-town, two-town, three-town, Khanapuram Haveli, Raghunadhapalem, Konijerla, Wyra and V M Banjara police stations in the Khammam Police Commissionerate jurisdiction.

Categorisation

These spots were classified into A, B and C categories based on the number of road accidents that occurred in these spots in the last three years.

Of these, as many as 64 spots are on the National Highway stretches, four on the State highway stretches and 16 are on other roads, sources said. As many as 281 persons were killed and 833 were injured in a total of 755 road accidents reported in the district in 2019. As many as 840 road accidents were reported in 2018, in which a total of 290 persons were killed and 1,093 were injured in 2018, sources added.

It mooted several remedial measures such as laying proper road markings, setting up crash barriers and traffic signs and improving streetlighting besides engineering measures to address road defects.

Joint teams comprising the officials of the police and multiple departments will inspect the blackspots and finalise remedial measures to fix these accident-prone spots in the next couple of days, said Khammam Traffic ACP Ramoju Ramesh.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/police-identify-84-accident-prone-spots-in-khammam-district/article30897876.ece
188,2020/02/24,"We were not just competitive enough, says Kohli after 10-wicket loss","Kohli was considerate towards his young batsmen but felt the bowlers could have been a bit more disciplined.

Indian captain Virat Kohli on February 24 said they were “just not competitive enough” after crashing to a 10-wicket defeat at the hands of New Zealand in the opening Test in Wellington.

Sent into bat after New Zealand won the toss, India were bowled out for a dismal 165 in their first innings, which eventually proved to be decisive on a Basin Reverse pitch that assisted the seamers.

“The toss did turn out to be very important. But at the same time, we take a lot of pride in being competitive as a batting unit, and we were just not competitive enough,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation.

“Anything in the region of even 220-230 would have made it different. As a bowling group, we have been pretty good. The wicket did get better.

“That first innings put us behind and then the lead put us under more pressure. The last three wickets and those 120 runs pushed us out of the game.”

Kohli was considerate towards his young batsmen but felt the bowlers could have been a bit more disciplined.

“The bowlers toiled well, as a bowling group we’ve taken pride in being competitive. Till the first seven New Zealand wickets, we were really good.

“We wanted to restrict the lead to under 100, but the last runs from their batsmen made things difficult. The bowlers can still be more disciplined, they were not as happy with their bowling performance.”

On the team’s younger batsmen such as Prithvi Shaw and Mayank Agarwal, the skipper said, “You don’t want to be too hard on guys like Shaw. He’s played just two overseas Tests. He will figure a way, he will find a way to score runs.

“Mayank applied himself well, and he’s the only other person apart from Rahane who got us any momentum with the bat.

“Our strength is to put big scores for our bowlers to bowl at, and that was missing in this match.”

Also read: Ashwin — battling and taming the breeze

New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson also spoke about the importance of bowling India out cheaply in the first innings and the substantial lead it had taken thanks to their lower-order batsmen’s resistance.

“Outstanding effort over the space of four days. We know how strong India are all around the world. The effort in the first innings and then a competitive total with the bat was great. The lower order runs are important to get a bit of a lead,” Williamson said.

The pitch aided his fast bowlers, with the duo of Tim Southee and Trent Boult sharing nine wickets between them when India came out to bat the second time.

“Didn’t know what to expect from the pitch on the morning of the Test. Because it wasn’t as windy this week, there was a bit more swing. The bowlers were brilliant but a real collective effort.

“(Debutant seamer Kyle) Jamieson was brilliant. Through the summer, in white-ball cricket he’s been valuable. So great debut for Kyle, contributed in a number of ways.

“Southee’s mindset wasn’t of one with a point to prove. He just wanted to lead with the ball. Having Boult at the other end would’ve been good for him too. Left-arm, right-arm combination can be dangerous.”

Man of the Match Southee, who was part of the squad that was thrashed 0-5 by India in the T20 series, was pleased to be back in helpful conditions.

“A great win, to beat a quality Indian side. Pleasant change coming back to home conditions. I think this morning was a massive moment in the game. Being able to pick up those two wickets before the second new ball was crucial,” Southee said.

“As a bowling unit, to take 20 wickets and an effort like this was pretty pleasing. The wicket had more in it than usual. With the wind there, the ball did a bit more.”",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/kz33w1/article30900391.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CRICKET-TEST-NZL-IND,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/we-were-not-just-competitive-enough-says-kohli-after-10-wicket-loss/article30900447.ece
189,2020/02/24,When Artiste C Krishnaswamy took to the streets wound in light strips to explore the concept of disguise,"C Krishnaswamy’s performance was an extension of his recently-concluded solo art exhibition titled Primordial Universe

The moderately crowded Dr Radhakrishnan Salai, on a week night, is in for a surprise. Moving cars, pedestrians and daily commuters watch in awe as an illuminated human figure, atop a moving contraption, rolls onto the main road.

The small entourage accompanying this “procession” seems as lost as the onlookers. ‘What is going on?’— say their curious expressions. Dodging the many questions, the entourage moves out of 2nd street onto the main road, halts for a few minutes, and returns the same way. Thus, Primordial Universe, a visual art exhibition of the works of C Krishnaswamy, extends itself into a performance, lending the display an abstract visual component.

The vehicle (an open cart with big tyres, pulled by a group of men) which carries Krishnaswamy, wound in light strips, also has three of his sculptures mounted on it. Made of steel and inspired by the structural quality of commercial racks, the sculptures are human figures in different poses. Amidst them stands Krishnaswamy, known for his experimental and immersive performance art revolving around the concept of disguise (think: Kundalini Rising), this time wound in light strips.

Almost the entirety of his body is covered in light, resembling an illuminated apparition. Through the maze that the linearly placed sculptures create, Krishnaswamy literally embodies the contrast between darkness and light. This very idea looms large in the series of abstract work that was on display until yesterday. The display has linear paintings and sculptures that are abstract representations of what a ray of light means. When it comes to performances, Krishnaswamy uses his body as a tool to express what his art tries to convey.

“The idea was to lead a procession all the way to the Gandhi statue [near Marina beach]. But there were technical difficulties, so we had to cut it short,” says the artist, as he wriggles out of the light strips after the performance. Moreover, the heat that the lights emanate, is another challenge that needs to be dealt with. This is also why the performance lasted only for a few minutes. “I don’t bother if I have an audience. The idea is to express what I feel,” continues the artist, who believes that every act of his is in itself a search.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/gz1k6g/article30903750.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23mpDSC1963jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/when-artiste-c-krishnaswamy-took-to-the-streets-wound-in-light-strips-to-explore-the-concept-of-disguise/article30903751.ece
190,2020/02/24,The craft of small things: Why A Mitralaxmi enjoys the challenge of creating miniature art,"A Mitralaxmi enjoys the challenge of creating miniature art from paper, be it a 2D likeness of actor Vijay Sethupathy or burgers and sandwiches

A Mitralaxmi remembers that afternoon when she received a message on Instagram. “It was from a close friend of actor Vijay Sethupathy who wanted to customise a gift to the actor on his birthday,” she says.

A model of actor Vijay Sethupathy

It took her two weeks to make 2D miniature of the actor’s face and a 3D miniature of a vintage camera. “I traced his portrait on black paper and cut and paste it on a frame. The camera was fashioned out of wood and had a slot to insert photographs. Vijay Sethupathy loved it and I am thrilled,” she says. Mitralaxmi, who has a day job as an auditor at a private firm, has been doing miniature art for the past one year. “It all started when a friend asked me to source a few personalised gift tags for her wedding. I couldn’t find anything that suited my taste and finally ended up making 250 handmade paper tags,” she says.

Mitralaxmi says it was natural she should be interested in craft. “My father owned a printing press and I had access to different types of papers. I loved origami and experimented with folds and designs.” She says learnt miniature art by trial and error. “While there are many online tutorial videos on clay miniatures, I could not find any good ones using paper. So I developed my own ways of doing it,” she explains.

Her first 3D work was done for Deepavali and it had tiny sweets and crackers made out of coloured chart paper. “It came out well and gave me confidence,” she says. She also recreated dumplings, noodles, burgers, sandwiches and French fries out of paper for a café. “They were put up in a photo booth at the restaurant and many customers took photographs of my products. I felt good to see my work pop up on Instagram the next day,” she recollects. Mitralaxmi’s most challenging work was to make a model of a Canon 5D camera. It took her a week to complete and she referred to multiple photographs to get the details right. “It was just two inches in height. I did the body with cardboard and covered it up with black chart paper. I later painted the buttons.”

She has begun to work with MDF wood. “It is sturdier and so easier than paper. I imported a machine from the US to cut the wood into shapes. Once done, I glue the pieces together,” she explains. “I work on my miniature art on weekends and in the evenings after work. Getting the shapes without crumpling the paper is the challenge. But once the final product is ready, there is no greater happiness.”

Mitralaxmi says she likes to take part in exhibitions and pop up shows as she can get a sense of what people want. “I met a few collectors at my stall in Art Street and they suggested that I open a store here,” she smiles but says that is not yet in the pipeline. Mithralaxmi has just completed a miniature sewing machine made of cardboard for a knitting company in Tirupur. “My next project is to recreate human faces with paper. It is not easy, but I know I will figure out a way,” she smiles.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/i9hvk0/article30901793.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/cm15miniature9,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/a-mitralaxmi-on-the-challenge-of-creating-miniature-art-from-paper/article30901794.ece
191,2020/02/24,‘Trump sheltering Bhopal gas tragedy fugitives’,"Modi not standing with nation, failing to question United States government, say survivors

Bhopal gas tragedy survivors on Monday, the day United States President Donald Trump arrived in India, alleged he was refusing to serve summons issued repeatedly by a Bhopal court on the firm responsible for the world's worst industrial disaster, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi had failed to press the U.S. government to act.

Accusing the Trump government of sheltering the Dow Chemical Company, which in 2001 had acquired Union Carbide, from whose pesticide plant here a methyl isocyanate leak in 1984 killed thousands and caused deformities and congenital diseases in lakhs, the demonstrators beat Mr. Trump’s effigy with brooms at the Iqbal Maidan in Bhopal.

“Mr. Modi is not standing with the country’s people and failing to ask Mr. Trump tough questions. Instead, crores of rupees are being spent for his reception,” said Rachna Dhingra of the Bhopal Group for Information and Action. “It is shocking that our Prime Minister in his eagerness to please Mr. Trump has not sought, let alone pressed for, the U.S. government’s cooperation in bringing the perpetrators to justice.”

Stating that Mr. Trump’s visit aimed at only expanding his corporate agenda in India, she alleged, “He is here to further the interests of death-dealing American corporations like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Westinghouse.”

Since 2016 when Mr. Trump came to power, the court had twice summoned the Dow Chemical Company, as the owner of Union Carbide is absconding on the charge of corporate manslaughter, said Rashida Bi, president, Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Stationery Karamchari Sangh. “But the U.S. Department of Justice has refused to serve these summons on the firm,” she said.

Meanwhile, Nasreen Khan of the Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Purush Sangharsh Morcha accused the U.S. of sheltering the perpetrators of the disaster. “This is in violation of the the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) between India and U.S..”

Untimely deaths

Pointing to hundreds of survivors dying untimely, Durgesh Ahirwar of Children against Dow Carbide said, “Hundreds of thousands are battling chronic illnesses and tens of thousands of children are being born with malformations and growth disorders. Through our brooms we are telling the world about the U.S. government’s role in perpetuating the injustice in Bhopal.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/l07xdq/article30906855.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE24-BHOPAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/trump-sheltering-bhopal-gas-tragedy-fugitives/article30906856.ece
192,2020/02/24,Cong. MLAs blast Haryana govt. over new excise policy,"Party legislators demand its withdrawal saying the move will push the youth of the State into addiction

The Congress MLAs in Haryana Assembly on Monday hit out at the ruling BJP-JJP government over the new excise policy, which they claimed would push scores of youth into addiction.

Participating in the debate on the Governor’'s Address here, Congress member Rao Dan Singh said the new excise policy will result in rise in liquor addiction among the youth. The State government should, he said, focus on curbing drugs menace, which is spreading across the State.

Terming Haryana’s new excise policy “a recipe for disaster”, former Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition in the State Assembly Bhupinder Singh Hooda demanded that the government immediately withdraw the new policy.

Separately, during Question Hour, Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala said that to tackle the problem of stray cattle in the State, the government has already initiated the process of setting up of “gaushalas” and cattle pounds across the State.

He said that the government was also taking the help of NGOs to tackle the problem.

“Financial assistance of ₹7100 is being given by the Development and Panchayat Department to those Panchayats which have sent the proposal for setting up ‘Gau-Grah’ and cattle pounds,” he said in a reply during Question Hour, adding that the government was committed to resolving the problem.

Haryana Minister of Mines and Geology Mool Chand Sharma said that illegal mining will not be tolerated at any cost.

“So far, 25 illegal mines operating in the State have been closed,” he said while replying to a question.

Mining activities

Mr. Sharma said that mining activities in the entire State, including the district Yamunanagar, had stopped from March 1, 2010, due to litigation regarding the requirement of environmental clearance for minor mineral mining. Mining resumed in Yamunanagar district in October 2016, he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/xaw3wl/article30906847.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE24-DUSH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cong-mlas-blast-haryana-govt-over-new-excise-policy/article30906848.ece

A Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said, “The State should therefore make an inventory, species-wise and district-wise and also have species-wise consumption data of all the wood-based industries and their capacity to utilise them and not proceed with the present proposal till further exercise of making inventory and assessment of actual availability of timber or raw material is done.”

Quashing the March 2019 notification issued by the State government, the green panel noted that the affidavit furnished by the government mentioned that there were 6,686 wood-based industries with a capacity of 41.5 lakh cubic meter per year operating in the State.

“Therefore the total timber that will be actually be available for new industries as per the data given in the affidavit of the State is not going to be more than about 2 lakh cubic metre per year. Therefore, 18 lakh cubic metre timber that has been allotted for new wood-based industries by a State-level committee appears to be absurdly unrealistic,” the Bench observed.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ngt-quashes-up-govt-notice-for-opening-wood-based-industries/article30906837.ece
194,2020/02/24,Jharkhand activists urge Soren govt. to stop NPR exercise,"‘Silence of govt. over CAA, NRC and NPR very disappointing’

The Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha (JJM), a forum of progressive organisations, on Monday came down heavily on the ‘silence’ of the Hemant Soren government on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register.

“The silence of the Jharkhand government on CAA-NRC-NPR is extremely disappointing. The State looks all set to roll out the NPR survey from April 1, 2020. A government that claims to represent the poor and marginalised cannot remain oblivious to the danger of NPR and NRC for people of the State,” said Bharat Bhushan Choudhury, a lead member of JJM, addressing a press conference in Ranchi.

Mr. Choudhury said, “We were expecting that the Jharkhand government would take a decision like its counterpart in Kerala that they are not in favour of conducting the NPR survey in the State. However, the government has not made any such announcement so far.”

“We demand that the government stop all NPR-related activities and also pass a resolution against the CAA and the NRC in the Assembly,” he said.

In a letter to Jharkhand CM signed by activists, including Jean Dreze, the JJM said, “The main purpose of the NPR is to lay the ground for NRC. The NRC is a wasteful exercise that is bound to lead to exclusion and harassment of large number of people especially poor as has already happened in Assam. It will wreak havoc on the poor of Jharkhand especially tribal, Dalit, Muslim and women. The combination of CAA and NRC could easily become a weapon to reduce many Muslims to second-class citizens.”

195,2020/02/24,"Centre denies starvation death, cancellation of ration cards","Ready to prove them wrong, says A-G in Supreme Court

The Centre on Monday denied allegations of a starvation death in Jharkhand and arbitrary cancellation of nearly three crore ration cards of poor people across the country in the Supreme Court, asserting that it was ready to prove them wrong.

“Let it be put on affidavit. I will respond and show all these are wrong. It is all incorrect statistics,” Attorney General K.K. Venugopal told a Bench comprising Chief Justice S.A. Bobde and Justices B.R. Gavai and Surya Kant.

The Attorney General had to intervene when senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing in a PIL, alleged starvation deaths following denial of food in the absence of Aadhaar card.

Mr. Gonsalves also claimed that as many as three crore ration cards of poor people have been cancelled by authorities across the country and a 13-year-old girl had died of starvation in Jharkhand after she was denied ration on account of non-matching of Aadhaar details with her ration card.

Comprehensive affidavit

The Attorney General submitted that the Centre would file a comprehensive affidavit on the issue and was waiting for replies of State governments which failed to file the same in compliance of notices issued to them on December 9, 2019.

He said the Centre would collate the responses of States and file a response.

The PIL petitioner and the Centre made counter charges against each other over the data on alleged cancellation of ration cards.

Mr. Gonsalves referred to the response of Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan in Parliament and said that he had said 2.33 crore ration cards have been cancelled to stop leakages.

The top law officer said that the cancellation pertained to the period 2013 to 2016 and was related to ghost ration cards.

The Bench ordered that it will hear the matter after four weeks and directed the States to file their responses in the meantime.

Earlier, the top court had issued notices to the State governments and had asked them to apprise it of the steps taken for implementation and putting in place the grievance redressal mechanism for ensuring food for all under the Food Security Act.

The Centre had claimed that, after investigation, it had found that the case of Jharkhand was not of starvation death as claimed by Gonsalves.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/centre-denies-starvation-death-cancellation-of-ration-cards/article30906805.ece
196,2020/02/24,DGP remark: din in Punjab House,"Opposition also seeks sacking of Minister over suspended DSP’s allegation

The Punjab Assembly on Monday saw noisy scenes after Opposition parties — the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Aam Aadmi Party — raked up the issue of the controversial remark made by Punjab Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta regarding pilgrims visiting the Kartarpur Gurdwara through the newly built corridor.

Also, the Opposition parties sought sacking of Cabinet Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu in the backdrop of allegations levelled by suspended Deputy Superintendent of Police Balwinder Singh Sekhon of masterminding a bomb blast in the Gur Mandi area of Ludhiana in 1992.

Mr. Ashu, however, had dismissed the allegation and said that “tainted DSP Sekhon was trying to rake up a 30-year-old case for political reasons in which he (Ashu) was duly exonerated by the Court only after due legal process”.

Soon after Question Hour started, members of SAD and AAP shouted slogans and demanded action against the DGP and the Cabinet Minister.

Leader of the Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema demanded sacking of Mr. Ashu from the Cabinet while asking for dismissal of Mr. Dinkar Gupta. Akali Dal members led by its legislative wing leader Sharanjit Dhillon also shouted slogans and alleged that the anti-Sikh face of the Congress party had been exposed.

As the Opposition parties continued with their sloganeering, Speaker Rana K.P. Singh asked members to cooperate in running the House. However, as the MLAs kept shouting slogans, the House was adjourned multiple times.

After his remark created a furore, Punjab Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta had on February 23 expressed regret, stating, “In case any remark made by me has inadvertently caused any hurt to the people of my State, I express my sincere regret as it was never my intention at all. I only want to ensure a safe and peaceful environment in Punjab, necessary for every citizen to flourish and prosper.”

‘Sentiments hurt’

Outside the House, Mr. Cheema alleged that the statement made by the DGP over the Sri Kartarpur corridor was a well thoughtout design, which was divisive in tone and tenor. “The statement made by the DGP had hurt the religious sentiments of millions of Nanak-leva sangat and those who have an abiding faith in the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev from across the world,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/k9crxx/article30906796.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE24-AAP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/dgp-remark-din-in-punjab-house/article30906797.ece

The Bihar government presented its 14th Economic Survey 2019-20 in the Assembly on Monday.

“With an average of over 10% growth, Bihar has registered higher growth than the growth rate of India in the last three years,” Deputy Chief Minister and State Finance Minister Sushil Kumar Modi later told journalists.

“The per capita GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) of Bihar was ₹47,541 at current prices and ₹33,629 at constant prices. The main growth drivers of the economy in Bihar, which registered a double-digit growth and contributed towards real growth of the overall economy of Bihar during 2018-19, are air transport (36%), other services (20%), trade and repair services (17.6%), road transport (14.0%), and financial services (13.8%),” he added.

The Survey said that the “fiscal deficit of the State was 2.68% of GSDP, revenue surplus 1.34% of GSDP, and the outstanding public debt liability of the State government was 32.34% of GSDP during the year 2018-19”.

“The total revenue receipt of Bihar in 2018-19 was ₹1,31,793 crore and capital receipt was ₹20,494 crore. The revenue expenditure and the total expenditure in the state were ₹1,24,897 crore and ₹1,54,655 crore respectively…the revenue receipt increased by 12.2% whereas the revenue expenditure increased by 21.7% in 2018-19 over the previous year,” added the report.

While listing highlights of the Economic Survey report, Mr. Modi further said that “egg production has increased in the state from 111.17 crore in 2016-17 to 176.34 crore in 2018-19 and the total fish production gone up from 4.79 lakh tones in 2013-14 to 6.02 lakh tones in 2018-19”. “Similarly, the annual growth rate of operational agro-based factories in Bihar was 16.4 % over the last 10 years, compared to only 3.3 % at the all India level”, he said. The major employment generating industries, said the report, for working males in the state during 2017-18 were agriculture, forestry and fishing (44.6%), construction (17.1%), wholesale and retail trade, repair of vehicles (12.3%) and manufacturing (9.3 %) and for female workers agriculture, forestry, fishing and education have been the major employment generating industries.

“The per capita consumption of the electricity in the state has risen from 145 kwh in 2012-13 to 311 kwh in 2018-19, implying growth of 114 % in six years and the availability of power has increased from an average of 6-8 hours to 20-22 hours in rural areas and from 10-12 hours to 22-24 hours in urban areas”, Mr Modi said, while adding, “the power capacity availability in the state was 3889 MW in 2018 which increased to 4767 MW in 2019 and in order to meet the increased demand of power, the state government has also planned for additional capacity of 5335 MW from different sources in a phased manner by 2021-22”. The Economic Survey has also put focus on state government’s flagship programme of Jal-Jivan-Hariyali to “tackle issues related to climate change and environmental degradation”. “Besides, the state government has improved its budgetary allocation and operational efficiency too through CFMS (Comprehensive Financial Management System) since 2019 ”, added Mr Modi.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/w0ptsy/article29451806.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THSUSHILMODI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bihars-economy-registers-higher-growth-than-indian-economy-in-last-three-years-govt/article30906767.ece

200,2020/02/24,"In a first, no shutdown in Kashmir on U.S. President's India visit","There was a heightened security across the Valley on Monday, as Mr. Trump landed.

In a first, Kashmir witnessed no separatist Hurriyat backed shutdown during the visit of a United States President. The entire local leaders, both separatists and the regional parties, completely refrained from issuing any statements during President Donald Trump’s two-day visit that began on Monday, unlike the trend witnessed in the past two decades.

There was a heightened security across the Valley on Monday, as Mr. Trump landed. An official said a general red alert was sounded in the Valley. Scores of mobile bunkers were set up on the highways and security forces stepped up operations against active militants and their sleeper cells.

“Operations were on against militants since January but they were paced up a bit to dent any striking capability of any armed group to create an event during the U.S. President's visit”, a senior police officer said.

The anxiety among the security apparatus was due to the past incidents, especially the killing of 36 Sikhs in south Kashmir's Chattisinghpora by unknown gunmen on the eve of then U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to India, first in 22 years then, in March 2000. Separatists had also organised a shutdown coinciding with Mr. Clinton's visit.

In November 2010, all the factions of the Hurriyat, headed by Syed Ali Geelani and Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, called for a shutdown when then US President Barack Obama visited India, in a bid to highlight the Kashmir issue.

Unlike the past, the Valley had a normal day on Monday. Over 10 lakh students returned to schools in uniforms first time in seven months. There was no shutdown call. No Hurriyat factions or separatists issued statements on the occasion.

Even the mainstream political parties, like the National Conference and the People’s Democratic Party, decided to refrain from issuing any statement. Both parties last year welcomed Mr. Trump's offer to mediate in the Kashmir issue.

Though scores of shopkeepers were glued to the television sets at the commercial hub Lal Chowk to keep a tab on the remarks made by Mr. Trump, but most of them refused to comment on their expectations from the visit.

“Traditionally, people in the Valley reacted to the U.S. President's remarks on the Kashmir issue or absence of it.

The opposition Congress in Manipur has reacted sharply to questions in the Class 12 state board examination asking students to draw the poll symbol of the ruling BJP and analyse four negative traits of the approach of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of the country, towards nation building.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday said it had no role in selecting the questions in the political science paper of the board exam that was held on Saturday and the authorities concerned should be asked about it.

The two questions carrying four marks each, which had gone viral on the social media, asked the students to draw the poll symbol of the BJP and analyse four negative traits of Nehru’s approach to nation building.

Taking strong objection to the questions, Congress leader Kh Joykishan had said on Sunday that the paper was an attempt to “instill certain kind of a political mindset” among students.

However, BJP spokesperson Chongtham Bijoy told PTI, “We do not have anything to do with the selection of the questions. The authorities concerned framed the questions and they should be asked about it.”

Chairman of the Council of Higher Secondary Education (Schools) L. Mahendra Singh told PTI that the questions were set by the controller of examination from the chapter on “Party System in India”, which was part of the political science syllabus.

An official, who did not wish to be named, said similar questions were selected in the past as well, wherein the candidates were asked to draw the symbol of the Communist Party of India (CPI) and the logo of the United Nations (UN).

State BJP general secretary N. Nimbus Singh said there was nothing wrong in the question on Nehru.

A 28-year old man was sentenced to death on Monday by a court in Indore in Madhya Pradesh for kidnapping, raping and killing a minor girl in December last year.

Ankit Vijayvargiya was given the death penalty under Section 376(A) (death due to injuries suffered during rape) and Section 302 (murder) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and provisions of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act by Special Sessions Judge (POCSO Act) Varsha Sharma.

He raped the girl and then strangled her, Mr. Sheikh said, adding that DNA samples and CCTV footage, which showed Vijayvargiya with the victim, played an important role in securing the conviction.

A total of 29 witnesses, including parents of the victim, were examined during the course of the trial, Mr. Sheikh said.

Samajwadi Party (SP) and Congress staged a walkout in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly on Monday against alleged police atrocities on peaceful anti-CAA protesters, including women, in Aligarh.

Soon after the House met at 11 a.m., Leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary demanded a discussion on the issue. He alleged that women were lathi-charged and tear gas shells were fired during the protest in Aligarh on Sunday.

SP leader and Congress leader Aradhana Misra, who raised the issue through separate notices, alleged that the government is out crush the peaceful protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

“Is this the ‘Ram rajya’ that the government claims (to be aiming for). It had been jungle law ever since the BJP came to power,” Mr. Misra said, adding that the government is answerable for the police action.

Mr. Chaudhary and Mr. Misra also demanded a judicial probe into the incident by a sitting Supreme Court or high court judge.

In his reply, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna said the Aligarh incident was a result of rivalry between the protesting women and the Bhim Army.

“When vehicles were damaged and there was anarchy, police stepped in and had to use force,” he said.

“The government will unmask those behind these agitations and those patting the backs of protesters. No citizen will have to suffer. It is the attitude of the Opposition which is responsible for it (violence) and nothing will happen if they do not encourage it,” he added.

Expressing dissatisfaction over the minister’s reply, SP and Congress members staged a walkout.

Earlier, Mr. Khanna had said, “I want to ask who is fanning the protests and who is affected by it (CAA) in Uttar Pradesh. We have the answer for everything and law and order is the priority of the government.”

At least five people were injured as anti-CAA protesters and police clashed in the old city area of Aligarh on Sunday.

The police fired teargas shells to disperse the mob that vandalised property and pelted stones at security personnel in Upper Kot area of Kotwali police station, Aligarh District Magistrate Chandra Bhushan Singh said.

Kasturi Basu, a resident of Patuli in south Kolkata, had come back from her routine evening door-to-door campaign against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) on Sunday night when about half a dozen men barged into her house and ‘threatened’ her for campaigning against the citizenship law.

Ms. Basu is a well-known activist and documentary film maker.

“My partner and I reached home when around 9 pm the apartment’s caretaker informed me that seven men who identify themselves as BJP workers have barged into the premises and are looking for me,” she said.

Ms. Basu and her partner Dwaipayan Banerjee, also an activist, are two of the founding members of the People’s Film Collective (PFC), a people-funded body that screens films every month in the city. They also hold the annual People’s Film Festival. Writers like Arundhati Roy and film makers like Anand Patwardhan took part in the PFC’s festivals. Of late, the couple, with a team of a few dozen civil society members, started a door-to-door campaign against the CAA, the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) which has irked the local BJP, Ms. Basu said.

“I took a picture to keep a record of them trespassing into the premises as they started taking a video of me and when I confronted them that this is against my consent, one of them said ‘Ga’er chamra chariye nebo’ [We will skin you alive].” One of them identified as Tulsi Gharami is “one of the foot soldiers of Baban Ghosh, a local BJP strongman,” Ms. Basu said. An FIR has been lodged against them under “common intention of wrongdoing, restrain and assault, criminal intimidation, and trespassing,” she said.

208,2020/02/24,"4,000-year-old crafts village unearthed near Varanasi","A BHU team found a temple, potteries at the site in Babhaniyav near Varanasi

A nearly 4,000-year-old urban settlement has been unearthed by a team of surveyors from the Banaras Hindu University, which experts say could be one of the craft villages mentioned in ancient texts.

The university’s Department of Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology, which did the preliminary survey of the site in Babhaniyav village, 13 km from Varanasi, said it found remnants of one of the settlements mentioned in ancient literature about the holy city.

The survey found a temple dating back to the 5th century through 8th century, potteries which are 4,000-year-old and walls which are 2,000-year-old, said Professor A.K. Dubey of the BHU department.

“On the basis of the surface materials we can say the structure is anywhere between 3,500 to 4,000 year old,” said Mr. Dubey, who is part of the team which will start excavation at the site from February 23.

He said the site gains significance because of its proximity to Varanasi, which is said to be 5,000 years old, though modern scholars believe it to be around 3,000 years old.

“The site at Babhaniyav could be a small sub-centre of Varanasi which grew as an urban town,” said Mr. Dubey.

‘Satellite town’

The findings are important as Babhaniyav could have been a satellite town and feeding centre for Varanasi-Sarnath region, said B.R. Mani, a former additional director general of Archaeological Survey of India.

Mr. Mani was invited by the BHU during its initial survey, and said the team unearthed a 5-metre cultural deposit like the ones found in Sarnath.

Kushan-Brahmi script

“While such crafts villages have been earlier unearthed in Sarnath, Tilmapur, Ramnagar and other areas, Babhaniyav is an addition. They have also found a pillar with a two-line text in Kushan-Brahmi script which makes the findings at least 3,500-4,000 years old. Once the excavation is complete we will get a clearer picture,” Mr. Mani, who heads the National Museum, told PTI.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/7q647o/article30053444.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THIN22BHUREOPENED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/4000-year-old-crafts-village-unearthed/article30900983.ece

The State government’s interest in allowing the establishment of casinos in Karnataka was strongly opposed by Kannada activists at Maddur in Mandya district on Sunday.

In a protest, members of Kasturi Janapara Vedike blocked traffic on the Bengaluru-Mysuru expressway for a while and shouted slogans against Kannada and Culture Minister C.T. Ravi for expressing willingness to open casinos in the State.

The agitators said that Mr. Ravi had no knowledge about the significance and richness of the State’s culture and heritage.

The Minister has expressed his liking to open casinos by claiming that the people of Karnataka were spending money at casinos in Goa and foreign countries. “Unfortunately, Minister B.C. Patil is also defending Ravi,” the protesters said.

214,2020/02/24,NRC will not be implemented in Bihar: Nitish,"NPR would be updated, says the Bihar CM

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar reiterated on Sunday that the National Register for Citizens would not be implemented in Bihar and only the National Population Register would be updated the way it was done in 2010.

The Janata Dal (United) president had in December already made its stand clear that the NRC would not be implemented in the state, though the party supported the Centre’s Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

“NRC is not going to be implemented here (in Bihar) and only NPR will be carried out the way it was done in the year 2010. It will be done on the basis of that only,” Mr. Kumar said in an official release.

He said this while addressing a function at the Maulana Azad National Urdu University at Chandanpatti in Hayaghat block of Darbhanga district, where he laid foundation stones for several schemes worth ₹80 crore pertaining to minority welfare department.

Mr. Kumar laid stones for a 100-bed hostel at Biraul in Darbhanga, 100-bed hostel each for girl and boy for the university students, G plus three multi-storeyed building at waqf land and 560-capacity intake minority residential school, the release said.

215,2020/02/24,Those flagging economy decline looking backward: Jayant Sinha,"‘All indicators, international agencies point towards its revival’

Bharatiya Janata Party MP and former Union Minister Jayant Sinha on Sunday said those claiming the economy was in decline were looking backward.

Speaking to reporters in Bhopal, he said, “All indicators and international agencies point towards the revival of the economy which had faced a temporary slump.”

Stating reasons for the “transient” decline, he said, “The trade war between the United States and China had affected economies across the world. Moreover, credit shock had prompted banks to hold back lending.”

Furthermore, Mr. Sinha termed Chief Minister Kamal Nath’s claim that Madhya Pradesh had received a cut of ₹14,500 crore in the recent Union Budget a “political statement” not representing the “true picture”.

‘Funds not utilised’

In reality, he alleged, the State government was not fully utilising funds earmarked for its various schemes, and not providing utilisation certificates to the Centre.

“Funds are available with the Centre on demand, but Madhya Pradesh is not taking initiative to further any welfare schemes,” he claimed.

“The Budget has something in store for every section of society,” he said. “Besides, the Prime Minister has set the target of making the country a USD 5-trillion economy, and the Budget is a policy road map to achieve it. Moreover, it has given a leg up to startups and investments.”

In the Budget, he said, the government had aimed at providing drinking water to every house. “We have already ensured a pucca house to every poor. This is the next logical step,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/those-flagging-economy-decline-looking-backward-jayant-sinha/article30898667.ece
216,2020/02/24,"Road blockades, dharnas during Bihar bandh","Called by Bhim Army over quota issue

Bandh supporters on Sunday staged dharnas and put up road blockades in many districts of Bihar during the shutdown called by the Bhim Army.

Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad had given a call for a nationwide shutdown to protest against a Supreme Court ruling that syas States were not bound to provide reservation in government jobs and quota in promotions.

Opposition parties such as the RJD, the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party, the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), former the Jan Adhikar Party (Loktantrik) and CPI had extended their support to the Bhim Army’s bandh call.

The bandh supporters belonging to the Bhim Army staged dharnas and blocked national highways and roads at some places in Muzaffarpur, Begusarai, Nawada and Bhagalpur districts for some time during the day-long shutdown.

They also blocked NH 28 near Gobarsahi in Muzaffarpur town, while the movement of Begusarai-Patna Rajya Rani train was hampered for some time in Begusarai.

The State capital remained, by and large, unaffected by the bandh with shops remaining open, traffic remaining unaffected except the Dak Bungalow roundabout, which is in the heart of city, where bandh supporters belonging to the Bhim Army, RLSP, HAM(S) and the JAP staged dharna and demonstrations in support of the bandh.

Some of protesters belonging to Pappu Yadav’s JAP (Loktantrik) targeted a city bus at the Dak Bungalow roundabout and raised anti-government slogans.

‘Sinister design’

Leading a protest at the same spot, former Chief Miinister and HAM(S) chief Jitan Ram said, “I have extended support to the Bhim Army and that is why I am here staging a sit-in to protest against the Centre’s sinister design to end the reservation for SC, ST and OBC.”

Leaders or workers of the RJD, the principal opposition party in Bihar, did not actively participate in the bandh.

RJD Bihar unit spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwary said, “the party has supported the issues raised by the Bhim Army but could not actively participate in the bandh due to a major programme in the State capital for the launch of Tejashwi Prasad Yadav’s Berojgari Hatao Yatra.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nk5q09/article30898657.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE24-AZAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/road-blockades-dharnas-during-bihar-bandh/article30898658.ece

Three Dalit youths were assaulted after being accused of stealing donkeys in Jaisalmer district, the third such incident to come to light in Rajsthan in recent days.

Five persons have been arrested and three detained after a video of the incident surfaced, police said on Sunday.

The incident occurred on February 15 in Rama village of Fatehgarh tehsil of the district.

The youths were thrashed with sticks and kicked by nearly a dozen people for stealing donkeys. They were later handed over to Sangarh police.

“Five persons have been arrested and three minors have been detained so far. A case has been registered in the matter under sections of SC/ST Act and further investigation in the matter is on,” Station House Officer of Sangarh police station Ugam Raj Soni said.

Similar incidents had come to light in Nagaur and Barmer.

Video gone viral

A chilling video of a man being beaten up brutally in Barmer allegedly for committed a theft had gone viral here, prompting the police to arrest a man and detain another on Friday for their alleged roles in the crime.

The video surfaced on Thursday close on the heels of brutal assault on two Dalit youths on similar allegation of theft in Nagaur.

The Barmer incident occurred on January 29.

Police have arrested at least seven persons in connection with the Nagaur case which occurred on February 16. The Dalit men were beaten up, stripped and tortured by staffers of a motorcycle service agency in Karanu village after accusing them of committing theft.

218,2020/02/24,‘Haryana excise policy a recipe for disaster’,"New policy will push the youth of the State into addiction, says Hooda

Terming Haryana’s new excise policy “a recipe for disaster”, former Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition in the State Assembly Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Sunday demanded that the BJP-JJP alliance government to immediately withdraw the new policy.

At a rally in Hisar’s Petwar village, Mr. Hooda said the excise policy announced by the government would push scores of youth into addiction. “Our (Congress’) policy was aimed at encouraging sports and making our youth world champions on the sports field. Their (BJP-JJP) policy is to push the youth of the State into addiction, which is a recipe for disaster. We have already seen what has happened in Punjab, they are pushing Haryana in the same direction,” alleged Mr. Hooda.

The former Chief Minister said the government had spent more than 100 days in office but the alliance partners have not yet been able to work out a Common Minimum Programme.

Mr. Hooda said the performance of the government is evaluated on the basis of the steps it takes to fulfil its pre-poll promises. “Based on what we have seen, we can say that this government has not taken one single step to fulfil the promises it has made in the election manifesto,” he said.

“Farmers are being pushed into debt as the government has increased rates on agricultural inputs and has increased taxes on them, on the other hand the increase in the prices of wheat and paddy has been minimal,” he said, adding that the irregularities in paddy procurement has demonstrated that the government has not given the farmers their due rights.

Former Rohtak Member of Parliament Deepender Singh Hooda said the people of Haryana had voted for change but the JJP has disregarded the mood of the people and deceived them to form a government in alliance with the BJP.

“They need to tell the people if they were given votes to fight the BJP and change the government or join hands with them. The message of this unholy and unprincipled alliance is reverberating all across the country,” he said.

‘Bigger failure’

The MP said the second term of the government would be a bigger failure than the first one.

219,2020/02/24,‘Centre changing way citizenship is granted’,"Precedence to ancestors’ birth over one’s own: Ambedkar

Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi chief Prakash Ambedkar on Sunday said it didn’t matter if the National Population Register (NPR) update was being planned as per the Citizenship Rules, 2003, as the Centre was attempting to “fundamentally change” the way citizenship was granted by giving precedence to the ancestors’s birthplace over one’s own.

“Even for the Assam exercise, the same rules were used which proved disastrous,” said Mr. Ambedkar in Bhopal, at a meeting where participants pledged against not partaking in the NPR update exercise.

“Whether you go by old or the new rules, which are yet to be notified, the information the Centre will seek is not just relating to living persons but also of those who’re dead. It is changing the way citizenship is defined by the Constitution, which grants it to anyone born in the country.”

Mr. Ambedkar, three-time MP, was responding to a query on Chief Minister Kamal Nath’s recent clarification on the December 9 NPR update notification that it was issued under the 2003 Rules of the Citizenship Act, 1955, and not the CAA. “The NPR will not be implemented in the State at present,” Mr. Nath had said.

Today, the political system has paralysed,” said Mr. Ambedkar, grandson of B.R. Ambedkar, the Constitution’s architect. “When Baba Saheb was asked who should take the lead when political parties fail, he pointed to ‘We the People’ in the Preamble on the first page of the Constitution, saying he’d hoped they’d come out to save it and protect rights.”

‘False sense of hope’

Stating that the Centre was trying to generate a false sense of hope among all communities of remaining unaffected by the law, he said, “It will not only affect Muslims, as roughly 40% of Hindus too don’t have documents. In Assam’s case, around 14.3 lakh Hindus were robbed of citizenship.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/45xkxz/article30898631.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE23-PRAKASH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/centre-changing-way-citizenship-is-granted/article30898632.ece
220,2020/02/24,‘The only way to get rid of plastic is to ban it’,"The new generation will find alternatives to plastic and a new economy will emerge, says filmmaker

The scourge of plastic is everywhere and needs to be rooted out, says Craig Leeson, documentary filmmaker, environment and global sustainability ambassador for BNP Paribas. Mr. Leeson’s film, A Plastic Ocean, has won more than 15 film festival awards and has been screened in over 70 countries. The film premiered at the UN General Assembly and talks about ending humanity’s single-use plastic addiction within a generation. Mr. Leeson, a former journalist whose stories helped weed out polluting industries in his Australian city, spoke to The Hindu on the need to move towards a new economy with the help of corporations interested in sustainable development.

How did you get attracted to environmental issues?

I grew up on a beach island called Tasmania, a beautiful place. It gave me the opportunity to interact with incredible creatures and develop a deep connectivity with the ocean, although Burnie, the city I grew up in, had one of the most polluted beaches due to waste from heavy industries like a pulp paper mill, paint pigment plant. It was giving swimmers sores and skin problems, and the place had the highest instances of cancer in Australia. As a journalist, I began investigating the reasons and found the industries responsible for this. We published stories, it became the national headline and resulted in several polluting industries being withdrawn from the city.

Did people lose jobs?

Yes, it did happen initially. But as polluting industries slowly withdrew, different avenues of employment opened up like tourism and cheese manufacturing. It is the migration of the economy to the new, more sustainable one.

How did the idea to make a film on plastic in oceans occur to you?

A friend once told me about the problem of plastic in oceans and asked me to make observations during my travel. I used to travel for my work to beaches, across seas and water bodies. Plastic was so common that before that, I had not noticed it as a problem. But after talking to my friend I started observing and started seeing plastic lying around everywhere. It was so common and such a part of my life that it literally disappeared from my vision.

It’s a part of everyone’s life. We can hardly live without it.

Plastic is the most durable substance we have ever made. It doesn’t biodegrade ever. It has already entered our food chain, a part of our body, possibly with all its chemicals. Everything that is made up of plastic ends up being thrown in the ocean or piles up on land. The only way to get rid of it is to ban it.

Will a ban work, especially when it has financial repercussions?

Rwanda was one of the first countries to ban plastic bags with strict punishments for its use. Several states in the United States have banned it and many other countries in Europe and Asia may follow suit. Maharashtra too has banned single-use plastic. But only legislation is not enough, there has to be effective implementation. The issue of economic activity being hampered, jobs being lost after banning plastic, especially in a developing country like India, are bound to be raised. But with new challenges come opportunities towards a new economy. The new economy towards sustainable growth is possible giving ample of opportunities.

Is the migration to a new economy is easier said than done?

There are global problems staring at us. Be it climate change or switching from fossil fuels to renewables. Where do we look for opportunities? Opportunity comes with entrepreneurship, with finding new solutions, new businesses, developing new technology. Another area of opportunity is finding better technology to use renewable energy to tackle single-use plastic. There are problems with fossil fuels or single-use plastics. But the new generation, when confronted with problems, will try to find to solutions. I am positive about it. This will lead to new businesses, a new economy. Financial institutions like BNP Paribas, governments, technology companies will come forward and legislations will be made and implemented when opportunities for the new economy are explored.

How important is the role of environmental activists, social groups and individuals, especially the younger generation, towards achieving this?

Immense. Every protest and movement starts with an individual’s idea. I realised it after I started showing my documentary on plastic in schools. The feedback was extremely positive. I met an oil company CEO at a conference where he told me about his son watching my documentary and asking him why he was working in the oil industry. An individual like Greta (Thunberg) is the best example of how the young generation is making the right kind of noise. After all, it is this generation which will inherit the earth and face the consequences of our actions today. This generation is smart, educated and informed. The future lies with them.",states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/7988g9/article30898968.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24bm-Craig-3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/the-only-way-to-get-rid-of-plastic-is-to-ban-it/article30898892.ece
221,2020/02/24,‘Why is Pawar obsessed with Babri mosque?’,"Fadnavis announces support to Thackeray if he brings in a resolution implementing CAA and NPR in Maharashtra

Former chief minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday asked why Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar was concerned about building a mosque named after Babar, who invaded the country, but not disclosing his intention about construction of the Ram temple.

The BJP, on the eve of the budget session of the legislature, attempted to take advantage of a disagreement between the three parties in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government over the issue of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizenship (NRC), and National Population Register (NPR). It said the BJP would support Shiv Sena chief and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray if he decided to bring in a resolution announcing implementation of the CAA and NPR in Maharashtra. “The MVA government was formed on November 28 but is still a directionless and U-turn government. We are in no mood to attend the tea party of the State government,” Mr. Fadnavis said.

An invitation to the Opposition for tea is for better communication, he said. “But I think it is the Sena, Congress and NCP who need to improve their communication first. They have not implemented a single promise, very clearly showing that all those were false promises.” He was referring to the Congress’s opposition to implement the CAA and NPR in the State, while Mr. Thackeray has softened his stand on implementing them, with an assurance that they would bring no harm to the people.

Raking up the issue of Mr. Pawar questioning the non-formation of a trust to construct a mosque on the lines of the Ram temple trust, Mr. Fadnavis said, “I don’t know whether he wants a Ram temple or not. But why is he obsessed with constructing Babri mosque, named after an invader? I think leaders as big as him should control what they say in public and avoid appeasement politics.”

Addressing a press conference after holding a meeting of BJP legislators to decide the Opposition’s strategy in the budget session, Mr. Fadnavis said he congratulates Mr. Thackeray on two counts. “He decided to hand over the probe into the urban Naxal issue to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and supported the CAA and NPR.”

The former CM slammed the Congress for its alleged disrespect shown towards Hindutva ideologue V.D. Savarkar in its mouthpiece Shidori, where he was called an apologist and also allegedly jailed in England over allegations of committing a rape. “How can the Sena, which idolises Savarkar, remain in power with such a party? We want the government to bring in a resolution celebrating the work of Savarkar on February 26,” he said.

Commenting on the Central government transferring the probe in the Bhima-Koregaon violence and Elgar Parishad case to the NIA, the BJP leader said the decision was a welcome step as the probe till now by the Maharashtra Police had shown the spread of urban Maoism in different States.

“Mr. Pawar had claimed that the Bhima-Koregaon violence was due to Hindutva forces. His theory was turning out to be wrong after the police probe and that is why he is questioning the probe by the State police,” Mr. Fadnavis claimed.",states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/2u2nbk/article30898870.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BMFADNAVIS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/why-is-pawar-obsessed-with-babri-mosque/article30898742.ece
222,2020/02/24,Chennai’s pocket-sized breakdancers,"As this generation of under-12 Bboys and Bgirls shows, children today have it easier taking up ‘Street’ culture, cheered on by supportive mentors who paved the way

When Bboy Found steps on to the makeshift dance floor, you already know the crowd is rooting for him.

His determined eyes and slight frown of focus mirror that of his opponent: they are both ready for battle. The intensity of their performance, complete with flips, handstands and plenty of attitude, has the audience whooping. Even though Found doesn’t win that particular battle, it is clear that the crowd — which includes some of Chennai’s earliest and most seasoned street dancers — is optimistic about him. Largely because Found is barely eight years old.

He might be the youngest among the Bboyers gathered in Velachery for this year’s edition of Revolution 2.0, but Found is not exactly an exception. There are at least 20 participants in the under-16 category, and most of them seem to be younger than 12.

Of course, there are others as well — dancers who have represented India on global stages, dancers who have given a decade of their lives to building a Street culture in the city in the first place — but it is the little ones who kick off the two-day series of Bboying, hiphop, beatbox and rap performances.

The circles that form around them, the encouragements that are hollered each time they stumble or freeze, the “woooah!” that rings out each time they pull off an impressive manoeuvre, turns what was supposed to be a day of highstrung competition into a surprisingly nurturing space.

But it is surprising only to the outsider looking in. For anyone an inkling of Street culture in the city — indeed, for anyone who spends even an hour at Revolution 2.0 — it is clear that the city’s first generation of Bboyers is not only encouraging its youngest one, but also openly doting on it.

Support all around

One of the oldest dance crews in town is All For One, whose founder, Anto George, has been tying up with schools to provide Bboying and street dance lessons to children for years. Today, many among the city’s Bboyers are following suit, teaching either at schools or dance institutions. And with the inhibitions and ignorance around the dance having been dispelled, parents are now lapping it all up, giving their children one more talent to build.

Take, for instance, Drusilla Melony. All of 12 years old, she doesn’t want to call herself a Bgirl just yet — “I am still learning different dances and haven’t decided what to focus on,” she says right after making it to the open style finals. “I can do pop, lock, break, house, contemporary and krump,” she lists out, but this is redundant information for anyone who has seen her battle her way up to at least two different final rounds out of the three — hiphop, break and open.

Drusilla has gone through a number of dance coaches in her seven years of Bboying. At the moment, she is learning at Raack Academy of Dance. She is not the only one to have come here with formal training, supportive parent in tow to keep her hydrated and take proud selfies. The tight circle around each battle is riddled with almost as many phone camera-weilding parents and siblings as Bboys and Bgirls. The shift, from Street’s early days in the city, is a drastic one.

“When we started dancing 13 years ago, we started from scratch. People were learning jazz and techno, but not street style. There was one man teaching us, and he had learnt it from the right places in the US,” recalls Bboy Dezee. “All the judges today and yesterday started out that way, with our parents not having a clue about what street dance is and telling us to focus on something else, something that will help us earn money,” he continues.

This was back in 2006-2007. In 2020, Chennai has around six dance crews and at least 80 breakdancers, many of whom either moonlight at dance studios mushrooming around the city or teach part-time in schools. He adds, “We didn’t even have identification for the different types of street dance. Now, these schools have the facilities and the know-how, which is also why the parents feel comfortable letting their children learn this.” Which is also why Drusilla now has the ability to focus on different variations of the dance, and tell us which ones she is good at.

Bboy Karan of the BFab dance crew has been dancing for about four years now, and also takes hiphop classes at Crews of Dance in Anna Nagar. “We teach the children, urge them to go for battles, and teach them the history of the art form. They should know where the dance came from,” he says, after having won a doubles final himself.

Dezee, however, is cautious in his optimism: “It is good that people finally have a thirst to learn this form of art. Now, it is up to the parents to do their research and approach a teacher who really knows the form. Only then can we build a solid culture in the city and take it to the world.”",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/k4bif2/article30904148.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26mphiphop7,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/chennais-pocket-sized-breakdancers/article30904149.ece
223,2020/02/24,A fine all-round effort: Williamson,"Praises pacemen who executed the ‘choke the Indians’ plan

Grace and dignity are the two words that sum up Kane Williamson as captain.

In victory or defeat [remember the excruciatingly painful World Cup final setback] these qualities shine through in this marvellous cricketer.

Level-headed

A captain and a leader of men, Williamson was typically level-headed after a crushing 10-wicket win over India. No bold talk, just common sense.

The Kiwi skipper said, “We know the quality of India and what they bring all around the world. We were aware of that challenge but were trying to focus on the areas that were important to us — our plans, our roles.”

Williamson said, “Our performance, across the board, was a very good one on a surface that I thought created a good balance between bat and ball.

“There were handy contributors with the bat too, it was a really brilliant all-round game for us.”

He complimented his pacemen. “These guys, especially this morning, put the ball in the right areas. There wasn't the sort of wind that we expect here in Wellington but we got a bit of shape and created opportunities. Throughout the match there was something [in the pitch] to keep us interested.”

On the Kiwi plan to ‘choke’ the Indian batsmen, he said, “You’re always trying to execute a plan and the bowlers were superb which allowed you to put fielders in areas where you could create something.

“It’s always nice to put a guy somewhere and have them hit it there and you get a wicket.”

Williamson said, “The lower-order partnerships were quite important to get that 183-run lead. Those late cameos really helped.”

Making things happen

On employing the short ball successfully, Man-of-the-Match Tim Southee said, “Neil [Wagner] usually does that for us and he is a great exponent of it. Without him, it was about trying things when the game was sitting in balance and not much was happening.”

Southee said, “Being a swing bowler helps, and being able to swing the ball is always handy when it is windy.”

Swing was the theme at the Basin.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/a-fine-all-round-effort-williamson/article30906387.ece
224,2020/02/24,"No excuses, says a grim Kohli","Captain feels team caved in without a fight rather uncharacteristically

Virat Kohli’s furrowed brows told the tale. The India skipper’s body language could not mask the pain of defeat.

As skipper of the World No. 1 Test team he takes pride in his side’s performances overseas. India, though, was swept aside by New Zealand at the Basin Reserve.

Blunt and direct

Kohli was blunt and direct, he did not make excuses.

Kohli said the team had not been competitive enough. He recalled how the team had fought all the way even in matches it had lost.

“But I think we let ourselves down massively with the bat in the first innings. If we had got 230 or 240 we would have given our bowlers a chance,” he said. “You could say the toss played a big role, but that’s an uncontrollable, so you can’t focus on that.”

Kohli said India had not been at its best in this Test. “Only if we accept this, we will come out in the next game with a much better mind-set and much more competitive.”

The captain felt shot-selection was very important in these conditions. Kohli said the New Zealand bowlers got into the minds of the batsmen — bowling with accuracy, fielders around the bat.

“You have to hit past those fielders and therein lies the risk. This pitch was slow and on the drier side. So we weren’t able to get our shots away,” he said.

Deceptive scores

Given his potential, Kohli was willing to give Prithvi Shaw more time.

About himself, Kohli said, “I am batting really well. Sometimes the scores do not reflect how you are batting and that can happen when you don’t execute what you can well.”

Kohli said India needed to block all the noise from outside [criticism] and approach the Christchurch Test with a clear mind-set. And the batsmen had to take responsibility. It was more a mental thing than technical, he said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/u0pxtn/article30906266.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25VIRAT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/no-excuses-says-a-grim-kohli/article30906267.ece
225,2020/02/24,100 says the icing on New Zealand’s victory cake,"Southee and Boult combine to inflict an emphatic 10-wicket defeat on fancied India

New Zealand’s 100th Test win, driven typically by team spirit, fittingly arrived at the the Basin Reserve, the soul of the country’s cricket really.

And the feat, an emphatic 10-wicket win against fancied India, arrived in the 100th Test of one of New Zealand’s favourite cricketing sons, Ross Taylor. The icing on the cake really.

As for the Indians, they were blown away at windy Wellington.

Ruthless

Ruthless and clinical on the fourth morning of the first Test, New Zealand required just 16 overs to send back the last six Indian batsmen.

Tim Southee scalped five, and Boult four. Southee was adjudged Man-of-the-Match for his nine wickets in the match.

Four of the wickets on Monday were prised out with the old ball, then Southee scalped two in his first over with the new one as India hurtled to 191 all out.

Openers, Tom Latham and Tom Blundell, knocked off the nine runs required without fuss. New Zealand had clinched the first Test, taking its points to 120 in the World Test Championship. India stays on 360.

The pitch offered some movement and the New Zealand attack posed searching questions, but the Indian batsmen could have put up greater resistance.

In the end, the surrender was meek and out of character for this team that prides itself on fighting till the very end.

The next Test is at Christchurch following a four-day gap. Coach Ravi Shastri is bound to have a tough talk with the boys.

The Kiwis are not the quickest of bowlers but are among the cleverest. The manner in which they mix their lengths, vary angles and assess a batsman underlines their cricketing nous.

There was much planning about every batsman here and the execution, was often, spot-on. They gave little away, bowled in partnerships, created pressure and were backed by a sensational bunch of fielders.

A fine pair

Talking about partnerships, they seldom come better than Boult and Southee. It’s a left-right pair of contrasts and similarities that has now featured in 28 of New Zealand’s Test victories.

Both are swing bowlers who induce the batsmen into drives around the off-stump to find the edges or bring the ball back, or surprise them with well-directed short-pitched deliveries.

It was clever bowling by Boult on the fourth morning, when he went round the wicket and got a delivery to angle into Ajinkya Rahane and then straighten up. The edge was snaffled up gleefully by ’keeper B-J. Watling.

Then, Southee set up Hanuma Vihari brilliantly. Two out-swingers were followed by an in-swinger. Vihari playing for the out-swinger saw the ball zipping back to hit off-stump.

Southee then unleashed a full and straight delivery to trap R. Ashwin leg-before. The batsman chose not to review the decision and was right.

At the other end, Rishabh Pant was playing his brand of strokeplay, swinging pacemen fine for boundaries.

However, he kept losing partners. Ishant Sharma, put down twice, once at short-leg [by Latham] and by Southee at short-cover, was eventually trapped leg-before by a well-pitched-up delivery from Colin de Grandhomme.

Grandhomme has an important role in the New Zealand attack; he bowls longish spells of control and accuracy, choking batsmen for runs, maintaining the pressure.

Terrific catches

Pant’s strength resulted in his downfall. The left-hander went on his knees to swing Southee, operating with the second new ball, only for Boult to dive forward and come up with a terrific catch. The Southee-Boult combination had struck again!

Then Southee’s yorker outside off was somehow edged by Bumrah — nothing has gone right for him in this Test — for substitute Daryl Mitchell to pluck the catch one-handed in the slip cordon.

Southee and Boult were smiling as they walked back. It takes two to tango.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/3au1lu/article30906171.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25HANUMA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/100-says-the-icing-on-new-zealands-victory-cake/article30906174.ece
226,2020/02/24,"Now, DRS in Ranji","Four referrals per innings in semifinals and final

One of the most sought-after firsts during the Ranji Trophy semifinals starting over the weekend will be

The Decision Review System (DRS) will be implemented, albeit with limited tools, in the Ranji Trophy semifinals starting over the weekend and the final later on. It is understood that the teams will be given four referrals per innings and the DRS will not involve either Hot Spot, Snicko or Ball Tracker.

Instead, the third umpire will have a slow-motion camera and a pitch map along with spin vision to assist him. This effectively means lbw decisions that can be reversed are the ones that have been adjudged out despite an inside edge or when the ball has pitched outside the leg-stump or the impact has been outside off-stump. Even close caught-behind decisions may be referred to the third umpire.

“Look, it’s a beginning. We are initiating what we are calling ‘limited DRS’ with an objective to eliminate howlers. I am sure the initiative will help the tournament and the teams a great deal,” Saba Karim, BCCI’s General Manager (Cricket Operations) told The Hindu on Monday.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/now-drs-in-ranji/article30906109.ece
227,2020/02/24,"It’s official, Saurashtra in semifinals","Skipper Bharat’s half-century prevents a push for victory by the visitors

With no scope for any dramatic twists or turns on the final day, last year’s finalist Saurashtra moved into the semifinal by virtue of its massive first-innings lead of 283 runs against Andhra in the five-day Ranji Trophy quarterfinal which ended in a tame draw at the CSR Sarma College Ground here on Monday.

Batting on

Significantly, Saurashtra, overnight 375 for nine, did not declare the innings this morning and go for an outright win, but played on till the 15th over of the morning when captain Jaydev Unadkat holed out in the deep off Karan Shinde.

Then, chasing an impossible target of 710 in 73 possible overs, Andhra was obviously never in the hunt. In a way, it was a chance for some of the batsmen to make amends.

Saurashtra captain and left-arm pacer Unadkat, who did not come onto the field when the innings started with left-arm spinner Dharmendrasinh Jadeja opening the bowling, didn’t bowl a single over when he eventually came on an hour later.

Regular wicketkeeper Avi Barot rolled his arm a la Sachin Tendulkar while Harvik Desai donned the gloves.

And, Andhra didn’t help its cause struggling to 66 for four. Unadkat’s brilliant diving catch in the deep to send back opener D.B. Prashanth Kumar off Dharmendrasinh was a special effort symbolising his commitment given the match situation.

Gritty

And, it was only another gritty, unbeaten half-century from captain K. Srikar Bharat and his unbroken, 86-run stand for the fifth wicket with Shinde that preempted a possible Saurashtra push for a dramatic win in the final session.

Play was eventually called off at the stroke of tea with Andhra at 149 for four.

The scores:

Saurashtra — 1st innings: 419.

Andhra — 1st innings: 136.

228,2020/02/24,Mushfiqur’s double ton puts Bangladesh on top,"Mominul also hits century; Zimbabwe in a spot

Mushfiqur Rahim hit his third Test double century as Bangladesh declared its first innings with a lead of 295 in the one-off match against Zimbabwe here on Monday.

Bangladesh ended its innings at 560 for six in the final session before spinner Nayeem Hasan then claimed two wickets off two balls in the first over.

The visitors reached nine for two at stumps on the third day, still needing 286 runs to make Bangladesh bat again on a wearing pitch at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium.

Mushfiqur, who became the highest run-scorer for Bangladesh in Tests, hit an unbeaten 203, while skipper Mominul Haque made 132, after the hosts resumed on 240 for three.

Mushfiqur and Mominul added 222 for the fourth wicket, while wicketkeeper-batsman Liton Das made 53 to give the hosts their highest-ever total against Zimbabwe. Mominul declared the innings soon after Mushfiqur reached the 200-run mark after Ainsley Ndlovu past extra cover for a boundary. Nayeem struck with the second ball of the innings, bowling Prince Masvaure for a duck, before dismissing nightwatchman Doland Tiripano.

The scores: Zimbabwe 265 and 9/2 in five overs vs. Bangladesh 560/6 decl. in 154 overs (Mushfiqur Rahim 203 n.o., Mominul Haque 132, Najmul Hossain 71, Liton Das 53, Tamim Iqbal 4).",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/oy215a/article30905783.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25MUSH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/mushfiqurs-double-ton-puts-bangladesh-on-top/article30905784.ece

Rahul has been in fine form for India, averaging over 75 in his last eight ODIs.

His addition will come as a huge boost to Karnataka, but will also present the team management with a selection dilemma. “KL’s comeback is a healthy headache for us,” said coach Yere Goud. “It’s a tough call for us. We will see how the wicket is and then decide on the combination.”

Spinner Poonam Yadav claimed three wickets as India defeated Bangladesh by 18 runs in a Group A match of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup here on Monday.

Invited to bat, India posted a competitive 142 for 6 and then returned to restrict Bangladesh to 124 for 8 to notch up their second successive win in the showpiece event.

Chasing 143 to win, Murshida Khatun compiled a 26-ball 30 after her opening partner Shamima Sultana was sent packing in the second over by Shikha Pandey.

Once Khatun was removed by Arundhati Reddy, Nigar Sultana (35) tried to keep them in the hunt but Bangladesh struggled against the quality spin bowling of Poonam Yadav, who claimed three wickets to derail Bangladesh’s chase.

Arundhati Reddy (2/33) and Pandey (2/14) took two wickets each, while Rajeshwari Gayakwad (1/25) accounted for one wicket.

Earlier, 16-year-old opener Shafali Verma gave India a rollicking start, smashing a 17-ball 39 which contained two fours and four sixes.

Jemimah Rodrigues also scored a crucial 37-ball 34, but rest of the batsmen failed to fire as India’s run-rate took a hit.

Down the order, Veda Krishnamurthy then blasted 20 off 11 balls studded with four boundaries to lift them to a fighting total.

For Bangladesh, skipper Salma Khatun (2/25) and Panna Ghosh (2/25) claimed two wickets each.

India women: 142 for six in 20 overs (Shafali Verma 39; Salman Khatun 2/25, Panna Ghosh 2/25).

231,2020/02/24,"It was pretty tricky for us, says Karun","Rasool feels inexperience cost J & K

Karnataka has been involved in a fair few close games this Ranji Trophy season, emerging from tense situations to triumph over Tamil Nadu, Mumbai and Railways. The scorecard from the Gandhi Memorial Science College here may suggest that the margin between Karnataka and Jammu & Kashmir was large, but in reality the game turned on one little passage of play.

“It was pretty tricky for us,” Karun Nair admitted afterwards. “They were 107/2 at one point (in the first innings). To come back from there was really commendable. Everyone chipped in when it was required. We got that crucial lead which eased that pressure. It was a slight relief,” he said.

Karnataka reached the semifinals of the Ranji Trophy in the 2017-18 and 18-19 seasons but lost on both occasions.

Karun hoped things would be different this time. “They were close games and we just fell on the wrong side both times. Hopefully we’ll be third time lucky. The message to the boys will be: if we find ourselves in a good position, it’s time to put our foot down and kill the game off,” he said.

Meanwhile, J & K skipper Parvez Rasool felt inexperience had cost his side. “From 192/7 to 192 all out…it was just a little inexperience that cost us. I felt Karnataka had given up at that point. If we had taken even a small lead, we would have dictated terms,” he said.

Rasool took pride in J & K’s Ranji Trophy campaign. “We lost only two out of 10 matches all season,” he said.

“We won six games in the league stages. Even here, we dominated for two days. To bowl out a mighty team like Karnataka for 206 is a great effort. People travelled 300km from Srinagar to watch us here. That matters to us.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/it-was-pretty-tricky-for-us-says-karun/article30904716.ece
232,2020/02/24,Karnataka seals its spot in the semifinals,"K. Gowtham takes seven as J & K folds for 163

In the end, it was comfortable for Karnataka, a 167-run win that sealed its spot in the semifinals of the Ranji Trophy.

Set an improbable target of 331 in 58 overs, Jammu and Kashmir folded for 163 on the fifth afternoon at the Gandhi Memorial Science College. K. Gowtham took seven for 54, swiftly ending a run chase that the batting side was never really going to take seriously.

Karnataka will now face Bengal, in Kolkata from February 29, for a place in the final.

Monday’s events, though, felt like a formality. All the air had been sucked out of the contest on the previous afternoon, when Karnataka stole the first-innings lead from under the opponent’s noses.

On the final morning, the touring side was already ahead by 259 runs, and it was merely a question of when and not if.

Siddharth falls for 98

K.V. Siddharth, who was 75 overnight, fell two short of what would have been a third First Class hundred. It was the softest of dismissals, Siddharth driving Abid Mushtaq straight into the hands of the short-midwicket fielder. The 27-year-old batsman was later declared man-of-the-match; nobody would have grudged him a hundred here.

Karnataka was bowled out for 316 at the stroke of lunch. What little interest there was in J & K’s pursuit evaporated quickly, when K. Gowtham packed off Shubham Khajuria and Abdul Samad in the 11th over.

In reality, Parvez Rasool’s men knew they had squandered their chances on day four. In the days, weeks and months ahead, they will wonder what might have been. Five more minutes of measured batting, two more overs of composure, one more calm head, and things may have turned out differently.

Karnataka would have fancied its chances of forcing a win even after conceding a narrow lead. But the eight-time champion would also have been under pressure, and J & K would have been in a position to dictate terms. We will never know.

The charges are all related to the ICC men’s T20 World Cup Qualifiers 2019 held in the United Arab Emirates.

According to an ICC statement, Al Balushi breached Article 2.1.1 of the Anti-Corruption Code — being party to an agreement or effort to fix or contrive in any way the result, progress, conduct or any other aspect of matches.

Besides, he also breached Article 2.1.4, Article 2.4.4 and Article 2.4.7 — all relating to corrupt practices.

Under the provisions of the code, Al Balushi chose to admit the charges and agreed the sanction with the ICC in lieu of an Anti-Corruption Tribunal hearing.

“This is a very serious offence where a player attempted but failed to get a team mate to engage in corrupt activity in high profile games and this is reflected in the severity of the sentence,” ICC General Manager, Integrity, Alex Marshall said.

“Without Balushi’s admission of guilt and full cooperation throughout our investigation, the ban could have been significantly longer.

“The player has also indicated that he is willing to contribute to future integrity education programmes on our behalf to help younger players learn from his mistakes,” he added.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/5mw0vf/article30901429.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CRICKETFILE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/icc-bans-oman-player-from-all-cricket-for-seven-years-on-match-fixing-charges/article30901430.ece
234,2020/02/24,"My scores don’t reflect the way I am batting, says Kohli","New Zealand has been one rare overseas tour in recent times when Kohli could not live up to his high standards.

Virat Kohli is not unduly perturbed by his relatively low run of scores on the tour of New Zealand as the premier batsman feels analysing too much can unnecessarily clutter his mind.

New Zealand has been one rare overseas tour in recent times when Kohli could not live up to his high standards, scoring only one half-century so far in nine innings across three formats.

His sequence of scores read 45, 11, 38, 11 (T20s); 51, 15, 9 (ODIs) and 2 and 19 (1st Test). So how does he assess his own batting performance?

“I am absolutely fine. I am batting really well. I feel that sometimes scores don’t reflect the way you are batting and that’s what can happen when you don’t execute what you want to well,” Kohli told mediapersons after India lost the first Test by 10 wickets.

For one of the world’s busiest international cricketers, a lull of 3-4 innings shouldn’t be a cause of concern.

“Look when you play so much cricket and you play for so long, obviously you will have 3-4 innings that don’t go your way. If you try and make too much out of it, it’ll keep piling on,” the skipper has his priorities clear.

He doesn’t pay too much attention to how people react to a defeat, and Kohli follows the same philosophy when they talk about his batting.

“I think it’s about staying in a good space and I know the chat on the outside changes with one innings. But I don’t think like that. If I thought like people on the outside, I would probably be on the outside right now,” Kohli said with a hint of sarcasm.

According to him, making an honest effort everytime one goes out in the middle should be the priority.

“I think it’s all about doing the basics right and putting the hard work in practice. You can’t really walk in thinking that I have to do it every time. You want to do it. But if it doesn’t come off, then you don’t have to beat yourself up too much.”

At the Hagley Oval in Christchurch, Kohli will be happy to even score a 40 if that helps the team win the Test match. A century in a lost cause is irrelevant as far as he is concerned.

“I am looking forward to contributing in a win in the next Test. It doesn’t matter what I do. It’s never been about my performance on tour or about how many runs I score. It’s all about if the team wins, even a 40 is good. If the team loses, then even a 100 is irrelevant for me, and I’m going to stay in that mindset,” he stated.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/dw8pj0/article30901421.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24KOHLI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/my-scores-dont-reflect-the-way-i-am-batting-says-kohli/article30901422.ece
235,2020/02/24,New Zealand beats India by 10 wickets in series-opening test,"If the first innings was about mixing back of length deliveries with fuller length balls, the second innings saw the pacers coming from round the wicket and targeting the rib-cage

Indian batsmen’s inadequacies in adverse conditions were laid bare as they crashed to an embarrassing 10-wicket defeat against a ruthless New Zealand side that wrapped up the opening Test in just over three days here on Monday.

Starting the day on 144 for four, India were all out for 191 in 81 overs in their second innings. This was a shade better after their dismal 165 in the first innings, which eventually proved to be decisive.

Trent Boult (4/39 in 22 overs) and Tim Southee (5/61 in 21 overs), one of the finest but most under-rated new ball pairs in world cricket, showed that when it boils down to playing incisive seam and swing bowling, this batting line-up is still a work in progress.

The required target of nine runs was knocked off by New Zealand without much ado for their 100th Test win.

India’s last defeat was against Australia at Perth during the 2018-19 series but the loss at the Basin Reserve would hurt them more because the visitors have not surrendered in such fashion of late.

There was no resistance from a star-studded line-up and more than intent, the failure was due to poor technique on a track that had something on the third and fourth day as well.

This is a team that plays fast bowling much better than their predecessors, the reason for their success on the bouncy Australian tracks. But when it comes to facing conventional seam and swing bowling in testing conditions, they are yet to learn the art of saving a Test match.

India had lost the mental battle on the first day itself when they saw the moisture on the wicket.

The toss became a factor and not for one session did they look comfortable. Mayank Agarwal was the only batsman, who felt at home at patches, as New Zealand showed what a Test match strategy is all about.

If the first innings was about mixing back of length deliveries with fuller length balls, the second innings saw the pacers coming from round the wicket and targeting the rib-cage. The line was disconcerting and it stifled them for good.

It affected their mindset and once Ajinkya Rahane and Hanuma Vihari stepped out on the fourth morning, defeat was written all over as both looked ill-equipped to handle such high quality seam bowling.

Rahane (29 off 75 balls) and Vihari (15 off 79 balls) are players who only play long-form cricket at the international level and both are known for their patience.

But little would have the Indian vice-captain apprehended that he would get a delivery from Boult, which he thought would move away after pitching but it held its line and he had no option but to jab at it, and all he got was an edge.

Southee, who bowls lovely classical outswinger then bowled an off-cutter from the other end and before Vihari could comprehend, it came back sharply to peg the stumps back.

Within first 20 minutes, the two seasoned practitioners of swing had knocked the stuffing out of India’s resistance.

Rishabh Pant (25 off 41 balls) batted only in the manner he can and played one breathtaking shot off Southee — a slog sweep off a 130kmph-plus delivery to the deep mid-wicket boundary.

But there was too much left to do with too little support from the other end. Bending on one knee, he tried another audacious slog scoop but couldn’t clear.

Southee, who had a terrific match, deservingly completed his 10th five-wicket haul and all it took was 16 overs to end the innings and the match.

236,2020/02/24,Confident India takes on plucky Bangladesh,"A win will take the former closer to the knock-out rounds

High on confidence after the impressive win over title holder Australia, India will look to carry forward the momentum against a plucky Bangladesh in its second Group A match of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup here on Monday.

Leg-spinner Poonam Yadav’s magical spell helped India defeat Australia by 17 runs in the tournament opener on Friday but the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side can’t afford to take Bangladesh lightly as it had defeated India twice in the 2018 T20 Asia Cup.

More required

Jemimah Rodrigues and Shafali Verma, who hit a typically aggressive 29 off 15 balls against Australia, will need to come good against Bangladesh.

In the last five meetings between the two sides, India is ahead 3-2 on head-to-head record and a win on Monday will take it closer to the knock-out rounds from the five-team group.

India will, however, need to improve its batting as it scored a below par 132 against Australia.

Captain Harmanpreet and opener Smriti Mandhana contributed little with the bat in the previous match and both will need to fire and put up a big total or chase down a target.

In another match on Monday, Australia plays Sri Lanka.

The teams (from):

India: Harmanpreet Kaur (Capt.), Smriti Mandhana, Jemimah Rodrigues, Deepti Sharma, Shafali Verma, Poonam Yadav, Radha Yadav, Taniya Bhatia (wk), Harleen Deol, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Richa Ghosh, Veda Krishnamurthy, Shikha Pandey, Arundhati Reddy and Pooja Vastrakar.

Bangladesh: Salma Khatun (Capt.), Rumana Ahmed, Ayasha Rahman, Fahima Khatun, Fargana Hoque, Jahanara Alam, Khadija Tul Kubra, Sobhana Mostary, Murshida Khatun, Nahida Akter, Nigar Sultana (wk), Panna Ghosh, Ritu Moni, Sanjida Islam and Shamima Sultana.

240,2020/02/24,‘CAA aimed at diverting people from economic recession’,"The Central Government had introduced the Citizenship (Amendment) Act to divert people’s attention from economic recession, Kongunadu Makkal Desiya Katchi general secretary E.R. Eswaran said here on Sunday.

“The government went ahead with the legislation despite knowing that it will draw protest. But it still did so because it did not want the people to talk about economic recession. And, that is why it is trying to project it as a Hindu-Muslim issue, when it is actually a BJP-versus-Muslim issue.”

In projecting so, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was attempting to gain political capital, he added.

The government legislating the CAA could be compared to its demonetisation move – though it had said the exercise was aimed at eliminating black money, the result was that only the people suffered.

Likewise, the CAA would only make the citizens suffer.

But the real issue before the people today was economic recession.

Tamil Nadu was among the states suffering the most. And, particularly the Kongu region. Several micro, small and medium enterprises faced the threat of closure and workers therein were looking at an uncertain future.

Now, the question before the people was not when the economy would revive, but if it would.

On the delay in conducting urban local body polls, the Kongu party leader said after the verdict in rural local body polls, it was doubtful if the ruling AIADMK would announce polls. If it did not, approaching the court would be the only solution.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/caa-aimed-at-diverting-people-from-economic-recession/article30898199.ece
241,2020/02/24,Coimbatore Corporation's failure to complete toilet construction may impact Swachh Sarvekshan ranking,"‘Beneficiaries not ready as the cost of construction had shot up to over ₹ 25,000 a toilet’

As the city awaits the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs’ ranking of cities on cleanliness (Swachh Sarvekshan), it appears that the Coimbatore Corporation has left much to expect a jump in ranking.

Last year, the Ministry had ranked Coimbatore at 40 as it had scored 3,412 marks out of 5,000 in its peer category – cities with over 10 lakh population.

The year before – in 2018 – the Ministry had ranked the city at 16 for 3,292 out of 5,000 marks.

Though there was a marginal increase in marks scored, the city fell by 24 places. Sources familiar with the subject attributed the fall in rank to other cities performing better than Coimbatore.

Municipal corporations in those cities worked better than the Coimbatore Corporation in improving sanitation; whereas, the civic body only showed marginal improvement.

This year too, the city had very little to look up to as the Corporation had overlooked an important aspect to boost the ranking – completion of the construction of individual household toilets (IHHTs). Soon after announcing the Swachh Bharat Mission on October 2, 2014, the Central Government launched a programme to aid the construction of toilet in houses without one.

It was to pay ₹ 4,000 a household, the State Government was to chip in with ₹ 2,000 and the local body concerned ₹ 2,000.

The government said the beneficiary should invest ₹ 4,000 as it pegged the cost of construction at ₹ 12,000 a toilet.

Nearly a year after the announcement, the Corporation woke up to the need for constructing the toilets as in the first year it ranked 143 in the list of clean cities.

After assessing the houses without toilets, the Corporation teamed up with Toiletfirst.in, an NGO, to construct toilets. It had also mobilised corporate social responsibility fund from companies based out of and operating in the city to be used against beneficiary contribution.

The Corporation officials, who supervised the construction in 2016 and 2017, said of the 6,056 houses identified, the civic body took construction of around 3,000 toilets in the first year and nearly 2,500 in the next.

To supervise the construction, the Corporation and Toiletfirst.in had roped in civil engineering students and civil engineers, making it a mass movement. It labelled the event ‘construct-athon’.

The construction of over 5,000 IHHTs, improvement in hygiene in a few public and community toilets and redevelopment a couple of public convenience facilities into model toilets saw the city’s Swachh Sarvekshan rank jump from 143 to 16 in two years.

By then, the Ministry had launched the open defecation-free cities campaign and incorporated the improvement that cities showed in the Sarvekshan ranking.

And, this is when the Corporation lost momentum, the sources said, pointing out that the failure to construct the remaining 500-odd IHHTs was costing the city a lot.

“By completing the construction of over 90% IHHTs, the Corporation got the city the Open Defecation-Free City certification. But it did not go further. Had it done so, the city would have been marching towards getting the ODF + certification.”

The impact of this was that if the city had ODF + certification, it would have straight away got another 250 marks in Swachh Sarvekshan. But now, it would have to remain content with a mere 50.

An engineer familiar with the reason for the Corporation not making progress in aiding the construction of the IHHTs said the beneficiaries were not ready as the cost of construction had shot up to over ₹ 25,000 a toilet.

Besides, the corporate social responsibility funding had dried up.

He further said the Corporation had obtained in writing from the beneficiaries their decision to not take up the toilet construction. It had uploaded the details for the Ministry’s consideration so that the civic body could move ahead to the ODF + certification process.

The sources said for the Ministry to certify Coimbatore an ODF + city, the Corporation would have to improve hygiene in public toilets and make at 10% of those in to model toilets by providing towels, hand sanitisers and mirrors. But given the state of toilets in the city, it was a tough ask, he added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/upr2q6/article30898190.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB24TOILET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/corpns-failure-to-complete-toilet-construction-may-impact-swachh-sarvekshan-ranking/article30898191.ece

The CBI has registered a corruption case against five officials of the Noida-based India Government Mint (IGM) and a private company in connection with the supply of ₹10 coin blanks.

Then IGM (Noida) General Manager G.P. Agarwal, Chief Manager Yespal Singh, Deputy Manager Praveen Gupta, Assistant Manager Surendra Kumar, Officer (Material) Rajkumar and Indore-based Mittal Appliances Limited have been named in the FIR.

The case pertains to a global tender floated by the IGM in March 2010 for supply of 500 million pieces of ₹10 bi-metallic composite coin blanks, weighing 3,855 metric tonnes. On completion of the process, a letter of intent was given to Mittal Appliances Limited.

After approval, an agreement was signed with the company in February 2011 for supply of 260 million pieces to be delivered in a staggered manner to four different mints.

As agreed, the IGM was to recover liquidated damages and allied charges for the failure in delivering goods as per schedule.

The company could not deliver the goods in the stipulated time-frame and requested for consideration of the delay, which was allowed on some occasions. The liquidated damages and other charges were deducted from its bills.

In April 2013, a file noting was initiated stating that the IGM had received all the supplies, 100% payment to the company had already been released and that it had completed the contractual obligation. The bank guarantees were also returned.

However, after more than two years, another file noting was initiated giving reference to some representation from the company for settling the final claim, pertaining to two supplies, though no such letter had been taken on record. It is alleged that ₹1.56 crore was illegally refunded to the company, causing loss to the exchequer.

A police head constable and four protesters died in violence that erupted over opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the Jaffrabad, Maujpur and Bhajanpura areas of northeast Delhi on Monday.

The violence took a communal colour and spread to other parts of northeast Delhi as organised groups attacked each other, setting shops and vehicles on fire.

Tensions escalated hours before U.S. President Donald Trump was scheduled to reach Delhi for bilateral talks as part of his first state visit to India. While Mr. Trump will stay in central Delhi, more than 20 km from the violence, he is scheduled to travel to Rashtrapati Bhavan and Raj Ghat in Old Delhi.

Additional Medical Superintendent, Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital, Dr. Rajesh Kalra, said five persons, including head constable Rattan Lal, died during the violence.

Head constable Rattan Lal, 42, succumbed to head injuries after being hit by a stone in Gokulpuri. He had been trying to control the situation along with his contingent, when he was hit. He was a native of Sikar in Rajasthan and was posted in the office of ACP (Gokalpuri).

During the violence, a group of anti-CAA protesters torched two cars and an e-rickshaw in the Jaffrabad area and in retaliation, pro-CAA protesters set four shops ablaze and pelted stones at other shops after identifying them as belonging to members of the minority community.

The violence erupted in the presence of nearly 100 policemen, who seemingly did not respond to the situation.

The violence over the CAA spilled over from Sunday. On Monday, fresh cases of stone-throwing were reported from near the Babarpur-Maujpur metro station. Later, a similar incident was reported from Khajuri Khas.

Man with gun held

A senior police officer said in the evening that a man who was seen firing during the violence in the Jaffrabad area, had been identified as Shahrukh Khan and detained. The police also recovered a pistol from him.

Several members identified as belonging to the minority community were thrashed by a mob in the area, according to eyewitness accounts.

The Delhi Police fired tear gas shells to disperse the protesters and also appealed to residents to maintain peace and harmony. Stone pelting continued till late in the evening in the Khajuri Khas area. Stone-throwing continued till late in the evening in the Khhajuri Khas area. Security forces staged a flag march in Maujpur to disperse the mobs.

253,2020/02/24,NCB arrests 3 foreign nationals with heroin worth ₹60 crore,"Two women held at IGI; man held at their instance

The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has arrested three foreign nationals with heroin worth ₹60 crore, officials said on Sunday.

NCB Delhi Zone Director K.P.S Malhotra said that two women from Mozambique were nabbed after they landed at Indira Gandhi International Airport here allegedly with 10 kg heroin.

Another man from Ivory Coast, who lives in Greater Noida, was arrested under the NDPS Act at the instance of the women, Mr. Malhotra said.

This is a new route or to say “reverse trafficking” of Afghan-produced heroin as it normally is smuggled to western parts of the globe after being sent to Mozambique, said the officer.

4 kg heroin

The women said they picked the contraband from Maputo, the Capital of Mozambique, and were supposed to hand it over to a receiver in Greater Noida Sector 106. The man from Ivory Coast was held after raids at his Greater Noida house and over 4 kg heroin was recovered from his place, the NCB director said. “In this case, the heroin, was smuggled to India from Mozambique,” Mr. Malhotra said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/tdv8vx/article30898854.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE24DRUG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ncb-arrests-3-foreign-nationals-with-heroin-worth-60-crore/article30898855.ece

255,2020/02/24,"For Congress, it’s back to basics","Senior leaders admit that Central leadership will have to plan an overhaul as there is a need to build a strong Opposition

Is there a future for the Congress in Delhi? This is a question several persons in the party have been trying to answer after the party’s dismal performance in the February 8 Delhi Assembly elections in which only three out of the 66 candidates managed to retain their deposits. Almost immediately after the results were declared, not only did senior leaders speak out but also many State-level leaders also wondered if they have a future.

Several senior congress leaders associated with the Delhi unit of the party refused to comment in their personal capacity on the way forward for the party but admitted that the Central leadership will have to plan a major overhaul as there was a need to build a strong Opposition not only in Delhi but also across the country.

“I’m not sure what I can do personally but there is definitely a need for some drastic changes that will have to be made at the top level. Several leaders within the party have already called for this overhaul to revive the party but we will have to see how the senior leadership reacts to these suggestions,” a senior leader said.

Confusion over tie-up

Some of the unsuccessful Congress candidates maintained that the attempts by central leadership to forge an alliance with the Aam Admi Party (AAP) for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections not only created a lot of confusion among voters but further weakened the party in Delhi. “I focused mainly on AAP and Kejriwal but most of the people who campaigned were not willing to do that,”said a Congress candidate who preferred to be anonymous.

Arbind Singh, the Congress candidate from Karawal Nagar, however said that organisational weakness cost the party. “Despite getting a meagre vote, there is hope. I found out that we have many Congress supporters but couldn’t convert them into votes,” Mr. Singh told The Hindu.

Consolidation of votes

A three-time MLA who contested the recent election said that until the first week of February, the Congress campaign was going well and while campaigning, there was no person who came up with any issue that they had with the party. However, after certain speeches given by BJP leaders, the election got polarised and minority voters and other non-BJP voters decided to consolidate and vote for AAP and not the Congress to defeat the BJP from carrying out its Hindutva agenda.

DPCC Spokesperson Mukesh Sharma who also contested the election said that the people of Delhi need to realise that while they are enjoying free electricity and water sitting at home, the infrastructure of Delhi has not been growing and that the six years of the AAP government will actually do harm to Delhi.

“Every day there are thousands of people from other Sates coming to Delhi in search of jobs. The city needs to develop the infrastructure to handle this influx. The Congress over the next few years will have to go door-to-door and explain people that while they are enjoying free electricity at home, when they step out myriad problems emerge and it is the Congress that they will then remember for changing the face of Delhi,” Mr. Sharma said. He added that in politics, there are cycles and the voters who are happy with their freebies will soon realise the all-round development that the Congress brought and shift back towards voting for the party.

Twitter war

Immediately after the party failing to win a single seat and receiving only 4.8% of the vote share, there was a war of words on twitter.

In a tweet former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said: “AAP won, bluff and bluster lost. The people of Delhi, who are from all parts of India, have defeated the polarising, divisive and dangerous agenda of the BJP.”

Replying to the tweet, AICC spokesperson Sharmistha Mukherjee said: “With due respect sir, just want to know- has @INCIndia outsourced the task of defeating BJP to State parties? If not, then why r we gloating over AAP victory rather than being concerned abt our drubbing? And if ‘yes’, then we [PCCs] might as well close shop! (sic)”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/pledaw/article30898824.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL24-CONG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/for-congress-its-back-to-basics/article30898827.ece
256,2020/02/24,Can AAP go national?,"The victory in Delhi elections has renewed the party’s national dream. From ‘nation building campaign’ to fighting local body polls, the party is treading carefully. But it remains to be seen whether Kejriwal will be able to take AAP beyond the Capital

On the morning of February 11, even before the Delhi Assembly election results were out, huge flex boards were put up inside and outside the Aam Aadmi Party headquarters in Delhi which has party chief Arvind Kejriwal’s face with a message “join AAP to build the nation”. It also had a mobile number in which people can call to be a part of it.

The party was riding on the confidence from exit polls as almost all of them had predicted a sweep by AAP in Delhi.

Around 3.30 p.m., just before Mr. Kejriwal addressed hundreds of volunteers gathered at the AAP office to celebrate the party’s win, senior party leader and Delhi convener Gopal Rai said from a stage set up on the terrace of the headquarters: “The fight has only begun. I want to tell you and volunteers across the country, you gear up, not just in Delhi, the whole country needs change... To people in each corner of India, I request you, what Delhi can do, the whole country can do it, do prepare for it.”

These were the first signs of AAP’s renewed national dreams.

Since then, through multiple statements the party has made it clear that they will be expanding beyond Delhi and fight local body elections in all States where they have a unit and Assembly elections in selected States.

AAP has tried to go national in the past but failed badly, except for Punjab Assembly election in 2017, where they are the main Opposition party.

Senior AAP leaders told The Hindu that they are confident and the party has learnt from its mistakes. They said that AAP is no longer a new party and they will project the ‘Delhi model of governance’ in other States too.

Political experts also said that AAP was moving more carefully and it is the right time as the huge mandate in Delhi where it won 62 out of the 70 seats, has given them another chance of going national.

Why local elections?

“The advantage of fighting local body elections is that in the process of building the organisation, you can fight the elections also. But in Assembly elections, if you want to show your presence, you have to be a challenger and you need organisation till the last booth. Also you have to campaign for at least six months to one year,” Durgesh Pathak, in-charge of AAP’s ‘National Organisation Building Team’ told The Hindu.

“We are already working to build the organisation across the country and fighting local body elections fit in this process,” Mr. Pathak, who is also the youngest member of AAP’s Political Affairs Committee (PAC), the highest decision making body of the party, said.

From Sunday, the party started a “nation building campaign” across the country and posters with the phone number —9871010101— released on February 11 will be put up in 20 States across the country. From February 23 to March 23, the party aims to join one crore people.

“We do not need a lot of resources for the local body elections. Local candidates will focus on it and top leadership from Delhi will not go for the campaigning. We want the local leadership to grow and Assembly elections need more effort,” Mr. Rai told The Hindu, explaining the reason behind the decision.

Even political analysts feel it is a smart move from the party to fight local selections. “If you are fighting the local body elections everywhere, it is a good way to go. And they don’t threaten the big guns of Indian politics by doing it,” said political analyst Neerja Chowdhury.

What went wrong?

“The party was formed in November 2012, with an intent to contest the 2013 Delhi Assembly elections. After we won, we decided to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha elections,” a party insider said.

“AAP is not a structured political party like the BJP or the Congress. Since it is relatively new, it’s strategy and plans are more dynamic and subject to changing political realities and circumstances,” the insider said further.

Its defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in which it contested over 400 seats across the country but could not win more than four seats in Punjab was followed by a brief lull in relation to its national plans as it decided to consolidate its position in the Capital first, according to insiders.

The first 49-day government ceased to exist in 2014 following which Mr. Kejriwal, as it’s national convener, hit the ground to expand its support base among the citizens of Delhi.

“The period from February 2015 to April, 2017, was the only time when AAP did not contest any elections. This was followed by the party’s decision to contest each and every elections across the country,” the insider said.

The AAP contested the Punjab, Goa, and Gujarat Assembly elections in 2017 in addition to the civic elections in Delhi. In 2018, it fought the Meghalaya, Nagaland, Karnataka, Chhatisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha and Telangana Assembly elections.

Later, the party debuted in Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand Assembly elections following its defeat in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections which, in 2020, preceded the Delhi Assembly polls that it successfully contested for the third time.

“Beginning with the Uttar Pradesh local body elections in 2017, where the party won 44 seats across various segments, AAP has gradually been working towards the creation of a cadre base across the country and there is no better approach to that than starting from the bottom,” the party source argued.

Both Mr. Rai and Mr. Pathak said that the party has learnt one lesson from its failures outside Delhi: they need to strengthen the organisation in other States.

“I think they went too fast. They thought the country was ready, little realising they did not have the organisation and come a cropper. One of the main criticism against Kejriwal was that he is a ‘my way or highway’ man. All leaders are like this, whether Modi-Shah duo or Congress high command,” Ms. Chowdhury said.

What next?

In the run-up to the Delhi elections, AAP was concentrating heavily on Delhi and none of the top AAP leaders went to campaign even in the 2019 Assembly elections in neighbouring Haryana and said that their “full focus” is on Delhi. The win have given them confidence, but they are treading carefully so as to not throw away the huge mandate in Delhi.

Mr. Pathak said that the party will form district and Assembly units where it is not there currently or are defunct. “We will also look at which units are not working properly and from where we get less missed calls [nation building campaign] and then we will focus on these areas. From this election there is an energy across the country.”

Mr. Rai said that a PAC meeting will be called in March to decide on which States the party will be fighting the Assembly elections. “We will review after the first phase of organisation building campaign and we will continue with it. It will go on now,” he added.

“We will tell people about the Delhi model of governance and compare it with the existing governments in those States. We will also focus on local issues and give solutions for it,” Mr. Pathak said.

But both AAP leaders did not say which States they will fight the Assembly elections.

A source pointed out that AAP is “more serious” this time around as it works on an unfolding plan to deploy popular party leaders such as Atishi, its Kalkaji MLA, as election in-charges for States such as Goa and Punjab where the Assembly elections are due.

According to sources, Ms. Atishi’s name is understood to be in the process of being finalised as the party’s Goa in-charge.

Will it work?

“The government will focus on Delhi and we are creating a mechanism so that our focus will be here and we will be able to balance both. In Punjab, people considered us a new party. Now, we have worked for five years and across the country there is a confidence on AAP’s model of governance and this will favour us,” he said.

He said that win in Delhi is not just limited to Delhi as it is a “mini India”. “In Delhi, the politics of work and positive nationalism has work and it has the participation of people from across the country. It is a sign that people from other parts of the country want such politics to work,” the AAP Minister said, exuding confidence.

“There is a political space here and Congress is abdicating its space. They have to go slow and go to the people, put in the hard work. I don’t know whether it will work out for them. Fighting local body polls is a good attempt and they are going much more cautiously this time. Currently, there is a space in Indian politics for AAP to occupy,” Ms. Chowdhury said.

“The party was formed to change the political system of the country. So, it is necessary for the country that AAP spread its wings across,” Mr Rai said. “For that purpose, the party will have to grow out of Delhi and for this, people have to stand up for the party.”

258,2020/02/24,AIIMS seeks explanation from RDA president on ‘political’ tweet,"‘He later deleted post from the official site, apologised’

The Central government-run All India Institute Of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) has issued a memorandum to the president of Resident Doctors’ Association, asking him to “explain his tweet” posted on February 12 which the institute said “was political in nature”.

In its letter addressed to the president of RDA, AIIMS read: “The content of this tweet was political in nature on the Delhi State Assembly Elections. It has also been brought to notice that this tweet was posted by the RDA president. An explanation should be given.” The tweet was posted on the RDA’s handle.

AIIMS RDA president Adarsh Pratap Singh, who is alleged to have written the posts, did not respond to The Hindu on Sunday.

However, his colleagues noted that the quote — “congratulated the people of Delhi for showing the whole country how democratic power can prevail over fascist forces & how people of a nation can decide on the kind of leadership they deserve! Congrats to @arvindkejriwal & @AamAadmiParty for such a great victory ! #DelhiElections [SIC]”— is “under review”.

The letter also statedthat the tweet has been viewed seriously by the Competent Authority. “RDA presidentis required to give his explanation regarding the above tweet within 48 hours from the date of issue of this memorandum.”

The letter has been marked to the Director and the Dean of AIIMS, Delhi. Sources at the hospital said the tweet was taken down after objection was raised by doctors at AIIMS and other institutes.

“Dr. Singh also sent a message on WhatsApp group after deletion of the tweet, which reads ‘Dear Residents, The tweet regarding winning of AAP yesterday was my personal opinion.

259,2020/02/24,Locals clean trash trail at Surajkund Mela venue,"The 3-hour-long drive was carried out in parking, stall areas of the fair a week later

Around a hundred volunteers carried out a drive — picking up litter, mostly plastic items, — at the venue for Surajkund International Crafts Mela here on Sunday.

The 16-day-long fair, inaugurated by President Ram Nath Kovind, had concluded a week ago. In a three-hour-long drive under the aegis of Save Aravali Trust, a non-government organisation working towards protecting the Aravali mountain range, the participants picked up the waste left behind by visitors, stuffed it into big plastic bags to be segregated and transported to Bandhwari landfill site.

Ecogreen Energy, the agency entrusted with the collection and disposal of solid municipal waste in Gurugram and Faridabad, also contributed towards the drive.

The Trust’s founder, Jitender Bhadana, said the drive was carried out in the parking and stall areas of the fair and the volunteers were shocked to see plastic bottles, glasses, spoons, wrappers and packaging material scattered all around even a week after the event.

Donning T-shirts with “Save Aravali” written on them, gloves and masks, the volunteers lifted the waste and stuffed them into the bags. Speaking to Mr. Bhadana, who streamed the drive live on the Trust’s Facebook page, the participants said they mostly found the caps of water and carbonated drinks bottles, wrappers of different brands of chewing tobacco, broken glasses, plastic teacups and plastic spoons.

“When the companies selling the carbonated drinks, juices and water to the visitors make profits from them, they should also ensure not to leave behind heaps of garbage to be later cleaned by the people,” said a woman volunteer.

An aged man, also part of the drive, said the administration must take the responsibility to clean the venue after the event. “The entire political leadership of the state came to the event but the administration is least bothered about cleaning it. They made crores out of it, but do not interested in clearing the litter,” he said.

Another volunteer said the visitors also had the responsibility to dispose of the waste properly.

Mr. Bhadana emphasised the need for the administration to minimise the use of plastic by arranging at least drinking water at the event and made an appeal to the masses to shun disposable plastic material to save the environment.

Waste segregation

A 44-year-old teacher, Shuchita Khanna, said the trust had worked in tandem with the administration during the fair to create awareness among the visitors on waste segregation and disposal. She added that the use of plastic was also banned in the mela but the stall owners managed to sneak in plastic material.

“Since most of us are in jobs, we chose the weekend after the mela for the drive. The trust’s waste management wing head Arun Gupta even sustained a cut on his hand during the drive,” said Ms. Khanna.

Several residents from the neighbouring group housing societies and some college students playing in the ground also volunteered to help.

Seemingly excited to be part of the drive, Sunaina Chauhan Dutta, a Class X student of Lotus Valley School, said wildlife and environment issues were close to her heart and it was a very “satisfying” for her to be part of the drive.

“I got up early to reach the venue in Faridabad with my parents. When I returned and told my friends about it, they said they would accompany me for any such campaign in the future. We take so much from nature, this is one way we can pay it back,” said 15-year-old Sunaina from Gurugram.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/locals-clean-trash-trail-at-surajkund-mela-venue/article30898791.ece

261,2020/02/24,PWD orders survey of flats to check illegal occupancy,"Officials told to submit report by today

Cracking the whip on illegal occupants of government flats, the Delhi Public Works Department has ordered a door-to-door survey of all the housing units and asked senior officials to submit a report by Monday.

The PWD of the government has recently communicated to its senior officials concerned, including executive engineers and assistant engineers, to carry out the survey of government-owned flats in their respective jurisdiction.

High Court order

The move comes days after the Delhi High Court rebuked the Housing Ministry for permitting over 550 accommodation units to be illegally occupied by retired officials and ordered the Centre to get them vacated within two weeks.

In its written communication dated February 19, the PWD said the High Court passed a judgment on February 5 and issued a notice to the government to provide the details of all officials who are illegally occupying government accommodation even after retirement.

“All executive engineers, assistant engineers and junior engineers are directed to carry out a door-to-door survey of all housing units under their jurisdiction and furnish a consolidated report by February 24,” the PWD said.

According to the PWD, officials will have to give details of unauthorised occupants such as their names, department and designation, date of allotment of flat and date of retirement.

‘Connivance, conspiracy’

On February 5, the court had also said that allowing illegal occupation of government accommodation for several years amounts to “connivance and conspiracy”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/pwd-orders-survey-of-flats-to-check-illegal-occupancy/article30898781.ece

Addressing a pro-CAA crowd at Maujpur Chowk, Mr. Mishra, a former MLA from Karwal Nagar, said if the police fail to clear roads, he would “not listen to them and remove anti-CAA protesters”.

With DCP (North-East) Ved Prakash Surya standing next to him, Mr. Mishra during his speech alleged that the roads were being blocked by anti-CAA protesters.

“We also have our household work but have come to protest because it's our right. We will not move from here unless the amended Citizenship Act is taken back,” said Neda, a protester. Joint CP (Eastern Range) Alok Kumar said the anti-CAA protesters have blocked road number 66 that connects Seelampur to Maujpur while another carriage is open for traffic. “We are managing traffic at another carriageway. The blockage has caused congestion in the area. We have deployed additional security personnel in the area,” said Mr. Kumar. He added that late on Saturday, a group of protesters had blocked the road outside Jaffarabad metro station and when the police persuaded them to clear it, they agreed.

However, on Sunday morning, a large group of protesters again blocked the road, the officer said. “We had called an Imam from the local mosque to request protesters to clear the road but they refused to listen to him,” said an officer.

The police had requested locals not to get involved or believe in any rumour regarding any violence.

The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Sunday closed the entry and exit points of two stations for several hours as a precautionary measure following the clash between the two groups. The Jaffrabad and Maujpur-Baburpur metro stations on the Pink Line connecting Majlis Park and Shiv Vihar were closed after clashes erupted between protesters in the area.

The Jaffrabad metro station was closed for commuters at 8.30 a.m. and remained shut throughout the day as thousands of people gathered near it. The Maujpur-Baburpur station was shut by authorities at 5 p.m. and remained closed till late in the evening. During the period, trains did not halt at these stations.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bjp-leader-gives-3-day-ultimatum-to-delhi-police-to-clear-roads/article30898775.ece
263,2020/02/24,Women protesters at Shaheen Bagh not willing to vacate site,"They plan to keep the 150-metre stretch blocked till CAA is revoked

With the hearing pertaining to Shaheen Bagh likely to come up before the Supreme Court on Monday, women protesters who have been on a sit-in since December 16 maintained that they were not willing to vacate the site till the Citizenship (Amendment) Act is revoked by the Centre.

The apex court had earlier appointed advocates — Sanjay Hegde and Sadhana Ramachandran — as interlocutors to speak to the protesters about shifting to an alternative site while observing that the road blockade was depriving other citizens of their rights.

While one of the several routes blocked was opened by authorities on Saturday for traffic, after several rounds of meetings between the demonstrators and mediators, the former said the route was never barricaded by them.

“People are saying that Shaheen Bagh protesters have opened the road towards Kalindi Kunj but we never blocked it in the first place. The barricades were put by the police just like they have blocked other roads. We have only been blocking one stretch which is where the women are sitting. So how can we open a road which we did not close? said a protester, Prakash Devi.

She added: “When the interlocutors had come for a meeting, we had told them that it is only a 150-metre stretch was blocked by the protesters. They again came and went to inspect the site when they saw that the barricades were not put by us. In fact, we are ensuring that ambulances and school buses pass through this particular stretch so that no hindrance is caused to them.”

A housewife, Aleena, said: “We hope that these facts are put before the Supreme Court. While there has been a lot of talk on inconvenience being caused to others, our concerns should also be brought up. The government has not made any attempt to reach out to us. Why should we even think of shifting the protest elsewhere? Will anyone even listen to us then?”

The protest against the CAA-NRC-NPR regime has entered its 71st day with hundreds of people gathering at Shaheen Bagh on a daily basis.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/women-protesters-at-shaheen-bagh-not-willing-to-vacate-site/article30898758.ece
264,2020/02/24,Foreign national held for using fake UK visa in 2014,"He used forged papers to obtain it

An Afghan national has been arrested for using a fake UK visa in 2014 on his Indian passport which he had obtained in 2013 by using “forged” voter ID and other documents, the police here said on Sunday.

On February 20, the District Investigation Unit attached to the IGI Airport arrested one Charan Singh Sachdeva (48), also known as Karan Singh, six years after an FIR was lodged in connection with use of fake UK visa, they added.

The police said that in June 2014, 11 people, consisting of two families, had flown from the IGI Airport to Moscow, Russia, where they procured UK visa from an agent and tried to travel to UK via Turkey. However, in Turkey, the Immigration authorities got suspicious and in July 2014, they were deported back to India.

On being questioned by Immigration authorities here, they revealed that they had procured the visa from an agent in Moscow, the police said. Thereafter, their passports were seized and were sent to the British High Commission for verification. The High Commission, in its report, said the visas were forged. An FIR was subsequently registered on July 22, 2014 against the passengers for cheating and impersonation.

During investigation, passport verification reports from Regional Passport Offices in Jalandhar, Punjab and R.K. Puram here, where the passengers supposedly resided, and ticket details were obtained.

However, the passengers could not be traced, as none of them actually lived in the addresses given in their passports. The police also found out that all were Afghan nationals who had got Indian passports using forged documents. A team was constituted and Mr. Sachdeva was arrested. He said he had obtained the Indian passport in 2013 by paying ₹5 lakh to an agent for fake papers.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/foreign-national-held-for-using-fake-uk-visa-in-2014/article30898630.ece
265,2020/02/24,Waiting to exhale,"After the outbreak of COVID-19, imports from China have stopped. Traders say the impact will depend on whether an alternative supply chain is set up quickly

From mobile phones, toys, pharmaceuticals to kitchen goods, traders in several sectors here say that the slowdown in trade activity with China, as a consequence of COVID-19, will soon start to effect business.

India’s trade and industry are highly dependent on China, says Praveen Khandelwal, general secretary of the Confederation of All India Traders, a body that has petitioned the Central government to bring in a special package to ease supply chain constraints arising out of the current issue.

Among three major reasons for this dependence, Mr. Khandelwal highlighted the import of finished goods for re-distribution, raw material for production purposes and the import of spare parts used in assembling goods.

“Since COVID-19 broke out in January, the trade and industry in China have been hampered and there is no msanufacturing or supply of goods. Because of the deadly virus, Indian importers have stopped importing goods from China and have cancelled their visits to China or other countries where there has been an outbreak of the virus,” said Mr. Khandelwal. While most importers tend to keep buffer stocks of about two months to tide over periods of low supply, a situation has now arisen where the supply chain will get badly affected now, he added.

The retail mobile trade, for instance, is almost entirely dependent upon China, said Arvinder Khurana, president of the All India Mobile Traders Association. While every month, old models of mobile phones would see a drop in prices as new models are supplied, in the current month, no such drop in prices has taken place and the supply of goods is being rationed by companies, said Mr. Khurana. “The market is on a bit of a wait-and-watch situation...we are hoping for things to improve by March 10,” he added.

In Pharmaceuticals, Ashish Grover, general secretary of the Delhi Drugs Traders Association, explained that a lot of raw materials used in the manufacturing of drugs, such as amoxy or para, were supplied from China. “Just as most other sectors, with trade from China at halt, raw materials are not being supplied,” he said. While as a consequence of this, there had been an upward correction in prices of goods, Mr. Grover noted that there was no shortage in supply of medicines. “After all it’s not like medicines from here are being sent to China or there is any emergency situation here” he said. Currently, it is unclear as to how many months of supply of raw materials the manufacturers had and the impact of the slowdown in trade from China would depend on whether or not alternative sources of supply are set up, he said.

In Sadar Bazar, where a wide range of items are sold, traders representative Devraj Baveja said that the prices of most of the goods had already seen an upward correction, and in some cases it is as much as 50%. “Many items, like belt buckles, Christmas lights, specific parts of gas stoves, are only made in China,” said Mr. Baveja. In many of these cases, sourcing the material from any alternative locations would mean much higher pricing. With various parts having stopped arriving from China, Mr. Baveja said, it would soon become hard to sustain. As a consequence of this, workers involved in the process, in assembly lines as well as in loading and unloading activities, would not be able to continue, he said.

The toy market sees nearly 80% of its demand met by products made in China, while only 20% is met by Indian manufacturers, said Ajay Agarwal, representative of toy manufacturers. With business activity with China having stopped, Mr. Agarwal said, Indian manufactuers are trying to ramp up production to meet demand. “The main problem is that we don’t have as many designs as they have in China,” he said, adding that for this purpose, R&D centres need to be set up.

However, Mr. Agarwal said that the effect on business had not been seen as of yet as most traders kept stocks worth two months at least. In any case, as in other sectors, Mr. Agarwal said, there was no clarity on how long the impasse would last and as other traders were also waiting and watching.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/waiting-to-exhale/article30898629.ece
266,2020/02/24,The fortress of the barber,"This crumbling structure, built in the time of Muhammad bin Tughlak, leaves more questions than answers

Nai-ka-Kot or barber’s fortress, on the outskirts of Delhi, is in ruins now and few find the time to visit it, for they are not conversant with the history of the place. How could a barber have built a fortress? Barbers were generally poor in the olden days and did not find much work, as few at that time went about with a clean chin. The hair was usually short-cropped or worn long, reaching right up to the neck, though some preferred to keep it ear-length.

There is a tale of a jobless barber who was so troubled at home that one day he decided to go into the jungle so that he could fall prey to some wild animal and thus be rid of his earthly woes. But things did not happen the way he had thought they would and, getting scared at nightfall, the poor man climbed a tree. He saw some robbers distributing their booty. Shaking with fear he fell on them, causing them to run away in confusion. The barber was able to collect all the wealth and live happily ever after.

But this is just a fairytale and the plight of the barbers was indeed a pitiable one. However, the barbers did occupy a position of some importance at social functions, like marriages and ceremonies associated with child-birth. The royal barber enjoyed a high status because of his closeness to the king. Nai-ka-Kot could be the story of one such barber who was attached to Muhammad bin Tughlak (1290-1351).

The king had a philosophical bent of mind, which was compounded by his suspicious nature. The barber who came to trim the royal beard was the source of much news, peppered with rumor and hearsay. Perhaps one day he did manage to hear of a conspiracy and inform the king. In gratitude, Muhammad Tughlak built a fortress to house his informant.

But this tale has some loose ends (like the one which says that it was constructed by his Wazir), because Nai-ka-Kot is also known as Dhobi (washerman’s) Kot and Mehtar Kot (how did a sweeper come to be associated with this medieval fortress?). Did the king honour a washerman and sweeper also the way he did the barber? If so, what were the services rendered by the man who washed the royal robes and the one who swept the royal apartments?

Did they also unearth a conspiracy and save the king’s life? In the absence of records, it is difficult to come to a conclusion.

However, one thing is certain: Nai-ka-Kot was the private apartment of Mohammad bin Tughlak, where he retired when he had had enough of the affairs of state. A plausible explanation could be that the barber, the washerman, and the sweeper were among the few allowed into the apartment, for without them a fastidious king was unable to lead his personal life in comfort, in an age when washing machines and flush toilets were hundreds of years away.

Courtiers who made fun of the king behind his back probably got a kick out of calling the retreat Nai-ka-Kot and the name stuck for posterity.

267,2020/02/24,"Cyber crime is a global challenge, says Kishan Reddy","Union Minister inaugurates cyber research centre at CDTI

Dependence on technology coupled with the government’s intention for digitalisation has created the demand for cyberspace, and cyber crime has become a global challenge, said Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy.

“With the proliferation of IT, life has become easier. But technology itself is a double-edged weapon and criminals misuse it for ulterior purposes,” he said after inaugurating the National Cyber Research, Innovation and Capacity Centre at the Central Detective Training Institute (CDTI) in Ramanthapur here on Monday.

As part of efforts to fight cyber crime, the centre would help the country effectively deal with cyber crime by taking up research and training, the Minister said.

He said that CDTI is one of the seven verticals under Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) and highlights the growing relevance of continuous research and innovation in our fight against cyber crime.

Mr Reddy said that every Indian in one way or the other uses cyberspace. “We make online payments which mandates our sharing of certain data. We are not sure of the security protocol that the respective companies follow. We use smartphones with multiple features and very often don’t understand the right way of using them. By using technology criminals may access our phone and the data. Then, the obvious follows,” he said, adding that the aim is to anticipate new domains of cyber crime and prevent them before the crimes take place.

268,2020/02/24,Enumeration of the unlettered in city begins,"25,49,065 households to be covered

Enumeration of illiterate persons has begun in all circles of GHMC on Monday without much fanfare. On the first day, the enumerators recorded a total of 17,365 illiterate persons in the city, of whom, 10,642 were women.

A total of 1,23,106 households from 3,640 locations has been covered in the survey, carried out by 5,597 enumerators, a statement from the GHMC informed.

During the 10-day survey which will continue up to March 4, a total of 25,49,065 households are to be covered in 5,817 locations of 150 wards in GHMC, for which 8,413 enumerators have been deputed.

The project is being conducted by the Urban Community Development (UCD) wing of GHMC, with an aim to take forward Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s New Year pledge to achieve 100% literacy in the State by next Census.

On January 1 this year, Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao has called upon the literate citizens in the State to educate people of no letters under the theme ‘Each one, Teach one’. In GHMC, each enumerator will cover 250 households by conducting a door-to-door survey to know the number of illiterates. Deputy commissioners will act as nodal officers for the survey at the circle level.

Project officers of the UCD and Assistant Engineers will monitor the enumeration at the field level, to be carried out by the Sanitation Field Assistants and Entomology Field Assistants.

269,2020/02/24,Shabbir Ali flays Home Minister,"Former Minister and Congress leader Mohd. Ali Shabbir has strongly opposed Home Minister Md. Mahmood Ali’s statement that Telangana Government would implement the National Population Register (NPR) in the new format.

Addressing a ‘mushaira’ held against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and NPR at Quli Qutub Shah Stadium here on on Monday night, he reiterated the allegation that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is a BJP ally and his government is ready to implement CAA, NRC and NPR in Telangana. He observed that the TRS opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Bill in Parliament was only an attempt to mislead people, especially Muslims.

Similarly, the proposed resolution likely to be adopted in Assembly opposing the CAA would be another move to cheat people. “What is preventing Mr. Rao from making an open statement that the State government would not implement CAA, NRC and NPR,” he sought to know.

The Congress leader condemned Home Minister Mahmood Ali for his statement that NPR would be implemented in Telangana with six additional questions that require people to report the date and place of birth of their parents. He reminded that it was the Congress-led UPA government that had launched the population register in 2010 with 21 simple parameters and no community or individual had any objection to it.

However, the BJP government made it contentious by adding six new parameters which include Aadhaar number of the resident, voter ID, PAN, driving licence number and mobile phone and date and place of birth of parents and the last place of residence, Mr. Shabbir Ali stated. “Before asking people, let Mr. Rao and Mr. Mahmood Ali tell the date of birth of their parents and furnish documents to prove it”, he suggested.

He stated that all Congress-ruled States had announced that they would not implement CAA, NRC and NPR and sought to why Mr. Rao is not doing so. He also slammed MIM leader Waris Pathan for his controversial “15 crore versus 100 crore” remark made a rally in Karnataka recently. He accused the MIM leaders of helping the BJP in the implementation of communal agenda in the country.

“With his controversial remarks, MIM leader had tried to sabotage the Shaheenbagh and other anti-CAA protests. People belonging to all religions and communities are taking part in the anti-CAA protests. But Mr. Pathan, at the instance of BJP and RSS, has tried to give a wrong impression that anti-CAA agitation belongs to only one particular community,” the Congress leader observed.

Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development K.T. Rama Rao has directed the GHMC Engineering officials to expedite the ongoing works under the Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP) towards early completion.

On Monday, he along with Mayor Bonthu Ram Mohan and principal secretary Arvind Kumar, reviewed all the ongoing components of SRDP work by work, and issued necessary directions.

When officials complained about restrictions by the Traffic Police, Mr. Rama Rao assured that he would mediate with the Police department to ensure that the Traffic police facilitated the works round the clock, by closing down the side of the road where works are on, and diverting the traffic through the other side. As of now, works are being carried out only for five to six hours per day.

The minister has also sought deployment of additional men and material to continue construction of all the components simultaneously, rather than taking them up one after the other. All the spans in each structure should be constructed concurrently, he instructed the agencies. He asked the Engineering officials to think innovatively and to have micro level planning about how to get the agencies to expedite the works. There is no dearth of funds, hence there should be no delay in land acquisition and shifting of utilities. He directed the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board, and Southern Discom officials to cooperate with GHMC in early completion of the ongoing works.

All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday condemned the violence in Delhi which led to the death of a policeman and a civilian.

He said that Mr. Mahmood Ali is not just a Deputy Chief Minister, but also a representative of the Muslims.

Maintain parks

It is good that GHMC is coming up with many new parks and facilities, but the enthusiasm that the authorities show at the time of opening fades when it comes to maintenance. Many old parks like Indira Park, Vengal Rao Park at Banjara Hills and NTR Gardens at Tank Bund use to have pedal boating facility but later it was abandoned and the water either dried up or raised a stink. Junctions as in Barkatpura used to have fountains with lights but lack of maintenance have put an end to them as also greenery in most parks. GHMC must focus on maintenance of the existing facilities and then think of opening new ones.

276,2020/02/24,TS among 11 states with low safety rating for road network,"World Bank, however, pats State for utilising IT tools to reduce fatalities on ORR

The World Bank has stressed the need for launching State Road Safety Incentives programme on national mission mode for implementation and enforcement of road safety measures to reduce fatalities in road accidents that would go a long way in achieving ‘Vision Zero’, seeking to reduce road fatalities to zero.

Pedestrians at risk

It said that its assessment of 12,000 kms in 11 States, including Telangana, pointed to a low overall safety rating for large part of road network with particular vulnerability for pedestrians and motorcyclists, locational vulnerability in high speed zones and roadside habitations, among others.

The study said Telangana for instance had about 800 driving schools, some of which did not follow the guidelines laid down for their registration and operation.

The Central government had set up 16 institutes of driver training and research at several locations, including Telangana, while the World Bank was also supporting several multi-sectoral, safe system-based road safety interventions in the State with loan funds and advisory assistance.

The State received the bank’s appreciation in effective utilisation of IT-based tools and systems. “In Hyderabad, speeding on the city’s outer ring road (ORR) reduced dramatically after speed cameras were installed at random locations. Offence notices are automatically generated and sent to registered owners of the vehicles and can be paid online,” the study said.

More, diverse vehicles

In its report on ‘Delivering road safety in India: Leadership priorities and initiatives to 2030’, the World Bank said a recent study of road safety investment in South Asia revealed a crisis that had been exacerbated by the rapid growth in vehicle ownership and diversity of motorised and non-motorised traffic of varying sizes and speeds, without adequate protection for the most vulnerable.

The crisis was particularly acute in areas where rapid motorisation and the provision of high-speed road infrastructure had serious implications for the safety of vulnerable road users — pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorcyclists — in urban areas as well as on inter-urban roads. “Road safety management at the national and sub-national levels in India lack a comprehensive and inclusive approach,” the report said.

The World Bank said the key priorities of the government were to implement the new national road safety strategy and all the directives of the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act or MVAA at national, state, district and town levels. Towards rapidly achieving this, it was important that formal agreements were reached and institutional arrangements were established for implementing the MVAA provisions with State governments.

277,2020/02/24,Venkaiah asks police to be vigilant against security threats,"Society also must stay alert to evil designs of such elements, says the Vice-President

Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu called upon the police force in the country to be more vigilant against elements creating disturbances in the country. Speaking at the closing ceremony of All India Police Band Competition-2019 held by Railway Protection Force (RPF) in Secunderabad on Sunday, he said one of India’s neighbours is “funding, aiding and abetting terrorism”.

“We are seeing what is happening in different parts of the country. Some people are encouraging violence. So, society has to be alert to understand the evil designs of such elements. We have to see to it that such efforts are foiled and the country’s unity and integrity are maintained,” Mr Naidu said.

Stressing that police forces must live up to the expectations of people, he said there is a need to initiate further reforms to improve ambience of police stations and make them citizen-friendly.

279,2020/02/24,More women may be inducted into the RPF,"The Railway Protection Force (RPF), which has inducted 4,500 women this year, might increase female representation in the force.

“We had 4,000 women employees and recruited around 4,500 more against 10,000 vacancies. Now their combined strength is 10% of the whole force. They are specially deployed to prevent crime against women and children,” RPF Director General Arun Kumar said at the closing ceremony of All India Police Band Competition-2019 on Sunday.

On an average, women constitute 20% of all rail passengers in the country and their numbers are expected to rise in future. “Recruiting more women constables and sub-inspectors will help curb crime against women and children,” he said.

Coffee table book

A coffee table book documenting the history and evolution of the RPF was released by Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu. The book states how a contingent designated as Company Police for Security of Railways, a private force, had to be banned after enactment of ‘Indian Police Act’ in 1872. Important tasks of the RPF are also mentioned.

On the fight against naxalism, it mentions how preventive steps are taken upon receiving information about bandhs or subversive activities by Left Wing Extremist groups. The steps include imposing speed restrictions on trains and operating a pilot engine ahead of passenger trains.

280,2020/02/24,Seat belt saved sole survivor in Hyderabad,"‘Seeing his friend drive at high speed, Kalyan fastened his belt’

Yet again, seat belt saved a life. But, for the decision to fasten the seat belt, Maganti Ramapadma Kalyan could not have survived a car crash in which three of his friends died on the spot at Karmanghat.

“Seeing that Madupati Vinayaka Malikarjun was driving at high speed, Kalyan decided to fasten the seat belt midway. His presence of mind even under the influence of alcohol saved his life,” said Saroornagar inspector E. Srinivas Reddy.

Speaking to The Hindu at Osmania General Hospital, where the bodies of the three victims were shifted for autopsy, Mr. Reddy said that Kalyan escaped with minor injuries.

“The retractor mechanism in the belt won’t allow the passenger to move during sudden jerks. I believe the other lives could also have been saved had they fastened the belt,” the police officer said.

Ten minutes before the accident, Pebba Sainath informed his mother that he was just a few minutes away from home. “Since he did not return home till late night, my sister-in-law Rajeshwari called Sainath inquiring about his whereabouts,” said Sainath’s uncle Prabhakar.

In less than an hour after talking to her son, Ms. Rajeshwari got another call from his friends about the accident. “She was distraught on hearing about the untimely death of her son,” he said.

The accident spot at Karmanghat was hardly two kilometres from Sainath’s house in Saidabad.

Around 3 a.m., Vinayaka’s mother Madupati Shyamala received a phone call from Saroornagar police informing her about the accident involving a car registered in her name.

“She came to my house in Trimulgherry to see our father and decided to stay for the night. She came to my room in a hurry and told me about the incident and we both rushed only to know about the death of my nephew,” said Vinayaka’s uncle K. Sampath Kumar.

Vinayaka, a techie with Accenture, got married to Niharika, a doctor, in August 2018. “He was a very gentle and soft-spoken person,” Mr. Kumar said.

A constable with Telangana Prohibition and Excise department, who retired as gunner in Indian Army, has requested the State government and philanthropists to donate money for his Mt. Everest expedition. L. Mahipal Reddy (33) needs ₹30-35 lakh for the expedition that begins from April 3.

A native of Godavarikhani in Peddapalli, Mr. Reddy retired from the Army in 2010 following a shoulder injury. Thereafter, he incurred loss of nearly ₹30 lakh in a business venture where he offered paper products as an alternative to plastic products.

“I got a new lease of life after joining the Excise department. While serving in Jammu and Kashmir, I was interested in trekking but could not take it up. I finally started it with Kashmir Great Lakes trek in 2016. Eventually, I scaled Mt Kilimanjaro and Mt Elbrus. My colleagues and senior officials in the department helped me greatly to pursue the two expeditions,” Mr Reddy said.

Now, he is aiming to be the first personnel from the department to scale Everest. This time, his colleagues has pooled ₹1.5 lakh. “I request the government and people to help me gather finances for the expedition,” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/9fbyw0/article30897959.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy23Mahipal-reddy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/excise-constable-seeks-funds-for-everest-expedition/article30897950.ece
282,2020/02/24,‘TS can be a leader for women in science’,"‘Number of women in pharmaceutical and life sciences industry in India is just 14%’

Piramal Group vice-chairperson Swati Piramal, who is keen on more women in the knowledge industry, believes that Telangana can play a major role in facilitating the process by pursuing on a mission mode a project to encourage more girl students take up science.

Telangana could be leader for women in science, she said, suggesting implementation of a project in the State to have a million girls pursue science. “Making them positive towards Maths, Physics, Chemistry… it would be so wonderful,” she said in an interaction on the sidelines of BioAsia 2020 recently. Pointing out that it is a male-dominated industry, she said the number of women in pharmaceutical and life sciences industry in India was 14% while the global average is 28%. A small country like Lithuania has 57% of women in science, she added.

“We have to work much harder to get there. Fathers have a very important role... when they believe their daughters can do it,” she said, adding this is the State that will lead the way. Dr. Piramal said she also to FICCI FLO members on significance of the one million girls in science project.

Education is on the three verticals – healthcare and protected water, the others – on which Piramal Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the diversified group focused.

In the State, the Foundation has been working primarily in the areas around Digwal where Piramal Pharma has a manufacturing facility. It also works in collaboration with other foundations, a strategy that she said had worked well.

On whether economic slowdown has impacted the corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities of the industry, she said it definitely has. Since many of the projects are long term, be it health, education or water, they cannot be stopped and started at will. A collaborative approach made it easier to attract resources.

To queries on the challenges for Indian pharma industry in the wake of Covid-19 (coronavirus) outbreak in China and the consequent impact on sourcing of raw material such as APIs and KSMs, she sought to highlight how this is an opportunity for India to scale up domestic production.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/qkysk9/article30897856.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY23SWATIPIRAMAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ts-can-be-a-leader-for-women-in-science/article30897857.ece

286,2020/02/24,Congress trains its guns on Devassy,"CPI(M) terms campaign against former Maradu panchyat chief politically motivated

With a few months left for the local body polls, the political debate in Maradu municipality where four illegal apartment complexes were recently demolished, is revolving around the permission given for the illegal structures.

The Congress Mandalam Committee will stage a march to the Crime Branch office here on Tuesday demanding action against K.A. Devassy, former president of Maradu panchayat, holding him responsible for the fiasco.

It was during the tenure Mr. Devassy as the president of the panchayat that the local body gave permission for the illegal structures. Though the Crime Branch, which is investigating the case, had questioned a large number of both the LDF and the UDF councillors, it has not even summoned Mr. Devassy, said R.K. Sureshbabu, secretary of the District Congress Committee.

As many as 350 families lost their homes when the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of the four illegal apartment complexes. The State government lost a significant amount in the case as it had to demolish the buildings and pay compensation to the apartment owners who lost their homes. Yet, the investigation agency was not even questioning the person who headed the panchayat during the period when the permission was granted for the illegal buildings. The Congress would raise the issue during the upcoming elections, Mr. Sureshbabu said.

Boban Nedumparambil, vice president of the Maradu municipality, said the State government was shielding Mr. Devassy in the case. The government was yet to clear the request of the investigating agency for questioning Mr. Devassy, he alleged.

At the same time, P. Vasudevan, Thripunithura area secretary of the CPI(M), said the campaign against Mr. Devassy was a politically motivated one. The Congress was targeting him as its earlier campaigns failed to convince people. The Congress was trying to create confusion among the people by raising baseless allegations, he said.

288,2020/02/24,LGBT+ community members in Kerala demand non-discriminatory healthcare access,"‘Many forced to undergo treatment for sexual orientation or gender identity’

Even as Kerala’s achievements in the healthcare sector are often been cited as a benchmark for other States, one of the major challenges of being Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex, Queer, or Asexual (LGBT+) in the State is being unable to access non-discriminatory healthcare, according to Queerala, a community-based organisation.

Queerala board member Vihaan Peethambar told The Hindu that there had been instances when many members were directed or forced to undergo treatment for their sexual orientation or gender identity, which included being locked up in de-addiction centres and undergoing shock therapy.

‘Treatment delayed’

Many times treatment of serious injuries to transwomen were delayed by doctors who assumed that they were involved in criminal activities. Advocacy with mental health professionals in the State was expected to bring in change, especially at a time when there had been favourable law reforms on LGBT+ rights, said Mr. Peethambar.

North Paravur town witnessed one of its worst incidents of fire breakout in recent memory with the waste dumping yard of the municipality at Vedimara catching fire Sunday forenoon, sending a wave of alarm across the town. No one was injured in the incident.

The fire was noticed around 11 a.m. and fire tenders from the Fire and Rescue Services Department’s local office, located close to the site, immediately swung into action. However, the fire could not be contained and fire tenders from Njarakkal, Aluva, Gandhi Nagar, and Eloor fire stations had to be called in, said T.V. Nithin, member of the Paravur municipal council and welfare standing committee chairman.

The fire was brought fully under control by about 4 p.m. However, it continued to smoulder as fire tenders kept close vigil. Areas close to Vedimara was engulfed in thick smoke for some time as the plastic dump in the waste yard had caught fire.

The cause of the fire is not known. There had been no incident of fire breakout in the dumping yard in the last 10 years, said Mr. Nithin.

290,2020/02/24,‘More TB patients dying of co-morbid conditions’,"Focus now on reducing vulnerability

The death of around 90 tuberculosis patients in Alappuzha in 2015 told a different story about TB care in Kerala even though the State has done well in implementing the Revised National TB Control Programme.

An investigation into the death of patients revealed that in around 60% of cases, there were other co-morbid conditions that were the actual causes of death. However, as the patients were on TB treatment, deaths were reflected in the State’s data as TB deaths. There were 40.3% patients who had died of TB.

The study published in The Indian Journal of Tuberculosis in 2019 titled ‘Why are people dying due to tuberculosis - A study from Alappuzha district’ led by Dr. Karthika M., Associate Professor, Community Medicine Department, Medical College, Alappuzha, had revealed that there were deaths caused by myocardial infarction, cancer, stroke, renal or liver failure, chronic pulmonary obstructive diseases and other causes including suicide.

Her study concluded that the co-morbid conditions in over 60% of patients who had died while on TB treatment had perhaps caused the deaths. Dr. Karthika had conducted a verbal autopsy on the guidelines of the World Health Organisation, meeting the family members of the patients who had reportedly died of TB.

This study led to a policy change in the State TB control programme where co-morbid conditions are detected early. As a result, the first step was to reduce the vulnerability quotient of TB patients. Another was to improve screening for patients and finally, early detection of TB in patients visiting non-communicable disease clinics.

Eighty-six per cent of vulnerability mapping has already been done at the panchayat level, said Dr. Manu M.S., pulmonologist at the State TB Training and Demonstration Centre and State TB-NCD nodal officer.

The State’s TB elimination programme has identified the 55-65 year age group with diabetes as the most vulnerable in the population.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/more-tb-patients-dying-of-co-morbid-conditions/article30898677.ece
291,2020/02/24,Modern slaughterhouse plan yet to materialise,"Corpn. council’s indecision delaying DPR, says councillor

Despite years of complaints over pollution from the Kochi Corporation's abattoir at Kaloor, plans to set up modern facilities on the same premises have not materialised.

The Kerala State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) had slapped a show-cause notice on the Kochi Corporation in September last year, specifying that, in the absence of an effluent treatment plant, waste from the abattoir was being released into the Thevara-Perandoor canal. KSPCB’s inspection also found that the biogas plant on the premises was defunct.

KSPCB officials in the district had reported that the slaughterhouse must be closed and had sent a proposal to that effect to their head office in Thiruvananthapuram in November last year. The proposal might have been placed on hold, keeping in mind the Corporation’s plans for modernisation of the slaughterhouse, KSPCB officials said. Last month, a group of residents in the area had registered another complaint with the KSPCB on the grounds that waste was still being released into the canal, and another inspection was likely soon, they said.

Project report

A detailed project report (DPR) was being prepared for the modernisation of the slaughterhouse and the installation of an effluent treatment plant, said health standing committee chairperson Prathibha Ansari.

As per initial estimates, the work would cost around ₹20 crore and would be funded by the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), said a Corporation official. Considering the KSPCB’s notice, work on the effluent treatment plant is likely to be completed first, before the rest of the work begins. The Corporation Council’s indecison over whether a new slaughterhouse should be constructed or the existing one modernised had delayed the preparation of the DPR, he said.

Modernisation would involve scientific slaughtering of animals, including facilities to bleed out the animals completely and coagulation of the blood to turn it into fish feed. “The aim is to complete work by the end of the year,” he said.

“Though a KSPCB proposal to shut down the slaughterhouse is awaiting approval, this is the only sanctioned Corporation slaughterhouse within the city. If it is shut, it will lead to the proliferation of illegal slaughterhouses and sale of unhealthy meat. Till a thinly populated place is identified for a new one, it will have to continue functioning in Kaloor,” said M.G. Aristottil, councillor from Kaloor South.

At Mattancherry

Though the Corporation’s other slaughterhouse at Mattancherry was shut around 10 years ago when it was found to be unhygienic, and plans had been in the offing to modernise it for several years, work on the DPR only began a few months ago, and was still being revised, said a Corporation official. The facility at Mattancherry would cost ₹12 crore.

The slaughterhouse at Mattancherry had the capacity to handle 50 large and 25 small animals, while the one at Kaloor handles 200 large animals and 75 small animals daily.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/sp3iqx/article30898670.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23KISLAUGHTERHOUSE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/modern-slaughterhouse-plan-yet-to-materialise/article30898671.ece
292,2020/02/24,Lack of draft poses threat to SWTD vessels in city,"Mattancherry, Ernakulam, Mulavukad, Varapuzha jetties hit

The lack of draft, especially during periods of low tide, continues to pose threat to State Water Transport Department (SWTD) vessels along multiple routes in the city.

The latest incident was reported on February 4 when Vega, a fast vessel operating between Vaikom and Ernakulam, ended up with a broken propeller leaf while approaching the pump near the Ernakulam boat jetty.

Service suspended

The SWTD has not been operating to the Mattancherry jetty for over a year now since the draft turned perilously low after the 2018 deluge. As many as six boats sustained damage in just a month after the deluge, forcing the agency to suspend service to the jetty.

“The service, which previously used to connect Ernakulam, Fort Kochi, Terminal jetty, and Mattancherry now winds up at the Terminal jetty, forcing those bound for Mattancherry to disembark at Fort Kochi and walk their way to their respective destinations,” said M. Sujith, traffic superintendent, SWTD, Ernakulam region.

The vessels languish for around 12 minutes at the Terminal jetty to avoid disruption of the scheduled timing of returning to Fort Kochi.

The lack of draft is especially problematic around Mattancherry, Ernakulam, Mulavukad and Varapuzha jetties where it dips even below the minimum level of two metres, especially during low tides. In some cases, it dips to just 45-50 cm, which means that someone could easily stand in the water without fear of drowning. There is no such issue at Fort Kochi, Island and Vypeen jetties thanks to their proximity to the shipping channel.

“The solution is to undertake dredging to increase the draft. No dredging has taken place in the last close to three decades, and the 2018 deluge only further worsened it. The low draft makes vessels vulnerable to protruding underwater poles and other articles washed in over the years,” said Mr. Sujith.

Around four months ago, a Minister-level meeting on low draft issue was held in the presence of people’s representatives and other stakeholders.

₹32-crore project

A project worth around ₹32 crore available under the Inland Water Authority was drawn up for the renovation of Ernakulam, Fort Kochi, Vypeen, Mattancherry, Kumbalam and Thevara jetties and dredging wherever necessary. But there has been no progress since then. Irrigation Department sources said the project was awaiting financial sanction from the Government.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/lack-of-draft-poses-threat-to-swtd-vessels-in-city/article30898662.ece
293,2020/02/24,Home gardens in Bengal hit by climate change,"‘They maintain green cover, harbour rich biodiversity and help in poverty reduction’

A recent study of home gardens in the dry regions of West Bengal has revealed that they are facing the effects of climate change and that there is a need to provide agricultural extension services to these gardens for their sustenance.

The paper ‘Biodiversity and Impacts of Climate Change in Home Gardens: Evidence From a Study in West Bengal’ authored by Joyashree Roy, professor at Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand, and Sebak Kumar Jana, Vidyasagar University, points out that home garden owners have reported pest attacks, insect and diseases. The studies were conducted in the arid areas at Garbeta block in Paschim Medinipur district.

Prof. Roy said home gardens not only provide food security but also help in maintaining green cover, harbour rich biodiversity and help in poverty reduction in rural areas. “Unless agricultural extension service is given to these home gardens, there is no guarantee that people will continue the healthy practice,” she said. According to her, home gardens are a major land use pattern all over the world, and in rural areas can provide vegetables and fruits to the family throughout the year.

“The most common attack on the home garden is semi-looper (Leda poka in Bengali), almost 77%, affecting vegetables and tree,” the study said. The other pests are aphids affecting 33% of home gardens and white fly 11% of home gardens. The common diseases in the home gardens studied are: mosaic in 41%, downy mildew in 37% and foot row in 32%.

The field survey pointed out that planting dates have been changed for some crops like chilli (30%), brinjal (21%) and gourd (17%). “The major reasons are changes in the onset of rain, shortage of water and lack of timely irrigation,” the study said.

Change in temperature

The study also looked at the change in temperature in home gardens between 1965 and 2010. The minimum temperature during this time showed an increase from 1960s to 2005. The minimum temperature increased from 20.5 degrees Celsius to over 22 degrees C. The maximum temperature decreased from about 32 degrees C in the mid-1960 to almost 31 degrees in 2005.

While there was no hired labour, annual time allocated by households varied from 40.14 hours and 35 hours. “The households report that some species of plants, like eucalyptus and mango, are becoming extinct in home garden… the main reason is felling, water crisis, pests and deteriorating quality of the soil,” the paper said.

The paper, which is part of book Current State and Future Impacts of Climate Change on Biodiversity, highlights that there is a “need of extension services on the part of the government regarding crop planning, land management, providing irrigation and training for water and soil conservation etc so that home garden owners can take different adaptation strategies”.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/g0mfup/article30898783.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE24BIMALMANDAL1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/home-gardens-in-bengal-hit-by-climate-change/article30898784.ece
294,2020/02/24,Rushikulya rookery all set to welcome olive ridleys,"Forest dept. is making arrangements for protection during mass nesting

Preparations are almost done at the Rushikulya rookery on the Odisha coast to welcome and protect olive ridley turtles during mass nesting, likely to begin in a week.

Eggs from sporadic nesting that has been going on for the past two months, which were incubated at artificial hatcheries of the forest department, have also started to hatch, said Berhampur Divisional Forest Officer Amlan Nayak.

Sporadic nesting

According to sources, till now around 23 turtles have laid over 2,400 eggs through sporadic nesting.

To provide security to mother turtles as well as the eggs from human and predator intervention, the forest department is erecting an over 5-km-long fence of metal net from Gokharkuda to Bateswar. This stretch is the most preferred location for mass nesting in the Rushikulya rookery.

The forest officials have already completed two to three rounds of awareness drive at all villages near the rookery.

Thousands of mother turtles are waiting in the sea near the coast where fishing in mechanised boats, including trawlers, has been banned. The forest department officials are also patrolling the region in two trawlers, two speed boats and a country boat.

In February, a fishing trawler from Andhra Pradesh was seized as it had illegally entered the restricted zone.

The whole stretch of the nesting beach has been cleaned four times in February.

Debris and plastic waste, like pieces of fishing net, are being removed with the help of locals. There will be regular monitoring of the beach.

Onshore camps

The department has set up 11 onshore camps. Personnel at these camps regularly document beach condition, inform about the debris deposited by the sea, prevent entry of predators like stray dogs and search for turtle carcasses. Officials from all ranges of the department have been mobilised, said Mr. Nayak.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/woh8ih/article30898765.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE24CAMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/rushikulya-rookery-all-set-to-welcome-olive-ridleys/article30898766.ece
295,2020/02/24,How Malai Biomaterials developed alternative leather from coconut water,"The coconut water repertoire

Coconut water is among the best thirst quenchers in the sweltering months. But there’s more. Did you know that coconut water can be the base material to develop alternative leather?

A little known Kerala-based start-up ‘Malai Biomaterials Design’ courted spotlight a few days ago when it won the second edition of Circular Design Challenge (CDC) at Lakme Fashion Week (LFW), Mumbai. The CDC was instituted a year ago to recognise those who employ innovative methods to recycle discarded materials to create new products.

Malai Biomaterials manufactures a water resistant bio-composite material that looks like leather, using raw materials such as coconut water and banana fibre.

Founded by Zuzana Gombosova, a material researcher from Slovakia, and C S Susmith, a product designer from Kerala, the start-up now supplies its vegan leather called ‘Malai’ (named after the coconut flesh) to a few international labels.

The CDC had more than 400 registrations from 40 cities in India, and five entrepreneurs were shortlisted. Zuzana and Susmith admit that they were pleasantly surprised to find themselves among the final nominees. In an email interview, they tell us that their surprise also stemmed from learning about the work of the other nominees in sustainable fashion. “To initiate and run such a project, you need determination and patience. I think our project was distinctive in a way that it went further with finding a solution to waste generation. We try to prevent waste generation by providing a material that doesn’t turn into waste. Malai is a circular material by default. It emerges from agricultural waste and ends its life becoming a nutrient for soil,” says Zuzana.

Circular Design Challenge at LFW is in collaboration with Reliance Industries’ R | Elan and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in India.

The other finalists for the CDC apart from Malai Biomaterials were: Samaritan that uses industrial plastic and textile scrap to make furniture and accessories using charpoy and macramé weaving techniques; Hyderabad-based firm Cancelled Plans that uses industrial waste to create clothing and accessories; Chambray & Co that upcycles waste into a funky line of clothing; and Off-Grain that upcycles textile waste.

What goes into Malai? “Bacterial cellulose (that’s developed from coconut water), fibre from banana stem, sisal fibre and hemp fibre,” state Susmith and Zuzana. They also use natural dyes, natural gums and starches.

The firm liaises with coconut farmers and processing units, collects and re-purposes coconut water to feed the bacteria’s cellulose production. A small coconut-processing unit can collect around 4000 litres of water per day, which can be used to make 320 square metres of Malai.

Both Zuzana and Susmith were working in Mumbai when they first met. “She told me about the possibility of growing bacterial cellulose on water from mature coconuts and I found that interesting because nobody makes this kind of product in Kerala or India,” recalls Susmith.

They began experimenting in their kitchen and then moved to the vicinity of a coconut processing unit where they developed the material further. “Malai emerged as an attempt to create material based on bacterial cellulose that’s ecologically friendly and usable for commercial products. Our criteria was to keep it as sustainable as possible, both environmentally and socially,” he adds.

Their mainstay is the material, Malai, which is now supplied to brands such as UK-based Ethical Living, Czech Republic firm Playbag and Riti in India, among others.

In 2018, Malai expanded its portfolio by designing product prototypes. A crowd-funding campaign was mooted and 10 products — bags and accessories included — are now in production. “We will be stocking some of these products at a few retailers in India and abroad soon. But our main focus is on material development,” they state.

They hope that the win at LFW will bring them more visibility in the fashion and lifestyle sector and help them reach a wider audience. They will be showcasing their new collection at LFW Winter/Festive 2020 and at Neonyt Berlin 2020, the international fair for sustainable fashion.

The fashion spotlight aside, Zuzana and Susmith intend to begin a new phase of research and development, and test the first batch of Malai products with their users.

Sustainability remains at the core of their ideology. As Susmith puts it, “We have to constantly remind ourselves that we are borrowing from nature and we are bound to return it back to nature in a form that nature can use.” He describes the work at Malai Biomaterials (made-from-malai.com) as a mix of art, craft, design, science and engineering.",fashion,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/x0k3fn/article30903153.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Malai-10,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/how-zuzana-gombosova-and-c-s-susmiths-start-up-malai-biomaterials-developed-alternative-leather-from-coconut-water-and-won-the-circular-design-challenge-at-lakme-fashion-week/article30903157.ece
296,2020/02/24,Protest brews against plan for service station near river,"Human wall to be formed from Kakkodi Bridge to Thanneer Panthal today

The Poonoor River Protection Committee will hold a public protest on Tuesday against the alleged attempt to pollute the river by means of an automobile service station.

Protesters, under the banner of the committee, will form a human wall from Kakkodi Bridge to Thanneer Panthal at 5 p.m.

The agitation against the proposed service station, promoted by an expatriate, began more than two years ago. The service station is coming up on the banks of the river between Kakkodi Bridge and Thanneer Panthal, where three drinking water projects are based. There are a few other drinking water and irrigation projects a few kilometres downstream.

The protesters have expressed apprehension that the water discharged from the service station will turn the river toxic, leading to a disaster as the same water is used for drinking water projects. “Automobiles are washed using chemicals. The chemicals, along with remnants of grease, petrol, diesel, and engine oil, will be discharged into the river after wash. The chemicals are toxic,” said committee coordinator T. Shobheendran.

Though the committee had approached the authorities against the proposed project, the promoters managed to secure all documents and approvals. “The authorities may not have seen the site, or else, they should be heartless. They are little concerned about the aftereffects,” Prof. Shobheendran added. The site earmarked for the service station is the same where a petrol pump was planned earlier. However, the plan was thwarted by the public. “Those who bought the plot are planning an even more dangerous project there,” he alleged. The committee pointed out that the toxin mixed with the still water at Cherukulam bund a few kilometres downstream would have devastating results.

A recent comment by the State Human Rights Commission that the service station was the means of livelihood of a family has perplexed the committee. “What is more important, the livelihood of one family, or the lives of thousands of people?” Prof. Shobheendran asked.

The committee has decided to approach the Kerala High Court seeking protection of the river.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/r6p949/article30907138.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25-KI-POONUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/protest-brews-against-plan-for-service-station-near-river/article30907139.ece
297,2020/02/24,Collector imposes curbs on Kozhikode beach events,"Programmes without the services of at least 10 wardens not to be permitted on Kozhikode Beach

The latest order of the District Collector regulating vehicle parking at the Kozhikode Beach may pose a challenge to the traffic police.

According to the order, which is intended to address the rush and traffic congestion at the beach during evenings and holidays, those who organise entertainment programmes on the beach are liable to seek the help of traffic wardens to control rush.

Programmes that do not ensure the services of at least 10 wardens will not be permitted at the beach, the order said.

Meanwhile, the police have been directed to effect traffic diversions and controls at Gandhi Road Junction and Corporation Office Junction during times of heavy rush.

The plan is to set up pay-and-park facilities at South Beach on the land owned by the Department of Ports. Parking of vehicles on Beach Road has been restricted to a single row.

Stress on planning

District Police Chief A.V. Geroge told The Hindu that the order could not be implemented without proper study and planning. “We cannot stop people from going to the beach. We cannot allow parking of more than one row of vehicles as it will lead to traffic congestion,” he said. The police plan to make use of the available private pay-and-park facilities at the beach, besides seeking other private plots on the beach to be converted into pay-and-park facilities.

“Once the parking of lorries on the South Beach is banned, we will have more space for parking of cars and bikes,” Mr. George said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/dokhbc/article30907122.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25-KI-BEACH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/collector-imposes-curbs-on-beach-events/article30907123.ece

299,2020/02/24,A walk for better disaster management plan,"Transect walk covers flood-hit regions of Mukkom

Dividing the flood-hit regions into three zones, the Mukkom municipal authorities on Sunday organised a transect walk with the support of disaster management experts and local residents. The event was held as part of the preparation of a comprehensive action plan to fight rain-related challenges.

It was the first time that such a participatory exercise was held in the village where community members, planners, and officials walked through the problem spots, held direct discussions with people in the affected areas, and prepared a map. The findings will be used for all future references of planners under the local body.

Municipal Chairman V. Kunhan, secretary N.K. Hareesh, and public works standing committee chairperson Saly Siby were among those who participated in the transect walk. Ward councillors and municipal overseers too were present.

At several locations, stormwater runoff was found blocked, and they will be repaired first as part of the mitigation project. Suggestions from local people too will be taken into account for finding appropriate remedy. The walk covered Kanhiramuzhi, Parasseryparambu, Nellikkappoyil, Pachakkad and Urpil regions. The municipal authorities said the walk would cover all the three identified zones in the days to come. The study report will be used for the preparation of an updated disaster management plan for the municipal area, they added.

300,2020/02/24,Mass cleaning drive begins ahead of village fair,"Pavayil fest, known for promotion of rural tourism, to begin on April 4

As part of preparations for the third edition of Pavayil Village Tourism Fest, a committee of local residents on Sunday launched a mass cleaning drive on the banks of the Akalappuzha river.

Huge quantities of discarded plastic bottles and other solid waste materials were collected during the drive, which also drew the active participation of women and children.

Coordinators of the cleaning initiative said it would continue in the days to come with the participation of more local residents’ forums and students’ groups. Country boats too will be used to remove floating waste from rivers, they added.

K. Premanath, a local coordinator of the fest, said the support of recycling units would be sought to scientifically treat plastic waste. “Because of the geographical features of the region, even waste dumped from the Purakkattiri bridge reach Pavayil village. We have no option but to manually clean everything ahead of the fest to showcase the natural beauty of the place,” he explained.

The Pavayil fest, known for the promotion of village tourism activities with the support of local residents, will begin on April 4. According to the organisers, the nine-day fest will be a novel experience for those who wish to explore village life and the beauty of river-side stay. As usual, food fest and a cultural extravaganza will pep up the celebrations, they said.

301,2020/02/24,Kozhikode's IT hub dream yet to take wing,"The Information Technology fraternity in Kozhikode has not received the required attention from the government, while the attrition rate is quite high in the region as professionals scout for jobs in bigger cities

Kozhikode is waking up to become an Information Technology friendly city with two cyberparks, one in the government sector and the other managed by the Uralungal Labour Contract Co-operative Society (ULCCS ), providing world-class infrastructure and attracting global companies.

Several companies have set up shop in the Sahya IT complex of the government-owned Cyberpark Kozhikode, which was inaugurated by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in 2017. Sahya has 3-lakh-sft space and may develop Kozhikode into an IT hub. At the same time, the UL Cyberpark near Cyberpark Kozhikode houses 44 companies in 5-lakh-sft space with over 1,500 professionals.

Incidentally, both the cyberparks are strategically located on the Kozhikode Bypass. Tier-2 destinations like Kochi, Mangaluru, Mysuru, and Coimbatore are within 200-km radius. Besides, many believe that Bengaluru, which is the nearest IT city (350 km away from Kozhikode), could act as a hub and spoke model for companies considering expansion in tier-2 cities like Kozhikode.

The government has already expressed its commitment to promote Kozhikode as the next IT destination after Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi. Robust infrastructure, excellent digital connectivity, in-house power distribution, and power back-up with an eco-friendly environment have been put in place to lure companies to start operations.

However, more needs to be done in tune with the changing times. Though the IT sector in the State has grown over the years, its history in Kozhikode appears to be unpleasant when compared with the IT parks in Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi.

The Economic Review prepared by the State Planning Board shows that the total employment at Cyberpark Kozhikode is 558 in 23 companies. The total investment was just ₹3.12 crore, and the turnover was ₹16.78 crore.

But Technopark in Thiruvananthapuram, established in 1995, employs over 60,000 people in 410 companies with a total investment of ₹4,979 crore and turnover of ₹14,000 crore. Similarly, Infopark in Kochi employs over 40,000 persons in 392 companies.

In 2010, when the Board of Approval, Ministry of Commerce, formally granted approval for 25 acres of Cyberpark Kozhikode, the State government said the project could generate 70,000 jobs for IT professionals and over a lakh jobs indirectly by 2015.

Many believe that the Kozhikode region is quite different from the other two hubs. A reason is that the city lacks domestic connectivity, especially to destinations such as Bengaluru and Hyderabad.

Another reason is that the government has not given the required focus to the IT fraternity in the region. Also, the single-window clearance is a cause for concern. Hartals and protests are hitting the work culture in Kozhikode unlike Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi.

According to human resource consultants, the attrition rate in Kozhikode is high as professionals scout for jobs in bigger cities and also go abroad. The marketing strategies of IT parks in the city should be upgraded to attract young talents, they say.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/baq4qv/article30897835.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24-KI-CYBERPARK-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/it-hub-dream-yet-to-take-wing/article30897838.ece
302,2020/02/24,Retired TNSTC official seeks relief,"He wants his pay on a par with Seventh Pay Commission slab

MADURAI

A retired Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation Superintendent moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Monday seeking a direction to the State to re-fix his pay on a par with the Seventh Pay Commission slab from the date of his promotion in 2017 and revise his terminal benefits.

The petitioner, S. Sampath, the retired Superintendent, TNSTC Madurai, said that he was appointed a clerk in the erstwhile Pandian Roadways Corporation in 1980. It was only in 2017 that he was promoted as Superintendent on the verge of his retirement, he said.

There were two types of pay pattern existing in the TNSTC. One was fixation/ revision based on settlement of pay to workers, and other was the government pay pattern fixation in respect of supervisory cadre that included Superintendents, Assistant Engineers, Assistant Managers and Managers.

At the time of promotion, a question arose as to how to fix his pay on a par with the Seventh Pay Commission slab as he had migrated from workers settlement pattern to government pay pattern. In 2017, the government issued an order to fix 2.57 multiplier to those who got promoted on or after January 2016.

However, the benefit was not paid and similarly promoted Superintendents submitted a joint representation to the government in 2018 with a request to implement the multiplier. But their plea had not been looked into, the petitioner said.

304,2020/02/24,"CAA is against women, says Kanimozhi","‘The government has remained a mute spectator to atrocities against students’

The Citizenship (Amendment) Act introduced by the Centre was against women, Thoothukudi Lok Sabha MP M.K. Kanimozhi said here on Monday.

Addressing cadre of the DMK’s women’s wing, she said there was a regressive saying in Tamil as to why women, who are involved in cooking, should be educated.

However, it was the M. Karunanidi government that made the life of women, who suffered a lot due to smoke while cooking with firewood, easy by introducing free cooking gas scheme for them.

Even as women and students were protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, they were being targeted in an ugly manner.

“The AIADMK government has remained a mute spectator to such atrocities and was supporting the CAA,” she said.

Former Chief Minister Karunanidhi also gave lot of importance for promoting women’s education by introducing marriage assistance scheme.

“Only after the Karunanidhi government introduced the concept of self- help groups for women, women who were otherwise confined to the four walls of their house, emerged out of them,” she said.

She said women did not have any safety and were not able to move around freely under the AIADMK government.

The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme was not being properly implemented now, leading to loss of income to rural women.

“Besides, women were also facing a lot of difficulties due to increasing prices of essential commodities,” the Lok Sabha MP added.

While the DMK government introduced egg in noon meals scheme, the AIADMK government, under the pressure from BJP, brought in free breakfast to students of Chennai Corporation. The breakfast supplied by an NGO, Akshaya Patra, would have only satvik food without garlic and onions.

Ms. Kanimozhi also criticised the State government for lack of employment opportunities for educated youth.

305,2020/02/24,Dhinakaran mocks at ‘Protected Agricultural Zone’ notification,"TIRUNELVELI

Terming the Tamil Nadu Government’s gazette notification declaring Cauvery delta as ‘Protected Agricultural Zone’ as an attempt to hoodwink the people, the Amma Munnetra Kazhagam general secretary T.T.V. Dhinakaran has demanded Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to make it clear if the 152 hydrocarbon projects to be implemented by the Indian Oil Corporation in the delta region would be scrapped in the wake of the notification.

Addressing the public meeting held at Gangaikondan near here as part of the 72nd birth anniversary celebration of late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, Mr. Dhinakaran said the Tamil Nadu Government was misleading the students and their parents that it was working overtime to scrap NEET after passing a resolution in the Assembly in this connection even after it was instantly trashed by the Centre. The shocking news came to light only in 2019 when a case relating to NEET came up for hearing in the High Court.

Similarly, a portion of the delta region had been declared as ‘Protected Agricultural Zone’ by the Tamil Nadu Government even as work on oil exploration was actively going on. With an eye on the next Assembly polls, the Chief Minister, who could not give any firm undertaking in this connection, was hoodwinking the delta farmers with this gazette notification.

Training guns against the DMK, Mr. Dhinakaran said it the Union Government could thrust the NEET upon the students of Tamil Nadu as the DMK had sown the seeds for the national-level entrance exam for securing admission in the medical colleges.

He appealed to the party cadres to stay united so that the AMMK could revive legacy of Jayalalithaa and her ‘golden rule’ in Tamil Nadu after the next Assembly polls scheduled for 2021.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/dhinakaran-mocks-at-protected-agricultural-zone-notification/article30906001.ece

307,2020/02/24,Villagers for removal of dilapidated school building,"‘Children from 250 families study in the 54-year-old school’

Seeking the reconstruction of the panchayat union primary school building after demolishing the existing dilapidated structure in their village, a group of villagers from Thathanooththu near here submitted a petition to Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish on Monday.

The petitioners from Thathanooththu under Sankar Nagar Special Grade Town Panchayat on the city outskirts said the children from 250 families in the village were studying in the 54-year-old panchayat union primary school in the hamlet. Since the tiled school building, owing to poor maintenance, is in a dilapidated condition, most of the parents had stopped sending their children to the school that gets drenched completely even in drizzle.

To make things worse, the rainwater that drenches the power boards and even the electricity meter had triggered electrical short-circuits in the past.

“Hence, the Collector should instruct the officials concerned to remove the old structure that was built in 1966 and reconstruct the school with separate classrooms for the students from first standard to the fifth standard besides the toilet and the kitchen for preparing their noon meal. Until the construction of the new school building is completed, the school may be shifted to the community hall in the village considering the safety of the children and the teachers as well,” said M. Azhagammal, one of the petitioners.

‘Upgrade hospitals’

308,2020/02/24,Free house sites given to transwomen,"Collector Sandeep Nanduri handed over free house sites at Peroorani to 29 transwomen during the weekly grievance redressal meet held at the Collectorate on Monday.

He also handed over free house sites to 3 more beneficiaries from Thirukkaloor village near Eral.

Earlier, Mr. Sandeep said that 65,953 farmers from the district had registered themselves for availing Prime Minister’s Kisan Credit Card through the special camps organised for this purpose. Since the farmers could get loan up to Rs. 1.60 lakh with 4% interest without any collateral, the farmers should register their names for getting the kisan credit card.

The Collector also said that there were no glitches in the implementation of ‘one nation one ratio card’ scheme. So far, 57 persons from Tirunelveli, 216 persons from other taluks and 927 from other villages had purchased from the ration shops of their choice without any problem.

A group of traders and the public from Udangudi submitted petition to Mr. Sandeep seeking operation of adequate number of buses via their town. They said more than 30 bus services, which were operated via Udangudi by the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation, had been withdrawn over the past four years, which had seriously affected the public, especially the students going to their educational institutions in other places.

Hence, the TNSTC should revive those bus services from Udangudi to Tiruchendur, Thisaiyanvilai and Tiruchendur to Nagercoil service via Udangudi.

They also appealed to the Collector to dig new tanks in Udangudi area to store rainwater which alone could check the intrusion of seawater into the land.

TENKASI

Seeking the immediate intervention by the State and the Central Governments to ensure the safe rescue of 6 stranded construction labourers in Muscat who have not been given their salary for the past ten months, family members of these workers submitted a petition to Collector G.K. Arun Sundar Thayalan on Monday.

The petitioners from Marudhapuram near Nettoor in the district said six persons from their village, who had gone for work in Muscat 8 years ago as construction labourers, had been denied of their salary for the past ten months. One Sathish Kumar from Kerala, who was running the construction firm, had returned to his native place without giving the workers their salary and also their passports.

Since the stranded workers were struggling even without food, the State and the Central Governments should take immediate steps to rescue the stranded labourers, the family members said.

Free house sites

After staging demonstration for a while, members of Vivasaaya Thozhilaalar Sangam submitted petitions seeking free house sites to those who did not own a house while the Kadayanallur wing of Communist Party of India submitted a petition seeking the removal of encroachments made by an individual along the burial ground in Chokkampatti.

Gypsies from Keezhavaaliyan Poththai near Tenkasi submitted a petition seeking free houses under Chief Minister’s Green House Scheme on the free house sites they had been given.

‘Annex hamlet’

Around 200 persons from Forest Bungalow Kudiyiruppu near Sivasailam submitted a petition appealing to the Collector to annex their hamlet with Sivasailam village panchayat instead of being with Mela Aambur panchayat.

“Since Sivasailam is very close to our village and Mela Aambur is situated about 3 km from our hamlet, Forest Bungalow Kudiyiruppu should be annexed with Sivasailam panchayat considering the proximity of the village,” they said.

Bus-shelter sought

A group of people from Neduvayal submitted a petition seeking construction of a bus-shelter in the village for the benefit of the residents and the students studying in the Government Higher Secondary School in the village.

311,2020/02/24,‘Streamline water supply to hamlets’,"Residents of Nellai Thiruthu village near here submitted a petition to Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish on Monday seeking her intervention to ensure supply of drinking water to them and two more nearby villages in an orderly manner to avoid frequent clash among the villagers.

In their petition, the Nellai Thiruthu villagers said the hamlet under Manur union, which was getting drinking water from the overhead tank at Alavanthankulam till 2004, later got a separate overhead tank for supplying drinking water to their village with the help of then Alangulam MLA P.G. Rajendran.

When work on laying pipes from the new overhead tank and fitting of the pump was taken up to pump water from the well (the source) at Alavanthankulam, it was opposed by the Alavanthankulam residents that led to an inquiry by the Revenue Divisional Officer, Tirunelveli.

In peace talks organised at the Collectorate, residents of Nellai Thiruthu, Alavanthankulam and Pallikottai, which werer also getting drinking water from the same overhead tank, participated.

It was decided in the meeting that drinking water would be pumped to the tanks simultaneously and water should be released to the residents by opening the valves simultaneously. If the valves broke down or the pump became inoperable, it should be done only in the presence of the village heads from the three hamlets.

Even as this arrangement was ensuring adequate supply of drinking water to all three villages, the Alavanthankulam residents made an attempt in 2019 to lay additional pipe from the well to the overhead tank in their village at the instance of an individual enjoying political backing. However, the work was stopped by the Gangaikondan police on getting a complaint from the Nellai Thiruthu residents.

“Subsequently, another round of peace talks were organised by the revenue officials on June 29 last, where it was decided to release water to Alavanthankulam, Nellai Thiruthu and Pallikottai on turn basis. Though the representatives from Alavanthankulam agreed to this decision and remained silent for a while, damaged the pipeline carrying drinking water with the ulterior motive of disrupting drinking water supply to the beneficiary villages. To find a permanent solution to this issue, the Collector should instruct the officials to revert back to the older system of pumping of water and release of water from the overhead tank to the villages simultaneously,” the petitioner villagers said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/ginhbg/article30905291.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA25TVL-WATER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/streamline-water-supply-to-hamlets/article30905292.ece

Three masked men who barged into the office room of petrol bunk along the Thoothukudi highway near Eliyarpathi highway toll plaza, stole cash, a mobile phone and a card-swiping machine from the employees of the bunk brandishing a sword, in the early hours of Sunday.

The police said that the supervisor of the bunk, K. Vinoth Kumar (32) of Palayampatti, along with two other workers Muthupandi and Selvam, was sleeping inside the office room of the bunk.

Three lungi-clad men, who walked into the bunk, pushed open the door and barged into the room at around 3.50 a.m. After waking the workers up, one of them brandished a sword and asked them to part with their valuables.

The trio, who were shocked, did not resist, and handed over ₹3,000 left in the cash box. Meanwhile, one of intruders pulled out the hard disc of the closed circuit television camera network and snatched a mobile phone and fled the scene.

The police said that the robbers, however, did not harm anyone.

The men had come to the bunk on a motorbike that was parked along the national highway. Later, they had escaped on the bike. The police suspect that the men could have been watching the movement of people in the bunk for some days before targeting it.

316,2020/02/24,"With summer fast approaching, GRH bracing itself to meet its water needs","The biggest consumer of Corporation water, it is exploring more options to augment supply

Government Rajaji Hospital, one of the biggest occupants of space on the northern side of the Vaigai, occupying 21 acres, is the biggest consumer of Corporation water.

Madurai Corporation supplies four lakh litres of water directly from its pipelines to the storage facilities available at the GRH. Lorries and tankers bring two lakh litres more, while the hospital has its own borewells through which it pumps 50,000 litres round the clock.

Still, the hospital faces a shortage. “We need close to 11 lakh litres of water daily but we get 6 to 6.5 lakh litres and looking for alternatives to face the summer,” said Dean J. Sangumani.

To save water, a number of measures have been initiated in all the wings, toilets and operation theatres.

The priority areas are cleanliness of toilets, linen washing, besides drinking water.

Only a very few attendants of patients brought their own drinking water, the Dean said.

Recycling

A Corporation official said they have planned to provide two lakh litres more through recycling which may be used for other purposes.

“We are exploring possibilities of digging borewells on the Vaigai bank near Alwarpuram side, so as to meet about 80% of the total demand.

Water experts say the GRH can use recycled water in toilets, which consumed over 40% of the total requirement.

Many corporate houses were ready to construct permanent toilets with RCC, but the problem is the availability of water. Hence, mobile toilets can be installed and run by NGOs.

More outpatients

The hospital receives about 8,000 outpatients daily. The hospital has 3,250 beds, one of the biggest in Tamil Nadu, Dr. Sangumani said.

Patients and their attendants demand better facilities, as many come to the GRH since they cannot afford treatment at private hospitals. Parvathi, accompanying her ailing mother-in-law from Arapalayam, said seating near pharmacy was insufficient. Doors in toilets were not in order.

Attendants have no other option but to use the corridors near wards to take rest. There is a plan to construct rest rooms for attendants, the Dean said.

Parking space

The hospital also lacks parking space. Of the 550 doctors on its rolls, 150 to 200 of them used cars and park them on the campus. It is learnt that 1,000-1,500 two-wheelers are parked on the campus. Haphazard parking hampers movement of ambulances.

The Dean said that they were planning to build a multi-level parking facilities for cars and bikes at two places on the campus.

A special entry for ambulance was being explored, he said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/ml08ii/article30900038.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24MAGRHWater,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/with-summer-fast-approaching-grh-bracing-itself-to-meet-its-water-needs/article30900039.ece

Raju inaugurated the second edition of Health Mela, an event where people from across the Madurai Parliamentary constituency can have their health check-up, at Thiru. Vi. Ka. School here on Sunday.

The event was funded under MP’s Local Area Development Scheme. Doctors from Urban Primary Health Centres and PHCs took ultrasound scan, checked for blood pressure and diabetes and explained the importance of a balanced diet. In some stalls, the doctors also explained various State and Central government schemes to the public and explained the enrolment mechanism for some State government schemes. The first edition was held at Kottanathampatti on February 18. Mr. Raju said that the State government had several novel schemes, particularly for the poor and marginalised people. He commended the Central government for its contribution to various schemes. “The highest number of institutionalised deliveries take place in Tamil Nadu and several colleges, including All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), are being established. People must make use of all these facilities and maintain good health,” he said.

“The rapid spread of coronavirus is a clear example of how prevention of a disease remains a challenge for a government. With new viruses and communicable diseases surfacing, it is necessary to have novel systems and infrastructure in place to deal with them. Tamil Nadu has the best health plan in the whole country,” said Mr. Venkatesan.

Collector T.G. Vinay said that several health schemes of the State, including the Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddy Maternity Benefit Scheme and Chief Minister Comprehensive Health Insurance, had served as models to follow for the Central government.

318,2020/02/24,"To live, they need to fight","D. Rajalakshmi, a 15-year-old student from Maniyakaranpatti, a village located 15 km from Dindigul, says she vividly recollects the time when her close friend was about to be married off to a much older man. “My friend and I would always roam around together both at school and outside of it. Her parents one day told her that she would be married off and she had no choice. She too agreed. The incident left me shocked,” she says.

Rajalakshmi and her friend are both members of ‘Childvoice,’ a non-governmental organisation working for protecting children’s rights, and had attended sessions on child abuse, marriage and labour together in 2012. When her friend submitted to the institution of child marriage, Ms. Rajalakshmi says she took matters into her own hands. Although she tried talking her friend out of it, her parents were unapproachable, she says. “That is when I called the Childline service and they intervened,” she says. Like Rajalakshmi, three others - M. Santosh Kumar, M. Vishali and A. Jeyaprakash - are attempting to strengthen child rights in Dindigul. Their efforts have earned them praise fromUNICEF in November 2019 and most recently at Lady Doak College. Rajalakshmi and her fellow activist 17-year-old M. Santosh Kumar from Sangalpatti say the biggest problem they currently face is against child labour.

“Parents somehow think that their child and the family will have a better life if the child is sent to a big city for work. The child too is enamoured by the opportunity to leave the village and see the world. We have a responsibility to tell the ones around us about the terrible working hours and abuse there. So many boys have escaped from firecracker-making companies, matchstick units, cloth manufacturers with nothing. Our Dindigul boys are often sent to the north,” says Santosh Kumar.

One of the boys is Jeyaprakash. “I was about to be sent to Delhi,” he says. According to Jeyaprakash who was supposed to work as a ‘shop boy,’ the prospect of seeing a new city was exciting but only after his friend spoke to him did he realise the dangers. “I received counselling from my peers and my parents had a discussion with social workers. I am now back in school,” he says.

Thirteen-year-old Vishali who has begun the conversation regarding alcoholic and abusive parents in her village Viralipatti, says she and her friends aim to alleviate the underprivileged from regressive ideas perpetrated over generations. “We help our friends survive and spread the message of reaching out to Childline and the police because many of us are in broken homes.

325,2020/02/24,"IHCL cuts down debt to ₹1,900 crore in FY20","To open more than one hotel a month

Through relentless focus on cost reduction, re-structuring and margin expansion, Indian Hotels Company Ltd. (IHCL) has cut down its net debt from over ₹5,000 crore in FY16 to ₹1,900 crore in FY20 and has remained profitable for the last eight consecutive quarters.

The company is working to further reduce debt and monetise non-core assets, a top executive said.

Speaking on the occasion of the company’s third Capital Markets Day, which he started soon after taking over little more than two years ago, Puneet Chhatwal, managing director & CEO, IHCL, said ëmphasis on debt reduction would continue.

“We have cleared some dollar loans and have refinances loans worth ₹750 crore at better terms.”

Soon after joining the company in late 2017, Mr. Chhatwal, who came with considerable international exposure, unveiled a five year vision for IHCL — called Aspiration 2022 — for turnaround of the company, which was making loss for several years. He said so far the company had achieved the targets and the performance had been satisfactory.

“This year continues the transformation of IHCL from a hotel company to a multi-brand hospitality ecosystem player. We have executed on our Aspiration 2022 vision and driven strong operational performance with significant improvement across all key financial metrics like profitability, cash-flows, EBITDA margins and debt ratios in the current fiscal.”

He said the company’s decision to re-imagine the brandscape had created sustainable value proposition for each brand. Now, IHCL has brands like Taj, SeleQtions,Vivanta, Ginger, Expressions and TajSATs.

Stating that the company signed 50 new hotels in the last two years, Mr. Chhatwal said this growth momentum helped the company to reach a portfolio milestone of 200 hotels, of which 158 are operational and the remaining 42 hotels with 6,000 rooms were under development.

“With 200 hotels we will have an inventory of 25,000 rooms in over 100 locations. Now, we are opening one hotel per month and our aim is to open more than one hotel every month in FY21. We will continue to focus on capturing emerging opportunities across the hospitality industry landscape, thereby creating significant value for all our stakeholders,” he said.

He said the company would now grow its footprint through management contracts. Now, 43% of the hotels are run under management contracts, while this was 32% two years ago. He said the company would focus on Food & Beverages and expanding the scope of TajSATs to maximise revenue.

On the Sea Rock hotel issue at Bandstand, he said the company had reached an agreement to increase its stake to 100% from 85% currently. He said it would take 12 to 18 months’ time to get any clarity on this issue.

IHCL also announced to set up a 371-room Ginger Hotel near the airport with an investment of ₹140 crore without land cost. This flagship hotel called Ginger Santacruz will commence operations from April 2022.

The company also announced that Taj Hotel & Convention Centre, in Goa will open on March 1, 2020. The integrated hotel and conference facility co-located with Cidade de Goa with over 500 rooms and 60,000 sq ft of conference space will be the biggest convention venue in the state.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/ihcl-cuts-down-debt-to-1900-crore-in-fy20/article30906588.ece
326,2020/02/24,Bharti Infratel puts off merger with Indus Towers,"Delay to affect Vodafone Idea

Bharti Infratel on Monday further extended the deadline for its merger with Indus Towers by two months to April 24.

The final call will be taken after assessing the impact of the ‘current crisis’ in the telecom sector on various stakeholders, it said.

“The Board of Directors of the Company met earlier today and took note of the FDI approval for merger of Indus Towers Limited with Bharti Infratel Limited received late evening on February 21, 2020,” the company said in a communique to bourses.

Since the other actions/conditions for the scheme to become effective cannot be completed by the extended long stop date i.e. February 24, 2020, the Board of Directors had further extended it till April 24, 2020, Bharti Infratel said.

“The final decision to implement the scheme will be taken by the board keeping in mind the best interest of the company and its stakeholders, including the assessment of the current crisis facing the telecom industry and the extent of its impact on the company’s major customers,” it added.

The delay in completion of the deal, would come as a blow to Vodafone Idea, which has to cough up ₹53,000 crore in statutory dues to the government and was eyeing about ₹5,500 crore from stake sale in Indus Towers. Vodafone Idea has a little over 11% in Indus Towers.

Vodafone Idea has so far paid ₹3,500 crore towards statutory dues, and any monetisation exercise would allow it to get closer to at least the principle AGR amount, it owes to the government.

327,2020/02/24,Ashok Leyland plans to resize operations,"Company to focus more on LCVs, international and defence businesses

Commercial vehicle manufacturer Ashok Leyland Ltd. (ALL) has decided to scale down its operations to the level that prevailed three years ago to make it a much more resilient company.

“The idea is to see that we don’t get into shrinking more because next year, the first quarter and second quarter is not going to be really great,” Gopal Mahadevan, whole-time director and CFO, Ashok Leyland, said in an earnings call.

“We’re going to use this opportunity to scale down the operations of the company even further. What we are trying to do is instead of doing something like cutting ourselves to the bone...why don’t we resize the organisation to the level it was possibly three years ago,” he said.

“Let’s go back to when we were ₹18,000 crore (in revenue) three years back. Let us look at what were the resources we are deploying and let us take a 20% cut on that,” he said.

“We are extremely determined this time to grow our international, and more importantly, our light commercial vehicle (LCV) business, and the defence [vehicles] business also. We are taking some steps to see how to broad base the overall profile,” he said. Going forward, ALL wanted to invest in the LCV segment as it had a huge business potential.

Regarding defence business, Mr. Mahadevan said ALL’s overall plan was to broad base its capabilities in defence so that it can see a larger addressable market.

Pruning capex

Asserting that the company will be pruning its capital expenditure (capex) for the current fiscal by 35%, he said: “At the beginning of the year, we said we will invest ₹2,000 crore. So far, we have spent ₹960 crore and we are going to be far, far lower than the projected capex and we will possibly finish the year at about ₹1,200- 1,300 crore maximum.”

On the debt level, he said the firm was in a comfortable position. As of the third quarter, ALL had a debt of less than ₹2,000 crore against ₹2,736 crore in the second quarter.

“Given a very tough quarter, I must state that we have done some very skilled cash flow management, reduction of inventory, all of which has resulted in cash flowing in, and we are doing everything that is right to build a long-term resilience of the company,” he said.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/i31sht/article30906545.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THBUASHOKLEYLAND,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/ashok-leyland-plans-to-resize-operations/article30906546.ece

330,2020/02/24,"Banks’ profitability remains fragile, says Das","Telecom sector poses challenge; overhang of non-performing assets remains relatively high

While the Indian banking sector may be slowly turning around on the back of improvement in asset quality, its profitability remains fragile, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said.

He also said that banks continued to face challenges like the present crisis in the telecom sector.

“In terms of recent progress, the Indian banking sector is slowly turning around on the back of improvements in asset quality with enhanced resolutions through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). Despite the recent decline in impaired assets and a significant improvement in provisioning, profitability of the banking sector remains fragile,” Mr. Das said at an event.

He said the capital position of banks had improved on account of recapitalisation of public sector banks by the government and capital raising efforts by private sector banks.

“Nevertheless, the sector continues to encounter challenges from events like those around the telecom sector,” he said.

According to Mr. Das, the overhang of non-performing assets (NPAs) remains relatively high, which is weighing on credit growth. “Also, in view of subdued profitability and deleveraging by certain corporates, risk-averse banks have shifted their focus away from large infrastructure and industrial loans towards retail loans,” he said, adding that this diversification strategy, while helpful as a risk mitigation tool, had its own limitations. He also said sector-specific pockets of stress needed policy attention.

“At the same time, proper due diligence and risk pricing in lending is of prime importance so that the health of the banking sector is not compromised while ensuring adequate flow of credit to productive sectors of the economy,” Mr. Das said.

On the issue of resolution of asset quality, the RBI Governor expects to have an integrated framework for resolution of financial firms operating in India, in the near future.

On consolidation in public sector banks, he said a properly worked out consolidation of PSBs can generate synergies in allocation of workforce and branches.

“The focus has to be on ushering in significant improvements in efficiency and rationalisation of scarce capital to meet the capital adequacy requirements,” he said.

As far as regulation of banks is concerned, he said the RBI was focussing on a sharper and more forward-looking off-site surveillance framework, apart from on-site supervision.

On non-banking finance companies, he said recognising the systemic importance of such entities and their inter-linkages with the financial system, the RBI had taken steps and the asset-liability management (ALM) position and other aspects of top 50 NBFCs were being closely monitored, covering all NBFCs with asset size above ₹5,000 crore.

The ALM of top 51-100 NBFCs is also being examined by the respective regional offices of the Reserve Bank, he added.

He reiterated that the RBI would also issue draft guidelines on corporate governance in banks.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/i8jjd1/article30906497.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THBUDAS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/banks-profitability-remains-fragile-says-shaktikanta-das/article30906498.ece

“Nobody wants to kill the sector, let me be clear,” Mr. Kumar said on the sidelines of an event to announce collaboration between Microsoft and SBI Foundation.

When asked about the outcome of the meeting between the government and the banks, Mr. Kumar said, “So far there has been no communication from the government, let us wait.”

The Supreme Court came down heavily on telecom companies recently, for not paying AGR dues. The government may invoke bank guarantees of the telecom companies if they fail to pay the dues before the next hearing scheduled on March 17.

SBI alone has ₹29,000 crore exposure to telecom players apart from non-fund based exposure of ₹14,000 crore.

Earlier this month, the Supreme Court ordered the managing directors and directors of companies, including telecom majors Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, to show cause why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against them for failing to pay even a “single penny” to the government in Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues, worth ₹1.47 lakh crore, despite an October 2019 judgment.

Following the order, the telecom players paid a part of their dues.

In its first year, the programme aims to develop skill of 500 youths for BFSI jobs in five cities — Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Mumbai and the National Capital Region.

332,2020/02/24,Indian CEOs need to build inclusive tech capabilities: Satya Nadella,"Stating that the last decade saw emergence of the aggregators, he asserted that aggregators are not enough alone.

Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella on Monday urged Indian business leaders to build technology capabilities that are inclusive in nature.

333,2020/02/24,Payyanur’s Gandhi connection,"During a visit to the Kerala town in 1934, the Mahatma planted a mango tree that still survives

Payyanur taluk, situated on the banks of the Perumba river in Kerala’s Kannur district, played a significant role in India’s struggle for independence and also has a historical engagement with Gandhian thought and action.

In the early days, the Simon Commission protest in 1928 was the first major movement that ushered Payyanur to the forefront of the freedom struggle. Moyarath Sankaran, A. Lakshmana Shenoy and Subrahmanyam Thirumunpu were the leaders of ‘Simon Go Back’. The same year witnessed the All Kerala Political Conference at Payyanur, which was presided over by Jawaharlal Nehru. During that conference, resolutions were passed demanding poorna swaraj (complete independence) for India and permanent tenancy for land tillers.

The Salt Satyagraha in 1930 was another landmark in Payyanur’s history. ‘Kerala Gandhi’ K. Kelappan led a procession of 33 satyagrahis from Kozhikode to Payyannur, the southern tip of the North Malabar. Poochal Beach of Ramanthali village, on the outskirts of Payyanur, was the arena for the ritual of disobeying the notorious salt law of the British Raj. S.A. Barelvi, in his newspaper the Bombay Chronicle, described Payyanur as the “Second Bardoli,” honouring its valour and sacrifice during the Salt Satyagraha.

Anti-untouchability movement

Payyanur was also an epicentre of the anti-untouchability movement. Great leaders of the movement at Payyanur — A.K. Gopalan, K.A. Keraliyan and Vishnu Bharatiyan — ushered boys from the oppressed Pulaya community into the southern corridor of the Kandoth Sree Kurumba Bhagavathi Temple.

Feudal elements tried to evoke communal friction between the Ezhavas, who ran the temple, and the Dalits. The leaders were brutally tortured by the caste supremacists, but this did not dent the enthusiasm of the movement.

One of the first crusaders against casteism in Payyanur was Swami Anandatheertha. A second-rank holder in Physics from the Madras University, Ananda Shenoy, a Konkani Brahmin by birth, should have otherwise got a respectable job under the British. But choosing a different and more adventurous path, he jumped into the freedom struggle and joined Sabari Ashram in 1926. Following Gandhiji’s advice to take up the task of uplifting the oppressed classes, he went to Sivagiri in 1928; he was consecrated as ‘Swami Anandatheertha’ by Narayana Guru in the same year and raised the banner of revolt against casteism.

Rights of Dalits

Payyanur, which was at that time a morass of rampant casteism, and a town with which the Swami had close contact since 1920, eventually became his karmabhoomi. At the time, lower-caste people were being systematically de-humanised there. The Swami understood that the rights of the oppressed cannot be gained without imparting a proper education to them; so in 1931 he started a school for the oppressed. He later staged numerous dharnas before barber shops where Dalits were not admitted. He also led a march to Guruvayur, where free meals were being given to Brahmins only, although many of those who were excluded from this handout were starving.

Gandhiji visited Kerala several times, but his visit to Payyanur in January 1934 was special — it was a private visit to call on Swami Anandatheertha. Gandhiji spent a whole day at the ashram and planted a mango tree there, which still thrives at that site. An urn containing ashes from the funeral pyre of Gandhiji is still preserved in the ashram.

The government of Kerala plans to set up a Mahatma Gandhi Smriti Museum. This be fitting tribute both to Gandhiji’s legacy and to Payyanur.

334,2020/02/24,Making the super-rich pay their fair share,"Reducing financial opacity requires more than exchange of tax information with other jurisdictions

Transparency seems to have become taboo in India. As the country remains mired in an economic slowdown, with evidence of falling employment and consumption, the government is persistent in its denial. Instead of actually addressing the problem, it seeks to suppress or manipulate official data to somehow provide a more optimistic picture. We saw this once again recently as the Union Budget was presented, based on numbers for revised estimates for the current year and Budget estimates for the coming year that the Finance Ministry itself knows are unlikely.

The opacity of data also extends to cross-border movement of funds generated through a range of activities, including tax evasion, misappropriation of state assets, laundering of the proceeds of crime, and bribery. Even here, India still has a lot to do, as confirmed by the recent publication of the Financial Secrecy Index by the Tax Justice Network, a U.K.-based financial advocacy group. On the surface, India has managed to reduce its contribution to global financial secrecy, with its rank falling from 32 on the 2018 index to 47 in 2020, but this is partly because the new edition of the index covers more countries than it did two years ago.

Arrangement with Switzerland

It is true that the government has adopted and supported a few transparency reforms, such as the automatic exchange of tax and financial information with other jurisdictions, like Switzerland. Thanks to that, for example, if an Indian citizen has an account with a Swiss bank, and has a balance over a certain threshold, this information will be sent to the Indian tax authorities automatically.

But stopping the financial haemorrhage and making multinationals and the super-rich pay their fair share of taxes requires much more. Capital flight out of India by Indian elites and foreigners alike has been undermining our country’s development for decades. An important part of these flows is the result of artificial profit shifting by multinational companies taking advantage of an outdated international tax system.

These multinationals may be making profits in India but can easily declare those profits in a low tax jurisdiction like Hong Kong and justify that transaction as a payment for the use of a patent. According to one estimate, this strategy represented a loss of $27.5 billion in 2014 for the Indian government, up from $142 million in 2000.

The government did create a beneficial ownership register — which would allow the identification of the beneficial owner of an asset regardless of whose name the title of the property is in — but the law is weak, since it exempts a lot of people at the discretion of the authorities. Also, this register is not accessible to the public.

Onshore financial services

That’s not all. Three years ago, the government took the paradoxical decision to set up onshore international financial services in the country. This is how the International Financial Services Centre in the Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT-City), Gandhinagar, emerged, modelled after offshore financial centres such as Hong Kong, Singapore, the City of London and Dubai. While this has not created much employment, it has led to growing possibilities for regulatory arbitrage by financial firms, with potentially very problematic consequences.

Meanwhile, the government keeps granting tax incentives on a discretionary basis, even though there is little evidence that these incentives attract investment. Instead, as shown recently in International Monetary Fund research, factors such as quality of infrastructure, a healthy and skilled workforce, market access and political stability matter much more. The massive reduction in corporate tax rates has thus far not led to any increase in private investment — but it has meant a significant reduction in tax revenues, with devastating consequences. It translates into a lack of resources for education, healthcare, food and nutrition and infrastructure. India is already an outlier among similarly placed developing countries with its low tax-GDP ratio of 18%. The government budget is also highly dependent on indirect taxes like the Goods and Services Tax which are regressive and hit ordinary citizens harder.

Increasing public spending

It is now beyond obvious that India cannot revive its economy without increasing public spending, and so increasing its fiscal resources is essential. Among other measures, this requires urgent adoption of legislation and institutional reforms to end financial opacity — including, for example, opening the beneficial ownership register to the public and stopping the creation of onshore tax havens.

In addition, the Government of India must also assume a more vocal role in the international debate about how to make multinationals pay their fair share of taxes. This means continuing to appeal for a United Nations tax body, which is much more legitimate than the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the arena where tomorrow’s global tax system is being decided. The OECD’s proposals, published at the end of 2019, are neither ambitious nor fair enough, as the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (of which I am a member) explained in a recent report. If the organisation continues to remain deaf to the demands of developing countries, India must be prepared to go it alone, thinking unilaterally about how to make multinationals pay what they owe.

335,2020/02/24,Batting for the downtrodden,"With the sorry state of Dalits still evident in data, the judiciary needs to continue to uphold their rights

The Supreme Court has ruled that quotas and reservations for promotions for government jobs are not a fundamental right, setting aside an Uttarakhand High Court order of 2012. The top court has also said that States could not be forced to make such provisions without data showing imbalance in representation of certain communities in public service.

While the legality of the ruling could be contended by legal experts, the top court’s advice on quantifiable data on under-representation exhibits lack of a broader perspective on the status of Dalits. The Court should have been more prudent than to leave the entire decision to Uttarakhand which has a high rank in in the country in terms of the practice of untouchability.

According to a recent survey by academician Amit Thorat, up to 47% of respondents in the hill State admitted to practising untouchability. More than half the forward caste people confessed to practising untouchability. Further, nearly 68% Brahmins in rural and 77% Brahmins in urban areas of the State admitted to the practice. With such widespread discrimination prevalent in the State, an honest response on representation from the Executive and administration is hard to expect. Reminders of a massive backlog of posts under reservation have become a regular feature in all States. Ironically, the Court while passing its order remained silent on the sources of under-representation: namely data on caste discrimination in public employment and other spheres. One expected the Court to be aware about the under-representation of Dalits in ownership of land and enterprise, literacy, and access to civic rights, and their over-representation in poverty, malnutrition, and social isolation and atrocities.

Widespread discrimination

Where are Scheduled Castes (SCs) under-represented, and where are they over-represented? The SCs suffer from low ownership of capital assets, illiteracy, and lack of access to civil rights. In 2013, of the total wealth in the country, the share of SCs was only 5% in rural areas against their population share of almost 17%. In terms of their share in agricultural land, it was only 5% while in building assets it was 8%. On the other hand, the high castes owned 39% of total natural wealth — 41% land and 39% building assets. In urban areas, SCs own only 4% of total wealth: 6% land and 2.6% of buildings as against 45% of land and 76% of buildings by high caste, much in excess of their population share of about 21%.

In 2015, the enrolment rate in higher education was 20% for SCs compared to 43% for higher castes. Besides the massive backlog in government services, these are spheres where SCs are grossly under-represented. They are over-represented in wage labour, poverty and malnutrition. In 2014-15, almost half of Dalits depended on casual wage labour when compared to 11% of high castes. In 2012 about a third were poor, compared to 11% for high castes. Most importantly, caste discrimination and untouchability continue to be practised widely despite anti-discriminatory laws. Between 2001 and 2013, SCs had registered about 54,257 cases of atrocities or 4,174 cases annually. This is just the proverbial tip of the iceberg.

Primary studies show extensive discrimination in employment, farming, enterprise/business against SCs. Based on NSS data, these studies indicate that in 2017-18, of the differences in access to employment between SCs and high caste, about 71% was due to discrimination in hiring. Findings of another primary survey in 2013 in rural India show that SC entrepreneurs in grocery, eatery, and transport services faced discrimination, with the high castes reluctant to avail of their goods and services. Many SC farmers admit that they face discrimination in the buying of inputs and sale of outputs.

Part of social hierarchy

A lesser known fact shown in recent studies such as that of P. Sanal Mohan in Modernity of Slavery: Struggles Against Caste Inequality in Colonial Kerala is that about untouchables being a slave caste. Hindu slavery goes back to at least 600 BC. Manu recognised slavery in 200 BC; it continued to be practised for about 2,500 years before it was banned by the British in 1843. A significant fact is that untouchables were recognised as slave caste wholly in the service of high caste.

Empirical evidence from Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala suggests that Hindu kings implemented the Brahminical theory of untouchables as slave caste for thousands of years.

Prof. Mohan while describing the plight of slaves observes: In Kerala the untouchable slaves generally go without clothing, barely cover their nakedness with a string of leaves propped around their loins. They eat all the refuse... were paid the lowest wages — that would keep them barely alive.”

A statement often found in all slave transaction documents, “Kill you may kill, sell you may sell”, bears testimony to the power of upper-caste Hindu and Christian landlords. In fact the entire agrarian economy was based on the exploitative slave labour of untouchables. Slavery is long gone but its legacy persists in the form of bonded, attached and forced labour of Dalits in many parts of the country.

Unaccountability and caste slavery have completely crippled Dalits. They remain asset-less, illiterate and socially isolated with overt residential segregation in rural areas, and subtly in urban areas. Therefore, the reservation policy is necessary as a safeguard against discrimination and to secure their fair share.

Need for compensation

But it is not enough. What the SCs require most is “adequate compensation or reparation” for traditional denial of rights to property and education, and slave labour. The affirmative action policies similar to reservation mainly provide protection against discrimination and ensure a fair share of benefits in the “present”, but this is a weak remedy to deal with the consequences of “past” exclusion.

Dalits need to be given adequate land, enterprises, and funds for education as compensation. The rationale behind ensuring compensation is the enrichment of the higher castes at the cost of the impoverishment of Dalits through under-payment of wages to slave labour and denial of rights to land, enterprises, and education.

Since the high castes have benefited at the cost of the former untouchables, there is legal and moral justification that they compensate for the losses they have inflicted on the latter for centuries. With such a massive backlog in the condition of SCs, the top court should have been more sensitive in its observations. The Court and the judiciary is the last resort for Dalits who continue to face oppression under the pretext of divine ordination.

336,2020/02/24,Limits of funding: on private sector research funding,"Private sector research funding is boosted mostly by partnerships among companies

That research and development in India is inadequate, in terms of money, personnel and ambition, isn’t news. The founders of independent India sought to base its development on science and technology. To this end, even at the expense of universal, free primary education, the country privileged esoteric research such as atomic energy and space over industrial technology, and tertiary research institutions — the IITs — over the spread of technical education in local languages. As a strategy with successes and setbacks, this also saw, as historians have noted, Indian R&D remain beholden to the government. Publicly-funded research has always been encouraged to reinvent the wheel and customise technology to Indian realities, whereas private companies and industrial firms have rarely been incentivised to develop their own intellectual property. It is only after the turn of the millennium that policymakers have pondered on coaxing the private sector to invest more in R&D. Public institutions contribute the lion’s share of R&D investment. In 2004-05, the private sector accounted for 28% of research spend; it was40% in 2016-17. In most advanced economies, private R&D accounts for the bulk of investment in R&D. Moreover, relative to its income, India underspends on R&D compared to what the U.S. and China did when it had income levels comparable to India’s now. Given this history, the Department of Science and Technology is mooting a fund that will match the private contributions in R&D. A ₹40-crore target is on the anvil and the idea is that the private sector — Indian firms and foreign companies with Indian subsidiaries — would fund scientists in key academic institutions.

This is not the first time that the government has tried to get private sector money into R&D. When ‘Startup India’ and ‘Make in India’ were the buzzwords in the early years of the Modi government, there were attempts to have venture capitalists and government departments involved in scientific research, to pool money and invest in technology start-ups. But, unfortunately, this has not resulted in investment in creating intellectual property. Too much of India’s research investment is expended on a small pool of scientists in a limited number of institutions. The private sector has extremely limited capacity to absorb scientists and a limited risk-appetite to invest in futuristic technology. Private research funding is also boosted more by partnerships among companies rather than by centrally-funded research programmes. While private funding is increasing, it still has not reached a level where major central funding can make a significant impact. Many CSIR laboratories have had a long history of collaborating with companies to develop and transfer technology to industry, but here too, restrictions on how intellectual property and licence fees can be shared abound. Unless there is greater participation and cooperation at smaller levels among companies and government, central schemes may not be fruitful.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/limits-of-funding-on-private-sector-research-funding/article30897174.ece
337,2020/02/24,Keep up the pressure: decision by FATF on Pakistan,"The international community must continue to hold Pakistan to account on terrorism

The decision by global watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), at its plenary in Paris last week, to keep Pakistan on its “greylist” for monitoring its record against terror financing was no surprise. While the Pakistan government has yet to complete the 27-point action plan it was given in June 2018, it has, according to the FATF, made some progress. As a result, the 39-member group that includes India decided to extend Pakistan’s September 2019 deadline until June 2020. Actions Pakistan still needs to carry out include tightening security and banking restrictions to block loopholes through which designated groups including the Taliban, al-Qaeda, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad access funding. It also calls on Pakistan to begin prosecutions against terrorists and sanction entities that are flouting the UNSC’s rules for designated terror organisations. The FATF Chairman’s final comment says Pakistan must comply with all 27-action points — it has cleared about 14 — in the next four months or face financial strictures by being placed on the “blacklist”. Pakistan is one of 18 countries on the greylist; Iran and North Korea are on the blacklist.

The FATF’s sharp language is significant, yet according to the force’s consensus rules, Pakistan believes it might be able to slip through the deadlines if it is able to ensure that three countries, China, Turkey and Malaysia, which have pledged support, veto any move to blacklist it. Pakistan also appears to have benefited from playing a role in U.S.-Taliban talks as it seems the U.S. and its allies are not enforcing the deadline to complete the action plan as before. A senior U.S. official’s statement in January welcoming Pakistan’s progress in its FATF commitments may have set the stage for the final plenary decision. While the FATF’s Chairman’s wording was strong, it was a repetition of the threat he served Pakistan last year, and there is a danger that Pakistan, a country that has not sustained punitive action against thousands of designated terrorists and entities, will feel immunity from the process. The Pakistani court’s hurried conviction of LeT chief Hafiz Saeed on terror financing charges just before the Paris meet appeared to be a command performance, and its shocking submission to the FATF that it cannot trace Masood Azhar must be scrutinised further by the international body. Among other issues on the agenda during U.S. President Trump’s India visit, it is necessary that India raises the need to continue to hold Pakistan to account on terror, and not flag in attention just when the FATF process has begun to extract results from Islamabad.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/keep-up-the-pressure-decision-by-fatf-on-pakistan/article30897171.ece
338,2020/02/24,NIA searches 25 places in Bengaluru and Chennai in IS module case,"‘The case relates to a criminal conspiracy to murder Hindu leaders, trigger communal riots’

Officials of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday conducted simultaneous searches at 25 locations in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu in connection with the recent IS Khaja Moideen module case and recovered incriminating documents.

According to an official release, NIA carried out searches at 15 locations, in Bengaluru and Kolar district in Karnataka. The locations included the residences of the accused in the case, both arrested and absconding. Searches were also conducted at the offices of Al-Hind Trust, linked to the case. During the searches, a number of items, including nine mobile phones, five SIM cards, one laptop, two hard discs, four CDs/DVDs, 18 books, an autorickshaw, firecrackers and other incriminating documents were seized from these locations, the release said.

“The case pertains to a criminal conspiracy to murder Hindu leaders, trigger communal riots and to do anti-national activities by forming a terrorist gang, being inspired by IS, a proscribed terrorist organisation,” the release said.

The accused in the case had allegedly conspired with IS member Khaja Moideen, native of Parangipettai, Cuddalore district. Members of the terrorist gang conducted meetings at Bengaluru and other parts of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and propagated IS ideology, procured arms and ammunition and other incriminating material for executing their plans.

Absconding

In this connection, Mehaboob Pasha, Mohammed Mansoor Ali Khan, Saleem Khan, Zabiulla, Syed Azmathulla were arrested earlier and the other accused are absconding, officials said.

Meanwhile in Tamil Nadu, searches were conducted at 10 locations in Chennai, Kanchipuram, Toothukudi, Salem, and Cuddalore districts. The seized items will be submitted before the jurisdictional NIA Special Courts at Chennai and Bengaluru and the digital devices subjected to cyber forensic examination.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/nia-searches-25-places-in-bengaluru-and-chennai-in-is-module-case/article30906964.ece
339,2020/02/24,Sahaaya app to be phased out,"BBMP is promoting Sahaaya 2.0 (Namma Bengaluru) app

There are over 30,000 complaints still waiting to be redressed on the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike's (BBMP) Sahaaya app. This, when the civic body has already moved on to addressing complaints registered on Sahaaya 2.0 (Namma Bengaluru) app that was launched recently.

Senior BBMP officials told The Hindu that since the new Sahaaya was launched by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, the civic body has been promoting it. More attention is being given to the complaints registered on Sahaaya 2.0.

Since its launch earlier in February, around 4,600 complaints pertaining to BBMP have been registered. Of these, officials have already redressed over 1,700 complaints. The official said that all the officers have been mapped and complaints once registered on the new app can get escalated to higher officials if not redressed within a particular time frame. Complaints that have come to the BBMP through the control rooms or even WhatsApp are linked on the new app, the official told The Hindu.

So what about the 30,000-odd complaints? The official said the BBMP will be addressing those separately. These complaints will remain on the old app. “Once all the complaints are addressed, we will shut down the old app,” the official stated.

Odette Katrak, a resident of Bellandur, has three open complaints on the old Sahaaya app. She said unless all the complaints are migrated to the new app, redressal is uncertain. In the old app, there have been several instances of complaints getting closed suddenly. There would be a flurry of calls from the call centre in the head office sometimes. “However, I have had some complaints being addressed by officials quite efficiently. The old and new apps should be linked at least for some time before the old app is shut down,” she said.

If the BBMP is keen on promoting Sahaaya 2.0, Ms. Katrak said it needed to be publicised. Residents, she said, should be encouraged to make use of the complaint mechanism. “This is a good instrument to engage with the BBMP. With more residents using the app, the instances of littering and burning of leaves will come down,” she added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/a3jwb4/article30906835.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BGSAHAAYAAPP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/sahaaya-app-to-be-phased-out/article30906836.ece
340,2020/02/24,"After one year, students learn BEd. college lacks BU affiliation","They have not been able to appear for the third semester exams

Students pursuing their BEd. courses in a city-based college were in for a shock when they received a message from the management that their end-of-semester examinations scheduled on Monday could not be held as they did not get the necessary permission from Bangalore University (BU).

Later, the third semester students of Pragathi College of Education, Chikkabanavara learnt that the college does not have the necessary permission from the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) to run the institution.

A third semester student of the college said, “Although we enrolled in February 2019 and appeared for examination of two semesters, we are yet to get our results for these two semesters.”

Another student said that last year she initially went to another city-based college in Horamavu and her admission was later transferred to Pragathi College of Education. “We feel cheated. We want the authorities of Bangalore University to listen to our grievances and help us find a solution,” the student said.

The students said that they had submitted the examination fees on the Bangalore University website and wondered why the university had acted so late.

The students have written a petition and they are planning to seek relief from the courts as nobody from the management turned up to provide an explanation.

The management on Monday sent messages to students that they were having a discussion with the university and that they would take the responsibility of ensuring that students appear for the examination.

Despite repeated calls and complaints, the college management was unavailable for comment.

Bangalore University authorities said that the management does not have the permission to start a college. “Last year, we gave them the benefit of doubt. We thought they had the necessary permission and allowed students to appear for the examination. This year, although the students have paid the fees, it does not mean that they can appear the examination,” a senior official of the varsity said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/after-one-year-students-learn-bed-college-lacks-bu-affiliation/article30906203.ece
341,2020/02/24,Tumakuru declared Open Defecation Free+,"It becomes the second city in the State to get this tag

The central government has declared Tumakuru as Open Defecation Free+ (ODF+). With this certification, Tumakuru has become the second city in the State, after Mysuru, to get the ODF+ tag in 2019-2020. Tumakuru was declared as an ODF city in 2018-2019.

The city has a population of 3.05 lakh as per the 2011 census. It has 15 community toilets and 15 public toilets. Among them, the one on J.C. Road is a pink toilet while the toilet in S.S. Puram has sanitary pads vending machines and an incinerator. Some toilets include rainwater harvesting.

The certificate is given by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, government of India every year. The cities are assessed by the Quality Council of India. This certificate has to be renewed every year.

Mruthyunjaya K.S., Environmental Engineer of Tumakuru city corporation, told The Hindu, “We are happy that Tumakuru has got the ODF+ tag. We will work hard to retain the tag next year.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/tumakuru-declared-open-defecation-free/article30905402.ece

A team of police led by ADGP, law and order, Amar Kumar Pandey brought fugitive underworld operative Ravi Pujari from Senegal on Monday.

The gangster was nabbed in South Africa and was later extradited to Senegal, police sources said.

Pujari, handcuffed, escorted by a team of officials landed at the Kempegowda International Airport from where he was taken to an undisclosed location amidst tight security.

He was housed in the interrogation centre at the Madivala Forensic Science Lab and subjected to medical examination.

DG and IGP Praveen Sood congratulated the team’s effort.

Pujari, involved in over 70 criminal cases, was running organised extortion rackets in Karnataka and other parts of the country.

Last year, he was arrested by the Senegal authorities, and the Indian police failed to arrest him as a local court there granted him bail.

The gangster then jumped the bail and fled Senegal and had holed up in South Africa, said police sources.

343,2020/02/24,"Increase in Bengaluru–Mysuru train services, highway work affect KSRTC","62 schedules of non-AC buses operating between the two cities cancelled

An increase in the number of train services between Bengaluru and Mysuru as well as the ongoing widening of the highway connecting the two cities have hit Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC). Owing to poor patronage, the transport corporation has cancelled 62 schedules of non-AC buses operating between the two cities.

KSRTC officials said operation of more trains on the route would have an adverse impact on the long run. “Owing to poor patronage, we have augmented our services on the route. Increased train operations is one of the factors. The ongoing work on widening Bengaluru–Mysuru highway is another factor. The travel time has considerably increased — by 20 to 25 minutes — owing to the work, this may also force more people to shift to train,” an official said.

The official said AC bus services on the sector remain unchanged. “AC buses have a seating capacity of at least 44 seats and the buses usually leave the bus stand after there are a minimum of 25 passengers. We are continuing this practice,” said the official.

‘Many prefer train’

Mahesh Mahadevaiah, a regular traveller on the route, said, “People prefer train over buses for various reasons, including the fare, shorter travel time, and the comfort of travel. Bengaluru–Mysuru ticket costs ₹35 in a MEMU (Main Line Electrical Multiple Units) train, ₹80 in a super fast train, and ₹75 in an express train. Whereas, one has to pay ₹130 to ₹140 for a bus journey. The Railways is operating adequate number of trains on the route, but attention should be paid to ensure that the trains run as per schedule. Trains take a long time to reach KSR Bengaluru City station from Kengeri.”

Another passenger, Abhishek R., said, “Trains have many advantages over buses. Bus journey takes longer because of the highway work. There are many traffic bottlenecks at Ramanagaram and Channapatna. The train reaches faster. Also, I use the SWR mobile app to book tickets and get 5% cash back.”

In the last two years, Mysuru got new train services and extension of existing services. Recently, the composition of a MEMU train was increased from eight cars to 16 (Four motor cars and 12 training cars).

South Western Railway chief PRO E. Vijaya said, “The new services have been well received by people. Early morning and evening services run packed. The special MEMU train (no. 06575) operates with an occupancy of 90%.” The official said that each motor car has a capacity to accommodate 226 people (55 seating and 121 standing) and the trailing car has the capacity to accommodate 325 people (84 sitting and 241 standing).",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/4tduia/article30898491.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BGBUSSTAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/increase-in-bengalurumysuru-train-services-highway-work-affect-ksrtc/article30898492.ece
344,2020/02/24,BBMP may go for new garbage tenders,"System of single vehicle with compartments to collect wet, dry, and sanitary waste every day mooted

Around four years of work on garbage tenders that were finalised recently is all set to be undone. These tenders are likely be scrapped to make way for new ones, changing the modalities of garbage collection in the city.

The present tenders are for collection of only wet waste, while dry waste collection centres (DWCCs) collect dry waste twice a week now. “This is not a model that will work. It will bring us back to square one of the garbage crisis. We want a single vehicle with separate compartments to collect wet, dry, and sanitary waste every day. We have held a meeting to work around this. We may go for new short-term tenders,” Mayor M. Goutham Kumar told The Hindu.

He said that unlike the present tenders, the new ones would not be at the ward level, but at the division level — for a cluster of three or four wards.

The process for the new garbage tenders began in 2016 when Subodh Yadav was Special Commissioner, Solid Waste Management (SWM), BBMP. He was transferred after tenders failed to take off as contractors boycotted them. Then, the Congress government toyed with the idea of eliminating contractors altogether but soon reverted to the contract system. A seven-member committee of former mayors cutting across party lines was formed and new tender documents were drawn and the process was finalised in 2019.

“The file to issue work orders for 168 wards has been pending before the Standing Committee on Health and Council for over three months now,” said a senior civic official.

Srinivas Gowda, one of those who has won the contract for ward number 97 but has not got the work orders, approached the High Court of Karnataka recently. The court gave a direction to the civic body to issue the work orders in a week. “After the tenders have been finalised and BBMP issued the letter of acceptance how can they cancel the tenders? If they do so, we will challenge it in the High Court,” he said.

The move has also drawn the ire of SWM activists. “There has to be continuity and consistency of a policy. How can a new Mayor overturn the policy ratified by a non-partisan committee? Moreover, Bengaluru experience has taught us that collecting separate streams of waste in a single vehicle will only lead to mixed waste. Cancelling tenders now will only take us back by four years,” Sandhya Narayan, a member of the SWM Round Table said.

Mr. Kumar has been advocating the idea of single vehicle based on the model of Indore which won the cleanest city tag twice in a row under Swachh Bharat rankings. “Indore is a small city and its scale can be no comparison to Bengaluru. If the Mayor wants to implement the Indore model, he should do it in full. There are no contractors in Indore and the entire vehicle fleet is owned by the civic body,” said Ms. Narayan.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/r5eqgo/article30898431.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BGGARBAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-may-go-for-new-garbage-tenders/article30898432.ece
345,2020/02/24,BBMP’s asphalt mix plant ready,"With this facility, the civic body hopes to bring in more accountability and reduce its dependence on contractors

The city’s pothole-ridden roads have grown in notoriety, with even the High Court of Karnataka pulling up the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) for its failure to address the problem. In an attempt to bring in more accountability and reduce its dependence on contractors, the BBMP has set up an asphalt mix plant.

In the present system, it is the contractor who provides the asphalt mix which could be of questionable quality, leaving the BBMP with no option but to take a gamble on the longevity of the patch-work. The hope is that by producing its own asphalt, the civic body will be able to exert more quality control.

The plant at Kannur, which is around 20 km from the city, was ready to be commissioned around two months ago. For the past months, we have been doing trial runs, said a senior civic official. The plant has been set up on around four acres of land owned by the BBMP. “The civic body spent nearly ₹5 crore on setting up the plant. The annual maintenance contract for running the plant has been outsourced,” the official said.

Computerised plant

According to senior officials, the civic body has created a digital platform for the plant on which requisitions or indents can be placed by different divisions. The plant is also computerised. After each batch is prepared, digital reports are generated immediately showing the percentage of different components that have gone in. “With this, we have complete control over the quality of asphalt mix that is manufactured, and there is no compromise. Earlier, we had to depend on the contractors, and procuring asphalt was also an issue,” officials said, and added that the plant would soon be fully functional.

The plant has the capacity to manufacture around 100 to 120 tonnes of hot mix per hour. Officials claimed that around 40 tractor loads of asphalt mix could be dispatched from the plant per day.

To transport the asphalt hot mix to different parts of the city, there are two special vehicles. “The asphalt mix has to be maintained at a certain temperature. If the temperature drops, the mix cannot be used to fill potholes,” officials explained, and said that the special vehicles are equipped to maintain the temperature for a maximum of four hours.

“The hot mix from the plant can be transported to any part of the city within two hours,” officials claimed.

Probe handed over to ACB

In the wake of allegations that there have been irregularities in the pothole-filling exercise taken up by the BBMP from 2015 to 2018, the Urban Development Department (UDD) has handed over the probe to the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). Probe into the allegation of diversion of funds allocated for Swachh Bharat Mission in 2017-18 has also been handed over to the ACB.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/occll2/article30898177.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BGASPHALTHOTMIXPLANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmps-asphalt-mix-plant-ready/article30898179.ece

347,2020/02/24,This primary health centre in Chennai’s New Washermenpet has been shut for six years,"Residents say the centre was very useful for collecting medication and vaccinations, and that keeping it under lock and key was a waste of resources

In the midst of a densely populated residential locality stands a Primary Health Centre (PHC) that was shut down nearly six years ago. Thanks to the National Urban Health Mission (NUHM), the single-storey PHC of Greater Chennai Corporation on Poondi Thangammal Street in New Washermenpet was closed, and remains unused as the mission allowed only one “dispensary” for every 50,000 population.

Poondi Thangammal Street, a residential locality off Surya Narayana Street, is home to several families including those residing in the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board tenements in the surrounding area. According to information on the building, the centre was constructed with funds from the constituency development fund of the then Member of Legislative Assembly of R.K. Nagar, P.K. Sekar Babu.

A cross-section of residents said that many of them regularly utilised the services of the PHC until it was shut down all of a sudden a few years ago. Many of them were unaware of why the facility was closed.

“I am a diabetic, and used to get medication from the PHC for nearly three years. But one day, the staff told me that the facility is going to close and that I would have to go to another PHC,” Babu, a resident of Poondi Thangammal Street, said.

Ashokan, a resident of Meenavar Colony, said there were around 5,000 families in and around the locality. “A number of mothers used to take their children for vaccination to this facility. It was close to our homes. Keeping such a facility under lock and key is a complete waste of money,” he said.

Officials of Chennai Corporation said the “dispensary” was started in 2009 and closed in 2014. The reason being as per NUHM, there should be only one dispensary for every 50,000 population. There was a bigger facility at Cherian Nagar that is three to four kilometres away and received a larger number of patients, an official said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/2wq2w7/article30902678.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24FEBTH--CORPNPHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/this-primary-health-centre-in-chennais-new-washermenpet-has-been-shut-for-six-years/article30902679.ece
348,2020/02/24,CMRL renovating MTC terminus at Vallalar Nagar,"Many amenities are expected to be introduced

Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) is renovating the Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) terminus at Vallalar Nagar which was taken over for the construction of Washermenpet Metro Station. Since then, the terminus was functioning from an open space on Basin Bridge Road as a temporary arrangement. It is a busy terminus as services to Iyappanthangal, K.K. Nagar, Periyapalayam, Ennore, Koyambedu, Red Hills, Pudhur, and Villivakkam and a few more localities ply from here. Services to Anna Square, Otteri, Ayanavaram and Vyasarpadi pass through the terminus.

Once the terminus is ready, it will be quite convenient for those commuters who switches between CMRL and MTC modes of transportation. Now, we have to cross the road and access the terminus, says a section of commuters at Washermenpet Metro Station. They also pointed out that the temporary facility lacks bus bays and as the ground is sandy and it turns slushy during rains.

According to Metropolitan Transport Corporation officials, it is almost 10 years since the Vallalar Nagar terminus got shifted to a nearby open space belonging to the Greater Chennai Corporation. It had to be shifted to facilitate infrastructure projects of CMRL and construction of Mint flyover. Now, as both projects are complete, the terminus will be shifted back to its previous location. The renovated terminus will have four bays.

349,2020/02/24,Chennai’s Triplicane residents grapple with stray cattle menace on their streets,"For several years now, residents of Triplicane have been grappling with the problem of stray cattle on their streets.

Though the Chennai Corporation has introduced a slew of restrictions, cattle owners continue to let their animals roam freely on almost every road in the locality. The availability of vegetable waste and leftovers dumped by vegetable vendors or other street vendors also attracts the stray cattle, and the streets have virtually become a grazing ground, said residents.

Stray cattle pose a grave threat to the lives of motorists and pedestrians using the road. The cattle can be seen taking a nap in the middle of the road causing traffic snarls. On innumerable occasions, the sudden and unpredictable surge of these animals has led to serious injuries for motorists and pedestrians.

There have been instances when, during the procession of the deity Swami Purappadu on Mada Streets, senior citizens who participate in these procession chanting sacred hymns have been injured due to stray cattle.

T.J. Ramani, a resident of Triplicane said, “The problems are acute especially near the main market area at Gangai Kondan Mandapam, T.P Koil Street Singararachari Street and Big Street and East Tank Square Street. Traffic congestion is already heavy in the busy market place (near Gangai Kondan Mandapam) due to encroachments, haphazard parking of vehicles and an increasing number of vehicles. The situation becomes even worse when cattle occupy the roads.”

“There are several private cow sheds in the small lanes near the temple. The sheds do not have adequate space to accommodate all the animals. Mostly, these cows are let loose lack of space and they also block the entrances of houses,” said Y. Narasimman, another resident.

Stray cattle pull down the huge garbage bins kept on the roads, resulting in the garbage getting spilled all over. Until the garbage is cleaned by sanitary workers, road users are forced to step on the litter and waste.

Whenever the residents call the helpline number and complain about the stray cattle, the Chennai Corporation sends a vehicle to impound the cattle and fine the cattle owners. But the cattle owners somehow get information and withdraw their cattle before the vehicle arrives. There have been instances when the officials trying to discharge their duty have been chased away, residents say.

T.A. Sampathkumar, president of Srinivas Young Men’s Association, said, ”Our association has been representing this issue for the past several years to Corporation officials and we have participated in many meetings organised by the Corporation to tackle the stray cattle menace.

“We residents met the then Mayor in January 2015 and brought the issue to his attention and the Mayor took the initiative and constructed a spacious shed beneath the MRTS track. All the facilities required to rear cattle were provided in that shed. The solution was to shift the cattle to a place demarcated exclusively for this purpose. Though a few cattle owners started using this shed from February 2015 onwards, the problem of stray cattle persists because all do not use it,” said Mr. Sampathkumar.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/nxehas/article30901487.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24FEBTH-Straycattlejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennais-triplicane-residents-grapple-with-stray-cattle-menace-on-their-streets/article30901488.ece

353,2020/02/24,Chennai-Bengaluru highway repair work to start in April,"₹49 crore sanctioned for strengthening Maduravoyal-Sriperumbudur stretch

Work on strengthening the 23.2-km stretch between Maduravoyal and Sriperumbudur on the Chennai-Bengaluru highway is expected to commence by April.

An amount of ₹49 crore has been sanctioned for the work by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), which manages the toll road.

Sources in the NHAI said that tenders had already been called and bids will be received shortly for work on the four-lane road that witnesses over 85,000 passenger car units (PCUs) a day. The toll plaza at Sriperumbudur witnesses 35,000 vehicles every day, in addition to 25,000 two-wheelers and other non-toll paying motorists.

Work is being taken up presently since the proposed widening of the road is likely to take time.

“A detailed project report for the elevated corridor is under preparation,” an NHAI official said.

As part of the work, which is likely to be completed before the next monsoon, installing reflector studs, road signs and lane marking will be taken up.

Lakshmi Rajangam, a resident of Vanagaram, who welcomed the repairs being taken up at junctions, including Vanagaram, Velappanchavadi and Parivakkam, said service lanes should be laid up to Sriperumbudur. “There are service lanes only in small portions. If this additional space is created, it will help local traffic. There is a lot of development on either side, including companies and residential localities, which has led to an enormous increase in two-wheeler traffic,” she said.

Sources in the traffic police said the NHAI was speeded up the work after the High Court stepped. “We hope lighting on the road will be improved. High-mast lights are required at the junctions. Lack of lighting leads to accidents,” said a police officer.

“We have also written to local bodies to prevent cattle from straying on the road and want NHAI to close gaps on medians to ensure that the cattle do not cross the road. Installation of CCTV cameras will help keep an eye on vehicular movement,” said the officer.

NHAI officials said steps would be taken to improve lighting.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ddlhzg/article30898694.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THTOLL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-bengaluru-highwayrepair-work-to-start-in-april/article30898695.ece
354,2020/02/24,Exam season begins for school students,"Counsellors, teachers create support network to make the exercise stress-free

A majority of students from Class X in CBSE schools will start writing the board exams with the Tamil paper on Monday.

Students of Class XII in the CBSE stream as well as students of Classes X, XI and XII in State board schools will begin their exams over the next two weeks. The focus now for school heads, teachers and counsellors is to ensure that students are not stressed or anxious about the exams.

Minoo Aggarwal, principal, D.A.V Public School in Velachery, said school counsellors and teachers conducted sessions with students on how to tackle the exams in a calm and stress-free manner.

“Last-minute pressure and stress tend to hamper their focus when they attempt the paper. We have asked them to calmly read the question paper and not to hastily attempt the questions,” she said.

At Prasan Vidya Mandir, Lakshmi Prabha, principal, said teachers, counsellors and students had come together to create a support network that candidates could turn to.

“Class teachers act as main mentors and we have sensitised all subject teachers to identify and be aware if students need any assistance. For students taking up the board exams in particular, we have ensured that are made aware through the year to remain stress-free and calm,” she said.

The CBSE has an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) at 1800 11 8004, which students and parents can call to get pre-recorded information on tips to tackle the exam as well as answers to frequently asked questions.

On the same number, the board also offers live tele-counselling services, where principals and trained counsellors from CBSE schools will speak to students. This year, the board has also taken to memes on social media to give students instructions regarding exams.

Toll-free helpline

The toll-free education helpline number 14417 run by the School Education department too is gearing up to field calls from State-board students and parents.

“At present, we have private candidates calling in to know more about the procedures related to obtaining their hall tickets and centre allocation. From March 1, we expect more students to call in with subject-related doubts for which there will be teachers available. Our counsellors are there as well to speak to students who are feeling anxious or stressed,” said an official with the helpline.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/qy6p3f/article30898602.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THSTUDENTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/exam-season-begins-for-school-students/article30898603.ece
355,2020/02/24,Discovering virtues of living in a community,"Conclave spells out the features of a senior living project at Maramalai Nagar

For many pondering over moving into a senior living community, ‘Life after 55’, a senior living conclave, listed what is in store for them and why they could consider shifting there.

The conclave, organised by Ashiana Shubham and The Hindu, addressed how such a living community could take care of most needs of senior citizens.

Nandini Raman, a conselling psychologist, said health, emotional and psychological well-being were non-negotiable after a certain age and that it was important to love and take care of oneself, especially after 50.

“Most of them [senior citizens] live all their life doing everything for every other relationship, but when are they going to live for themselves?” she said.

“World over, retirement is seen as a phenomenon and people wait to go on a world trip, but here it is not seen that way. That’s not how we should be. There is so much to life after retirement. You should plan and peacefully live those golden years of life,” she said.

Eating right

Priya Rajendran, a nutritionist, said that eating right and staying fit was crucial.

Ankur Gupta, JMD of Ashiana Housing Limited, spoke about Ashiana Shubham, a senior living project in Maraimalai Nagar, Chennai, that has a host of facilities. “People can move in here because it is away from the busy and pollution-filled city. Yet, you can get to the heart of the city whenever you want.

357,2020/02/24,Readers Mail,"Traffic signal not pedestrian-friendly

I visited the Madhya Kailash junction on February 14 at 8.45 a.m. and tried crossing the road. The pedestrian signal had turned red, so I stood by the roadside. I waited for 10 minutes but the signal for pedestrians continued to be red. There were four police officers (three of them sergeants). I asked one of them about the non-functional pedestrian signal. He replied: “Go sir. The signal will change.”

After another five minutes, I approached another police officer and narrated what had happened earlier. This officer responded: “Go sir. The signal will change in two minutes.”

In a minute, the pedestrian signal turned green and I started walking on the zebra crossing. A speeding car was about to hit me and the driver informed me that he too had the green signal to drive. I realised that I was foxed, duped by a cruel joke that would have cost my life. This is the plight of the pedestrians.

358,2020/02/24,Govt. schools introduce folk arts to keep students’ strength robust,"Arts forms like Parai and Silambam bring about change in children

A few government schools in the city and its suburbs have taken to teaching folk arts to students in an attempt to reduce the number of dropouts in their schools and increase admissions.

K. Suganya has been teaching the arts for free. One of the schools that has adopted the tactic is the Government Higher Secondary School, Pudhur, in T. Nagar. There are over 300 children in the school and they are taught art forms such as Parai, Silambam, Karagam and Oyilattam.

“A few years ago, we started noticing that children were not focussing and were indisciplined due to extensive phone usage and even due to the consumption of tobacco. Many used to come to school without books and some would bunk classes. However, all of them were skilled in Parai and drums, ” said I. Vennila, a commerce teacher at the school.

She got the idea of introducing folk arts at school to bring about a change in the character of the children. Through R. Kaleeswaran of Loyola College, she was introduced to K. Suganya, who knew 35 folk art forms.

“Suganya has been teaching art to the children for the past one year. There is a change in their behaviour now. Seeing our students, other government primary schools have been inspired. The children performed at the Veedhi Virudhu Vizha at Loyola College, and after interacting with diginitaries there, they have been inspired to come up in life,” Ms. Vennila said.

Ms. Suganya, a native of Tirupandurai near Kumbakonam, said that she has been teaching folk arts for the past 12 years and has learned that the art forms can create awareness about different issues. “I came to Chennai two years ago and I have been teaching in nine government schools. I teach the art for free in a few schools and the others pay the transport charges,” she said.

She said the Government School in Pattravakkam had also been using folk arts to prevent students from dropping out and to empower children with skills. “The teachers said that it also encourages parents to admit their children in their school. Besides, children are interested in dance and music, so they seldom take leaves,” she added. But folk artists like her have been struggling to make ends meet. “We are passionate about the art and want to pass it on to children,” she explained.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tckbl5/article30898574.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THDANCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/govt-schools-introduce-folk-arts-to-keep-students-strength-robust/article30898575.ece
359,2020/02/24,Book of lectures on South Indian heritage released,"Discussion series comes to a close after 18 years

After 18 years, the South India Heritage Programme (SIHP) officially came to a close on Sunday.

Rich encomiums were paid to TAG Corporation managing director and the programme’s curator, R.T. Chari, at an event held at TAG Centre.

Madras Music Academy president N. Murali, who released the book The Magnificent Heritage of South India, comprising details of 350 lectures and other events conducted as part of the SIHP, said the series used to be the talk of the town.

The role that the series played in heritage awareness and building camaraderie was amazing, he said.

A disciplinarian, Mr. Chari would take people off the list of invitees if they did not ensure to provide RSVP thrice in a row. Though the programme has come to an end, the experience lingers on, said Mr. Murali.

Meticulous execution

Former Chief Secretary of Andhra Pradesh P.K. Doraiswamy commended the meticulous way in which the programmes were planned and executed by Mr. Chari. He wanted the guests to ensure that Mr. Chari was decorated with a Padma Award for his services to heritage and culture. Former Chief Election Commissioner T. S. Krishnamurthy said the heritage series covered a wide canvas of subjects and wanted it to be continued in some form. Former CBI director R.K. Raghavan said that SIHP had enriched the community through informative and educative lectures.

Mr. Chari made a video presentation titled ‘My musical and heritage journey’. He said that he would continue interacting with his extended family through programmes on music, humour and health. He also expressed his gratitude to his staff members, who helped him put together the SIHP over the years.

S.R. Madhu, who put together the book and has compered most of the programmes, said that he really admired Mr. Chari’s energy and the diversity of subjects that were chosen for SIHP. His retrospectives on Srirangam, Kancheepuram and Ramanuja, that had five to six lectures each, an exhibition and a little booklet, were a learning experience, he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/i44jfj/article30898568.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THBOOK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/book-of-lectures-on-south-indian-heritage-released/article30898569.ece
360,2020/02/24,Relocated vendors have their share of woes,"Footpath traders who were shifted to the Corporation complex for the pedestrian plaza are a perplexed lot.

The Chennai Corporation provided them details of the rent last month. S. Kaja Mohideen, who owns a shop on the first floor, said the civic body had levied GST from 2016, while it was introduced only in 2018.

The rent for a shop is only ₹1,000, but the GST levied, at 18%, is ₹6,480. Many have moved on to other jobs as it is not viable to run shops now, he said.

The shopkeepers point out that while they have been evicted from the footpath, bigger shops have encroached the pedestrian space. Some shops on the plaza have allowed small traders to thrive. Most shops place their generator sets outside and a table to place their wares, they add.

The shopowners at the complex point out that the NSC Bose Road vendors only multiply after every eviction.

The third floor remains unoccupied but they have to pay the pending dues for electricity they have not consumed, says a vendor.

Fire extinguishers have not been serviced. An extinguisher on the first floor, with its expiry date as 2015, has not been replaced despite several complaints, said M. Kamarudeen. “I was told that they would only replace the date on the sticker. But they have not even done that,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tpve40/article30898561.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THPLAZA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/relocated-vendors-have-their-share-of-woes/article30898562.ece
361,2020/02/24,Pedestrian plaza a bane for residents in the neighbourhood,"Unruly traffic, dug-up roads and encroaching shops trouble walkers

Now that the initial excitement over the pedestrian plaza in T. Nagar has subsided, it is the turn of residents in the surrounding streets to live in perpetual dust.

If in some streets, residents have to contend with the constant whir of share autorickshaws, in others it is the dug up roads that have left senior citizens irritated, as they cannot walk any longer. The Venkatnarayana Road-Dandapani Street-Sivagnanam Street junction is chaotic as the road has been dug up to lay cables. The entry to Pinjala Subramaniam Street is closed and pedestrians jostle with vehicles for space.

“For the last three or four months, we have been wondering what to do about the traffic problem,” said B. Arunachalam of Gopalakrishna Road, which runs parallel to the Theyagaraya Road. “Share auto drivers are unruly. They compete with each other for passengers. My mother is 85 and normally walks on the road. But now she is scared. The police cannot do much, but at least they can put up speed breakers,” he suggested.

An embittered senior resident of Usman Road said merely laying footpaths and LED lights do not make a smart city. “What is the action against building violations and what steps have been taken to tackle fire? How are they going to address an issue like cable fault? Trenching should be foolproof and leak-proof. Who is checking these violations,” he asked. Alleging lack of transparency, he said there should be a board on the road providing information and phone numbers of officials and contractors, he said.

Officials upbeat

Residents also charge that shops lining the plaza have started encroaching the pedestrian space by displaying their wares or placing generator sets, which extend a few feet into the platform.

But the disappointment of residents and shopkeepers in the area has not dampened the enthusiasm of officials behind the Smart City project. An official said 14 feeder roads, including G.N. Road and Venkatnarayana Road, are being upgraded.

Work on underground ducting and safe zones for pedestrians is under way. “The roads won’t be as fancy as the plaza, but will be safe for walking,” the official said.

The operating equipment for the car park has arrived from China but officials are waiting for the installation team. He said that they may have to consider alternatives if the team does not make it.

For parking attendants, it has been a challenging job. The educated young graduates are polite, but face a tough time from others. Often, cars with flags of political parties are parked on the wrong side, obstructing the way. “We tell them to pay, but they demand free parking,” an attendant said.

Parking problems

A battery-shuttle operator, V. Palani, says that it is not just two-wheelers, even car owners park the footpath.

Smart City officials and M. Vairamudi, managing partner of S.S. Tech Parking, which has got the contract, are however confident. “We have started collecting fines. The contractor and the police will be part of enforcement. Chennai is one of the first cities to get such an advanced method. We are in the process of implementing one of the largest systems in the world,” the official explained.

Mr. Vairamudi said, “Cameras are capturing violators. We have tickets and stickers for various violations — and the fine is four times higher than the parking fee. We have a record of vehicles violating rules and will not allow parking the next time. They must pay for earlier violations and we will blacklist violators after three times.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/4jqe30/article30898554.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24New-Work-in-progresstcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pedestrian-plaza-a-bane-for-residents-in-the-neighbourhood/article30898555.ece
362,2020/02/24,Youth can be a clear advantage for India,"Its close to five decade-long demographic opportunity can be leveraged only with suitable policies and programmes

India’s population is among the youngest in an ageing world. By 2022, the median age in India will be 28 years; in comparison, it will be 37 in China and the United States, 45 in western Europe, and 49 in Japan. India’s working-age population has numerically outstripped its non-working age population. A demographic dividend, said to have commenced around 2004-05, is available for close to five decades. This is an extraordinary opportunity. There are however, two caveats.

Key caveats

First, India’s population heterogeneity ensures that this window of demographic dividend becomes available at different times in different States. While Kerala’s population is already ageing, in Bihar the working age cohort is predicted to continue increasing till 2051. By 2031, the overall size of our vast working age population would have declined in 11 of the 22 major States. Second, harnessing the demographic dividend will depend upon the employability of the working age population, their health, education, vocational training and skills, besides appropriate land and labour policies, as well as good governance. India will gain from its demographic opportunity only if policies and programmes are aligned to this demographic shift. Demography is not destiny.

There is consensus now that among other factors, it was the demographic dividend that powered respectively the Asian economies of Japan, China, and South Korea to spectacular growth. More significantly, in each case, the underlying pattern was fairly similar i.e. countries will benefit from the economic potential of their youth bulge when and where they succeed in providing good health, quality education, and decent employment to their entire population; and not to segments defined by socio-economic status, geography, or historical legacy.

Need for skills

The Economic Survey 2019 calls for additional jobs to keep pace with the projected annual increases in working age population. We need a workforce that is well educated, and appropriately skilled. UNICEF 2019 reports that at least 47% of Indian youth are not on track to have the education and skills necessary for employment in 2030. The projected demographic dividend would turn into a demographic disaster if an unskilled, under-utilised, and frustrated young population undermines social harmony and economic growth. While over 95% of India’s children attend primary school, the National Family Health Surveys (completed up to 2015-16) confirm that poor infrastructure in government schools, malnutrition, and scarcity of trained teachers have ensured poor learning outcomes.

Even while India aspires to become a knowledge economy, millions of young people are getting left behind. The national capital has now demonstrated that when meticulous attention is paid to equity and quality across government schools, huge numbers benefit, with encouraging learning outcomes. High quality education achieves gender parity and propels people forward into more productive lives. A coordinated incentive structure prompting States to adopt a broadly uniform public school system focusing on equity and quality will yield a knowledge society faster than privatising school education can accomplish.

Most districts now have excellent broadband connectivity. Irrespective of rural or urban setting, the public school system must ensure that every child completes high school education, and is pushed into appropriate skilling, training and vocational education in line with market demand. Let geography not trump demography. Modernise school curricula, systematically invest in teacher training so that they grow in their jobs to assume leadership roles, while moving beyond the tyranny of the syllabus. Deploy new technology to accelerate the pace of building human capital by putting in place virtual classrooms together with massive open online courses (MOOCS) to help prepare this huge work force for next-generation jobs. Investing in open digital universities would further help yield a higher educated workforce.

Helping women

Growing female literacy is not translating into relevant and marketable skills. A comprehensive approach is needed to improve their prospects vis-à-vis gainful employment. Flexible entry and exit policies for women into virtual classrooms, and into modules for open digital training, and vocational education would help them access contemporary vocations. A mushrooming of job portals and organisations are providing employment for trained women, even from home. Equal pay for women will make it worth their while to stay longer in the workforce. Economist Yogendra Alagh has written that the significance of this “deferred bonus” (women entering the workforce), could be higher than the immediate benefits of the dividend from shifts in population age structure.

The recent massive job losses across the automobile, real estate, and IT sectors, as well as in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises is leading to an alarming fall in private consumption. And if prolonged, these could begin to jeopardise India’s demographic dividend. Policies to restore the ailing economy would bring back the mojo on employment.

On health care

In India, population health is caught between the rising demand for health services and competition for scarce resources. The National Sample Survey Office data on health (75th round, 2018), shows that a deep-rooted downturn in the rural economy is making quality health-care unaffordable. People are availing of private hospitals less than they used to, and are moving towards public health systems. That is all very well except for the fact that the central budget 2020-21 lays emphasis on private provisioning of health care which will necessarily divert public investment away from public health infrastructure. The Ayushman Bharat Yojana links demand to tertiary in-patient care. This promotes earnings of under-utilised private hospitals, instead of modernising and up-grading public health systems in each district. We need to assign 70% of health sector budgets to integrate and strengthen primary and integrated public health-care services and systems up to district hospital levels, include out-patient department and diagnostic services in every health insurance model adopted, and implement in ‘mission mode’ the Report of the High Level Group, 2019, submitted to the XV Finance Commission.

The elderly population in India is projected to double from 8.6% in 2011, to 16% in 2040. This will sharply reduce the per capita availability of hospital beds in India across all major States, unless investments in health systems address these infirmities.

The policies that we adopt, and their effective implementation will ensure that the our demographic dividend, a time-limited opportunity, becomes a boon for India.

363,2020/02/24,Hiding poverty,"Covering poverty with a wall: is it possible? Instead of constructing a wall, the government could have constructed houses for the poor people under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana using the same bricks. Another point is that Americans know better about India’s poverty than our politicians, economists and social workers. So, no need to hide it. Nobel Prizes for Amartya Sen, Mother Teresa, Abhijit Banerji and recognition for Satyajit Ray’s cinema are illustrative of the fact that the Western world is aware of India’s slums and shanties.

The attempt at camouflage reveals a neglect of the landless poor. Constructing a wall is not new to the world. Generally, countries construct walls against invasion by ‘enemies’. China constucted the Great Wall just to prevent the enemies from the steppe grasslands. Israel constucted a wall against Palestine in West Asia. Recently, the U.S. started constructing a wall against Mexican refugees. The wall between East Germany and West Germany was brought down in 1989.

In India, constucting a wall around rich people’s residential areas is not something new. It was in practice even before independence. It was to avoid theft and to maintain caste hierarchy. Gated communities are nothing but a version of these walled compounds. These gated people always keep their distance from the poor.

To reduce the income inequality, the produce of farmers and agricultural labourers, who comprise around 60% of our population, should be protected. The government should construct godown facilities in each village and also establish food processing industries in rural areas. This will create employment opportunities for the rural people. Farm labourers will become industrial workers. They will get employment opportunities throughout the year. Villages also should be provided with air-conditioned container facilities to transport and export the various processed food items. The Kisan Rail announced in the Budget is a welcome development in this regard. If government really interested in increasing the purchasing power of the rural people, good preservation of agricultural grains and products is a must. A handful of rich persons cannot enjoy the national wealth for long periods. It is highly unacceptable. So, instead of hiding poverty, it is better to take steps to bring the poor people into the mainstream by giving them their due share.

364,2020/02/24,Unethical diplomacy,"The ‘Namaste Trump’ extravaganza is likely to be nothing more than an image-boosting exercise for two leaders facing multipronged criticism in their respective countries. Optics like the number of people at an event are rarely an accurate reflection of the diplomatic strength of bilateral ties. Moreover, it is unfair and improper to accord a high-profile welcome to a U.S. President at the cost of poor people of Ahmedabad. Further, the attendance of people at such mega-shows is often secured through coercion. It is high time the Indian media discloses the unethical diplomacy underlying such events.

Anthony Johnson,

Thrissur, Kerala

India is facing one of the worst situations of social disquiet with Shaheen Bagh-style demonstrations being held across the nation (“In India, Trump likely to raise CAA, Kashmir,” Feb. 23). With expressions like ‘divisive politics’ and ‘oppression of minorities’ being bandied about vociferously, the political climate is not conducive for the visit by the President of the United States. The planned roadshow is nothing more than a decorative event. A prudent Mr. Trump should avoid acting as an interlocutor on issues like the CAA, the NRC and Kashmir, as dust has not settled yet on them. When such discussions are not going to yield any fruit, the futility of the whole exercise is glaring. The conviviality between the two leaders is no solution provider. The stature of Mr Trump’s high office will seriously be undermined. His visit is not going to help Mr. Modi’s image in any way. As Mr. Modi is facing the worst crisis of his tenure as the Prime Minister, he must concentrate on sorting out the prevailing simmering discontent. The additional burden of hosting the most important personality could have been diplomatically avoided. Mr. Modi has not properly prioritised the issues.

365,2020/02/24,Goa CM’s inexplicable rollbacks,"Quite unlike the resolve shown by Prime Minister Modi and his team to ignore the resolute demands from various quarters for repealing the amended citizenship act, the regularity with which the Chief Minister of Goa has been withdrawing ‘promulgations’ made by him under pressure from the Opposition parties does indeed come as a big surprise. The North Goa district administration has withdrawn Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code banning unlawful assembly of people which was imposed earlier after intelligence inputs about possible terror threat along the western coast. Although the Opposition parties were right in questioning the security restrictions ordered by the State administration on large gatherings ahead of the carnival festivities as it would adversely affect the tourism industry, it is astonishing to have the CM wilting under pressure so easily. Despite the overwhelming ‘majority’ that he enjoys in the house, a handful of Opposition legislators and their ‘histrionics’ were able to unsettle him!

Just recently, following strong objection from the civil society, village panchayats and Opposition parties, the Pramod Sawant-led government hurriedly withdrew the controversial order notifying urban status to 56 villages under the Goa Land Revenue Code, 1968. The justifications proffered by the government in each of these cases are as much cloaked in ambiguity as are the reasons for imposing them in the first place. To add further to the unease, the Archbishop of Goa has urged the Central government to immediately and unconditionally revoke the Citizenship Amendment Act and desist from implementing the NCR and the NPR’, and stop quashing ‘the right to dissent’. Although the divide in the Cabinet on this issue is quite obvious, the Church’s stand will severely dent the political fortunes of the eight Congress turncoats who joined the BJP in July last year. Hence the urgent meeting sought by the Chief Minister with the Archbishop appears to be the reactions of a harried leader who senses matters slipping out of his hands. And now, the State government’s ‘technical ground’ explanation notwithstanding, Mr. Sawant’s critics claim the nod by the Supreme Court allowing the Karnataka government plea that the Mhadei Tribunal award be notified by the Central government is a definite setback for the government. Succumbing to pressure from the Centre, he stands accused of compromising on the contentious issue. Is the CM out to save his chair?

366,2020/02/24,In black and white,"The retention of Pakistan on the ‘grey list’ by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) reaffirms that the incomplete and half-hearted actions of Pakistan in the fight against terror financing couldn’t convince the global watchdog, and quite rightly so. I am reminded of what Abraham Lincoln said: “You can fool all people some of the time and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time”. The writing was on the wall with the lame submissions of Islamabad like that of Masood Azhar being “missing”, and unanswered questions on matters like why terrorist financiers were imprisoned for only a few days. Pakistan would now do well to comply with the action plan of the FATF not only for ensuring peace and security in the subcontinent but also in its own interest, given its oft-repeated claim that it is a victim of terrorism itself.

B. Harish,

Mavelikara, Kerala

It is quite perplexing that “even Indian government officials” took the stand that “placing Pakistan on the ‘black list’ might prove counter-productive” on the specious grounds that “it (Pakistan) would not be incentivised to complete the action plan under a deadline” (Front page, “Pakistan retained on ‘grey list’ of FATF,” Feb. 22). This is not the first time Pakistan is placed on the grey list. It was on grey list for three years during 2012-2015, put back on the list again in June 2018 and where it has remained since then. It is obvious that so far being ‘grey-listed’ has not incentivised Pakistan to complete the action plan given by Financial Action Task Force, though several deadlines and more than one and half years have elapsed since the date of latest listing. Though it is evident that Pakistan is unwilling to complete the FATF action plan to curb the mushrooming of terror funding and money laundering, extending the deadline again upto June 2020 appears to be a decision taken based not on ground realities, but on the basis of extraneous factors. As pointed by The Hindu editorial earlier (January 27), “there is no doubting that geopolitics and bilateral deals play a part in deciding outcomes” at the FATF’s plenary sessions. Given these geopolitical realities, Pakistan may very well remain on grey list with continuously shifting deadlines, without actually dismantling any of the terror networks on its soil, and India may continue to face the menace of cross-border terrorism.

369,2020/02/24,Mishra’s musings,"It was unbecoming of Supreme Court judge Arun Mishra to have showered encomiums on Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the International Judicial Conference (Front page, “PM Modi a versatile genius, says Justice Arun Mishra,” Feb. 23). By doing so, the judge seems to have not only erred but also demeaned the exalted position that he holds. It was of particular significance that he extolled Mr. Modi at a conference where a galaxy of judges from 20 countries was in attendance. What conclusion those who heard him might have drawn is not difficult to fathom. Justice Mishra seems to have done incalculable harm and unpardonable injustice to the country’s judicial ethos and its cherished values by his indiscreet and inappropriate words.

C.G. Kuriakose,

Kothamangalam, Kerala

What confidence will the people have in the judiciary when a sitting Supreme Court Justice praises sky-high Prime Minister Modi, calling him a “versatile genius” who “thinks globally but acts locally”? These remarks come at a time when critical issues like the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and dilution of Article 370 are pending before the apex court and constitutional values like democracy, secularism and the like are to test. Our boasts of having a robust and independent judiciary have received a severe jolt. The least the Justice can do is to gracefully step down. The Supreme Court Bar Association and other associations have to act immediately to preserve the glory of the Constitution.

N.G.R. Prasad,

K.K. Ram Siddhartha,

Chennai

A sitting judge of the Supreme Court has set the cat among the pigeons with his fulsome praise for the head of the executive at a judicial conference and the eulogy has drawn flak from retired members of the judicial fraternity. Justice Mishra’s lauding of the Prime Minister as an internationally acclaimed visionary and versatile genius who thinks globally and acts locally, irrespective of the merits of the argument, is clearly laying it on a bit too thick and perhaps the learned judge could have been a bit more subdued in his observations. It goes without saying that the independence of the judiciary cannot be compromised and, if this has to be ensured, it has to keep its distance from the executive and treat it on par with any other litigant.

C.V. Aravind,

Chennai

Supreme Court judge Arun Mishra was fulsome in his praise of the Prime Minister at the International Judicial Conference in New Delhi. Justice Mishra showed no qualms or compunction about saying what he said as a sitting judge of the apex court about a sitting Prime Minister. His laudatory characterisation of Prime Minister Modi as a “versatile genius who thinks globally and acts locally” flabbergasted watchers of Indian politics and judiciary. His encomium that Mr. Modi is an “internationally acclaimed visionary” has left us speechless in disbelief. Did the learned judge mean what he said? Did he know the meaning of what he said?

Usually, singing the paeans of praise to a leader is left to his followers. The nature of his job has not deterred Justice Mishra from extolling the incumbent Prime Minister as a ‘versatile genius’. He seems to have been smitten by ‘Modi Worship Syndrome’. The moot question is whether a judge can lavish praise on a leader to an unbounded measure even if he is popular and has a huge cult following and risk being bracketed with sycophants. Modi bhakts abound in our country; they include TV anchors; serving and ex-army officers; yoga gurus; and even Governors. Now, a Supreme Court judge has joined the ‘Modi Fans Club’. In glorifying the Prime Minister in such glowing terms, Justice Mishra has revealed his political and ideological leanings.

We take issue with Justice Mishra because his eulogy goes to show the judiciary in a poor light and inclines us to wonder if it is as independent as we assume it to be. Justice Mishra’s praise does not alter the fact that Narendra Modi is a profoundly polarising figure with a chequered past and a promoter of the interests of privileged upper caste Hindus and corporate behemoths. In school, we learnt that Leonardo da Vinci was a versatile genius; he was a painter, a scientist, a mathematician, an engineer, an architect, a sculptor, a musician, a man of the theatre, a paleontologist, and a lot more, rolled into one. Versatile geniuses hold a lofty place in our imagination. Mr. Modi does not.

371,2020/02/24,Is the Havells Nutri Art Slow Juicer worth its price?,"The Havells Nutri Art Slow Juicer is an excellent product with just one thing missing

The experience of any product begins with the packaging, which, in the case of the Havells Nutri Art Slow Juicer, looks and feels like you have paid ₹26,995 for it. The second step to product engagement is when you read the manual — a painful process that takes you back to school physics text books and toys that had way too many instructions.

Here, unfortunately, is where Havells falters, with its five-page ‘pamphlet’ that just about tells you how to fit one piece of the juicer into the other and warns not to use it for sugarcane. I was left to wonder whether I could use it to make nut and soya mylks, as plant-based milk has come to be spelt. The Havells video ironically, does mention nuts, but because I had a doubt, I reached out to the product team to ask, and they said it wasn’t meant for them. You can do coconut though. I do wish they had a recipe booklet with about 10 juice combos to get people started — they do have some online videos though.

Specifications Speed 70 RPM

Power 200 Watts

Voltage 230 Volts, 1 Phase AC, 50 Hz

As a juicer, the Havells machine looks good in the kitchen, is sturdy, heavy, and feels like it is built to last — the company claims its copper motor enhances durability and extends its life, which is probably why it has a two-year warranty. The solid ceramic auger and the tough plastic body of the feeding tube don’t yield to any fruit or veg — whether apple or cucumber, squeezing through them with quiet, slow ease. That is one promise Havells delivers on — the machine is genuinely low noise, so your sleeping family won’t be roused to green juice. It is only when you put in leaves that it makes a slightly squeaky sound, but it is still not the kind that emanates from several other juicers.

‘Easy to clean’

I tried juicing almost everything, and the only ones that were problematic were amla and Swiss chard — though if you put in one or two pieces of amla this doesn’t happen; I did almost a kilo of just amla. Both have a great deal of fibre that made it difficult to open the machine and clean it without soaking it in water. I did get the juice of both though — again, some other juicers may just stop or the pith may get trapped inside the strainer, causing a jam, but this didn’t happen with the Havells. However, the machine is not great with mushy fruits like banana and strawberry, where you lose a lot of the pith. What is excellent though, is that the feeding tube is large, so you can practically cut an apple into four and put it in and just chuck a whole carrot in, cutting down on time spent in the process. There is also the low, medium, high pulp option.

It is easy to clean, but needs some kitchen space, especially since it is a horizontal structure. If you are elderly, do test whether you can hold and push in the parts though, because they are heavy.

Would I buy the Havells Nutri Art Slow Juicer? It all boils down to the price. I would have, had it been less than ₹20k. At almost ₹27k, it seems like a lot to spend on something that doesn’t give me a complete healthy-drinks package. I’d expect it to make a smoothie, juice, and give me some mylk too. Perhaps, Havells should study the lifestyle of a customer who will invest in a juicer — in all probability it will be someone who buys into an overall healthy lifestyle, and needs one product to fulfil that aspiration.

Would I buy it at ₹14,450 (on Amazon.in)? Yes, in a minute.",fitness,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/kqnudb/article30904485.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25mp-Nurtiart-Juicer,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/is-the-havells-nutri-art-slow-juicer-worth-its-price/article30904486.ece
372,2020/02/24,Are brands fooling us out of exercising?,"Break a sweat. Don’t fall for one-month detox and inner cleansing plans that claims to ‘flush out of toxins’

I often get messages that read somewhat like this: “Weight Loss plan that WORKS! Lose upto 5 Kgs or More. Get...1 MONTH DETOX IN A BOX! Use code DETOX 40 & Get FLAT 40% OFF.” This links to a website where the “celebrity nutritionist” asks if we have “No time for exercise? No time for dietician?” Like the two are basic necessities of life. The product is sold on the basis of “inner cleansing” — not the kind that people go to church for — but the kind that “flushes out toxins”.

Meanwhile, a friend had an ad from her housing colony in Gurugram, which said, in all-capital letters, “Dear member, lose weight without exercising. Is it possible? Learn how intermittent fasting works to change your body from within.” The talk was going to be presented by a person who represented a brand of foods that facilitated weight loss, the website of which declares, “Weight loss plans: No hard work no exercise.”

Both are selling products and services by touching on so many raw nerves: our insecurities about being overweight, our dread of exercise, and our hope that life can (and must) be easier not harder.

My generation — X they call us, like the elusive algebraic letter that never knew its own value — has had it rough. We didn’t have role models who played sport for its enjoyment, with the result that we now have a generation of competitive people who are so busy registering for runs and positioning themselves next to the photographer so they can post a sweaty pic on social media. The corporate world — we were the first generation introduced to MNCs, remember — has linked it to goals, which means we must either look at weight-loss or some sort of landmark (30 marathons in 30 days).

For women, most of our mums didn’t exercise, spending a lot of time in the kitchen (even when they were menstruating, so you know what they’re going to be in their next life, if you believe a particular Swami). As children, many of us girls simply stood on the sidelines of the field feeling awkward in our skirts, hoping the games period would end soon.

It’s no wonder we find exercise boring, scary, tiring. We look terrible in tights, and we’re in awe of the few kitted-out folks running with ease in the park. Better to hide in the house and go with a “detox in a box” or a “subscription menu”.

The truth is, we do need to exercise, but we don’t need to join a gym, run a marathon, swim in the sea. We simply need to walk at least 30 minutes a day, breaking a sweat, in comfortable clothes.

373,2020/02/24,The difference between a listening post and a hammer,"Dialogues, discussions and debates are crucial in a democracy

At ‘The Huddle’, The Hindu Group of Publications’ annual thought conclave, participants invariably convert interactions on the sidelines into open house sessions. They compare how the topics that were discussed at The Huddle were covered by the newspaper in its pages. Some of them thought that the newspaper and The Huddle were a perfect fit as both share the idea of dialogue, debate and discussion. One them said that my definition of my role “where I begin from a position that all complaints are made in good faith and that no journalist comes to work to mislead readers” was limiting. He thought my columns worked well when I found fault with the reporters or the newspaper, but read defensive when they explained journalistic terms and theories. He was delighted with my column, “Journalism in the time of an epidemic” (February 10), and felt let down by the subsequent column, “Strident nationalism and rigorous journalism”(February 17).

Over a cup of coffee, I explained to him that as an internal news ombudsman, I always remember the saying, “To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” Many instances of overreach happen because of this attitude where there is little space for critical evaluation. My job is to critically evaluate complaints using journalistic yardsticks and examine whether or not the newspaper did a fair job of addressing them. It is neither about vindicating the newspaper’s writings nor about rejecting them.

Exchange of views

The session on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) gave me an opportunity to explain the newspaper’s approach to contentious issues. I drew the attention of this reader to a study by Meltwater India that pointed out to the fact that “NDTV, [The] Hindu, Dainik Jagran [are the] biggest drivers for online conversation on CAA”. This study put The Hindu on top in the print category as it led the mScore based on editorial mentions, reach, and tonality for CAA-related stories.

When Yamini Aiyar, President of the Centre for Policy Research, pointed out that the CAA fundamentally upended the Constitution by creating two very distinct pathways of citizenship on the basis of religion, and how problematic it is to decouple the CAA from the proposed National Population Register and National Register of Citizens, as both are intrinsically intertwined, the reader who raised questions earlier acknowledged that there is a clear method in this newspaper’s approach to both reporting as well as debating issues. On the question of citizenship, he was able to see why I mentioned the case of the plantation Tamils of Sri Lanka and their statelessness in an earlier column, “The enemies of writing” (January 27, 2020). It was an exchange of views where a reader who did not agree with the editorial stand on some crucial contentious issues accepted later that there was a clear thinking behind the editorial judgment and that it was not guided by narrow partisan considerations.

Listening to diverse voices

The question of the “other” came up through the discussions. There were two panels in which the theme of “othering” came up for intense scrutiny. The first panel was on the Kashmir conundrum and the second one was on the age of the strongman and the rise of illiberal democracies. The participants realised that there is a need to listen to diverse voices rather seeking confirmation bias. They realised that critical voices against muscular nationalism are the ones that keep the space for plural society intact. The role for the media in this task, despite a lot of external pressures, is immense.

If the newspaper has to remain the site for a democratic mediation of ideas and to hold those in power accountable, the fundamental requirement is empathy. President Ram Nath Kovind said that The Hindu sticks to the five basic principles of journalism: truth-telling, freedom and independence, justice, humaneness, and contributing to the social good. These five pillars are raised on the foundation called empathy.

At the end of the conclave, the reader said that though his heart is with what BJP MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar said about the CAA, and what BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav’s said on Kashmir, he also realised that the opposing viewpoints had some rationale. He said that the government should be open for dialogue rather than implementing decisions without seeking people’s opinions. He said, “Please remain a listening post and never become a hammer.”

374,2020/02/24,The best bowls-to-order in NCR,"Food lovers can now dig into dinner comprising a wide range of bowls from a delivery outlet called World in a Bowl

Nothing whets my appetite more than the sight of a man or a woman — usually in a Hollywood or a Netfilx film — dipping into a carton of noodles with a pair of chopsticks and having a mouthful of what looks like a flavourful meal. The table is not loaded with dishes and you don’t have to politely ask someone to pass the rice. Everything that you need is in that carton. This is life, I tell myself, when your dinner comes ready in a bowl. No mixing, no stretching — all that you have to do is dig in.

Well, we don’t have those cartons, but we sure have meals in a bowl. One of my favourite dishes at The Deck in the India Habitat Centre is its bowl of rice and chicken, with goat cheese and spinach leaves adding to its taste. Every now and then, my heart sings for such meals. It’s just what you need when you want to watch a gruesome thriller on television and have dinner at the same time.

And, thus, to get to the point, I looked up a place called World in a Bowl a few days ago and decided that our dinner was going to comprise different kinds of bowls. We asked for the Kyoto Teriyaki Chicken with Herbed Rice (₹219), Butter Chicken with Jeera Rice (₹269), Aglio Olio Chicken Pasta Bowl (₹275) and Sunny Protein Salad Bowl (₹279).

This is a delivery place with outlets across Delhi (and elsewhere, too). I ordered through Swiggy, and the food arrived within the hour. Each of the dishes was packed in a plastic bowl, with little bowls of sauces on the side. Like the characters in the American series, I dug into my bowl (alas, not with chopsticks) and had a hearty meal.

My pasta — with its trademark garlic-olive-oil-and-red chilli dressing, and topped with some greens — was excellent (even though the pasta was a bit more al dente than the way I like it). The butter chicken lover at home gave her dish full marks, though I must admit that its appearance didn’t appeal to me at all. But I did share the Kyoto Teriyaki — and enjoyed it thoroughly. The rice had been flavoured with fresh cilantro and basil, and the sweet and spicy teriyaki chicken came with garlic sautéed broccoli and cabbage, and scrambled eggs. The chicken was actually juicy, and the flavours had all melded well.

But what I loved the most was the Sunny Protein Bowl. The description on the menu had won my heart: “Robust chickpeas, purple cabbage ribbons, blushing beetroot, broccoli, fennel shaving, fresh spinach topped with a crispy fried egg and tzatziki dressing on the side”. I am not sure if the beetroot was blushing (I did think of relating a racy, Pedro kind of a joke to it), but the veggies and chickpeas — with that double fried egg on top — did make for an awesome salad. We had some of it that evening, and some for breakfast (with boiled eggs) the next morning.

The helpings are large. And I found that the menu has various other interesting dishes (though the menu may vary from outlet to outlet). It has, for instance, Chicken Vietnamese rolls with Glass Noodle Salad (₹249), Fish and Lemon Butter Sauce with Pilaf (₹289), Black Rice with Chicken (₹270), Vegetable Thai Green Curry with Steamed Rice (₹219), Chettinad Chicken with Coconut Rice (₹250) and Stir Fried Tofu with Noodles (₹259). The desserts include Red Velvet Cake in a jar (₹220), Blueberry cheese Cake in a jar (₹220), Belgian Brownie Beauty (₹175), Sunrise Lemon Cake (₹170) and Gluten free Chocolate Cheesecake (₹200).

Quite like the old explorers, I am now going to discover the world. Bowl by bowl.

375,2020/02/24,Japanese drink shōchū comes to Chennai,"Shōchū, distilled from rice, barley and chestnuts, is now available at TASMAC outlets. We try Tan Taka Tan, which tastes like a lime mint cooler on fire

Consuming the most whiskey in all of the world conversely affects Indians’ accrued knowledge of various drinking cultures. It is what Kavitha Saravanan discovered when she pitched the business proposition of importing and marketing the distinctly Japanese drink of shōchū in Chennai to TASMAC officials.

“[TASMAC] wanted to categorise the drink. They asked me if it should be registered under whiskey. When I told them it was a neutral drink, they asked me if it was vodka,” she laughs, adding, “I was at pains to explain to them that shōchū was neither.” She, however, had to comply with TASMAC’s arbitrary classification practice to get her products out.

Kavitha, through her trading firm Shirokin India, is marketing three Shōchū drinks — Den En Gold (priced at ₹ 3,960), Tan Taka Tan (₹ 3,280) and Grand Bleu (₹ 2,900) in select Elite TASMAC outlets in Chennai (Phoenix MarketCity, Forum and VR malls, Parsn Complex in Nungambakkam, Vijaya Nagar in Velachery and Gokul Arcade in Adyar) as well as Brookefields mall in Coimbatore.

At a launch event in Off The Record on Kodambakkam High Road, Kavitha says that she intends to popularise the drink in Chennai as an alternative to hard liquor, courtesy shōchū’s lower ABV (alcohol by volume of 20-25%) measure.

A distilled beverage, shōchū is made from grains like rice and barley; and sweet potatoes. “There are at least 40 different variations of shōchū. It can be distilled from buckwheat, carrots, brown sugar, chestnuts and even sesame,” says Sunil Suresh, general manager, Shirokin India.

It is just one of the similarities that shōchū shares with the more popular Korean-origin drink soju, also a neutral drink that boasts a lower ABV.

Curated menus

Like soju, Kavitha notes that shōchū is best when paired with food, and can be consumed either as a cocktail, neat or on the rocks.

To that end, Shirokin India is negotiating with restobars and hotels in the city to introduce curated menus with dishes than can be specifically had with shōchū cocktails and shots, says K Saravanan, vice president of the trading firm.

Off The Record’s starting platter was an indicator. With chicken and avocado bits held together by the nori to go with wasabi dip, this iteration on a sushi helps “amplify the smell and taste” of the shōchū, Saravanan adds.

While we get to taste all three, it is Tan Taka Tan that trips the sensor in our taste buds. Unlike the other two, Tan Taka Tan is distilled from the beefsteak plant (shiso in Japanese), which Kavitha refers to as the “Japanese basil”.

Delivering a minty flavour and a heady aroma, Tan Taka Tan tastes, essentially, like a lime mint cooler on fire, if that is ever possible.

Den En Gold gives off the oak flavours singular to Scottish single malts while the Grand Bleu has a bit of smoke to it, which settles down in a few minutes, if you let the cocktail in your hand sit for a couple of minutes.

While Den En Gold is manufactured in Kagoshima in Japan, Tan Taka Tan and the Grand Bleu are native to Hokkaido. Though opting to market and distribute it through premium restaurants may have been a more profitable bet for Kavitha, she says that it was her desire to make shōchū “accessible” to people in Tamil Nadu that makes it worthwhile having to go past TASMAC’s iron curtain.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/tm51aq/article30904034.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25MPLAUNCHOFJAPANESEPREMIUMSPIRITS3,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/japanese-drink-shch-comes-to-chennais-tasmac-outlets/article30904035.ece

378,2020/02/24,Shedding light on audiovisual heritage,"German expert to conduct workshop on preserving magnetic audio-video tapes

For decades, our daily lives were recorded on magnetic tapes, whether it is home videos, weddings, birthday parties or television shows. These tapes, almost obsolete in the digital world today, store volumes of personal and social history, and stand at the danger of being lost forever. Focusing on the preservation of these audio and video tapes, Munich-based conservation expert, Andreas Weisser, will conduct a workshop at Goethe-Institut Max Mueller Bhavan on Friday and Saturday.

The workshop will cover the history of audio and video technology (analogue and digital), degradation mechanisms, risk assessment, caretaking of equipment, storage requirements and optimisation of storage facilities, conservation/restoration treatment methodologies and preparation for in-house or external digitalisation projects. “The training is designed for participants with little or basic knowledge in the field of the preservation of audiovisual media,” Mr. Weisser said.

The two-day workshop, organised by Film Heritage Foundation (FHF) in collaboration with the institute, will be free of charge. Describing magnetic tapes as “accessible heritage”, Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, director, FHF, said they are organising this workshop for the first time to “shed light on the much-neglected area of our audiovisual heritage”.

According to Mr. Weisser, u-matic, beta, digi-beta tapes, video and audio cassettes, have been neglected in the field of preservation because they were always cheaper in production and didn’t offer the superior recording quality of film. “So, most premium productions were shot on film, and they are now getting the most attention. But I think this will change someday because the daily life worldwide was recorded on magnetic tape,” the 46-year-old said.

Since 2003, Mr. Weisser has been working as a conservator for time-based media and as a preservation manager for audiovisual collections. His work focusses on the support of public and private collections for analogue and digital long-term preservation and storage of contemporary and time-based media art.

“This may be a trend worldwide, people are becoming more aware of the audiovisual heritage, even of their own family film or video heritage. In Germany, we recently launched a program for film preservation but video and audio is still lacking consciousness,” he said. The workshop in Mumbai, thus, aims to inform where to start with conservation and how to make a long-term preservation plan that suits your needs.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/f647ed/article30898965.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22bm-Andreas-Weisser---Photo2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/shedding-light-on-audiovisual-heritage/article30898966.ece
379,2020/02/24,Three-party panel to look into NPR columns in Maharashtra,"Rollout of loan waiver today: CM

Refuting rumours of a rift in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said a coordination committee of senior leaders of all three parties will discuss the controversial points of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NCR).

Addressing a press conference on the eve of the budget session of the State legislature, Mr. Thackeray also announced that the first list of 20,000 beneficiaries under the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule crop loan waiver scheme will be announced on Monday. Loans up to ₹2 lakh will be waived under the scheme.

Earlier, when asked about the possible disagreements between the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, Mr. Thackeray said a coordination committee of senior leaders of the three parties will be formed to check if controversial columns are included in the NPR survey. “What we are saying is only after discussions with the other two parties,” he said.

When asked about the Centre saying that States have no right to change the columns decided by it, Mr. Thackeray said “but the people of the State have the right to live”. The issue came up as Mr. Thackeray, after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, had said that the CAA will be implemented in Maharashtra. He had also said, “The NPR and census are different. If there are objectionable columns in NPR survey, the government will not go ahead.”

The Congress is opposing the CAA, NPR and NRC.

Criticising the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the violence in States where the party is in power, Mr. Thackeray said there have been protests in Maharashtra, but no violence. “On the contrary, look at Uttar Pradesh or Delhi. The terrorists who beat up students in JNU are still at large. The BJP must check on what is happening in its own backyard,” he said.

When asked about Devendra Fadnavis congratulating him over transferring the probe into the Bhima-Koregaon violence to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), Mr. Thackeray said he had not done any such thing. “The Centre has snatched away the probe from us using special powers. We are not happy at the Centre’s behaviour. The State government wanted to investigate the case by itself,” he said.

On the loan waiver, Mr. Thackeray said banks have submitted a list of 35 lakh accounts that have loans up to ₹2 lakh to the government.

“We have decided to select two villages from each district on a trial basis for the first list, which will be announced on Monday. The trial is to check whether the system set up is working smoothly. The second list will be announced on February 28. We aim to complete the procedure by April-end, unlike the previous government’s farm loan waiver scheme which continued for months and years,” he said.

Finance Minister Ajit Pawar said the money will be deposited directly into the accounts of the farmers. “The 35 lakh accounts will be scrutinised to filter the exact number of beneficiaries,” Mr. Pawar said.

Savarkar barb

Commenting on the issue raised by the BJP of the alleged insult of Hindutva ideologue V.D. Savarkar by the Congress, Mr. Thackeray said the BJP must not consider Savarkar or Hindutva as its own assets.

“When Savarkar’s name was removed from Andaman jail, BJP’s Ram Kapse was the governor and the party did not remove him from the post,” he said, adding that he will answer every question raised in the Assembly.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/b3510b/article30898942.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22UDDAHAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/three-party-panel-to-look-into-npr-columns/article30898943.ece
380,2020/02/24,BMC worries about ranking on Ease of Living Index,"Only 8,000 Mumbaikars have voted for the city so far

Mumbai may have ranked first among mega cities in the Ease of Living Index (EoLI) 2018, but nodal agency Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is worried about its ranking this year as only about 8,000 Mumbaikars have voted so far.

Citizens’ participation has 30% weightage and at least two to five lakh Mumbaikars need to vote in the next four days in order to improve its position. The BMC has also seen poor participation of citizens in the Swachh Survekshan campaign.

Meeting benchmarks

The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs unveiled the EoLI 2019 and the municipal performance index earlier this month to help assess the progress made in cities and empower them to use evidence to plan, implement and monitor their development. Both these indices are designed to assess the quality of life of citizens in 100 smart cities and 14 million-plus cities. The index is an initiative to assess liveability of cities as compared to global and national benchmarks.

The EoLI 2019 will carry out assessment on three pillars: quality of life, economic ability and sustainability, which are further divided into 14 categories across 50 indicators.

For the first time, as part of EoLI, a citizen perception survey is being conducted on behalf of the ministry. The survey opened on February 1 and will end on February 29. Meanwhile, face-to-face interviews are also on. Participating cities have been divided into three categories based on their population.

The citizen participation survey is an important part of the assessment as it will help in capturing the assessment of citizens with respect to the quality of life in their cities. Apart from this, quality of life has 35% weightage, economic ability has 15% and sustainability has 20%.

There are questions covering health, environment, safety, green cover, power supply, infrastructure, transportation, drinking water and sanitation among other things.

As on Sunday, only around 8,000 Mumbaikars had given their feedback.

“At least 2% of the population is expected to give feedback, which means we need two to five lakh people to vote. In a city like Mumbai where people take to Twitter to voice their opinions, we appeal to them to spend two minutes to express this opinion in the survey,” said a senior civic official.

An internet connection is all that is needed to fill out multiple-choice questions, the official said. “We now need one lakh people to vote per day in the next four days but if Mumbaikars decide, they can do it.”

The BMC has submitted the application for EoLI. The results will be announced later this year.

In EoLI 2018, the results of which were announced in September 2018, Mumbai stood first among mega cities and third overall.

Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray has appealed to people to vote.

Doing your bit

Actor Suneil Shetty tweeted, “Everyone has worked very hard to improve our Mumbai city. Such low participation reflects very poorly on the entire city. This survey is beyond BMC, and pertains to Mumbai, and we must do our bit for our city.”

Actor Ajay Devgan had tweeted on Saturday, “Proud to be a Mumbaikar? Unleash your roar and vote for @smartmumbaicity in the #EaseofLiving2019 Visit http://bit.ly/SmartMumbai and vote for Greater Mumbai now! #MyMumbaiMyPride.”

381,2020/02/24,Doctor plugs brain fluid leak through patient’s nose,"ENT surgeon uses biological glue to repair leakage

A piece of bone from the nose, skin from the leg and a biological glue helped doctors repair the leakage of brain fluid in a 20-year-old Kurla resident. Mohammad Arfad Khan had suffered a skull fracture after a fall when he was 10 years old. While the fracture healed over the years, the damaged bone gave way a few months ago and he began experiencing a watery discharge from his nose.

Mr. Khan’s case was diagnosed as a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea, a condition wherein the brain’s protective fluid leaks into the nose and sinuses. Mr. Khan recalls experiencing the discharge since July last year, which he and his family members ignored as an attack of common cold.

When he also began getting headaches, they sought medical help and a consultation with a neurology expert confirmed that cerebrospinal fluid was leaking through the fractured skull bone. “When he had the fall as a child, he had experienced fluid coming through his nose but that had stopped within a few days,” said Mr. Khan’s brother Mohammad Aftab.

Many neurosurgeons Mr. Khan consulted suggested surgery by opening the skull. However, Dr. Sanjay Helale, an ENT surgeon from Kohinoor Hospital, said he could repair the defect through the nose. “We took help of a navigation device to guide us to the point of damage through the nose and carried out the repair with the help of an endoscope,” said Dr. Helale. The two-and-a-half-hour procedure was challenging because the site of the defect was difficult to access. Dr. Helale said the procedure involved borrowing skin from the patient’s leg to plug the defect in the membrane and then taking a 2x2 cm bone from the nose to close the skull defect.

“We used biological glue to hold it all together. During the procedure, we increased the brain pressure to check if our repair remained intact,” said Dr. Helale.

A neurosurgeon was kept on standby. While the surgery was carried out on December 31, Mr. Khan remained at home to recover and avoid pollution that could cause complications. Since last week, he has been driving and helping out with his family’s steel business.

Dr. Helale is preparing to present the case in an ENT conference next month.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/sge91v/article30898909.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24bm-Arfad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/doctor-plugs-brain-fluid-leak-through-patients-nose/article30898910.ece
382,2020/02/24,"Now, cycle away from the Metro station","At Jagruti Nagar Metro station, you can hire bicycles at ₹2 an hour to travel to your destination

At just ₹2 an hour, Mumbaikars can hire bicycles from Jagruti Nagar Metro station to their destinations, thereby reducing the carbon footprint.

Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) Commissioner R.A. Rajeev and Mumbai Metro One president and CEO Abhay Kumar Mishra inaugurated the service at the Metro station on Sunday.

Mr. Rajeev and Mr. Mishra took the first bicycle rides to inaugurate the service that will be provided to commuters in collaboration with a company called MYBYK.

The bicycles, equipped with an in-built GPS location system, will be available at ₹2 per hour and people can avail of multiple daily, weekly and monthly plans.

“It will enable us to provide a clean environment along with end-to-end solutions for public transport. Such projects can become successful only when there is supporting infrastructure. We have to build cycle tracks and remember the pedestrians before constructing roads,” said Mr. Mishra. “It is the ultimate kind of last-mile connectivity that any Metro station will aspire for.”

Mr. Rajeev said all the Metro stations in Mumbai will eventually be bike-friendly. “We will develop all the new Metro stations with multi-modal integration with share taxis, bikes including non-motorised bikes, buses and all other means of transport for parking spaces. People will have easy access to these. We have planned to increase the capacity of public transport to push the number of people utilising it. We will double the capacity of public transport,” he said.

On the complaints about the lack of cycling tracks, Mr. Rajeev asked, when people can travel by their own vehicles even when the roads are not up to the mark, why is riding a bicycle such an issue without a dedicated bicycle track. No mass traffic transport system in the world has been successful in diverting people towards public transport without taking care of the first and last mile, he said.

383,2020/02/24,Goregaon man accuses Ola driver of misconduct,"A Goregaon resident took to social media on Saturday night alleging that an Ola Cabs driver stopped the car to buy alcohol, demanded cash from him though the payment was done digitally, and then drove rashly to a secluded spot after abruptly ending the ride.

Alok Sharma, director and founder of a graphic novel brand, has not filed a police complaint against the driver, Ketan Surve, yet. But he had tagged the Mumbai Police on social media and they have responded to him.

An Ola Cabs spokesperson said the driver has been suspended from the platform until further investigation.

According to Mr. Sharma, the incident occurred around 11 p.m. on Saturday. His fiancée had booked him a ride home from Navi Mumbai. “The driver was stopping many times and at one point, he stopped to buy alcohol. I told him it was fine as far as he did not consume it during the ride,” said Mr. Sharma, adding that thereafter the driver began asking for cash from him.

“I told him the payment had already been made. He insisted I take back the payment and give him in cash. When I refused to do so, he ended the ride somewhere near Trauma Care Hospital in Jogeshwari and began driving rashly on the Western Express Highway,” he said.

Mr. Surve drove him off the highway and stopped the car at a secluded spot between Jogeshwari and Goregaon. “I told him I would call the police, but that did not help. He suddenly took out something wrapped in black cloth from under his seat and walked towards a house. It seemed like a metal stick,” Mr. Sharma said.

Mr. Sharma got out of the car and ran towards the highway when he saw the driver approaching. “I took an autorickshaw home.”

He said if Ola Cabs fails to act against the driver, he will pursue a police case. “Ola has been trying to reach the driver, but his phone has been switched off,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/j4jg1k/article30898844.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24bm-Alok,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/goregaon-man-accuses-ola-driver-of-misconduct/article30898845.ece

A 30-year-old French man who lived in Seawoods was found dead inside the duct attached to the washroom of his apartment on Sunday.

Charly Tastet, who lived on the ninth floor of The Residence society in Sector 46 was found missing by his wife, Tanaya Thakur, when she woke up around 7.30 a.m. She went to look for him, asked the watchman and finally tried calling her husband, only to find his phone in their bedroom. When Ms. Thakur entered the dry area attached to their washroom and peeped into the duct, she found Tastet’s body lying on the podium on the third floor.

386,2020/02/24,Crocodile rescued from Mulund construction site,"Traps had been set up since December; reptile suspected to have reached spot from SGNP

A 6.59-foot-long male crocodile was rescued from a construction site near Yogi Hills in Mulund on Sunday by the Thane forest division.

Volunteers from organisations like Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare (RAWW) and Wildlife Welfare Association (WWA) also helped forest officials rescue the marsh crocodile.

Residents had spotted the reptile in the water accumulated at the defunct construction site several times since November. Traps had been laid to rescue the reptile since December, along with cameras.

“The crocodile got into the trap around 3.30 a.m. on Sunday. The door of the trap cage was closed when we reached around 6.30 a.m. on our daily visit to the construction site. This is an automatic mechanism, wherein the animal puts pressure and the trap door automatically opens,” Aditya Patil, president of WWA, said.

According to Pawan Sharma, founder of RAWW, there was no work happening at the construction site due to a case under way at the National Company Law Tribunal. “Due to a lack of drainage system, the water had started accumulating,” Mr. Sharma said.

The construction site is close to Tulsi Lake in Sanjay Gandhi National Park, and forest officials believe that due to the overflow from the nearby drains in monsoon, the crocodile must have reached there with the current.

“The animal was found fit after medical examination and has been released into the wild,” said Jitendra Ramgaokar, deputy conservator of forest, Thane.

The reptile is around five years old, he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/crocodile-rescued-from-mulund-construction-site/article30898741.ece

390,2020/02/24,Mahila Congress workers protest against LPG price increase,"Narayanasamy urges party cadre to tell people that Centre is responsible for hike

The Congress will intensify its agitation against LPG price hike, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy said on Monday.

Participating in a protest organised by Mahila Congress workers against cooking gas price increase, the Chief Minister said the recent increase by ₹114.5 a cylinder was one of the highest ever. Urging party workers to launch door-to-door campaign against the price increase, he said people should be made aware of the anti-people policies of the Centre. The workers should explain to the people that the territorial administration did not have any role in the price hike, he added.

The Chief Minister said the BJP used to organise protest when the United Progressive Alliance government increased the LPG price even by ₹1 or ₹2. The ruling party was now silent on price increase, he said.

The women workers raised slogans against the Centre and Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi creating hurdles for the Cabinet. Minister for Public Works A.

The police have tightened security ahead of Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu’s visit to the Pondicherry University for the 28th annual convocation on Wednesday.

Around 1,500 police personnel, including those drawn from the Rapid Action Force, would be deployed for security and traffic regulation during Mr. Naidu’s visit.

As per the current schedule, a special Indian Air Force helicopter carrying the Vice-President would land at the airport by around 10 a.m.

Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy, Ministers and senior officials would receive Mr. Naidu. He would then travel by road to the university. After attending the convocation, the Vice-President would return to the helipad to leave for Chennai by noon.

On Monday, the police held a trial run on the route to be taken by the Vice-President.

Taking into account the ongoing protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and fee increase by the university, the police and the university authorities have made special security arrangements on the campus, the police said.

392,2020/02/24,Work on barrage on Kollidam River gains momentum,"The barrage aims at storing nearly 1.02 tmcft of water that usually drains into the sea, which will help recharge the groundwater table in villages in and around Adhanur and Kumaramangalam

The construction of a barrage across the Kollidam River, between Adhanur and Kumaramangalam villages in Cuddalore and Nagapattinam districts, to store flood water, has gained momentum. The construction work, being undertaken at an estimate of ₹494.84 crore, began in May 2019.

The barrage aims at storing nearly 1.02 thousand million cubic feet (tmcft) of water that usually drains into the sea, which in turn will help recharge the groundwater table in villages in and around Adhanur and Kumaramangalam in the two districts besides ensuring stabilisation of the existing Ayacut.

The flood-water harnessed in the barrage will ensure additional supply of water during scarce times to North Rajan channel in Cuddalore and South Rajan channel in Nagapattinam district.

According to A. Kannan, Executive Engineer, Public Works Department (Special Works Division), “About 25 % of work has been completed so far. The barrage comprises of as many as 87 bridge piers that will come up on 19 rafts between the two villages. As far as raising of rafts along the proposed stretch is concerned, the concrete work on the first raft has already been completed. Work on raising four piers on the first raft is now underway. Each pier has a width of four metres,” he said.

The construction of a diaphragm wall is the other major work being undertaken at the project site. It is aimed at preventing seepage of water and arresting the movement of sand in the vicinity of the structure.

Out of the total length of 1,064 metres, the upstream cut off wall and downstream cut off wall have been completed for a length of 284 metres. The PWD has planned to complete a major portion of the work before the monsoon. It has been proposed to construct 19 rafts before July, Mr. Kannan said.

The proposed barrage will have 84 vends with a capacity to discharge 4,55,726 cusecs. The capacity of the barrage is 0.334 tmc and around 1.072 tmc of surplus water is proposed to be harnessed through four fillings of rain and surplus flows in a year, once the structure is completed. The barrage will benefit as many as 5,427 hectares of land each in Cuddalore and Nagapattinam districts.

PWD officials estimate that as many as 307 borewells in 12 villages in the two districts will be recharged, which will help in recharging the ground water table in the surrounding villages. Each bore well is expected to irrigate an average of 14 acres each covering 1129 hectares in Cuddalore district and 657 hectares in Nagapattinam district.

It has also been proposed to construct two new sluices to control the flow of water into the North Rajan and South Rajan channels. The barrage will also have a two-way bridge at an estimate of ₹26 crore connecting Adhanur and Kumaramangalam villages.

The single-lane bridge in Anaikarai is dilapidated and the proposed bridge is expected to ease the traffic flow between the two districts. The banks of the Kollidam River will also be strengthened on both sides of the barrage site. The project is expected to be completed by 2021, a PWD official said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/h5gxlt/article30901582.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24FRBTH--BARRAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/work-on-barrage-on-kollidam-river-gains-momentum/article30901583.ece

394,2020/02/24,Menace of shrill horns continues,"Authorities say private bus drivers defy the ban on fancy horns despite penal action

The indiscriminate use of air horns by private buses and tempos on arterial roads has become a nuisance.

Despite a directive from the Transport Department to the private bus operators to avoid using air horns, there is little compliance on the ground.

Although strict regulations are in place to prevent use of high-decibel horns, residents alleged that concerned efforts have not been made by the traffic police and the Transport Department to check the noise pollution.

One can come across the horns being used with impunity on arterial roads, especially the East Coast Road, Cuddalore Road, Tindivanam Road and Villupuram Road during peak hours.

The continuous use of air horns is not limited to private buses and tempos alone. Buses of the Puducherry Road Transport Corporation (PRTC), tipper lorries, cabs and buses of educational institutions also use high-decibel horns. A section of motorists riding high-end motorcycles use horns with fancy tunes on their vehicles.

An official said that private buses tend to use these horns as part of the race to pick up passengers waiting at bus stops. Bus drivers use loud horns to intimidate drivers of small vehicles, including two-wheelers and cars to provide them with a passage on the roads.

The violation is more rampant at Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi square, Marappalam junction, Moolakulam, Nellithope, Mettupalayam and Gorimedu.

The Union Territory of Puducherry has earned a dubious distinction of having chaotic traffic scenario. The number of two-wheelers appear to be more than the population of Puducherry.

The implementation of the latest Motor Vehicles Act is on a slow pace leading to the traffic snarls, residents alleged.

Meanwhile, air horns used by private buses and two-wheelers adds to the menace of traffic. Senior citizens and children bear the brunt of loud noises at busy thoroughfares. “The pity is such vehicles ply through the points where the traffic police are stationed,” said S. Nadarajan, a senior citizen.

“A strict enforcement of the rules relating to using of horns in the vehicles is an immediate requirement in Puducherry. Flying squads should be set up by the traffic police in sufficient numbers and they should move about in different pockets to bring to focus how closely the police are watching,” he demanded.

A doctor at the Indira Gandhi Government General Hospital and Postgraduate Institute, said that although the area had been declared a “no-honking zone”, private buses and tempos parked in front of the bus stops continue to use them.

According to a Transport Department official, “The permissible sound level for a horn is 80 to 90 decibels. But private buses use horns with a sound level as high as 110 to 130 decibels. This distracts motorists and results in large-scale noise pollution. The air horns are illegally fixed in the buses.”

No deterrent

He said Motor Vehicle Inspectors conduct frequent inspections and seize the equipment from the buses. But they make a comeback. The Transport Department recently booked cases against 20 private buses for using air horns and imposed penalty on them. “However, the bus drivers are not worried and continue to use them as only the registered owners of the vehicles have to pay the fine,” he said.

The Transport Department has written to the Puducherry Pollution Control Committee (PPCC) to take action against vehicles who honk unnecessarily, he said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/var0kw/article30898257.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THPONDYUTMATTERS02,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/menace-of-shrill-horns-continues/article30898258.ece
395,2020/02/24,‘Proper mechanism needed to deal with water crisis’,"Experts speak on Issues Relating to Trans-boundary River Water Sharing in South Asia at Pondicherry University.

South Asia experts, including diplomats and academics, participating in a seminar have called for instituting a mechanism for conflict-free water sharing in the region.

The two-day seminar on “Issues Relating to Trans-boundary River Water Sharing in South Asia” was hosted by UNESCO Madanjeet Institute of South Asian Regional Cooperation (UMISARC)-Centre for South Asian Studies of Pondicherry University.

Mahendra P. Lama, founder Vice-Chancellor of Sikkim Central University and an expert on South Asia, in his inaugural address, dwelt on the role of the United Nations in resolving water security efforts. The challenges with regard to water sharing manifested at three layers- local, national and international, he pointed out.

Prof. Lama also spoke about the various assessment indicators including the water management index to analyse these challenges and accordingly develop a proper mechanism to deal with the issue of the water crisis. He argued that the food security of India is going to be a very critical issue in the country due to shortage of water.

He highlighted how China’s efforts to build more dams on the bank of the Brahmaputra and its efforts to reverse the course of rivers from downwards to upwards can have a serious effect on India, Bangladesh and Bhutan, as they are lower riparian.

Ashok Sajjanhar, former diplomat, emphasised that water was not just for economic growth but for the welfare of the people. He threw light on how despite the water issue having emerged as a global problem, there was still no international binding law in this regard. He also underscored India’s high credentials in resolving water and all other issues with its South Asian neighbours.

Symbol of coexistence

Gurmeet Singh, the Vice-Chancellor of Pondicherry University, said the South Asian region should become a global symbol of peaceful coexistence, resolving all regional and global issues including trans-boundary river water issues.

Air Mashal R.C. Bajpai, D. Purushothaman, the Director of the Conference and Centre Head, UMISARC, P. Moorthy, dean of School of Social Sciences, Pondicherry University and Santhosh Mathew, faculty of South Asian Studies spoke.

Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi led a team from Raj Nivas to inspect tourist projects funded by Centrally-sponsored schemes in and around the city as part of weekend visits.

According to the Lt. Governor, the Centre is fully funding the cost of the infrastructure development of the sites at a cost of ₹200 crore. The eco-tourism site being developed at Arikkamedu is expected to be completed by 2023 and would offer a comprehensive tourist experience.

The development of this site shall provide a unique holistic experience in archaeology, boat ride along mangroves, visits to an art and craft village, a museum and an inter-cultural residential, on-site stay called Franco-Tamil Village.

The lagoon, if well maintained, also acts as an absorber of excess rainwater and becomes a source of circulation of excess water from the sea during heavy rains. The Tourism Department, with its meagre resources, is already promoting school visits to the art and craft village and short boat rides on the lagoon.

The team also visited the ongoing Tourism Promotion Project at Old Distilleries, the construction of a Cultural Complex and Art Digital Museum and Convention Centre at Old Port.

397,2020/02/24,Chakka flyover open to traffic,"The flyover is the longest in the Reach I and Reach II of the NH 66 bypass

Ending years of wait, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on Sunday opened the 1.6-km-long four-lane ₹142-crore Chakka flyover in front of Thiruvananthapuram airport’s international terminal for vehicular traffic.

The NHAI, which had thrown open the two lanes of the flyover from Eenchakkal side towards Kazhakuttam for traffic a few weeks ago, removed barricades on the other two lanes towards Eenchakkal on Sunday allowing movement of vehicles. The move took road users by surprise.

With this, a hassle-free ride awaits the flyers, techies and other road users. A seamless vehicular traffic along the four-laned 26.7-km Reach I of Kazhakuttam-Mukkola corridor of National Highway (NH) 66 bypass that extends upto Karode on Kerala-Tamil Nadu border has also become a reality now.

The flyover is the longest in the Reach I and Reach II of the NH 66 bypass extending from Mukkola to Karode. It commences from near the Railway Overbridge at Chakka and ends at Kingsway Hotel on the busy 3.5-km Chakka-Enchakkal-Muttathara stretch.

Slip road

The NHAI is yet to complete the slip road for vehicles coming from the Kazhakuttam side to exit the flyover before Chakka junction to reach the city and the service road beneath the flyover. “Work is on even at night to complete it within this week. All other works have been completed and the street lights have been charged,” a top official of the NHAI told The Hindu.

Beneficiaries

The flyover will come in handy for those commuting through the Pettah- Chakka-All Saints College-Veli-Shanghumughom corridor and those proceeding to the domestic terminal of the airport, Veli Tourist Village, and Shanghumughom beach.

It has 42 spans each of 25 metre apart and runs parallel to the existing ROB as two-lane flyover for 396 metres.

Later, it gets widened to a four-lane flyover with a width of 19.6 metres.

The work of the flyover was entrusted by the NHAI to the Hyderabad-based KNR Constructions Ltd, the EPC contractor executing the ₹623.41-crore four-laning from Kazhakuttam to Mukkola, on the Balaramapuram-Vizhinjam road that is almost over.

“The NHAI will be informed of the completion of the work. It is for the MoRTH to take a call on the formal inauguration of the Reach I of the bypass and the flyover,” the NHAI official added.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/4iitcm/article30898379.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24TVTVCHAKKAFLYOVER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/chakka-flyover-open-to-traffic/article30898380.ece
398,2020/02/24,Vattiyurkavu development plans to take off finally,"PWD Minister set to lay stones for project on March 5

For the residents of Vattiyurkavu, the development of the perpetually clogged junction have long remained an unfulfilled promise.

Now, for the first time, works for changing the face of the junction are finally taking off, with the Public Works Minister set to lay stones for the project on March 5.

Facilities

In addition to widening the junction and construction of amenities including bus bay, toilet blocks, and a building to rehabilitate traders who will have to part with their land, the project is aimed at widening all the four major roads that converge at the Vattiyurkavu junction.

These roads include the Mannarakonam-Peroorkada road, Thoppumukku-Vattiyurkavu road, Sasthamangalam–Mannarakonam road, and Mannarakonam-Vazhayila road, measuring in total to close to 50 kilometres.

The land acquisition process, which will begin next month, is expected to take at least six months.

Since the development of the junction has been a major demand of the residents here for quite a long time, the government is hoping that the resistance to acquisition would be less.

Protest

The residents had last year, under the aegis of the Vattiyurkavu Development Action Council, staged a protest lasting several days demanding development of the junction.

“Our plan is to develop each of the four roads converging at the junction at a width of 18.5 metres each. Near the junction, we also have to acquire land for constructing the bus bay, park and toilet facilities. The Thiruvananthapuram Development Authority (TRIDA) has already identified 3.5 acres of land for the construction of a building to rehabilitate the traders who will have to move out of their shops. At a recent meeting of the KIIFB director board, an amount of ₹27 crore was allocated for this, in addition to the ₹220-crore allocation for the junction development,” said V.K. Prashant, MLA.

Institutions including the village office and the Vattiyurkavu police station might have to be shifted as part of the junction development.

Once the land acquisition is over, a detailed project report will be prepared.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/vattiyurkavu-development-plans-to-take-off-finally/article30898377.ece

401,2020/02/24,Sick MSME units in Tiruchi seek rehabilitation package,"Submit a representation to Union Minister Nitin Gadkari

The BHEL Small Scale Industries Association (BHELSIA) and Tamil Nadu Boilers Association have placed a charter demands to the Union government seeking a rehabilitation scheme and various concessions to the sick fabrication units in Tiruchi.

Drawing the attention of the Centre to the critical situation faced by the fabrication units due to recession over the past four years, Rajappa Rajkumar, president, BHELSIA, submitted a representation to the Union Minister for MSME Nitin Gadkari recently, seeking an effective rehabilitation package for the revival of the units.

Mr. Rajkumar said that the sick MSME units could not pay the Goods and Services Tax and Provident Fund contributions due to non-receipt of payments from their customers.

“The GST registration of the defaulting units should not be cancelled and they should be allowed to pay the arrears in instalments,” Mr.Rajkumar demanded. This, he said, was essential to help the units continue their business.

Similarly, the sick units should be allowed to pay the arrears in PF contributions in easy instalments along with their current payments without additional interest of penalty.

Seeking changes in the procurement policy of public sector undertakings especially BHEL, Mr. Rajappa contended that the present policy and the tendering process framed were against the interest of the MSME units. “We have submitted various suggestions and the Minister has assured to send his recommendations to Heavy Industries Ministry and BHEL,” Mr. Rajkumar said.

A rehabilitation programme has to be sanctioned for units under stress and those which have turned non performing assets due to the general recession over the past four years. “Until such a viable programme is implemented, all the legal process has to be stopped,” Mr. Rajkumar said and added that he was given to understand that the MSME and Finance Ministries were preparing a proposal based on the association suggestions and it is likely to be sent to the Cabinet for approval soon.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/rr444c/article30906223.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY25UNITTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/sick-msme-units-in-tiruchi-seek-rehabilitation-package/article30906224.ece

Pointing out the sudden emergence of weekly shandies at Geethapuram on Thursdays and on Theppakula Street on Mondays, Mr. Govindaraj said that an individual had been organising the shandies without any permission from the Corporation.

Poor sales

Since the start of the unregulated weekly shandies, the sale of vegetables and fruits for the traders of East Adayavalanjan Street was severely hit.

They had been suffering huge loss.

Most of the pavement traders have been paying rent to the Corporation.

Unable to bear the loss, the traders submitted a petition to the Assistant Commissioner of Srirangam on December 26 and the Collector on February 10, demanding action against the unregulated weekly market. But, no action has been taken on the petitions, Mr. Govindaraj said.

A good number of guest lecturers have completed their doctorate degree and even cleared the National Eligibility Test of the UGC for lectureship.

The huge disparity between guest lecturers and the regular faculty is what saps their morale.

The minimum monthly salary of a regular faculty is ₹80,000 as against the measly ₹15,000 for a guest lecturer.

Espousing the case of the guest lecturers in the government colleges and constituent units of universities, the Association of University Teachers (AUT) and the Tamil Nadu Government College Teachers' Association (TNGCTA) have been reminding the government of the latest guidelines of the University Grants Commission for hiking the honorarium of guest faculty, but to no avail.

Consequent upon implementation of the recommendations of Seventh Pay Commission, the honorarium for guest faculty should be enhanced to ₹ 1,500 per lecture subject to a maximum of ₹ 50,000 per month.

Having introduced new programmes, most of the government colleges are entirely dependent on the guest faculties for handling them.

This is the state of affairs in almost all the government colleges in rural parts, a functionary of Tamil Nadu Government College Teachers' Association said.

“In fact, the start of new programmes without determining availability of faculty is a proverbial case of putting the cart before the horse.

For a State that prides itself of having the highest gross enrolment ratio in higher education in the country, it would be prudent to infuse quality as well into higher education for which a reasonable salary for the guest lecturers is a must,” a principal said.

The UGC could, in fact, play a role to make that happen by issuing a circular that the recognition for courses will be cancelled if the specified salaries are not paid to guest lecturers, the college head said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/principals-desire-reasonable-hike-in-salary-for-guest-lecturers/article30906182.ece

406,2020/02/24,On a solo mission to save agriculture,"A 26-year-old youth, on a solo bicycle expedition to “save agriculture” arrived in Tiruchi on Monday.

Miffed over the indiscriminate conversion of agricultural lands into housing plots, T. Balamurugan of Vadakkipatti near Mannachanallur in Tiruchi district, a mason, began the expedition in Kanniyakumari on February 18. The youth, who grew up in Mannachanallur, had been upset on seeing the large scale conversion of agricultural fields into plots by real estate promoters in Mannachanallur, Bikshandarkoil and Samayapuram in Tiruchi district.

He was toying with the idea of going on a State-level bicycle expedition for some time to create awareness among the people, officials and other stakeholders.

Mr. Balamurugan started his campaign at Kanniyakumari on February 17 after buying a bicycle for ₹1,250. He then fixed a national flag and a few boards on the bicycle bearing slogans on “Save Agriculture”. He began the expedition on February 18 from the bus stand in Kanniyakumari.

He pedals for about 80 km a day. He sleeps in the bus shelters en route in the nights. At villages and towns, Mr.Balamurugan stops his bicycles and distributes pamphlets to the people on the need to save agriculture. He invariably speaks to the people on the danger of indiscriminate conversion of lands into plots.

After covering nearly 400 km via Tirunelveli, Virudhunagar, Sivaganga and Madurai districts, Mr. Balamurugan arrived at his home district on Monday. He presented a petition at the weekly grievance day meet, seeking the intervention of the government to come out with an elaborate and efficient mechanism to check conversion of agricultural lands.

“I have seen conversion of more than 5,000 acres of well irrigated paddy fields into plots in Mannachanallur alone. Just imagine the extent of converted lands in the State. If it is unchecked, the country will face acute shortage of foodgrains in the future, Mr. Balamurugan warns.

He says that his campaign has got a good reception in villages. Besides listening to him, people offer him buttermilk, coffee and cool drinks. But, no one bothers to listen to him in towns, Mr. Balamurugan laments. He plans to reach Chennai on Friday.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/9hazja/article30906160.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY25BALAMURUGANTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/on-a-solo-mission-to-save-agriculture/article30906161.ece
407,2020/02/24,Police map out ‘hot spots’,"This is to check recurring instances of crime against women and children

Amid recurring instances of crime against women and children in Tiruchi Range encompassing five districts, the police have identified potential “hot spots” based on detailed analysis of offences reported over the past five years.

Consequent to identification of the “hot spots”, field -level police personnel attached to the All Women Police Stations (AWPS) in the Tiruchi Range have been instructed to periodically visit such places and interact with public to ascertain from them if there were any unreported cases and threats to victims, if any, besides creating awareness among the community on a host of aspects.

The law enforcers have made a detailed analysis of data relating to crime against women and children reported to the police during the last five years from 2015 to 2019 in Tiruchi Range comprising of Tiruchi Rural, Ariyalur, Perambalur, Pudukottai and Karur districts.

The data pertaining to such cases taken up for detailed analysis were split into three categories: POCSO Act (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences), Rape and Domestic Violence against Women.

Based on the five-year data, the police carried out mapping of the five districts to eventually zero-in on the potential “hot spots” where crimes against women and children were found to be more and frequent, says the Deputy Inspector General of Police, Tiruchi Range V. Balakrishnan.

Having conducted the exercise, field-level personnel of the All Women Police Station (AWPS) have been visiting such “hot spot” places and even schools once a week to interact with public and students to ascertain from them safety of women and children in the respective places.

The visit was also being made use of to create awareness among them on a host of aspects including POCSO Act and the social evil of child marriage besides also to find out about any such unreported offences. The field-level officials would also ascertain if there was any threat to victim and whether protection was required, Mr. Balakrishnan said.

An interaction with the newly elected village panchayat presidents from the identified “hot spot” areas was held in Tiruchi recently and it was convened by Mr.Balakrishnan during which they were explained about the POCSO Act, domestic violence against women among others. They were also told to keep the law enforcers informed in case they came across such offences.

The initiative has been put in place to devise policing strategies accordingly especially in the “hot spots” with the larger objective of curbing crime against women and children.

Police statistics reveal that the number of POCSO cases booked in various AWPS in the five districts in Tiruchi Range was over 700 from 2013 till date. Mr.Balakrishnan said as a deterrent measure 35 accused involved in POCSO Act cases had been detained under the Goondas Act from 2013 onwards.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/6c9unt/article30906143.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY25PUBLICTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/police-map-out-hot-spots/article30906144.ece

Usually, a new examination centre is sanctioned if the student strength exceeds 100.

Earlier, the Parent-Teacher Associations used to lobby with the School Education Department for securing the examination centre status.

In recent years, the recommendations of the Chief Educational Officers are being accepted by the government to increase the number of centres.

The only requirements are that the school must have the specified student strength and the requisite infrastructure, Chief Educational Officer of Tiruchi district S. Shanthi said.

409,2020/02/24,Farmers in Tiruchi stage protest by rolling in front of Tiruchi Collector’s office,"The farmers are demanding that Tiruchi district be included in the protected agricultural zone of Tamil Nadu

A group of farmers owing allegiance to the Tamil Nadu Tank and River Irrigated Areas Farmers Association, staged a novel protest on Monday, by rolling down in front of the Collector Office, calling upon the State government to include Tiruchi district in the protected agricultural zone.

As a symbolic form of expressing their dismay to the government’s decision to exclude the district, the farmers, who sported ‘namams’ on their forehead, rolled on the road watched by a large number of petitioners, who thronged the Collector’s Office to represent their grievances at the weekly Grievance Day meet.

Led by P. Viswanathan, president of the association, the farmers raised slogans, demanding that the Chief Minister include Tiuchi district in the protected agricultural zone, a Bill of which was introduced recently.

Revenue and police officials held talks with the farmers. Later, they met Collector S. Sivarasu and presented a petition. He in turn promised to take up the issue with the State government.

Mr. Viswanathan pointed out that in Salem Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had announced that Tiruchi and Ariyalur districts would also form part of the protected special agricultural zone along with Thanjavur, Nagappattinam and Tiruvarur. But, Tiruchi and Ariyalur districts had been left out in the Tamil Nadu Protected Agricultural Zone Development Act.

This had hurt the people of Tiruchi district. Agriculture was the lifeline of the district. While padddy was raised on about 1.5 lakh acres in the district, sugarcane and banana are raised on about 1 lakh acres. Omission of the district from the zone would mean giving a green signal for the Centre to start oil and gas exploration projects here. Hence, the State government should come forward to include Tiruchi district in the zone, he demanded.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/oo44ri/article30902188.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24FEBTH--Protestjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/farmers-in-tiruchi-stage-protest-by-rolling-in-front-of-tiruchi-collectors-office/article30902189.ece
410,2020/02/24,Madras Flying Club teams up with city college to offer aviation courses,"Aviation and aircraft maintenance, pilot training and airport ground handling are among the courses that will be on offer at Bishop Heber College

The Madras Flying Club, which has shifted its operations from Chennai to the Tiruchi International Airport, is set to offer a host of aviation-related degree and diploma courses from this year in association with the Bishop Heber College in Tiruchi. A Memorandum of Agreement was signed between the college and the Madras Flying Club Aviation Academy on Monday.

The agreement was exchanged between the Flying Club honorary secretary Capt. Jacob Selvaraj and the CSI Bishop of Tiruchi and Thanjavur Diocese Rt. Rev. D. Chandrasekaran who is also the chairman and secretary of the Bishop Heber College Governing Board.

An Aero Lab is proposed to be established at the college under this tie-up, which would be equipped with aero engines and other aviation-related equipment to be supplied by the 90-year-old prestigious Flying Club.

The courses would begin in June upon obtaining a formal approval from the Bharathidasan University which will award the degree and diploma certificates.

The Flying Club plans to offer three-year B.Sc. courses separately in Aviation and Aircraft Maintenance; postgraduate diploma in Airline Operations; a six-month Pilot Training course and a one-year diploma courses for Assistant Flight Dispatchers, Air Hostesses and Airport Ground Handling, besides a six-month certificate course for Customer Service Agents.

The Flying Club has prepared the syllabus for the academic programmes and would deploy its team of 20 highly-qualified faculty members to handle theoretical classes at the Bishop Heber College, Capt. Jacob Selvaraj told The Hindu.

The college would provide the necessary infrastructure and academic support for the programmes, its Principal D. Paul Dhayabaran said.

The practical sessions for the Pilot Training course would be organised at the Tiruchi international airport where the Flying Club has been provided with separate space for its functioning.

Capt. Selvaraj said the Club had plans to move two of the six single-engine aircraft in its possession to the Tiruchi airport for conducting the academic courses in Tiruchi. As part of the tie-up, certain subjects including English language paper, Radio Aids, Environment Studies, Radio Telephony-Theory and AC instruments, would be taken by Bishop Heber College.

The courses have been designed to enable students to take up professional careers in various areas in the aviation field including aircraft operations, aircraft maintenance, ground operations, cargo management and air hostessing, said Capt. Selvaraj.

The Flying Club, which is registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act, 1975 is recognised by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, New Delhi.

411,2020/02/24,Residents allege ‘stepmotherly’ treatment,"Despite paying taxes for years, we find roads in K. K. Nagar area in a sorry state’

Residents of localities in K. K. Nagar area complain that despite paying taxes for years, the roads remain in a sorry state. Alleging apathy by the civic body they say that though they have submitted several petitions to the authorities, the issue has remain unaddressed for long.

A common grouse of the residents is that arterial roads in select wards are being given undue preference in the allocation of funds for road improvement. “K. K. Nagar is as posh as Thillai Nagar. It has impressive buildings and posh residences. However, the roads are in a terrible state”, M. Balan, a resident of Thendral Nagar lamented.

Several of the roads in the area are in deplorable condition with pits, potholes and craters.

“The situation only worsens during rainy months. The residents suffer when it rains as one cannot judge the depth of the potholes. Several two-wheeler riders fall, sometimes with children. It has become a common practice for the authorities to take notice only when some major accident occurs”, Mr. Balan said.

Another resident of Anbil Nagar, said that the civic body, which was focussed on re-laying roads in the Cantonment area ought to accord as much importance to roads in the other wards. “Residents in that area enjoy the facilities while we are neglected”, he said. “We approached the Tiruchi Corporation several times but they are unresponsive”, he added.

The ‘stepmotherly treatment’ by the civic body is not new to the residents, said S. Ranjith, a student residing in the area.

“All facilities reach the area last. We got a bus stand only recently. The K. K. Nagar main road is being widened but the streets, where several schools and colleges function, are full of potholes,” he said.

Officials of the civic body said that they have begun work on laying roads across the city.

“The work is being done in a phased manner. Roads in K. K. Nagar will also be laid soon,” an official said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/bitwtw/article30900188.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY24BADTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/residents-allege-stepmotherly-treatment/article30900190.ece
412,2020/02/24,Covid-19 takes a toll on electronic products’ sale,"With falling imports and rising prices traders are a worried lot

With the stocks dwindling and prices rising by the day, traders of electronic goods in the city are worried over their businesses that are heavily dependent on imports from Covid 19-hit China.

The coronavirus epidemic has impacted the retail and wholesale trade of electronic goods across the country and the city is no exception as the traders here source their products from Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and other port cities.

“The dealers who import electronic goods have hiked the prices of many products by 50% citing fall in exports from China since the outbreak of the virus. We are being asked to pay for an LCD screen, worth ₹1,000 a month ago, ₹1,500 now at Mumbai. We will not be able to sell them at this price,” said Sayyapreddy Nagaraju, a dealer of LCD screens, sound systems and other products at NTR Complex.

Many other traders who sell electronic products including mobile accessories, TVs, audio systems and computer peripherals are facing a similar situation.

Several blows

Amaravati Digital Electronics Dealers Welfare Association (ADEDWA) treasurer Sivalinga Prasad said that continuation of this situation for another couple of months or more would take a heavy toll on their businesses. “The electronic goods trade was badly hit by a series of issues since demonetisation and this (Covid-19 outbreak) is the latest to trouble us,” he said.

ADEDWA vice-president P. Venugopal said that they were caught in a fix as they were heavily dependent on imported products supplied by nationwide dealers. “We cannot trust business-to-business e-commerce websites to get products directly from China as the quality of the products and their delivery are uncertain,” he added.

414,2020/02/24,NRDC chairman laments A.P.’s poor record in filing patents,"He calls for efforts to spread innovation culture in State

The number of patent applications being filed from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana is slowly increasing, but there is still a lot to be done to develop a culture of innovation in the two Telugu-speaking States, National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) Chairman and Managing Director H. Purushotham said.

On the sidelines of a programme on Intellectual Property Rights protection held here recently, Mr. Purushotham said while 900 to 1,000 patent applications were being received from Telangana in a year, the number ranged between 300 and 400 for A.P. He predicted a bright future for Andhra Pradesh in the future with Visakhapatnam being made the Executive capital of the State.

“Telangana has the advantage of being home to several R&D labs. Visakhapatnam, being a cosmopolitan city with a robust industrial base, also has a bright future,” Mr. Purushotham said.

‘Lack of awareness’

Stating that there is a lack of awareness in the country to file patents, he said in a vast country like India, only around 50,000 patents were being filed in a year, of which almost 80% are filed by multinational corporations. India has a huge market for exclusive rights, Mr. Purushotham said.

In India, the highest number of patents numbering 3,000 to 4,000 are being filed from Maharashtra and Karnataka in a year. In comparison, China files 15 lakh patents a year while the 7.75 lakh patents are filed in the United States a year.

India ranks 52 on the global innovation index, and is expected to improve its ranking this year, Mr. Purushotham said.

He said that identification of problems with a viable solution is key to a successful startup, and called for developing an ideal ecosystem to encourage the out-of-the box ideas and innovation culture among the students in the State.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/nrdc-chairman-laments-aps-poor-record-in-filing-patents/article30898571.ece

Bank employees across the country will go on a three-day strike to press a list of demands including wage revision among from March 11, Sanjeev Kumar Bandlish, convener of United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) and general secretary of All India SBI Staff Federation, has said, adding that an indefinite strike will be launched on April 1 if the negotiations with the Indian Banks Association (IBA) fail.

Addressing the media here on Sunday, Mr. Bandlish said that negotiations with the IBA on the wage revision were on and it would continue till March 5. The main demands of the employees included wage revision settled at 20% hike on pay slip components, 5-day banking, updating pension and improvement in family pension.

The UFBU observed a two-day strike on January 31 and February 1 on the same issues. The Chief Labour Commissioner had asked the IBA to negotiate with the unions.

Negotiations on

“The IBA is reluctant to consider the main demands. After mutual consultation with constituent union representatives, it was conveyed to the IBA that if the wage revision settlement offer was improved from 12.5 % to 15 %, the remaining issues could be sorted out through further negotiations,” said Mr. Bandlish, adding that the IBA regretted its inability to improve the offer and hence the UFBU decided to go ahead with the strike.

416,2020/02/24,‘TDP leaders are scared of SIT probe into land scam’,"YSRCP leader makes light of Opposition’s allegations of ‘political vendetta’

The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leaders are terming as ‘vindictive’ the decision of the State government to order a probe by Special Investigation Team (SIT) and other teams into the alleged land irregularities reported between 2014 and 2019 due to fear of getting jailed, YSR Congress Party leader Koyya Prasad Reddy said here on Sunday.

“No guilty will be spared. It was the TDP leaders who had dared the YSRCP government to probe into the alleged irregularities. When the government constituted SIT to probe into the alleged insider trading in Amaravati, the TDP leaders are terming it as a political vendetta,” Mr. Redddy told the media here.

He alleged that many TDP leaders had indulged in several corrupt deals during the land pooling exercise undertaken for construction of the capital at Amaravati.

ESI scam

Referring to the ESI scam, the YSRCP leader accused TDP leader and former Minister K. Atchannaidu of issuing a letter recommending a private firm for supply of inferior quality medical kits at a higher price.

It may be noted that the officials of the Vigilance and Enforcement (V&E), who raided the hospitals and dispensaries, found that the alleged involvement of Directors of Insurance Medical Services (DIMS), joint directors, civil surgeons, administrative officers, pharmacists and clerical staff in procurement of drugs worth about ₹975.80 crore in the last five years allegedly in violation of the rules.

Mr. Reddy rubbished the claim of Mr. Atchannaidu that he had just followed the directive of the Centre and tried to follow the implementation method adopted in Telangana.

Land Pooling Scheme

Mr. Reddy came down heavily on TDP leader Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy for his claim that the State government was forcibly acquiring assigned land under the land pooling scheme for building houses to the poor. “Collector V. Vinay Chand has already denied the allegations with facts and figures,” the YSRCP said.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/mkont/article30898532.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24VZ3SENIORYSRCONGRESSPARTYLEADERKOYYAPRASADREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/tdp-leaders-are-scared-of-sit-probe-into-land-scam/article30898533.ece
417,2020/02/24,Fishermen sensitised on use of turtle excluder device in trawlers,"Experts conduct training session, allay apprehensions over loss of catch

A demonstration-cum-training programme on turtle excluder device (TED) for fishermen was conducted by ICAR-Central Institute of Fisheries Technology on board a fishing trawler near Visakhapatnam recently.

The programme was conducted in collaboration with the WWF-India, Andhra Pradesh Mechanised Boat Owners’ Association and Forest Department.

Fifteen fishermen were given hands-on training at sea on installation and operation of the TED.

Installation cost

TEDs are devices that allow escaping of turtles from the fishing nets without resulting in significant loss of shrimp and other catch. The indigenous design of TED was developed at the ICAR-CIFT, with a focus on reducing catch loss, which has been a cause of concern for trawler fishermen in adopting the device.

It can be fabricated and installed with minimum training at the local workshop and net making skills at a cost of about ₹7,000. The programme was conducted as part of the ICAR-CIFT project titled ‘enhancing awareness among stakeholders of trawl systems in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha through capacity building’ on the use of CIFT-TED for sea turtle conservation funded by the WWF -India.

R. Raghu Prakash, Principal Scientist and in-charge of Visakhapatnam Centre of ICAR-CIFTsaid the hands-on training programme would clear fishermen’s misconceptions over catch loss associated with the TEDs.

Sea turtles are endangered species, which are protected under the Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act.

They are also protected under international conventions such as Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES 1973). Sea turtles are listed as critically endangered species on the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red list.

418,2020/02/24,Nigerian 419 scam spreads its tentacles in city,"While 14 cases were reported in 2018, the number shot up to 42 in 2019, say police

On January 29, four Nigerians were arrested by the cybercrime police in the city for allegedly duping a person to the tune of ₹ 6.62 lakh on the pretext of running an online charity.

The victim, named Sanjay Singh, reportedly got a text message from a person named Aisha, who claimed to be living in the United Kingdom. The sender said in the message that they wanted to transfer an amount of $5.5 million (₹39 crore) to Mr. Singh in order to be distributed as charity among the poor. The sender said that in order for the money to be transferred, Mr. Singh would have to pay them an initial ‘processing fee’ of ₹6.62 lakh.

Mr. Singh fell for the scam, and ended up transferring ₹6.62 lakh to the accused’s bank account in 12 instalments.

Advance fee fraud

Such scams are not new, as they began surfacing in the early 2000s. However, even as the modus operandi of such scams is common knowledge, gullible people still fall prey to fraudsters and end up parting with large sums of money believing that they will get a fortune in return, say police officials.

Apart from Sanjay, there are several individuals in the city who have been defrauded in such scams. Such cases are classified under the Nigerian 419 scam, also known as the ‘advance fee fraud’, and despite awareness, such cases are rising in the city.

According to statistics from the cybercrime police, the city has reported 42 cases in 2019, up from 14 in 2018.

In 2019, the city reported about 365 cybercrime cases in which nearly ₹5.51 crore was lost. Police said that after online marketing frauds, website/e-mail hackings, Nigerian frauds lead the list of scams in the city. Of the total money lost in 2019, almost 25% was due to Nigerian frauds.

Explaining the modus operandi of the scamsters, cybercrime police station SI N. Ravi Kumar said that the fraudsters send emails or messages to people congratulating them on winning a lottery, or tell them that they are the recipients of a charity donation. Some claim to offer employment while others evince interest in a matrimonial alliance.

“The fraudsters send out bulk text messages, emails and social media messages. They lure the gullible victims with astronomical sums of money. Once the victim takes the bait and responds to the message or the email, the fraudsters begin a long process of convincing the victim about their genuineness. Once the victim is convinced, the fraudsters try to extract money on the pretext of paying customs fees, processing fees and taxes. The victim thinks that he or she is paying only a fraction of the promised sum, and ends up paying lakhs to the fraudsters,” the SI said.

‘Making arrests difficult’

In 2019, 90 persons were arrested by the cybercrime police in 63 cases. Among the arrested persons were just two Nigerians.

According to cybercrime inspector V. Gopinath, the Nigerian fraudsters hire middlemen who handle the communications. “Even bank accounts and the mobile phone SIM cards do not belong to the Nigerians. They might be fake or taken from someone on a commission basis. They may be based in India or at times even operating from abroad through a middleman,” Mr. Gopinath said.

“Even though we nab these middlemen, the details of the main fraudsters are not known. The fraudsters meet the middlemen at metro stations, flyovers and other public places. They do not reveal their real names and addresses to them,” he said.

Social media

Mr. Gopinath said that during investigation in several Nigerian fraud cases, they found that the accused use Facebook as a major medium to approach people. He said that people must be alert if any unknown person befriends them on social media claiming to be an NRI. “When we checked the laptops of these fraudsters, they have a number of pictures stolen from social media websites, through which they create fake profiles. If any person asks these fraudsters to send their pictures in order to verify their authenticity, these fraudsters immediately send them these pictures after which the victims are convinced that these persons are genuine,” the SI said.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/fulqq4/article30898411.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23-vz-cyber-crimecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/nigerian-419-scam-spreads-its-tentacles-in-city/article30898412.ece
419,2020/02/24,A personal yet engaging act that evoked empathetic smile,"There were phases in Papa CJ’s stand-up act, which concluded The Huddle on Sunday, that evoked an empathetic smile from the audience as opposed to shrieks of laughter.

In these bittersweet interludes that punctuated guffaws, the comedian recounted his heartbreak, read out a poem he wrote about his beloved, narrated his life’s biggest slump — when he was clinically depressed — and the rise after — when he became a stand-up comedian and rechristened himself, Papa CJ.

The name itself is a matter of intrigue. When the comedian let his audience ask him questions, the first one was “What is your actual name?”

“You can find the answer if you buy my book,” he replied with an impish grin. The book, Naked (by Westland), is an autobiographical account that traverses through the streets of Kolkata, stages of Edinburgh, and many bizarre episodes (like performing at gunpoint in South Africa).

Papa CJ’s act, for the most part, was deeply personal yet relatable and engaging. When he spoke about how an 80-year-old, bed-ridden lady sent him pictures of her smiling every day as ‘fees’ for his pro bono performance for her, the audience collectively exclaimed ‘aww’.

All this isn’t to suggest that he was just making many handkerchiefs wet throughout the evening. The laughs, of course, burst like firecrackers on a festival. And, there were jibes at the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Kunal Kamra’s flight ban and Donald Trump among other things. But what stood out in the stand-up act were the aforementioned moments that caused one to smile amidst bouts of laughter.",the huddle,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/mc8ek1/article30896993.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24PAPA,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/a-personal-yet-engaging-act-that-evoked-empathetic-smile/article30896994.ece
420,2020/02/24,Chennai-based international beauty chain Naturals turns 20,"As Naturals salon turns 20, founding couple Veena and Kumaravel discuss expanding their Chennai-based, pan-India brand overseas

When they launched their first beauty parlour Naturals in 2000, founders Veena and Kumaravel did not foresee that their brand would grow by leap and bounds, with close to 650 salons in India and overseas. “When we ventured into this business, it was considered a taboo industry. Honestly, we did not expect such exponential growth in this segment, and I had no plans to go beyond eight or 10 branches within Chennai. The market grew, thanks to the IT industry that was booming. Grooming gained prominence among IT and corporate employees. From occasional visits to parlours, we had youngsters who visited regularly,” says Veena Kumaravel, founder of Naturals, which celebrated its 20th anniversary recently.

The salon chain adopted the franchise model in 2006, and now has about 650 outlets in India. They plan to make it 700 by the end of the year and then aggressively expand to 3,000 by the time they are ready to celebrate their silver jubilee. “We have expanded our operations overseas as well, beginning in Sri Lanka and later in Malaysia and Dubai. We are now entering into a joint venture with Kerala Ayurveda and launching Naturals Ayur (Ayurvedic beauty and grooming) on the occasion of our 20th year,” she says. Such a collaboration enables the launch of Naturals Ayur in Europe, the UK and the US, as the element of Ayurvedic beauty and wellness has a lot of appeal in the West, says Veena.

The strong point and core value of the brand, says Kumaravel, is their unrelenting focus on empowering women. “Transforming homemakers into successful entrepreneurs and job providers has been our mission over these years,” he says. “And our franchise model was a tremendous success because of our centralised training facility that we had established on the outskirts of Chennai, where we train new recruits and upgrade our staff,” Veena says.

The salon chain, that started off as a women-only parlour, transformed into a unisex parlour in 2005. “We realised families preferred to come and spend time together in the parlours and we were quick to track this trend,” says Veena.

To mark their 20th year, the founders have launched a beauty and wellness college. Courses will be in accordance with the curriculum of the Beauty and Wellness Sector Skill Council (BWSSC) under the Government of India. “In our country, training in beauty and wellness was possible only by way of apprenticeship. By streamlining the curriculum and training, we are aiming at training beauty professionals from all walks of life. Such qualifications in beauty and wellness will soon be seen as being as valuable as any professional degree. Training centres will be established across the country in order to create career avenues for the youth,” Kumaravel says.

Veena says her company has taken quality and professionally-run beauty parlours to second and third-tier towns in India, and creating employment opportunities for women and youth from small towns. “Empowerment through employment has always been one of our core values. We now add education to the picture, and are excited about equipping people from all over India with the skills and experience of an international standard,” she says.

Adds Kumaravel, “In 20 years, we have seen a huge transformation. We have evolved into a lifestyle industry.”",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/cp0c14/article30904011.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPNaturalsAyur003JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/chennai-based-international-beauty-chain-naturals-turns-20/article30904012.ece
421,2020/02/24,Intensified campaign against vaccine-preventable diseases launched,"Focus will be on under-served population and tribal areas.

“No child should have to suffer or die due to vaccine preventable diseases and we have intensified our campaign to ensure that all children are covered,” said Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Monday, inaugurating a special campaign on Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI 2.0).

The campaign aims to immunise, children under the age of two and pregnant women, against vaccine-preventable diseases.

The Minister said, “We are required to achieve 90% immunisation coverage target and with this Intensified Mission Indradhanush 2.0, India has the opportunity to achieve further reductions in deaths among children under five and achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of ending preventable child deaths by 2030.”

The salient features of the IMI 2.0 include immunisation activity will be in four rounds over seven working days excluding the RI days, Sundays and holidays, enhanced immunisation session with flexible timing, mobile session and mobilisation by other departments and focus on leftouts, dropouts and resistant families and hard to reach areas.

“Focus will also be on urban, under-served population and tribal areas, inter-ministerial and inter-departmental coordination,’’ said the Minister.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/7si19f/article30736740.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HarshVardhan-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/intensified-campaign-against-vaccine-preventable-diseases-launched/article30904977.ece
422,2020/02/24,A parental guide to toddler dental health,"Brush baby, brush

The battle begins after dinner every night. Armed with a toothbrush with a pepper seed-sized drop of toothpaste, I announce (beg) to my almost-three-year-old son that it’s time to brush his teeth. He runs for his life, but in the end, almost always ends up with squeaky-clean teeth and I, a few kilograms less from all the chasing. Getting a toddler to brush his/her teeth can be a monumental task for parents. Needless to say, they need to get into the habit, even at the milk-teeth level. Here, Coimbatore-based Dr N Varshini, paediatric dentist, tells us why it’s important that children start early.

The first toothbrush

Introduce a toothbrush the moment the first tooth appears. Pick a regular, small-headed one with nylon bristles and not a silicon finger-brush. The latter does not clean plaque well. You can also go in for bamboo ones, provided the head is small enough to reach the molars. Use the toothbrush to gently clean gums as well. In fact, you can start cleaning your child’s gums from the third month of birth. Dip a small piece of gauze cloth in clean drinking water and wipe your baby’s gums and tongue after every feed.

Toothpaste matters

Choose any child-friendly, fluoride-free, natural toothpaste in the market. Ideally, make sure that your child’s first dental visit happens by the time they turn one, and get a toothpaste that’s tailored around your child’s needs, prescribed by your dentist. For children with caries, it is essential that they brush with a fluoride toothpaste so that it does not spread.

Use just a tiny speck of paste initially. If your child is fussy and does not know how to spit, brushing with even plain water twice a day will do the trick. Many children learn to spit by the time they are one-and-a-half years old, and some might do so once they turn three, depending on their individual milestones. They can start brushing on their own once they can tie their shoelaces; this indicates that fine motor skills are well-developed.

The technique

Brush for two minutes twice a day, and if possible, slip another session into the day after they’ve had something chewy to eat. A tooth has five surfaces; make sure that you brush all of them well, especially the space between teeth and the molars.

Food and dental health

Start night-weaning once solids are introduced after the sixth month. Although extended breastfeeding is beneficial for your child, night-feeding is not good from the dental health perspective. So try and wean your child off the night feed by the end of one year. This is because in sleep, salivary and flushing action is reduced, resulting in multiplication of bad bacteria. This may render some teeth yellow, then brown, and finally, black and painful. For children who cannot be night-weaned, their teeth and gums can be cleaned with xylitol wipes after a night feed.

Sticky foods are a big no, especially at night. Chocolates and caramel, for instance, stick to the teeth and toddlers may not even feel this. While it is not possible to keep them away from sweets all the time, offer something raw afterwards. A carrot or apple to chew on, following a chocolate, cleanses the teeth.

Brushing tips

It’s a good idea for both parents to take turns with the brushing so it becomes a fun-filled activity. Standing behind your child while brushing, is the easiest position. Incorporate a ‘brushing song’; encourage them to stand in front of the mirror while brushing so they can see what’s happening. Consider brushing along with your children, to make it a habit.

Danger signs

Healthy milk teeth will indirectly pave the way for sturdy permanent teeth. Nursing bottle caries are common in children below five years; these appear on the front teeth. Look out for any change in the colour of teeth — it helps to shine a torchlight into their mouth once a month to keep watch.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/aw3thd/article30902603.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24MPHealthAnchor3,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/a-parental-guide-to-toddler-dental-health/article30902604.ece
423,2020/02/24,Radiating positivity: A cancer survivor helps clear some misconceptions,"A cancer survivor, in conversation with her radiation oncologist, on doubts, fears, and the clearing of misconceptions

“Kamal, take a deep breath and hold it,” a voice says, as I lie on a radiotherapy table, with the machine moving to image the cancerous part and place it in the field to receive the rays. To me it seems ironical, as I had always been camera shy! Now I had to let the lens capture me for 33 days. Yes, my treatment protocol had 33 radiations, five days a week, after a lumpectomy in my left breast, followed by eight cycles of chemotherapy. This was in 2013, and when I look back, radiotherapy was the easier, friendlier part of the treatment.

I was amazed by the precision in the calculations made by Dr Mathangi Padmanabhan, Senior consultant and Incharge, Department of Radiation Oncology at BGS Global Hospital, to work out the number of fractions to be administered, the intensity of each, and the markings made on my chest. I followed the dos and don’ts during the treatment, mingled with other patients in the waiting lounge and combined my radiation schedule with official duties.

I met people of all ages, frames, colours and nationalities trooping in and out of the consultation chambers and waiting lounge. I saw myself drawn towards a young boy who would run through the corridor, play with toys, sometimes holding tight to his mother. His spirit was free, footsteps light, fearless of the outcome. I was always next in the queue after him, to receive radiation. Two weeks ahead of my completing radiation he bid farewell to return to his country, only to remain in my thoughts to this day. I missed my little companion who changed me for the better.

My doctors also changed my perspective of looking at my disease by asking me to reach out to a patient in a chemotherapy ward and boost her confidence. It has been six years now and I have befriended unknown people, talking to them to settle their fears and be patient and hopeful through the treatment.

Here is the professional perspective, from Dr Padmanabhan.

What is radiation therapy and how does it work?

Radiotherapy is treatment with ionising radiation, most commonly with high-energy X-rays directed at the site of the tumour. It works by damaging the DNA of the cancer cells. The normal cells have the capacity to repair the damage. But for tumour cells, the damage accumulates and kills them.

Is radiation therapy a cure for cancer or a short-term option for treating cancer?

The role of radiotherapy is generally classified into curative and palliative. Curative/radical is when radiotherapy can cure the disease by itself. This is usually given for areas such as head and neck cancer, anal canal cancer where organ preservation is a priority. It can also play a curative role in cervical, vaginal, vulval, prostate and skin cancers. Radiation therapy is used as an adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatment when it is given before or after a main treatment like surgery or chemotherapy. This modality of treatment is useful for breast cancers, cancers of the gastrointestinal tract like oesophagus, stomach, colorectum, pancreas; brain tumours, and genito-urinary cancers like uterine and penile cancers.

Palliative treatment is offered only to relieve some symptoms like pain, bleeding, obstruction, to improve the quality of life, such as in painful bony metastases and symptomatic brain metastases.

What is external radiation/external beam radiotherapy (EBRT)?

This is the usual form of radiotherapy that is used for the treatment of majority of cancers. A teletherapy machine like Cobalt – 60 or a linear accelerator is used for treatment. The radiation beam is delivered through the head of the machine to penetrate the body of the patient to reach the intended area from different directions. It is usually delivered in many sittings called fractions over 10-15 minutes every day. The entire treatment time may range from 2 -7 weeks, upto 5 days in a week. It is usually given as an OPD treatment unless the patient’s clinical condition warrants it. It is non-invasive and painless.

During my radiation treatment, I received five booster doses. What is a booster dose?

Whenever the lump is removed in a breast cancer patient, the rest of the breast has a risk of having another lump (recurrence) in the same breast, which is higher in the area of removal of the lump. So the entire breast is irradiated to prevent such recurrences and a higher dose (boost) is given to the area where the lump was removed.

What are the significant risks related to radiation therapy?

The risks depend on the region of treatment and the dose received by the adjacent normal tissues. The recent advances in radiotherapy are primarily intended to reduce the dose to normal tissues while delivering full dose to the tumour. For example, the Gating technique avoids a dose to the heart while treating left sided breast cancers, which in turn reduces the risk of heart attacks in the future. The dose to the rectum can be reduced by techniques like IMRT (intensity-modulated radiation therapy) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) while treating prostate cancers, which otherwise might result in long term bleeding with stools. Usually, the side effects are temporary and reversible once the treatment is over.

If the patient is treated for brain tumors, we expect temporarily hair loss in the treated area, headache, vomiting that can be controlled by simple medication.

Redness and darkening of the skin in the treated area is also a common temporary side effect related to the skin.

Soreness or ulcers in the tongue or the throat resulting in pain during swallowing is a common temporary side effect during the treatment of head and neck cancers.

When the abdomen or pelvis are treated, we may expect a little increase in the frequency of stools or obvious watery diarrhoea. This also is temporary and manageable.

Is it a myth that radiation turns normal cells into cancer stem cells, while killing cancer cells?

This is not a myth. Of course, radiation is a known carcinogenic factor. When a tissue is exposed to a low dose of radiation that does not kill them, the DNA mutations caused by it can become cancerous, though the incidence is very low. That is why we don’t always advise unnecessary X-ray-based investigation unless the benefits outweigh the risks.

When treating a patient with radiotherapy, we consider the benefit of treating a patient with present cancer to be far more important than the very low (<10%) possibility of developing a cancer 20 years later. Also, during radiotherapy treatment, the tissues are exposed to high doses and high-energy radiation as low dose radiation is usually carcinogenic.

Are there instances when radiation therapy is excluded from being a part of breast cancer treatment?

Yes. Patients who are diagnosed with very early stages and breast limited disease (no nodes), with the entire breast removed by mastectomy, may benefit only minimally from radiotherapy. In such cases, a doctor may advise a person to avoid it.

In recent years, radiation therapy has been used as a standalone treatment for early-stage cancer. Why?

After years of thorough clinical research, in certain cancers like cancer of the vocal cords and anal canal cancers, for instance, the tumours have been found to be extremely sensitive to radiation therapy and can be managed without surgery. Additionally, surgery could be psychologically demoralising in such situations.

What is your message for the readers regarding cancer?

Treating any disease at an early stage will always have better long-term cure rates. Every treatment — surgery/chemotherapy/radiotherapy has its own role and is not interchangeable. Radiotherapy once started should be completed as per the prescribed protocol and timing. It cannot be stopped in between and done after a period of unnecessary breaks — it definitely reduces the efficiency.
