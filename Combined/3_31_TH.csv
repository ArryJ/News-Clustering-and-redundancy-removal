0,2020/03/31,Crisis deepens in All India Chess Federation as president removes secretary,"AICF is awaiting a directive from the Madras High Court regarding fresh date of elections of its office-bearers

The crisis-ridden All India Chess Federation (AICF) plunged into further turmoil when its president P.R. Venketrama Raja removed Bharat Singh Chauhan from the post of secretary of the federation on Monday.

In a three-page letter, dated March 30, addressed to Chauhan, Raja detailed the reasons for his action, and said he had no option but to exercise his “extraordinary powers as the president of AICF under Article 15 (a) of the AICF Constitution and Bye-Laws.”

It may be recalled that the AICF is awaiting a directive from the Madras High Court regarding fresh date of elections of its office-bearers.

In February, Chauhan (secretary), Ajay Patel (president) as well as three others were declared elected unopposed to the principal posts of AICF.

Later, the Madras High Court ordered fresh elections and the Supreme Court dismissed a Special Leave Petition challenging the verdict.

When contacted, Chauhan questioned Raja’s authority and dismissed his action of removing him as a “malicious attempt to cover his tracks.”

He argued, “Raja ceased to be the AICF president from February 11, the date on which the court-appointed Returning Officer declared Mr. Patel as the newly elected AICF president.

“Despite the Hon’ble Madras High Court ordering fresh elections of AICF, Mr. Patel, being the last person to hold the AICF president’s office, remains the interim president till fresh elections are conducted.”

He alleged Raja announced his removal to save All Marathi Chess Association, which was delaying the submission of the accounts for the World Youth Championship held last October.

“AMCA received a State Government grant of ₹2 crore for the championship and did not bother to account for it. Last of my letters seeking AMCA’s response was sent on March 29, and within a day, Raja, without authority, announced my removal.”

Strange development

In another strange development, 12 affiliates have jointly called for AICF’s Special/Extraordinary General Body Meeting on April 24 in the Capital.

The letter, written on Chandigarh Chess Association’s letterhead claiming representations from 12 States and Union Territories and listing a nine-point agenda, read, “We had sent to Hon. secretary, AICF, a requisition in writing to call a Special/Extraordinary General Body Meeting of AICF as per the rights and powers vested in them under Article 11 of the Constitution of the AICF and Section 28 of the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act 1975. As the Hon. secretary of AICF has expressed in a letter dated 29.03.2020 his inability to call such a meeting we have decided to call for the meeting.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/aek1ni/article31222376.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Chess-boardjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/crisis-deepens-in-all-india-chess-federation-as-president-removes-secretary/article31222201.ece

Olympic bronze medal winning wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt has a simple solution to the problem of staying confined at home in the time of a nationwide lockdown.

Sharing how his determination helped him stay isolated for six months in South Africa while recovering from a knee surgery, Yogeshwar said the country’s collective willpower would beat the deadly COVID-19 virus.

Failure at the 2008 Beijing Olympics had made Yogeshwar hungrier for success. He travelled to South Africa in 2009 for a surgery to fix his injured knee. The time required for recovery and rehabilitation tested Yogeshwar, who has bagged several medals in top level competitions, including the 2012 London Olympics.

“I spent six months in recovery and rehab. I was almost alone. In those days it was not easy to speak to one’s family over phone. I used to watch whatever Indian films came on television and listened to music to pass my time. My only aim was to recover from the injury and become fully fit. I focused on that to overcome my loneliness.

“Right now, we should aim at beating coronavirus. This will make our stay at home easier. These days we have got so many facilities, including social media, to stay engaged. Spending time with family is another good option,” Yogeshwar told The Hindu.

For Yogeshwar, who joined politics during the Haryana elections last year, social commitments have increased. But he is monitoring all this from home. “In our Gohana village, we are feeding about 2000 to 3000 people every day. We are also trying to extend help to all the needy people in our locality. We have a 12-member team, which is looking into all this.

“Amid all this, we are following the rules of social distancing. The biggest challenge at this moment is helping poor families with food and other basic needs,” said Yogeshwar, who has shut down his wrestling academy to protect the trainees from the virus.

Welcoming the postponement of the Olympics, Yogeshwar expressed confidence that the Indian wrestlers would be unaffected by the one-year delay.

“All of them have been performing well for the last two-three years. They need to protect themselves from the virus, maintain focus and use the additional time to get back to top form again. They know how to do it, they just need to stay fit,” said Yogeshwar.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/q5fq7c/article31230211.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01YOG,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/countrys-collective-willpower-will-beat-covid-19-says-yogeshwar/article31219650.ece
2,2020/03/31,"Today’s cache | Zoombombing, VPNs and more","Today's cache is your daily download of the top 5 updates from the world of technology.

Advances in technology is making online meeting easy and free in our times. We are videoconferencing with people frequently these days. And one of the top trending platforms is the Zoom videoconferencing app. Today, we look at the app’s security vulnerability, and how you can protect your own virtual conversations with the help of secure VPNs.

And on the other side, engineers are trying to fully charge an electric vehicle in less than 10 minutes for Formula E race in 2022.

Finally, moving to engage kids at home, Spotify launches its Kids service in three countries, and parents are allowing their children to use Facebook’s Messenger Kids app.

Zoom’s privacy policies questioned

As millions of people have been advised to stay at home due to COVID-19, videoconferencing app Zoom has become the mainstay for people to connect with each other.

According to market research firm Sensor Tower, Zoom’s cloud-meetings app is currently the most popular free app for iPhones.

As its popularity grew, so did questions surrounding its privacy and data projection policies.

In the last few weeks, Zoom’s screen-sharing feature has been exploited by internet trolls. They hijack meetings and interrupt educational sessions leading to what is now called “Zoombombing.”

New York’s attorney general Letitia James on Monday sent a letter to the company asking if it has taken any new security measure to handle the surge in traffic on its network and to detect hackers, according to a report by New York Times.

The letter outlined several concerns on the company’s slow response to security vulnerabilities on its platform. These gaps could allow malicious third-parties to gain access to users’ cameras.

Zoom had updated its privacy policy on Sunday after users reported concerns, and Monday, its chief executive and founder Eric Yuan said in a statement that the company has taken its users’ privacy, security and trust extremely seriously.

“We appreciate the New York attorney general’s engagement on these issues and are happy to provide her with the requested information,” the statement added.

Protecting yourself online with VPNs

As most of us communicate online, it is important to send and receive messages and data over secured networks.

Most public networks are not secure. They easy targets for people trying to snoop on your data that is sent unencrypted. Accessing a website that doesn’t use HTTPS will make your communication vulnerable to malicious attacks.

A secure website is marked by a green lock icon. If this lock is missing, anyone can view the data you send. So, using a private network helps keep your data safe.

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is like a tunnel that you can use to pass through a public network. It helps protect your data in transit from hackers or scamsters. It keeps both encrypted and unencrypted data safe. By changing your IP address, it also protects your privacy to an extent.

So, here are some VPN providers that have been tested by WIRED. They have all been independently audited and have published their results.

ExpressVPN: is known for not keeping customer logs. At one point of time, it failed to produce records on customers in courts even after the Turkish government seized its servers. It costs $6.67 a month for a one year upfront purchase.

TunnelBear: It has a bear animation explaining what a VPN does and what it doesn’t. It also offers the same security features as other VPN providers with a no-logging policy. It costs $4.99 per month for a one year up front purchase.

Mullvad VPN: The Sweden-based company offers total anonymity so you can generate a random account number, write it down and mail it along with cash to Sweden. And no one can connect the sender to the random account. It costs $5.60 per month.

Charging an electric car in about the same time as filing gas

Tesla and Porsche have recently deployed 250-kilowatt public charging stations. These charging units can power some vehicles to full charge in about 40 minutes. That’s a big leap considering how long it used to take for battery vehicle to get charged fully.

Now, as if a 40-minute full charge isn’t short enough, Formula E officials want new cars in the all-electric racing series to pack a full charge in about 10 minutes.

The team had announced the specs for their third-generation all-electric race cars that will debut on the motorway in two years.

Increasing the battery charging rate is a function of how fast lithium ions flow from the cathode to the anode, and how much ion the anode can hold.

Making thicker anodes solved the part of the equation on the storage, but the flow of ions sometimes gets slower as they can’t penetrate the anode fast enough while charging. This delay causes a molecular traffic jam, making lithium to stay on the surface, leading to a phenomenon called lithium-plating.

To solve the flow part, engineers are planning to add silicon to the anode, instead of graphite. According to a review paper on eTransportation, silicon can change the anode’s crystal structure in a way that makes lithium plating less likely.

Enevate, an energy storage company, has been working on this for the last 15 years with pure silicon anode. The company’s researchers announced that their latest generation of batteries could be charged to 75% in just five minutes, according to a report by WIRED.

Spotify Kids app launched in US, Canada and France

Spotify’s standalone app Kids, aimed at kid-friendly music and stories, is being broadly made available in the U.S., Canada and France, the company announced on Tuesday.

The app debuted in Ireland last fall, and was made available to Spotify’s Premium Family subscribers.

Spotify’s Premium Family plan costs $14.99 per month, and it can be accessed by six people in the same household. It offers ad-free music streaming, each with their own personalised accounts.

The Kids app can be customized by age range. Also, the content is hand-curated by Spotify editors, unlike YouTube kids app, which uses an algorithm to suggest content.

More children are using Facebook’s Messenger Kids app

The COVID-19 outbreak that pushed schools to shut has made Facebook’s Messenger Kids popular, according to a report by MIT Technology Review.

The app showed a noticeable increase in downloads as the coronavirus pandemic erupted, according to SensorTower.

Parents are allowing their kids to use the Messenger as it helps them to stay in touch with their friends. Also, it offers them a chance to get on with their own work while their kids engage with their friends.

The app was originally launched in 2017 to allow kids too young to join Facebook to use their parents’ account to chat with other kids.

Coronaviruses are sensitive to humidity and are less likely to thrive at moderate levels of humidity, a series of experimental studies over the years have shown. Earlier this month, a study by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States said that regions experiencing a monsoon might see a slowing — but not a stop — to the transmission of the virus and, therefore, could help mitigation strategies in tropical countries such as India.

The number of people suffering from severe alcohol withdrawal effects who visit Institute of Mental Health (IMH), Erragadda, increased from maximum of 5 patients a day to 90. Along with other commercial establishments, liquor shops too were shut for over a week as part of lockdown for containment of the spread of coronavirus. Deprived of their regular dose of alcohol, addicts have slipped from atonic symptoms such as restlessness, trembling, to severe effects such as seizures, delirium.

Harsh lockdowns aimed at halting the march of the coronavirus extended worldwide Monday as the death toll soared past 35,000 and new waves of U.S. outbreaks pushed the nation’s containment efforts to the brink.

5,2020/03/31,China focuses on patients with no symptoms as infections rise,"Asymptomatic people under observation numbered 1,541

China will start releasing information from Wednesday on coronavirus (COVID-19) patients who show no disease symptoms, ordering them into quarantine for 14 days, a health official said, after the mainland witnessed its first rise in infections in five days.

As local infections peter out and new cases surface among travellers returning home, the existence of virus carriers with no symptoms is fuelling public concern that people could be spreading it without knowing they are ill.

Coronavirus - Live updates

From April 1, the daily report of the National Health Commission will include details of such cases for the first time, Chang Jile, a commission official, told a briefing. People in close contact with them face 14 days of medical observation.

Asymptomatic patients under observation numbered 1,541 by Monday, with 205 of the cases having come from overseas, the Commission said separately.

State Helpline numbers

Monday's 48 new infections, and one death, in mainland China were up from 31 the previous day, the commission said, reversing four days of declines. All were imported, taking China’s tally of such cases to 771, with no new local infection reported. Many were students returning from overseas. About 35 infected Chinese citizens are still studying abroad, Education Ministry official Liu Jin said.

6,2020/03/31,Study shows middle-age COVID-19 mortality risk,"Researchers from Britain analysed more than 3,600 confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as data from hundreds of passengers repatriated from Wuhan.

Middle-aged people, and not just the elderly, have a dramatically higher risk of dying or developing serious illness from coronavirus (COVID-19), says a study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal. Researchers from Britain analysed more than 3,600 confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as data from hundreds of passengers repatriated from Wuhan.

They found that age was a key determining factor in serious infections, with nearly one in five over-80s requiring hospitalisation, compared to around 1% among people under 30.

Taking into account estimates of the number of cases that may not have been clinically confirmed — that is, mild or asymptomatic infections — the data showed the hospitalisation rate of patients in their fifties was 8.2%.

It estimated that the mortality rate from confirmed cases in China was 1.38%.

The Lancet study showed that 18.4% of patients in their 80s were hospitalised in China. This compared to 4.3% for 40 to 49-year-olds and roughly 1% for people in their 20s.

“There might be outlying cases that get a lot of media attention, but our analysis very clearly shows that at aged 50 and over, hospitalisation is much more likely than in those under 50, and a greater proportion of cases are likely to be fatal,” said Azra Ghani, a co-author of the study.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/study-shows-middle-age-covid-19-mortality-risk/article31221870.ece

Indonesian leader Joko Widodo declared a state of emergency on March 31 as coronavirus (COVID-19) deaths in the world's fourth most populous country jumped again. However, he has resisted calls for a nationwide lockdown.

President Widodo has been heavily criticised for not imposing lockdowns in major cities, including the capital Jakarta, home to about 30 million people where most of the country's virus deaths have been reported. He announced $1.5 billion in beefed-up social assistance and subsidies for low-income workers.

Indonesia’s leader offered few details of the state of emergency beyond calling for stricter social distancing, but He also announced $1.5 billion in beefed-up social assistance and subsidies for low-income workers.

Tens of millions eke out a living on poorly-paid jobs in Southeast Asia's biggest economy.

“To overcome the impact of COVID-19, we've chosen the option of large-scale social distancing,” Mr. Widodo told reporters.

“We must learn from the experience in other countries, but we cannot copy them because every country has its own characteristics,” he added.

On Tuesday, 136 people died after contracting the virus, with 1,528 confirmed cases of infection.

But the latter figure is widely thought to be well below the real number in the archipelago of more than 260 million.

The Indonesian Doctors' Association has warned that the coronavirus crisis is far worse than has been officially reported and that the government's response is “in tatters”.

Jakarta's governor has said nearly 300 suspected or confirmed victims of the virus have been wrapped in plastic and quickly buried in the city since the start of March.

Last week, France reported the death of a 16-year-old girl from coronavirus in the greater Paris region.

Although serious COVID-19 infections are uncommon among the young, some exceptional cases have been taken to hospital intensive-care wards, as U.S. health authorities have pointed out.

Belgium's toll on Tuesday represented a jump of nearly 200 fatalities from that given the previous day, which stood at 513.

It comprised 98 deaths recorded in the preceding 24-hour period, plus another 94 deaths over previous days but which had not been counted in the national tally, Mr. Andre said.

The small EU country, with a population of 11.4 million, now has 12,775 cases of persons tested positive for COVID-19, of whom 4,920 have been hospitalised, including 1,021 in intensive care.

9,2020/03/31,"U.S. outlines plan for transition in Venezuela, sanctions relief","Power-sharing govt. to include allies of Maduro and Guaido

The U.S. is prepared to lift sanctions on Venezuela in support of a new proposal to form a transitional government representing allies of both Nicolas Maduro and opposition leader Juan Guaido, officials said.

The plan, which will be presented on Tuesday by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, echoes a proposal made over the weekend by Mr. Guaidū that shows how growing concerns about the coronavirus, which threatens to overwhelm the South American country’s already collapsed health system and crippled economy, are reviving U.S. attempts to pull the military apart from Mr. Maduro.

What’s being dubbed the “Democratic Framework for Venezuela” would require Mr. Maduro and Mr. Guaidū to step aside and hand power to a five-member Council of State to govern the country until presidential and parliamentary elections can be held in late 2020, according to a written summary of the proposal.

Four of the members would be appointed by the opposition-controlled National Assembly that Mr. Guaidū heads. To draw buy-in from the ruling socialist party, a two-third majority would be required. The fifth member, who would serve as interim President until elections are held, would be named by the other council members. Neither Mr. Maduro nor Mr. Guaidū would be on the council.

“The hope is that this setup promotes the selection of people who are very broadly respected and known as people who can work with the other side,” U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams told the AP in a preview of the plan. “Even people in the regime look at this and realize Maduro has to go, but the rest of us are being treated well and fairly.”

The plan also outlines for the first time U.S. requirements for lifting sanctions against Mr. Maduro, officials and the oil industry.

Those accused of grave human rights abuses and drug trafficking are not eligible for sanctions relief, individuals who are blacklisted because of the position they hold inside the Maduro government - such as members of the supreme court, electoral council and the rubber-stamp constitutional assembly - would benefit.

But for sanctions to vanish, U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams said the council would need to be functioning and all foreign military forces — from Cuba or Russia —would need to leave the country.

Still, any deal is unlikely to win Mr. Maduro’s support unless the issue of his future is addressed and he’s protected from the U.S. justice system, said David Smilde, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7w3hyq/article30466250.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VENEZUELA-GOVERNMENT-MADURO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-outlines-plan-for-transition-in-venezuela-sanctions-relief/article31221666.ece
10,2020/03/31,Myanmar scribe hit with terror charges,"An interview with a top representative of Arakan Army published by Voice of Myanmar led to the detention of editor-in-chief Nay Myo Lin, who was brought to court on terrorism charges.

A Myanmar journalist faces up to life in prison for publishing an interview with a rebel group operating in the country's restive Rakhine state a week after the insurgents were classified as a terrorist organisation.

The western region has long been a tinderbox of conflict between the Myanmar military and Arakan Army (AA), a group demanding greater autonomy for the state's ethnic Rakhine people. Clashes have left scores of civilians killed, hundreds injured and 150,000 displaced since January last year, and both sides have traded allegations of abuse.

A March 27 interview with a top representative of Arakan Army, a group seeking greater autonomy for Rakhine people, published by Voice of Myanmar led to the detention of editor-in-chief Nay Myo Lin, who was brought to court on terrorism charges on Tuesday. The government had classified the insurgents as a “terrorist group”.

“I was accused under two charges of the counter-terrorism law,” he told reporters before leaving the court in Mandalay.

The charges – which cover violations including allowing terrorist groups to spread fear, gather or hide – were filed by Special Branch, Myanmar's intelligence arm, he said.

They carry penalties ranging from three years to life in prison.

“This is disturbing for press freedom,” said the journalist, who previously worked for the BBC's Burmese-language news service.

His wife Zarni Mann, a reporter with independent local news outlet The Irrawaddy, said her husband's laptop was seized.

She decried the use of counter-terrorism laws against journalists.

Amnesty International's Nicholas Bequelin called for the charges to be dropped and for Nay Myo Lin's immediate release.

“Myanmar must stop arresting journalists simply for doing their jobs,” Bequelin said.

Myanmar has come under fire in the past for the high-profile jailing of two Reuters journalists who were convicted in 2018 of breaching a law on state secrets after revealing a massacre of Rohingya Muslims.

The pair were eventually freed by presidential pardon after spending more than a year in jail.

11,2020/03/31,Taliban team in Kabul to monitor prisoner release,"First such visit since its ouster in 2001

A three-member Taliban technical team arrived on Tuesday in the Afghan capital to monitor the release of their prisoners as part of a peace deal signed by the Taliban and the U.S., a spokesman for the insurgent group said.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid confirmed the team’s arrival in a tweet. It marked the first time a Taliban delegation has been in Kabul since the group was driven out by the U.S.-led coalition in November 2001.

There was no immediate comment from the Afghan government on the team’s arrival.

On Monday, Jawed Faisal, spokesman for the Afghan National Security Adviser’s office, said Afghan officials and the Taliban agreed during a video conference that the insurgent group should send a technical team to Kabul for discussions on the release of Taliban prisoners. The International Committee of the Red Cross agreed to assist the team in getting to Kabul.

The prisoner release is part of a peace deal signed last month by the Taliban and U.S. that calls for the government’s release of 5,000 Taliban and the Taliban’s release of 1,000 government personnel and Afghan troops.

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and political opponent Abdullah Abdullah both declared themselves president in a parallel inauguration ceremony earlier this month. They have been locked in a power struggle and the discord has prompted Washington to say it would cut $1 billion in assistance to Afghanistan if the two can’t work out their differences.

Mr. Putin visited the Kommunarka hospital on March 24 where he chatted with the doctor, Denis Protsenko. Neither of them were wearing protective equipment during their conversation, TV footage from the visit showed.

Mr. Protsenko, writing on Facebook said, “Yes, I have tested positive for coronavirus, but I feel pretty good. I've isolated myself in my office. I think the immunity I've developed this month is doing its job.”

The Kremlin said that Mr. Putin was being regularly tested for coronavirus and that “everything is okay,” the RIA news agency reported.

Mauritania has declared its first fatality from coronavirus (COVID-19), state media reported on March 31, adding to the growing death toll on the African continent.

The victim is a 48-year-old French-Mauritanian dual national who tested positive for the virus after she died, according to the Mauritanian Information Agency.

The woman had been quarantined alongside 16 other French nationals who landed in the West African state in mid-March, in one of the last flights to reach Mauritania before it banned international arrivals.

N’Diaye Mamadou, an official in charge of the isolation centre in the capital Nouakchott, told state TV that the woman’s case was unusual because she did not initially present symptoms.

She began to feel ill on Sunday evening, before her condition worsened on Monday morning. She then died en route to hospital on Monday, Mr. Mamadou said.

15,2020/03/31,"Coronavirus | Spain registers overnight death toll of 849, highest so far","The death toll rose to 8,189 on Tuesday from 7,340 on Monday.

Once again, Spain hit a new record with 849 COVID-19 deaths in 24 hours on Tuesday although health chiefs said the rate of new infections was continuing its downward trend.

After Italy, Spain has suffered the world’s second most deadly outbreak, which has now claimed 8,189 lives there. The latest figures came a day after the death toll fell slightly, dampening hopes it could have passed the peak of the crisis.

Over the same period, the number of confirmed cases rose to 94,417 after another 9,222 people tested positive: a nearly 11% increase.

That figure was seen as a setback after a week, in which the rate had been steadily failing, with Monday’s figures having shown a rise of just over 8%.

“It’s true that today we have a slight increase in the number of cases,” said Maria Jose Sierra, from the health ministry’s emergencies coordination unit. But the downward trend “is continuing”, she added.

This time last week, the rate of new infections stood at around 20%.

Now on day 18 of an unprecedented four-week national lockdown to slow the spread of the virus, Spain has sought to dramatically ramp up testing. It is sourcing kits from around the world in order to test some 50,000 people per day, up from the current 20,000.

Meanwhile, Italy marked a minute of silence and flew flags at half mast on Tuesday to mourn the 11,591 people who have died.

Britain’s Prince Harry and wife Meghan Markle on Tuesday bid a formal goodbye to their role as frontline royals as they settle down to their financially independent roles in the US.

Harry, who remains sixth in line to the British throne, had announced the royal split along with his former actress wife Markle earlier this year and, as per the deal struck with Buckingham Palace, they will now be in a 12-month transition period with the option for the prince to return to his frontline roles by March 2021.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will hold on to their titles but will not be actively using them or formally representing Queen Elizabeth II from April 1.

As we all find the part we are to play in this global shift and changing of habits, we are focusing this new chapter to understand how we can best contribute, they said in reference to their new roles away from the UK as the couple signed off as Harry and Meghan on social media.

“What’s most important right now is the health and wellbeing of everyone across the globe and finding solutions for the many issues that have presented themselves as a result of this pandemic,” the couple said in their final message on their Sussex Royal Instagram.

“While you may not see us here, the work continues. Thank you to this community - for the support, the inspiration and the shared commitment to the good in the world. We look forward to reconnecting with you soon. You’ve been great! Until then, please take good care of yourselves, and of one another, read their farewell message, which indicates their return to social media under a more private capacity in the future.”

On a more philosophical note, they referred to the extraordinarily fragile world as it undergoes the coronavirus pandemic.

“Yet we are confident that every human being has the potential and opportunity to make a difference-as seen now across the globe, in our families, our communities and those on the front line-together we can lift each other up to realise the fullness of that promise,” they added.

Alongside, Buckingham Palace released a statement saying: “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex would prefer that in the immediate weeks and months, the focus remains on the global response to Covid-19.

“However, we recognise there are outstanding questions relating to their future beyond their household transition deadline.”

The statement reiterated that they would no longer use the name Sussex Royal for their charitable organisation, Instagram or website. Their Sussex Royal Foundation will not continue and the winding up process has begun.

“The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will spend the next few months focusing on their family and continuing to do what they can, safely and privately, to support and work with their pre-existing charitable commitments while developing their future non-profit organisation,” it adds.

Harry, 35, and Markle, 38, will now settle down with their 10-month-old baby son, Archie, in California after they flew down to the US from their previous base of Vancouver Island in Canada. US President Donald Trump had tweeted soon after to say that his government would not foot the bill for their security.

The couple’s spokesperson immediately stressed the soon-to-be former frontline UK royals have no plans to ask the US government for security resources and that they had organised privately funded security arrangements.

They have hired a top executive who worked for Micrsoft’s Bill and Melinda Gates to help set up their new charitable roles.

Catherine St Laurent, who the couple described as “an incredible asset”, will start as chief of staff next month and also be executive director of their new non-profit organisation.

In a statement, she said: “From our very first conversation, Harry and Meghan have expressed a deep commitment to improving lives and having a positive impact on society.

“Their perspective on the role that empathy, connection, and compassion can play in that mission is both deeply personal and incredibly timely.”

Frogmore Cottage, the couple’s refurbished home on the Queen’s Windsor estate, will continue to be their family home in the UK, where they plan to spend some time in the future. They had announced earlier that they would be paying back the GBP 2.4-million used from the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant on re-doing it as they move away from access to the funding in their new avatar.

Harry’s sustainable travel initiative, Travalyst, will be established as an independent non-profit organisation and the couple are said to be committed to their roles as patrons.

The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted four resolutions on Monday, with its 15 members voting by email for the first time because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Members voted to keep troops in Sudan’s restive Darfur region until the end of May and maintain the U.N. political mission in Somalia until June 30. They extended the mandate of the U.N. panel of experts for North Korea until April 30, 2021 and they stressed the importance of supporting the U.N.’s far-flung peacekeeping operations.

The U.N.’s most powerful body has been meeting by video because of COVID-19, which has hit New York City, where the U.N. has its headquarters, exceedingly hard. The last council meeting in the headquarters complex was on March 12, when a resolution was adopted extending the mandate of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan and welcoming “encouraging developments” toward peace.

A resolution sponsored by the United Kingdom and Germany extends the joint United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur known as UNAMID until May 31 when the council said it will decide on “the responsible draw-down and exit” of UNAMID. The council said it also intends to establish “a follow-on presence to UNAMID” at the same time.

The Darfur conflict began in 2003 when ethnic Africans rebelled, accusing the Arab-dominated Sudanese government of discrimination. The government in Khartoum was accused of retaliating by arming local nomadic Arab tribes and unleashing them on civilian populations — a charge it denies. In recent years, as the result of a successful government military campaign, the rebellion has been reduced to a single rebel faction.

There has been pressure, including from the Trump administration, to scale down the UNAMID force in response to reduced fighting and security conditions. It was established in 2007 and was one of the U.N.’s most expensive operations, with a ceiling of 15,845 military personnel and 3,403 police in June 2016.

A proposed U.N. Security Council resolution obtained by AP earlier this month would replace UNAMID with a U.N. political and peace-building mission whose primary aim would be to support Sudan’s fragile transition to democracy, including drafting a new constitution and preparing for elections. But that proposal could be changed before the council makes a final decision on UNAMID and a follow-on mission at the end of May.

China, which holds the rotating council presidency in March, sponsored a resolution adopted unanimously stressing “the crucial role” that U.N. peacekeepers play “in achieving conditions for stability and a lasting peace,” and urging countries where they are deployed to ensure their freedom of movement.

U.N. peacekeeping currently has over 100,000 field personnel including military, police and civilians from over 120 countries deployed in 13 active missions across three continents.

Facebook and Instagram removed videos of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro on Monday, saying they spread misinformation about the COVID-19, a day after Twitter did the same.

“We remove content on Facebook and Instagram that violates our terms of use, which do not allow misinformation that could cause physical harm to individuals,” Facebook said in a statement in Portuguese.

Twitter on Sunday explained it had removed the videos in accordance with its recently expanded global rules on managing content that contradicted public health information from official sources, and could put people at greater risk of transmitting COVID-19.

The videos showed the far-right leader flouting his government's social distancing guidelines by mixing with supporters on the streets of Brasilia on Sunday and urging them to keep the economy going.

At least 19 people, including 18 firefighters, were killed while battling a forest fire in southwest China’s Sichuan Province, state-run media reported on Tuesday.

The fire started on a local farm at 3.51 pm on Monday and quickly spread to the nearby mountains due to the strong winds, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Those killed include 18 firefighters and a local forest farm worker who led the way for the firefighters. They were trapped in the fire due to a sudden change in the wind direction, the report said.

Over 300 professional firefighters and 700 militiamen were sent to help, the report said, adding that the cause of the fire is under investigation.

A weekend benefit broadcast featuring recording stars performing live music online from home raised nearly $8 million for two charities serving first responders and Americans facing economic hardship amid the coronavirus crisis, sponsors said on Monday.

The Sunday night show, hosted by Elton John from his kitchen, featured Billie Eilish, the Backstreet Boys, Lizzo, Alicia Keys, Mariah Carey, Lady Gaga and Tim McGraw - all appearing by way of smartphones, home cameras or online platforms.

The Fox broadcast network carried the hour-long show, dubbed the “iHeart Living Room Concert for America,” live without commercial interruption, drawing 8.7 million television viewers, Fox said.

The songs were interspersed with short personal stories from nurses, doctors, truckers, grocery staff, and other essential workers as millions of Americans entered a second full week subjected to stay-at-home orders designed to curb the spread of coronavirus.

The concert, also broadcast on iHeart radio stations nationwide, urged listeners to donate to two charities, Feeding America and First Responders Children's Foundation.

As of Monday evening, the benefit special had raised nearly $8 million for the two organizations, including $500,000 donated by household products giant Procter & Gamble and a matching sum from Fox.

YouTube, which also made a donation in support of the cause, will continue streaming the benefit show through Wednesday on iHeart Radio's YouTube channel.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/du81fo/article31204177.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31ELTONJOHN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/elton-johns-coronavirus-living-room-show-raises-8-million-for-us-charities/article31214092.ece
24,2020/03/31,G20 finance ministers to hold virtual talks on coronavirus crisis,"G20 leaders last week pledged a ""united front"" in the fight against the pandemic, saying they were injecting $5 trillion into the global economy to head off forecasts of a deep recession.

Finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of 20 major economies will hold a second round of virtual talks Tuesday to push ahead the coronavirus response, the Saudi hosts said.

G20 leaders last week pledged a ""united front"" in the fight against the pandemic, saying they were injecting $5 trillion into the global economy to head off forecasts of a deep recession.

Saudi Arabia, which holds the group's rotating presidency, said the ministers and bank governors will convene for the second time to ""advance a coordinated global response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its human and economic implications"".

US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin joined the emergency summit chaired by Saudi Arabia's King Salman, who called for coordinated action while facing pressure to end an oil price war between Riyadh and Moscow that has roiled energy markets.

The talks came after criticism that the G20 has been slow to address the COVID-19 pandemic, which has left more than 37,500 dead worldwide and triggered financial shock waves as some two-fifths of the globe's population is put under lockdown.

The $5 trillion figure is the sum total of the fiscal stimulus packages adopted by individual G20 states, the Chinese foreign ministry said, adding that Beijing's share amounted to $344 billion.

As concerns mount for poorer countries without access to capital markets or adequate health facilities, G20 leaders also pledged to work with bodies such as the International Monetary Fund to deploy a ""robust"" financial package to support developing nations.

French President Emmanuel Macron said on Twitter that ""a strong initiative"" would be launched to help African nations deal with the crisis.

Putin called for a moratorium on sanctions during the pandemic, telling G20 leaders it was a matter ""of life and death"". Russia has faced numerous rounds of Western sanctions following the annexation of Crimea in 2014.

G20 trade and investment ministers also held an extraordinary meeting on Monday, as they assess the impact of the crisis on global trade.

They said they were working to ensure the flow across borders of medical supplies and equipment -- which are in short supply in some hard-hit nations -- as well as critical agricultural products, and other essential goods and services.

""We will guard against profiteering and unjustified price increases,"" they said in a statement.

The G20 ministers also warned that emergency measures adopted in the midst of the crisis must be ""proportionate, transparent, and temporary"", and that they do not create barriers to trade or disruption to global supply chains.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/cc16si/article31178718.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MODI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/g20-finance-ministers-to-hold-virtual-talks-on-coronavirus-crisis/article31214060.ece
25,2020/03/31,"Employment-based backlog to double by 2030, Indians will have to wait for decades for Green Card: CRS","Indian IT professionals, most of whom are highly skilled and come to the US mainly on the H-1B work visas, are the worst sufferers of the current immigration system which imposes a seven per cent per country quota on allotment of the Green Card.

Employment-based backlog for legal permanent US residency is expected to double by 2030 and Indians will have to wait for decades for the coveted Green Card, according to a latest Congressional report.

A Green Card allows a non-US citizen to live and work permanently in America.

Indian IT professionals, most of whom are highly skilled and come to the US mainly on the H-1B work visas, are the worst sufferers of the current immigration system which imposes a seven per cent per country quota on allotment of the Green Card.

The Congressional Research Service (CRS) report said that the time frame would reduce a bit if the per country cap on its allocation is removed by the Congress.

Almost 1 million lawfully present foreign workers and their family members have been approved for, and are waiting to receive, Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) status (a Green Card). This employment-based backlog is projected to double by fiscal 2030, the report said.

The back log exists because the number of foreign workers whom US employers sponsor for Green Cards each year exceeds the annual statutory Green Card allocation. In addition to this numerical limit, a statutory seven per cent per-country ceiling prevents the monopolisation of employment-based Green Cards by a few countries.

For nationals from large migrant-sending countries — India and China — the numerical limit and per-country ceiling have created inordinately long waits for employment-based green cards. New prospective immigrants entering the backlog (beneficiaries) outnumber available Green Cards by more than two to one, it said. “Many Indian nationals will have to wait decades to receive a Green Card. The backlog can impose significant hardship on these prospective immigrants, many of whom already reside in the United States. It can also disadvantage US employers, relative to other countries’ employers, for attracting highly trained workers,” the report said.

The CRS report is based on the analyses of its projects about the 10-year impact of eliminating the seven per cent per country ceiling on the first three employment-based immigration categories: EB1, EB2, and EB3. It models outcomes under current law and under the provisions of S. 386, as amended.

The bill would phase out the per country ceiling over three years and reserve green cards for certain foreign workers, but it would not increase the current limit of 120,120 Green Cards for the three employment-based immigration categories.

According to CRS, the analysis projects similar outcomes for all three employment-based categories: Indian, and to a lesser extent Chinese, nationals in the backlog would experience shorter wait times under S 386 compared with current law.

“The bill would eliminate current EB1, EB2, and EB3 backlogs in 3, 17, and 7 years, respectively, with modest differences by country of origin. Subsequently, new prospective immigrants would receive Green Cards on a first come, first-served basis with equal wait times within each category, regardless of origin country,” the CRS said.

“By FY2030, EB1, EB2, and EB3 petition holders could expect to wait 7, 37, and 11 years, respectively. Maintaining the seven per cent per-country ceiling, by contrast would substantially increase the already long wait times for Indian and Chinese nationals, but it would continue to allow those from elsewhere to receive Green Cards relatively quickly,” CRS report said.

It said S 386 would not reduce future backlogs compared to current law. Given current trends, the analysis projects that by 2030, the EB1 backlog would grow from an estimated 119,732 individuals to an estimated 268,246 individuals; the EB2 backlog would grow from 627,448 to 1,471,360 individuals; and the EB3 backlog, from 168,317 to 456,190 individuals.

Majority of Indian-Americans in H-1B visa category who apply for green card are either in EB2 or EB3.

“The total backlog for all three categories would increase from an estimated 915,497 individuals currently to an estimated 2,195,795 individuals by FY2030. These outcomes would occur whether or not S 386 is enacted, because the bill maintains the current limit on number of green cards issued,” the CRS said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/business/kagg5z/article28701933.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th25BUINDO-US-VISA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/employment-based-backlog-to-double-by-2030-indians-will-have-to-wait-for-decades-for-green-card-crs/article31213994.ece
26,2020/03/31,H-1B workers seek 180 instead of 60-day stay in US post-unemployment period,"The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows the US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.

Fearing massive layoffs in America due to the coronavirus crisis that is hitting businesses around the globe, foreign technology professionals on H-1B visas, most sought after among Indians, demand the Trump administration extend their permissible post-job loss limit to stay in the US from the existing 60 to 180 days.

The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows the US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.

The current federal rules require an H-1B visa holder to leave the US along with their family members within 60 days of losing their job.

Economic experts fear massive layoffs in various sectors of the American economy due to the current economic distress that is only going to deteriorate in coming weeks and months.

A record 3.3 million Americans have filed initial jobless claims for the week ending March 21.

Even as the peak of coronavirus in the US is some two weeks away, millions of people in the US have already lost their jobs.

According to an estimate, some 47 million people could be rendered unemployed.

Those on H-1B visas are not eligible to unemployment benefits. They are also not entitled to the social security benefits, even though there is deductions from their salary for this purpose.

Initial reports suggest that quite a number of H-1B employees are being laid off. In some cases, companies have already informed their H-1B employees that they are on top of the list of being fired.

As such, the H-1B visa holders have started a petition campaign on the White House website to extend the timeline for their stay in the US after they are being laid off.

“We request the government to temporarily extend the 60-day grace period to 180 days and protect the H1B workers under these difficult times,” says the petition which so far has attracted more than 20,000 signatures.

It requires a minimum of 100,000 petitions to get a response from the White House.

The COVID-19 situation is getting worse with massive lay-offs expected. The economic conditions may have a significant impact on H1B workers, the petition says.

“Under regulations, H-1B workers have a 60-day grace period of unemployment time during each authorised validity period to stay in the USA legally. They must find new work within 60 days; otherwise, they have to leave the country,” the petition said.

“Most H-1B workers are from India and cannot travel home with children who are US Citizens as many nations announced an entry ban, including India. H-1B workers cater to the economy at large, mainly supporting the IT Industry with high tax contributions,” the petition says.

A total of 782,365 COVID-19 cases have been reported across more than 175 countries and territories with 37,582 deaths reported so far.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was tested negative for the novel coronavirus, his office said, after one of his aides has contracted the virus.

The prime minister’s office on Monday said in a statement that the tests of Netanyahu’s family and his close team also came out negative, Xinhua news agency reported.

The tests were conducted earlier on Monday after it was found out that his advisor Rivka Paluch had been infected with the virus.

The prime minister was expected to stay in quarantine despite the test result until the epidemiological investigation into the case is concluded.

Mr. Netanyahu was leading efforts to contain the coronavirus spread in Israel while struggling to finalize a new coalition government with his former opponent Benny Gantz, leader of the centrist Blue and White party.

28,2020/03/31,"U.S. coronavirus death toll passes 3,500","President Donald Trump has been criticised for an initially slow response by the federal government to the now-accelerating pandemic spread.

The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 climbed past 3,500 on Tuesday, eclipsing China’s official count. New York was the nation’s deadliest hot spot, with about 1,550 deaths statewide, the majority of them in New York City.

President Donald Trump has been criticised for an initially slow response by the federal government to the now-accelerating pandemic spread. Harrowing scenes from hospitals in New York and elsewhere revealed a health system unprepared with basic supplies such as face masks, as well as life-saving devices like respirators.

New York was the nation’s deadliest hot spot, with about 1,550 deaths, the majority of them in New York City.

USNS Comfort, a Navy hospital ship with 1,000 beds that docked in New York on Monday, was expected to begin accepting non-coronavirus patients on Tuesday.

A 1,000-bed emergency hospital set up at the Javits Convention Center began taking patients Monday night. And the Billie Jean King USTA National Tennis Center was being transformed into a hospital.

The crisis became personal for New York Governor Andrew Cuomo with word that his brother was infected. Chris Cuomo tweeted that he suffered fever, chills and shortness of breath but will continue broadcasting from his basement.

Seeking help

On Monday, the Governor pleaded for help from volunteer medical workers, and close to 80,000 former nurses, doctors and other professionals were already said to be stepping forward.

New York City sought to bring in 250 out-of-town ambulances and 500 paramedics and emergency medical technicians to help its swamped EMS system. The city’s ambulances are responding to about 6,000 calls a day, or 50% more than average, authorities said. Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said a five-day stretch last week was the busiest in the history of the city’s EMS operation. Mr. Trump said U.S. death rate was likely to increase for two weeks.

The Navy’s 1,000-bed USNS Comfort arrived in New York Monday as America’s coronavirus epicenter gears up for the peak of the pandemic, with emergency restrictions extended as the national death toll passed 3,000.

The 894 foot-long vessel — which also has space for a dozen operating rooms — was greeted by cheering crowds after departing Norfolk, Virginia on Saturday.

President Trump also said on Monday that the U.S. will send medical equipment for combating the pandemic to Italy and later France and Spain. “We're going to be sending approximately $100 million worth of, of things, of surgical and medical and hospital things to Italy,” he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wurvke/article31213908.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001QA3F9,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-coronavirus-death-toll-passes-3000-johns-hopkins-university/article31213909.ece
29,2020/03/31,Coronavirus | Global lockdown tightens as deaths mount,"World leaders — several of whom have been stricken or forced into isolation — are still grappling for ways to deal with a crisis that will have economic and social shockwaves unseen since World War II.

Harsh lockdowns aimed at halting the march of the coronavirus extended worldwide Monday as the death toll soared past 35,000 and new waves of U.S. outbreaks pushed the nation’s containment efforts to the brink.

Despite slivers of hope in stricken Italy and Spain, the tough measures that have confined some two-fifths of the globe’s population to their homes were broadened. Moscow and Lagos joined the roll call of cities around the globe with eerily empty streets, while Virginia, Maryland and Kansas became the latest U.S. States to announce emergency stay-at-home orders. The capital city Washington followed suit.

In a symbol of the scale of the challenge facing humanity, a U.S. military medical ship sailed into New York to relieve the pressure on overwhelmed hospitals bracing for the peak of the pandemic. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases around the world topped 750,000, with 413,000 of those in Europe, while most of the confirmed deaths are also from the continent, according to an AFP tally.

World leaders — several of whom have been stricken or forced into isolation — are still grappling for ways to deal with a crisis that will have economic and social shockwaves unseen since World War II. U.S. President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin discussed “closer cooperation” on the pandemic and talked about plunging oil prices in a telephone call on Monday, the Kremlin said.

‘Good for morale’

The U.S. Navy’s USNS Comfort, which has space for 1,000 beds and a dozen operating rooms, docked just a day after Trump extended social-distancing measures in the United States until the end of April.

“It will be good for morale,” said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio of the arrival of the Comfort, which will help people requiring intensive care unrelated to coronavirus, easing the burden on an overwhelmed hospital network. In Russia, Putin urged residents of Moscow to “very seriously” respect a lockdown that has seen the closure of all non-essential shops, including restaurants and cafes, in Europe's largest city.

Red Square in the heart of Moscow was deserted and the surrounding streets were quiet. Anna, a 36-year-old web designer, said the lockdown would be hard for her and her five-year-old daughter. “But I don't want Arina to get sick,” she told AFP while on her way to buy bread. “So of course we will observe the quarantine.”

Fears of a rise in cases drove Moscow to follow Italy, Spain and France in imposing full lockdowns, and Europe remains the epicentre of the pandemic with the death toll there passing 26,500 on Monday, according to an AFP tally.

‘Work continues’

After weeks of life spent under a national lockdown in Italy, signs were emerging that its drastic actions could slow the spread of the coronavirus. Even though the country’s death toll grew by 812 in 24 hours to 11,591, figures from the civil protection service showed the rate of new COVID-19 infections hitting a new low of just 4.1% and the number of people who had recovered reached a new high.

“The data are better but our work continues,” said Giulio Gallera, the Chief Medical Officer of Lombardy, Italy’s worst-hit region. Spain also announced another 812 virus deaths in 24 hours. The country meanwhile joined the United States and Italy in surpassing the number of cases in China, where the disease first emerged in December in the city of Wuhan.

France however reported its highest daily number of deaths since the outbreak began, saying 418 more people had died in hospital.

‘Nothing to eat’

Britain and Italy both warned at the weekend that measures to prevent disease spread would be in place for months to come. In Britain COVID-19 has hit high profile figures including Prime Minister Boris Johnson and heir to the throne Prince Charles, who was out of virus isolation, according to royal officials. In Israel, meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu became the latest world leader to enter isolation and German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s third coronavirus test came back negative.

The lockdowns are causing hardship across the world but particularly in impoverished cities in Africa and Asia. Africa’s biggest city, Lagos, was due to join the global stay-at-home from Monday, with Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari ordering a two-week lockdown for its 20 million people. The measures, in force from 2200 GMT, also apply to the capital Abuja.

“Two weeks is too long. I don’t know how we will cope,” said student Abdul Rahim, 25, as he helped his sister sell food from a market stall.

Zimbabwe also began enforcing a three-week lockdown in the impoverished southern African country. “They need to be fed, but there is nothing to eat,” vegetable vendor Irene Ruwisi said in the township of Mbare, pointing at her four grandchildren. “How do they expect us to survive?”

The shutdown has already put millions out of work and forced governments to rush through huge stimulus plans.

Experts in Germany, Europe’s economic powerhouse, said the virus would shrink output there this year by up to 5.4%. In the U.S., more than two thirds of the population were under lockdown orders, as the number of confirmed coronavirus infections topped 159,000, a global high, and deaths approached 3,000. For Louisiana, where the city of New Orleans is a coronavirus hot spot, Governor John Bel Edwards signalled the worst may be yet to come.

“We are nowhere near over the hump. We still have an awful lot of work to do to flatten the curve,” he said, adding that a crisis loomed with needs for ventilators expected to exceed capacity on April 5.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/dr16ck/article31213878.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001QA2ZAjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-global-lockdown-tightens-as-deaths-mount/article31213863.ece
30,2020/03/31,Coronavirus | Great Pyramid of Giza lights up in solidarity against pandemic,"Egypt has so far registered 656 COVID-19 cases, including 41 deaths and 150 reported recoveries.

Egypt’s famed Great Pyramid was emblazoned Monday evening with messages of unity and solidarity with those battling the novel coronavirus the world over.

“Stay safe”, “Stay at home” and “Thank you to those keeping us safe,” flashed in blue and green lights across the towering structure at the Giza Plateau, southwest of the capital Cairo. Egypt has so far registered 656 COVID-19 cases, including 41 deaths. Of the total infected, 150 reportedly recovered.

“The tourism sector is one of the most affected industry but our priority is health,” said Tourism and Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Anani, speaking at the site. Senior Antiquities Ministry official Mostafa al-Waziri thanked “all the medical staff who help to keep us safe.”

Egypt has carried out sweeping disinfection operations at archaeological sites, museums and other sites across the country. In tandem, strict social distancing measures were imposed to reduce the risk of contagion among the country’s 100 million inhabitants. Tourist and religious sites are shuttered, schools are closed and air traffic halted.

Authorities have also declared a night-time curfew and threatened penalties including fines and even prison. On Monday, the Interior Ministry said hundreds were arrested for violating curfew orders. It was not immediately clear if they were later released.

The World Health Organization has commended Egypt’s response to the pandemic as “strong and adapted to the situation”. But it called on the Arab world’s most populous country to boost hospital resources to better prepare for potential wider transmission.

The novel coronavirus was declared a pandemic on March 11. It originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has so far spread in 183 countries. Over 727,000 people have been infected and more than 34,000 have died worldwide, according to a tally compiled by AFP.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/xxizr/article31213672.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001QA3NQjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-great-pyramid-of-giza-lights-up-in-solidarity-against-pandemic/article31213670.ece
31,2020/03/31,Coronavirus | Albanian healthcare personnel help badly-hit Italian city of Brescia,"Italy has recorded a world-leading 11,591 deaths, more than half of them in the Lombardy region.

About 30 doctors from Albania, one of Europe’s poorest countries, were at work in northern Italy on Monday helping overwhelmed hospitals at the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic.

One of the doctors said he was simply following the Hippocratic Oath that medics have taken through the ages vowing to help their colleagues in need. “In difficult situations, if our fellow (healthcare workers) need help, they must be helped,” Ermal Pashaj, a surgeon from a hospital in the Balkan country’s capital Tirana, told AFP.

The doctors arrived Monday in Brescia, a city whose COVID-19 death and infection rates have been among the highest in the world for the past month. Brescia’s hospitals have been staffed by chronically overworked doctors and nurses facing a ceaseless flow of critically ill patients. Dozens of Italian doctors have died from the new disease, many of them in hospitals in and around Brescia.

But Almarin Domi, a nurse at a Tirana State hospital, said he was not scared. “We’re not afraid at all,” Mr. Domi told AFP after himself getting tested for COVID-19 to make sure he does not spread it to patients.

“For people like me who work in emergency rooms, the word fear does not exist,” he said. Albania, with a population of just under three million, has officially recorded 11 deaths from the novel coronavirus.

32,2020/03/31,"Coronavirus | Amazon, Instacart workers protest over safety","A separate group of workers at the Amazon-owned grocery chain Whole Foods meanwhile called for a one-day stoppage or “sickout” on Tuesday to press demands for improved health measures.

Amazon warehouse employees and Instacart delivery shoppers joined protests Monday to press safety demands, highlighting the risks for workers on the front lines of supplying Americans largely sheltering at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

An estimated 50 to 60 employees joined a walkout at an Amazon worker warehouse in the New York borough of Staten Island, demanding that the facility be shut down and cleaned after a worker tested positive for the coronavirus. “There are positive cases working in these buildings infecting thousands,” warehouse worker Christian Smalls wrote on Twitter.

Amazon, responding to an AFP query, said Mr. Smalls made “misleading” statements about conditions and that he was supposed to be on quarantine. “Like all businesses grappling with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, we are working hard to keep employees safe while serving communities and the most vulnerable,” Amazon said in a statement, “We have taken extreme measures to keep people safe,” it said.

Meanwhile a group calling itself the Gig Workers Collective said it was maintaining its call for Instacart’s independent contractors to strike despite new safety measures announced late Sunday by the company. “Workers aren’t filling orders until our full demands are met,” a spokesperson told AFP. “This isn’t just about us, we want to also protect our customers.”

It was not immediately clear how many of Instacart “shoppers” who are independent “gig” workers, were participating in the stoppage. Instacart, which recently announced plans to hire some 300,000 people to help meet demand for grocery delivery, said in a statement it was “fully operational” and that the walkout caused “no impact.”

“We’re continuing to see the highest customer demand in Instacart history and have more active shoppers on our platform today than ever before picking and delivering groceries for millions of consumers,” said the San Francisco company, which operates in some 5,500 cities in the U.S. and Canada.

More safety gear

The firm said Sunday it would provide additional health and safety supplies to full-service “shoppers” and would set a “default” tip based on customers' prior orders. The labour group, whose numbers were not known, called the Instacart moves “a sick joke.”

“We had been asking for hand sanitiser for many, many weeks. But apparently the company is capable of sourcing some with two days of work? Where was this before,” the group said in a Medium post. A separate group of workers at the Amazon-owned grocery chain Whole Foods meanwhile called for a one-day stoppage or “sickout” on Tuesday to press demands for improved health measures.

33,2020/03/31,Saudi-led coalition air strikes hit rebel-held Yemen capital Sanaa,"The Huthi-run Al-Masirah television reported at least 19 air strikes on a number of targets in Sanaa, including military bases and a military academy.

The Saudi-led military coalition on Monday carried out multiple air strikes on Yemen’s rebel-held capital Sanaa in retaliation for missile strikes on Riyadh. Residents in Sanaa reported multiple explosions after the bombing raids began, in a new escalation despite UN calls for a ceasefire to protect Yemeni civilians from the coronavirus pandemic.

The military operation targeted the “storage, assembly and installation sites” of ballistic missiles and drones across territory held by the Huthi rebels, the coalition said in a statement released by the official Saudi Press Agency. The Huthi-run Al-Masirah television reported at least 19 air strikes on a number of targets in Sanaa, including military bases and a military academy.

Global ceasefire

The operation comes after Saudi air defences intercepted Huthi ballistic missiles over Riyadh and the border city of Jizan late Saturday. The attacks left two civilians wounded in Riyadh, which is under a 15-hour per day curfew to limit the spread of coronavirus, according to Saudi State media. It was the first major assault on Saudi Arabia since the Huthi rebels offered last September to halt attacks on the kingdom after devastating twin strikes on Saudi oil installations.

Fighting has also escalated between the Huthis and Riyadh-backed Yemeni troops around the strategic northern districts of Al-Jawf and Marib. The rebels stormed a key governmental military camp in Al-Jawf after heavy clashes on Monday, according to Yemeni military sources. The escalation comes despite a show of support on Thursday by all of Yemen’s warring parties for a UN call for a ceasefire as the Arab world’s poorest country remains vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic. Saudi Arabia, the Yemeni government and the Huthi rebels had all welcomed an appeal from UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres for an “immediate global ceasefire” to help avert disaster for vulnerable people in conflict zones.

Broken healthcare system

On Sunday, UN special envoy Martin Griffiths reiterated the call for an immediate cessation of hostilities to help avert the “potentially disastrous consequences” of the coronavirus outbreak. Yemen’s broken healthcare system has so far recorded no case of the COVID-19 illness, but aid groups have warned that when it does hit, the impact will be catastrophic.

The country is already gripped by what the UN calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Saudi Arabia is also scrambling to limit the spread of the disease at home. The kingdom's health ministry has reported 1,453 coronavirus infections and eight deaths from the illness so far.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/7u1hd1/article31213143.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/000Nic6514109jpg-31,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/saudi-led-coalition-air-strikes-hit-rebel-held-yemen-capital/article31213142.ece
34,2020/03/31,Coronavirus | Five members of U.S. Congress test positive,"An estimated 230 House members returned to Washington to pass the $2.2 trillion Economic Relief Bill despite the health risks of travelling and gathering at the Capitol.

Six members of the U.S. Congress have announced that they have contracted the novel coronavirus, and more than 30 others are or were self-quarantining in hopes of limiting the spread of the pandemic.

Now that Congress has passed a $2.2 trillion Economic Relief Bill, and President Donald Trump has signed it into law, neither the House of Representatives nor Senate is now due back in Washington before April 20 at the earliest. An estimated 230 House members returned to Washington to pass the relief package on Friday, despite the health risks of travelling and gathering at the Capitol, after Republican Representative Thomas Massie said he would block an effort to pass it without at least half of the House’s 430 members present.

Who has the virus?

Representative Mike Kelly, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said on Friday he had tested positive for the coronavirus at a drive-through testing site. Mr. Kelly said in a statement he had started experiencing mild flu-like symptoms, and his doctor ordered the coronavirus test. Representative Joe Cunningham, a Democrat from South Carolina, said on Friday he had tested positive for the coronavirus, although his symptoms had already begun to improve. Mr. Cunningham had been in self-quarantine since March 19 after learning he had been in contact with another member of Congress who had tested positive.

Senator Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, said on March 22 that he had tested positive and was in quarantine. He said he was asymptomatic and feeling fine and was tested out of an abundance of caution. He had been in the Senate and using the gym there in the days before he received his positive result.

Republican Representative from Florida Mario Diaz-Balart said on March 18 that he tested positive after developing symptoms on March 14. That was less than 24 hours after he and more than 400 other members of the House of Representatives crowded into the chamber to pass an earlier coronavirus aid package. Utah Democrat Ben McAdams said on March 18 that he had the virus, also having developed symptoms on March 14. In a statement March 24, Mr. McAdams said he had been in the hospital and doctors were monitoring his occasional need for oxygen. He has since been released from the hospital.

Representative Nydia Velazquez, a Democrat from New York, announced in a statement on Monday that she had been diagnosed with a presumed case of coronavirus, although she had not been tested, after developing symptoms of the ailment on Sunday. Ms. Velazquez was among the House members who returned to the Capitol on Friday.

Who is self-quarantined?

At least six of the 100 senators have self-quarantined because of exposure to Mr. Paul or others who tested positive for coronavirus. They are Republicans Cory Gardner, Lindsey Graham, Rick Scott and Ted Cruz. All have returned to public life. Over two dozen House members have self-quarantined, some after exposure to Diaz-Balart or McAdams, and others after contacts with constituents or staffers who tested positive. Not all are still in isolation.

The Senate’s No. 2 Republican, John Thune, missed the March 25 Senate vote on the $2.2 trillion coronavirus bill after feeling ill and flying home to South Dakota. He later announced that a coronavirus test had come back negative.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/ks3pdz/article31213005.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001Q6553jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-five-members-of-us-congress-test-positive/article31213004.ece
35,2020/03/31,"Coronavirus | New York State surpasses 1,000 deaths","The total number of State-wide deaths isn’t expected to be released until Monday, but with at least 250 additional deaths recorded outside the city as of Sunday morning, the State’s total fatalities was at least 1,026.

New York State’s death toll from the coronavirus outbreak climbed Sunday above 1,000, less than a month after the first known infection in the State. Most of those deaths have come in just the past few days.

Also read | Five members of U.S. Congress test positive for virus

New York City reported in the evening that its toll had risen to 776. The total number of State-wide deaths isn’t expected to be released until Monday, but with at least 250 additional deaths recorded outside the city as of Sunday morning, the State’s total fatalities was at least 1,026. The virus and the disease it causes, COVID-19, has torn through New York with frightening speed.

The first known infection in the State was discovered March 1 in a healthcare worker who recently returned from Iran. Two days later, the State got its second case, a lawyer from the suburb of New Rochelle.

By March 10, Governor Andrew Cuomo had declared a “containment area” in New Rochelle that shuttered area schools and houses of worship. That same day, the metropolitan area saw its first fatality — a man who worked at a harness track in Yonkers and lived in New Jersey. By March 12, the State had banned all gatherings of more than 500 people, darkening Broadway theatres and sports arenas. A day later, the first New York resident died, an 82-year-old woman with emphysema.

New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio closed New York City’s schools March 15. More severe restrictions came March 20, when Mr. Cuomo ordered all non-essential workers to stay home, barred gatherings of any size and instructed anyone out in public to stay at least 6 feet from other people. At the time, only 35 New Yorkers had been killed by the virus. That was only nine days ago.

It took Spain 18 days to go from its first death to its 1,000th, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Italy took 21 days. New York state took 16 days.

‘Unprecedented’ surge in 911 calls

New Yorkers are hearing a constant wail of sirens as weary ambulance crews respond to a record volume of 911 calls. The city’s ambulances are responding to about 6,000 calls a day — more than 50% more than average. Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said Sunday that the last five days have been the busiest stretch in the history of the city’s EMS operation. “This is unprecedented,” Mr. de Blasio said. “We have never seen our EMS system get this many calls — ever.”

Mr. Nigro said the surge is delaying responses to lower-level calls. Mr. De Blasio said the city is planning to shift personnel onto EMS crews to help keep up with demand.

‘Days before supplies run out’

Mayor De Blasio said he has asked the federal government to deliver 400 more ventilators to city hospitals by Wednesday and warned that without reinforcements the city will run out of masks, gowns and other hospital supplies in a week.

With the expected peak of cases in the city still two to three weeks away, Mr. de Blasio said he has asked the U.S. military to aid in sending new waves of doctors, nurses and other medical personnel to the city. He said Sunday that more than 76,000 health professionals, including many who have recently retired from the field, have volunteered to help in the coronavirus fight.

The USNS Comfort, a Navy hospital ship with 1,000 beds, 12 operating rooms and a full medical staff, is scheduled to arrive in the city on Monday. It will be used to treat non-coronavirus patients to free up space in city hospitals. A 68-bed field hospital is being built in Manhattan’s Central Park. Samaritan’s Purse, a charity run by Christian evangelical preacher Franklin Graham, built a similar temporary facility in Italy to help deal with the crisis there. He said the New York City version could be up and running Tuesday.

Poor neighbourhoods hard hit

Coronavirus is overwhelming some of New York City’s poorest neighbourhoods, according to new data released by the city. Queens accounts for 32% of the city’s more than 30,000 confirmed cases as of Saturday - more than any other borough. Jackson Heights, Elmhurst and Corona, which are generally poor neighbourhoods, densely packed and have large non-English speaking populations, have been among the hardest hit, according to a city map showing percent ranges of people testing positive for the disease. In those areas, between 69% and 86% of the tests done have come back positive.

A hospital in Elmhurst has been overrun with coronavirus cases. Statistics on coronavirus cases do not reflect everyone who may have the virus, because many people have been told to manage their illness at home and are not getting tested.

The number of patients being discharged at the State’s hospitals after they’ve been treated for coronavirus has increased daily to a high of 845 on Saturday, Mr. Cuomo said. In all, more than 3,500 people have been discharged. They include a lawyer from the New York City suburbs connected to one of the earliest U.S. coronavirus clusters. Lawrence Garbuz’s family and neighbour were infected, as well as members of his synagogue.

More federal money

Mr. Cuomo spoke with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday after lambasting the federal government for giving the State a fraction of needed funding as it faces a potential revenue shortfall of up to $15 billion due to the economic damaged caused by the virus.

“They committed to right the wrong in the next federal bill that passes, and the Governor is committed to working with them to make that a reality,” Mr. Cuomo’s senior adviser Richard Azzoparadi said. Mr. Schumer called the conversation “long and productive.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lnclk0/article31212906.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31MARCHTHAP30-03-2020000006A,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-new-york-state-surpasses-1000-deaths/article31212907.ece

37,2020/03/31,"COVID-19: Fake news pandemic surges on Facebook, Twitter","Jumbling of content makes viewers less likely to check sources, according to a new research by a team from Ohio State University

In novel coronavirus times, there is so much fake news going around and according to new research, there’s a price to pay when you get your news and political information from the same place you find funny memes and cat pictures.

Jumbling of content makes viewers less likely to check sources, said the team from Ohio State University, adding that people viewing a blend of news and entertainment on a social media site tended to pay less attention to the source of content they consumed — meaning they could easily mistake satire or fiction for real news.

“The findings show the dangers of people getting their news from social media sites like Facebook or Twitter,” said study author George Pearson, a senior lecturer and research associate in communication at The Ohio State University.

“We are drawn to these social media sites because they are one-stop shops for media content, updates from friends and family, and memes or cat pictures,” Pearson added.

People who viewed content that was clearly separated into categories — such as current affairs and entertainment — didn’t have the same issues evaluating the source and credibility of content they read.

“Jumbling of content makes everything seem the same to us. It makes it harder for us to distinguish what we need to take seriously from that which is only entertainment,” said Pearson in the study appeared in the journal New Media & Society.

For the study, Pearson created a fictional social media site called ‘Link Me’.

The 370 participants saw four web pages with either two or four posts each. Each post consisted of a headline and short paragraph summarising the story, as well as information on the source of the post.

The sources were designed to be either high or low credibility, based on their name and description.

All posts were based on real articles or public social media posts taken from Reddit or Tumblr.

The results showed that when the content was not grouped by distinct topics — in other words, news posts appeared on the same page with entertainment posts — participants reported paying less attention to the source of the content.

“They were less likely to verify source information to ensure that it was a credible source,” said Pearson.

That may be one reason why satirical and other types of fake news get shared by people who evidently think it is real.

One solution would be for social media companies to develop tools to distinguish content.

But until that happens, it is up to users to pay more attention to where their news is coming from — as difficult as that may be.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/j5ehfa/article31214633.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31NETFACEBOOKFAKENEWS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/covid-19-fake-news-pandemic-surges-on-facebook-twitter/article31214634.ece
38,2020/03/31,COVID-19: Facebook pledges $100 mn to support corona-hit news industry,"The social networking giant said the investment will include $25 million in emergency grant funding for local news through the Facebook Journalism Project

Facebook has pledged to invest an additional $100 million to support journalists at a time when ad revenues are declining due to the economic impact of the new coronavirus.

The social networking giant said the investment will include $25 million in emergency grant funding for local news through the Facebook Journalism Project, and an extra $75 million in marketing to get money to publishers around the world at a time when their advertising revenue is declining.

“This investment is in addition to the support we’ve already pledged to the news industry in response to COVID-19: $1 million in grants for local news, $1 million in grants for fact-checking organisations, and a $1-million donation to the International Fact-Checking Network,” the company said in a statement on Monday.

The news industry is working under extraordinary conditions to keep people informed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Local journalists are being hit especially hard, even as people turn to them for critical information to keep their friends, families and communities safe.

“Through the COVID-19 Community Network grant program, direct funding is helping journalists cover important stories when we all need them most,” said Campbell Brown, VP, Global News Partnerships.

“We’re building on this work and will direct a portion of these funds to publishers most in need in the hardest hit countries. The first round of these grants went to 50 local newsrooms in the US and Canada,” he added.

39,2020/03/31,YouTube Originals content to binge during the COVID-19 lockdown,"While we are on coronavirus lockdown, tune into these high-production shows and films by YouTube Originals

Lockdown has ushered in new ways to entertain oneself, digital or otherwise, and we have given you our fair share of listicles for Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hotstar but there’s a platform worth our attention, too: YouTube Originals.

That’s right, YouTube is not just for make-up tutorials, recaps of our favourite sports news of the quotidian lives of vloggers. YouTube Originals was officially launched on September 24, 2019, but way before then, there were already an impressive line-up on content, from the bone-chilling kind to the sort which make you chuckle a bit during these difficult times.

Majority of the content is available in 4K along with closed captioning as well as subtitles in French, Japanese and German, among other languages. However, some content is restricted to YouTube Premium users. Pre-paid and subscription plans are available, starting at ₹129 per month.

Here is our list of unmissable YouTube Originals:

‘The Age Of A.I.’

Robert Downey Jr summons his inner-Tony Stark as he hosts this sci-tech show which addresses the ongoing convergence of futurism (in this case, Artificial Intelligence) and humanity. The show kicked off on December 18, 2019. It seems, though, that Downey Jr himself checks his Tony Stark ego at the door, given the very real and astounding advancements in the discussed fields. The series comprises impressive nuances in med-tech, an AI baby, and an ex-NFL star regaining his voice, making it appealing to those who consider themselves technophobes.

There are 8 episodes of ‘The Age Of A.I.’, each about half an hour long.

‘BookTube’

Bibliophiles, you haven’t been forgotten. BookTube isn’t just an informal name for the book-loving community on the platform anymore, it’s now a full-fledge show which made its foray into YouTube on March 19. The series features Michelle Obama, Margaret Atwood, Malcolm Gladwell, Jaqueline Woodson and Melinda Gates.

Expect discussions on not just the literary world but also social issues such as placement of the LGBTQ+ communities, racial disparity and family. The Michelle Obama episode extensively delves into the back-story of her memoir Becoming which she discusses intensively with author John Green.

There are 7 episodes of ‘BookTube’ , each around 15 minutes long.

‘Justin Bieber: Seasons’

The Canadian pop star has not had an easy life in the limelight; he struggled with mental health issues, personal relationships and a hectic schedule as a musician. Seasons, which launched on January 27, features never-before-seen footage of his music-making career, his quotidian life with wife Hailery Bieber (nee Baldwin), as well as confessionals with the 26-year-old sensation himself.

“My life is changing a lot,” Bieber says at one point of the series, adding, “Getting married, getting back in the studio, talking about getting married. Just being creative with being in this new chapter. And being happy about what I’m doing and being in a good space; a better headspace.”

There are 10 episodes of ‘Seasons’, each an average of 10 minutes long.

The Fake Show

A Hajime production, The Fake Show is a satirical commentary on the often ill-perceived life of well-known YouTubers who are known to frequently glamourise their lifestyles. The plot follows Shotaro who strives to go above and beyond to make a name for himself in a fast-saturating YouTuber market. Unfortunately, chaos ensues when Shotaro’s doppelganger steals his account. Though the premise is straightforward, the humour and direction of the show is impressive, once again reminding us that Japanese entertainment is eons ahead of many of us.

The 11-episode show kicked off on December 12, 2018, before the genesis of YouTube Originals, but this has been added to the Originals collection.

Bodied

Eminem and acclaimed music video director Joseph Kahn come together for this YouTube Original feature film. It follows Berkeley grad student Adam Merkin who gets sucked into the rap-battle game after meeting icon Behn Grym and accidentally competing in — and winning — his first battle. Do we expect a plot of any other kind from Eminem? Rising through the ranks of the battle scene with his provocative insults, Adam alienates his academic buddies, uptight girlfriend, and literary professor father.

The R-rated two-hour feature film launched on the platform on November 28.

Weird City

Another dark horse in the YouTube Original realm is this Jordan Peele masterpiece. Weird City follows a halved society, segregated by economic class: Above The Line, populated by Haves, and Below The Line, populated by Have-Nots. We already know this is going to be a good watch.

The series stars Dylan O’Brien, Rosario Dawson, Michael Cera and LeVar Burton. Colourful production design and self-aware writing make for a rivetting watch.

The six-episodic series launched on February 13, 2019, but it deserves a spot on our list purely because, well, Jordan Peele.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/kozn4t/article31215321.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/collage,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/youtube-originals-films-and-web-series-to-binge-during-lockdown/article31215322.ece
40,2020/03/31,The man from Kerala who cured yaws in the 1930s,"Dr Sankaran Govindan and his compounder Padmanabhan Pillai travelled across Kadakkal, in what is now Kollam district in Kerala, to cure the tropical bacterial infection, yaws

Two men were on a mission in a bullockcart. Covering the hilly terrain was not easy in the mid-1930s when roads were few. Moving from village to village and walking through paddy fields and slush in the rural area of Kadakkal, now in Kollam district, nearly 50 km from Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, were Dr Sankaran Govindan and his compounder Padmanabhan Pillai. Over three years they injected more than 12,500 patients with medicine, to cure them of the tropical bacterial infection yaws that was mutilating and crippling people.

As doctors and health workers battle COVID-19 the world over, Dr G Krishnakumar rewinds to an era when his father worked hard to cure the people of Kadakkal from yaws, an infection affecting the skin, bones, and joints, that was endemic in the hilly areas of the princely state of esrtwhile Travancore, on India’s south-west coast.

Dr Govindan, then a young doctor in his thirties who’d graduated from Madras Medical College, took up his first posting as medical officer in 1935-36 at a government dispensary in Kadakkal. His father Shangu Vaidyan was the Kottaram Vaidyan (palace physician) and he sent his son for higher education to what was then Madras.

Allopathy was still an unknown system of treatment in rural Kadakkal, but the young doctor’s work, attitude, and sincerity gradually brought him patients. In the predominantly agrarian area, inhabited by marginal farmers and tribes people in the hills, Dr Govindan noticed a lesion that occurred in many people of different age groups, especially among those who lived in close quarters. He identified it as yaws that is closely related to the bacterium that causes syphilis, though it is not transmitted through sexual intercourse. It spreads through direct contact with infected wounds, instead.

What causes Yaws Yaws is a disease caused by Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue, a bacteria closely related to Treponema pallidum, which causes syphilis. The bacteria is transmitted by direct contact, acquired during childhood and can cause severe late manifestations years after initial infection.

“My father began documenting the illness and its treatment in an album-cum-journal that he meticulously maintained in 1936,” Dr Krishnakumar says, gently turning the pages of two albums, crumbling with age, and speaking of an era before the arrival of antibiotics, when doctors and compounders worked hand in hand to make medicines.

A jotting in the journal, supplemented with photographs, explains his findings and the progression of the disease. He noted that the primary lesion often occurs at the site of an existing ulcer or bruise, does not respond to any local treatment, and persists for years. Children were susceptible to yaws, perhaps because of their tender skin and poor health.

Dr Govindan found that healthy children with primary or secondary manifestations were able to withstand the disease but at any point of time when their immunity was compromised, they would fall prey to it. “The secondary manifestations sometimes appear after a period of years…. The ulcerating condition is more prolonged and extremely destructive. It makes the patient a cripple. …Bow legs are one of the characteristic features of Yaws,” he wrote.

In those days yaws was considered incurable. Dr Govindan found that Neo-Salvarsan, a drug made in Germany was found to be effective in curing the disease. But he understood that this would be too costly to treat a large group of people, especially those he treated, who were mostly underprivileged.

“That is when he read about an alternative treatment for yaws and found out that compounds of bismuth had been used in the treatment of syphilis since 1921. Immediately, he contacted his friend Narayanan Potti, then head of the department of chemistry at University College in the Thiruvananthapura,” says Dr Krishnakumar.

Professor Potti managed to synthesise and purify the sodium bismuth salt of tartaric acid for him in quantities sufficient for mass use. He called it Bisota. Dr Govindan and his assistants travelled from village to village injected one dose into each of those afflicted by yaws. As a result of their tireless work, yaws was eradicated from Kadakkal and the surrounding areas, says a historical article published in The Journal of the Association of Physicians India that Dr Krishnakumar wrote.

“My father had told me about this when I was a child. Now, these albums are all that remains of that momentous journey. Once the Trivandrum Medical College came up in Thiruvananthpuram, he was appointed in the department of surgery. After his retirement in 1962 as Professor of surgery in Kozhikode Medical College, he established Govidan’s Hospital in 1966,” says Krishnakumar.

He adds that as long as his father was practising, patients used to come from Kadakkal for treatment. Today, Kadakkal is a town and not many remember the work of its first doctor.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/9xil48/article31218410.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01tvmDrGovindan,https://www.thehindu.com/society/the-man-from-kerala-who-cured-yaws-in-the-1930s/article31218417.ece
41,2020/03/31,Covid-19: Chennai’s quilters now make protective masks,"Quilters in Chennai are using their expertise to make simple cotton masks for hospitals, patients and others in their community

The inchworms have swung into action. These members of The Square Inch (India’s first quilting studio, where they meet to exchange quilting designs and techniques and organise and execute community serving projects) are a community of 150 or so quilters in Chennai, explains Varsha Sundararajan. Now, in response to Covid-19, instead of quilts, they are making masks.

“We have a Facebook group of quilters of Indian origin across the world. One member is Jaya Parker, an ER surgeon in the US. Tina Katwal, the founder of the Square Inch, asked her what she thought of the idea of making masks in these times, and she said it was a good idea. Another quilter Elvira, from Guwahati, shared pictures of the masks she had already started making. We spoke to more doctors in the city and they were encouraging too,” says Varsha, who is particular to point out that these are not Covid-19-specific masks. “Masks are needed for other patients too. Those visiting hospitals for dialysis, pregnant women and others who are vulnerable to any infection.”

She says that Madras Medical Mission (MMM) approached them and the nephrologists suggested modifications, such as making a provision to insert a filter that would keep patients safe. The inchworms got to work and supplied them with 250 masks in three days. Dr Rajeevalochana P of MMM is happy with them but reiterates that the masks are not for those affected by Covid-19 or for health workers. “These are for patients vulnerable to infections, especially those who come twice or thrice a week for their dialysis. They have to wear masks when they are here. We will sterilise these masks and distribute it to them. These masks can be washed and reused and therefore are most useful,” she says. The quilters have also supplied masks to a maternity hospital.

Apart from hospitals, the inchworms are also focussing on making and distributing masks in their respective localities, gated communities and apartments. “There are so many senior citizens and their caregivers where I live. I made masks for them too. And for the milkman, the paper delivery person and the sanitation workers who turn up every day to clean the streets,” says Varsha. Once the needs of each quilter’s community is met, surplus masks are collected at five or six points in the city to be distributed elsewhere. One of the quilters made a mask for her watchman and a policeman who saw him asked where he had got the mask from. She gave him one too! Each mask they give out is accompanied with instructions on how it is to be used. The instructions come in Tamil, English and Hindi.

Tailoring the mask is simple, assures Varsha. “There are just a few points we have to keep in mind and we are good to go.” The masks are made of 100% cotton fabric. Where is all the fabric coming from? Varsha laughs. “All quilters worth their quilts squirrel away fabric. We call it our stash. I never thought I would run out of my stash ever, but I am!”

The inchworms have shared what they do on social media and with friends and family. “We may not be able to cater to demands for masks from elsewhere. But we will be more than happy to share how the masks are made,” says Varsha. She says she has had enquiries from as far as Nepal and, closer home, from Coimbatore. “I ask them to identify two or three tailors with sewing machines and we can tell them how to make the masks over Skype or WhatsApp.” Varsha adds that the quilters have also taught the teachers of V-Excel Educational Trust, and they, in turn, will be teaching others through video.

Admittedly, the inchworms and their masks have come in for considerable flak from “a legion of naysayers.” “But we have stood our ground. Doctors have approved it, hospitals are using it and our sanitation workers and those who are providing essential services are grateful for them. Fabric masks do have their uses. It is a barrier of sorts and the first line of defence. They are easy to make, are not patented and we are happy to show you how to make them.”

42,2020/03/31,Construction halt to hit L&T revenue,"Post lockdown, there could be delays in resuming work

The COVID-19 lockdown in India has brought construction activities to a halt in the peak season, a move that will hurt revenues of engineering and construction major Larsen and Toubro (L&T), according to analysts.

“We note that March is a peak month for construction activities in India. Even post the lockdown, there might be some more delays in resuming construction activities in full swing as labour, machinery and materials would need to be re-mobilised. Thus, we see a clear risk to our revenue growth assumptions for the fourth quarter of FY20 as well as FY21 estimates,” Motilal Oswal said in a research note to its clients.

The brokerage has cut FY21 and FY22 earnings by 20% and 14% respectively and the target price to ₹1,320 crore.

March activity

Historically, the month of March is marked by higher execution and payments from government authorities, which brings down the closing working capital for the year. However, the fourth quarter of FY20 will not see execution as well as payment push.

Moreover, L&T would have to continue supporting its vendor base, including sub-contractors, in these tough times, as it has been doing over the past many months. This is likely to increase its working capital further.

Besides, the oil price crash is likely to weaken the prospects of the hydrocarbon segment in the near term, according to analysts.

The hydrocarbon segment has been a key driver of execution and earnings since the last 4 years for L&T with the highest ever order book and double digit margins.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/a4fkga/article31124309.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vestian-corona-GK27856O93jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/construction-halt-to-hit-lt-revenue/article31221912.ece

Gains in the benchmarks were primarily led by stocks like ITC, Tech Mahindra, Sun Pharmaceuticals, Hindustan Unilever, Asian Paints, Nestle HDFC and State Bank of India among others.

“The index managed to show some pullback move today owing to buying seen in the defensive sectors such as FMCG, Pharma and IT,” said Ruchit Jain, Equity Technical Analyst, Angel Broking.

“The banking space also witnessed some pullback but it continued to be a relative under performer compared to some of the other indices. One positive development that was seen was the decline in the India VIX,” added Mr. Jain.

Investor sentiment improved on the back of a strong trend in the Asian markets on account of encouraging factory activity data from China. The benchmarks of Hong Kong, South Korea, China, Taiwan and Indonesia all ended in the green on Tuesday.

Incidentally, Indian markets registered gains even as the number of coronavirus cases in India saw the steepest rise on Monday, taking the total number of cases past the 1,200 mark.

Meanwhile, the gains were not limited to index heavyweights as the broader market breath was also strong with over 1,500 stocks having ground as against less than 800 declines.

44,2020/03/31,"IDBI Bank, IDFC First implement moratorium","Borrowers to send e-mails with choice

Customers of IDBI Bank who wish to continue with equated monthly instalments (EMIs) and do not want to avail the moratorium will need to inform the bank by sending a mail to moratorium@idbi.co.in, the lender said in a communication.

IDBI Bank said there was no separate request needed for availing the moratorium.

“The [moratorium] scheme will be uniformly applicable to all standard term loans under housing loans, loans against property, auto loans, education loans and personal loans as of March 1. There is no separate request required from the borrower,” it said.

IDBI Bank has said that in case the March 2020 instalment had already paid by the borrower, the relief would be applicable for the EMIs payable in April 2020 and May 2020.

On the other hand, private sector lender IDFC First Bank has said that customers who want to avail the moratorium have to inform the bank from his/her registered email at help@idfcfirstbank.com with mobile number and loan account number.

Housing finance company Indiabulls HFC has asked its customers to fill up a form available on its website to avail the moratorium.

On Friday , the RBI had allowed all banks and financial institutions including non-banking financial companies, to extend a three-month moratorium period on EMIs falling due between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020 for all term loans.

This is also applicable to auto, home and personal loans as well as credit card outstanding. This would mean a consumer may choose not to pay monthly equated instalments on their loans for the next three months. The move is a part of measures announced by the central bank to fight the economic impact caused by a nationwide lockdown.

ICICI Bank will send SMS and mails to customers asking them to visit the bank's website to exercise the option if they want to avail the moratorium or want to continue paying EMIs.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/iknx2f/article31221667.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01THBUBANK,https://www.thehindu.com/business/idbi-bank-idfc-first-implement-moratorium/article31221668.ece
45,2020/03/31,"‘Remote working’ may emerge as mainstay option, to cut health risk, cost","If in case COVID-19 lockdown is extended in India, productivity of global in-house centres here could be severely impacted and enterprises across sectors have started reviewing business continuity plans, as per Colliers Research.

Colliers India’s latest report ‘Insights & Recommendations for Indian Real Estate in Light of Spread of COVID19 said, “We expect occupiers to initiate renegotiation of leases or ask for relief from developers/landlords over elements such as lock-in amount, fixed deposit, to cope with likely increased financial pressure.’’

The country’s office sector likely to see lower gross absorption of about 45-50 million sq ft in 2020 due to delays in decision-making, arising from the ongoing pandemic outbreak, it further said.

“We recommend investors to capitalise on the situation and focus on commercial real estate assets as their cap rates are likely to decline in line with the falling 10-year government bond yields. This should place commercial assets in a more lucrative position, possibly generating higher returns for investors. We also recommend investors to scout for assets in data centres and warehousing and logistics, given strong potential in terms of cloud infrastructure, and robust domestic demand”, said Sankey Prasad, Managing Director and Chairman at Colliers International India.

Colliers study spotted a strong inclination for ‘remote working’ and ‘building data capabilities’ among occupiers. MNCs are likely re-evaluate their workplace strategies with respect to global in-house centres/support centres and call centres in India to minimise continuity risk.

“The current scenario may be a precursor to a shift in the idea of workplaces and hence we recommend that occupiers evaluate their density plan and seating arrangements in workplaces, keeping safety and health as key considerations,’’ said Colliers study.

Currently, each employee/seat, on an average, takes 60-80 sq feet at workspace, as against 100 sq.ft and above internationally.

During H1 2020, the realty advisory anticipated slower deployment of funds in India by foreign investors as they are on a wait-and-see mode. “We foresee occupancy levels in flexible workspaces to stay muted in March and April as the risk exposure is higher than in traditional offices,’’ the study cautioned.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/remote-working-may-emerge-as-mainstay-option-to-cut-health-risk-cost/article31221656.ece

The Centre will borrow ₹4.88 lakh crore in the first half of the coming financial year 2020-21, or 62.56% of the gross borrowings of ₹7.8 lakh crore for FY21, Department of Economic Affairs Secretary Atanu Chakraborty said on Tuesday.

“The government is committed to meet its requirements for fighting COVID-19, whether on account of health issues, or on account of protecting the economy, and also providing necessary stimulus at any point of time. The entire borrowing was designed in that fashion,” Mr. Chakraborty told journalists here.

He added the plan would enable the government to have sufficient amounts for cash management to meet such requirements.

The Centre proposes to revise its ways and means advances (WMA) limit to ₹1.2 lakh crore.

This will be reviewed on a need basis, according to Mr. Chakraborty.

The revised limit is significantly higher than the ₹75,000 crore limit imposed in the first half of 2019-20.

With this, the total repayment stands at ₹1,500 crore (inclusive of principal and interest).

Bikesh Ogra, director and global CEO, said: “When we announced our nine months’ results in February 2020, we were one of the first few companies to have felt the impact of COVID19 pandemic, as the dispatches from China for the solar PV panels and other equipment related to solar projects had been impacted. Even under those circumstances, we had guided that the last quarter will be our best quarter for FY 20, both in terms of revenue as well as profit, which we are confident of achieving,”

The company has to pay another ₹500 crore by June 30, 2020 and the balance by September 30,2020.

“The situation in China has improved substantially, ever since, and the dispatches for all equipment including the solar PV panels have already commenced for countries currently unaffected by the lockdowns. However, that said, since our operations are spread over more than 25 countries, COVID19 is likely to affect, delivery of materials and project execution for the countries which continue to go under lockdown. We are monitoring the situation closely to see how to complete execution of the projects with the least of disruptions,” Mr. Ogra added.

IndusInd Bank has reported a reduction in deposits by up to 11% after the Yes Bank crisis..

In a call with analysts on Monday, the bank said the total deposit base is lower by 10-11%.

The bank said, while citing reasons for the drop, “Almost two-thirds of the reduction is on account of government-related accounts — this is largely related to the general private sector bank stance.

This will also result in a lower CASA ratio, but reduce our dependency on this category for deposits in future.”

The bank has also said there was some reduction in wholesale deposits, which could possibly be because of the fall in stock price.

Some private banks were seeing an erosion in deposit base after Yes Bank was put under a moratorium on March 5.

Deposits safe

Retail conglomerate ITC has repurposed its perfume manufacturing facility in Himachal Pradesh to produce an additional 1,25,000 litres of Savlon hand sanitisers, amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic crisis and an unprecedented surge in demand for hand-hygiene products like sanitisers.

To serve a larger national priority during these challenging times, ITC’s Perfume manufacturing facility in Himachal Pradesh has commenced production of Savlon sanitisers to cater to the soaring demand due to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a release.

Sameer Satpathy, Chief Executive, Personal Care Products, ITC Ltd., said, “Addressing a larger national requirement during the Coronavirus pandemic, ITC has repurposed its recently commissioned perfume manufacturing facility in Manpura, Himachal Pradesh to manufacture Savlon Hand Sanitizers.

“This initiative reinforces our efforts to enable enhanced production and supply of Savlon range of hygiene products in the market which is the need of the hour to help fight the virus and contain its spread.”

In line with the government order and in public interest, ITC has reduced prices of Savlon sanitisers and was working overnight to reach the new stocks with the revised prices to the market.

58,2020/03/31,Coronavirus | World Bank says about 11 million could be driven into poverty in East Asia and Pacific,"Containment of the pandemic would allow for a sustained recovery in the region, although risks to the outlook from financial market stress would remain high, the Washington-based global lender stated in a report

About 11 million people could be driven into poverty in East Asia and the Pacific as a result of the coronavirus pandemic that has impacted over 780,000 people and killed more than 37,000 globally, the World Bank has warned.

The Washington-based global lender, in a report released on Monday, said that prior projections had estimated that nearly 35 million people would escape poverty in East Asia and the Pacific in 2020, including over 25 million in China alone.

“If the economic situation were to deteriorate further, and the lower-case scenario prevails, then poverty is estimated to increase by about 11 million people,” it said in its April 2020 Economic Update for East Asia and the Pacific ahead of the annual spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

Growth in the developing East Asia and Pacific, the bank said, is projected to slow to 2.1% in the baseline and to negative 0.5% in the lower-case scenario in 2020, from an estimated 5.8% in 2019.

Also read: World Bank increases coronavirus response fund to $14 Billion

Growth in China is projected to decline to 2.3% in the baseline and 0.1% in the lower-case scenario in 2020, from 6.1% in 2019.

Containment of the pandemic would allow for a sustained recovery in the region, although risks to the outlook from financial market stress would remain high, the report said.

Also read: World Bank, IMF to hold ‘virtual’ Spring Meetings

Noting that the COVID-19 shock will have a serious impact on poverty, the bank said the report estimates that under the baseline growth scenario, nearly 24 million fewer people will escape poverty across the region in 2020 than would have in the absence of the pandemic (using a poverty line of $5.50/day).

Countries in East Asia and the Pacific that were already coping with international trade tensions and the repercussions of the spread of COVID-19 in China are now faced with a global shock, said Victoria Kwakwa, Vice President for East Asia and the Pacific at the World Bank.

“The good news is that the region has strengths it can tap, but countries will have to act fast and at a scale not previously imagined,” she said.

Urgent investments in national healthcare

Among the actions recommended by the report are urgent investments in national healthcare capacity and longer-term preparedness.

It also suggests taking an integrated view of containment and macroeconomic policies. Targeted fiscal measures - such as subsidies for sick pay and healthcare - would help with containment and ensure that temporary deprivation does not translate into long-term losses of human capital.

“In addition to bold national actions, deeper international cooperation is the most effective vaccine against this virulent threat. Countries in East Asia and the Pacific and elsewhere must fight this disease together, keep trade open and coordinate macroeconomic policy,” said Aaditya Mattoo, Chief Economist for East Asia and the Pacific at the World Bank.

Mallya, who is wanted in India on alleged fraud and money laundering charges amounting to an estimated ₹9,000 crore, also said all his companies have effectively ceased operations and manufacturing following the lockdown in India.

“I have made repeated offers to pay 100 per cent of the amount borrowed by KFA to the Banks. Neither are Banks willing to take money and neither is the ED willing to release their attachments which they did at the behest of the Banks. I wish the FM would listen in this time of crisis,” Mallya said in a series of tweets.

He further said, “Indian Government has done what was unthinkable in locking down the entire country. We respect that. All my companies have effectively ceased operations. All manufacturing is closed as well.”

62,2020/03/31,Export of medical items to Serbia triggers debate,"90 tonnes of protective supplies sent

Despite reported shortfalls of necessary items for medical professionals, India exported a major consignment during the weekend.

According to the UN Development Programme (UNDP), Serbia procured nearly 90 tonnes of “medical protective equipment” from suppliers located in different parts of India.

“The transportation of valuable supplies purchased by the Serbian government has been fully funded by the European Union while the UNDP, Serbia organised the flight and ensured the fastest possible delivery,” UNDP in Serbia declared in a social media message.

The delivery has triggered discussion in social media with comments pointing at shortages of many necessary items that the medical community in India is facing in the fight against the novel coronavirus.

Doctors and nurses from various parts of the country have been sending out videotaped messages urging the government to ensure necessary items for their safety during treatment of coronavirus (COVID-19) patients.

While the Ministry of External Affairs is yet to elaborate on the full list of items that the Serbian government has purchased from here, available information from Customs suggests that the items exported included 35 lakh pairs of sterile latex surgical gloves.

The Centre, in recent weeks, has prohibited several items from being exported in view of the urgent requirement in the country. India is also looking at procuring equipment from abroad, including from China and South Korea.

The shortage of essential medical items in the fight against the outbreak also featured during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s video conference with 130 Indian envoys across the world on Monday.

64,2020/03/31,Coronavirus | Air India pilots flag poor protective equipment,"They have to fly flights chartered by countries such as Germany and the U.K. to repatriate their citizens stranded in India

Air India pilots have expressed their concern over “flimsy protective gear, inadequate sanitisers, shoddy disinfection procedure” and a lack of quarantine arrangements as they embark on flights chartered by countries such as Germany and the U.K. to repatriate their citizens stranded in India due to the nationwide lockdown over COVID-19.

Two pilots’ unions, the Executive Pilots of Air India and Indian Pilots’ Guild, have written to Minister of State for Civil Aviation Hardeep Singh Puri raising questions about their safety as they continue to work on the front line during a pandemic.

The unions represent nearly 500 pilots who operate the wide-bodied planes such as Boeing 787, 747 and 777.

The March 30 letter states that the personal protective equipment is “ill-fitting and flimsy and tears easily on rescue flights, sanitisers are not provided in sufficient quantities and disinfection processes are short of industry best practices.”

They also point out that the airline has not made any arrangements for crew members to go into a quarantine, who are then forced to join their families despite operating flights to some of the global hotspots of COVID-19.

‘Poor facilities’

The pilots have also raised questions about the lack of medical facilities as the Air India Medical Services Department has been allowed to work from home, which the cockpit crew say implies, “that any illness suffered by the crew or their families because of these high-risk flights is the sole responsibility of the crew.”

While the airline has not provided any additional medical insurance to crew members to cover them for any COVID-19 related risks, it has gone a step further and recently advised its employees, “enquiries on reimbursement of bills, sick leave, fitness certificate, are considered as undesirable.”

While some of these pilots have operated special flights to Wuhan and Rome to bring back Indians and have operated flights for countries like Israel to help their citizens return home, they have not been paid 70% of their salaries for the past three months and “have also recently been informed by our management of a substantial pay cut, while in the midst of the above mentioned COVID rescue operations!”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bfw64v/article31221762.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1TH-FLIGHTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-air-india-pilots-flag-poor-protective-equipment/article31221763.ece

The COVID-19 pandemic is a “turning point in history”, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a telephone conversation with French President Emanuel Macron on Tuesday. According to a release by the Ministry of External Affairs, PM Modi expressed his condolences for the loss of lives in the pandemic in France.

“The French President strongly agreed with Prime Minister’s view that the COVID-19 crisis is a turning point in modern history and offers the world an opportunity to forge a new human-centric concept of globalisation,” the MEA statement said, adding that the two leaders had agreed to have Indian and French experts share preventive measures, research on treatment and vaccines.

The two leaders had both appeared on an emergency video conference convened by Saudi King Salman last week to discuss the pandemic, where leaders of the G-20 had committed to infusing $5 trillion into the global economy to mitigate the impact of the virus.

During the conference, PM Modi had stressed on the need for the G-20 to look at humanitarian aspects to global challenges like pandemics, climate change and terrorism, not just economic ones.

The Union Health Ministry has allowed the use of Hydroxychloroquine in combination with Azithromycin under close monitoring for patients with severe disease and requiring ICU management as per the revised Guidelines on Clinical Management of COVID–19.

Hydroxychloroquine was previously under testing and was allowed to be administered only to doctors and caregiver in direct contact with COVID-19 positive cases.

67,2020/03/31,Coronavirus | Centre’s extra ration promise yet to be kept at PDS shops,"Orders issued to States only on Monday; States yet to lift the additional grain for the distribution of extra 5 kg rice or wheat

One week into the COVID-19 lockdown, and five days after the Centre’s welfare package was announced, there is no sign of the promised free grains and pulses at ration shops across the country.

Although the Finance Minister promised that the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana would come into effect immediately, the Food Department only issued orders to the States on Monday, and States are yet to lift the additional grain for the distribution of the extra 5 kg rice or wheat per beneficiary. For the promised 1 kg of free pulses, the need to process and transport procured dals, is causing even further delays.

Also read: Centre’s relief measures on statutory, regulatory compliance matters

Jaigunnissa, a 38-year old domestic worker and mother of three, is disgruntled by the delay. She has walked for more than half-an-hour from her home in Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan area, in order to stand in the morning sun outside her ration shop in Bhogal, slowly moving from one chalk circle to the next, keeping the proper coronavirus-era distance from other shoppers.

“I heard that the Modi sarkar announced extra ration last week itself. But when I come here, I find that they are still giving only the 7.5 kg promised by Kejriwal,” she says, gesturing to the large poster of the Delhi Chief Minister hung at the entrance to the shop, promising an enhanced ration of 6 kg of wheat and 1.5 kg of rice, now provided free of cost to each beneficiary.

Lost livelihood

She and her husband, who has a cycle-rickshaw, have both lost their livelihood due to the lockdown. “The lady of the house where I work has said that since she is now doing all the cooking, cleaning, washing, she cannot pay me any salary. So I am dependent on ration only. My children will only get rotis and salt during this lockdown.,” she adds, using her dupatta as a makeshift mask.

“We have just issued the notice to States to lift the additional allocation,” Food Secretary Ravikant told The Hindu on Monday, four days after the initial announcement. “States now have to plan and organise transportation from the godowns [of the Food Corporation of India].”

Also read: Central government’s ₹ 1.7-lakh crore welfare package

Advice to States

The March 30 notice to States advises them to lift the additional allocation together with the regular monthly allocation under the National Food Security Act within the timelines prescribed for that. “However, for States/UTs which have already lifted the allocation under NFSA for April may lift this additional allocation for April till 30 April,” says the notice, seeming to indicate that many ration cardholders may not actually receive their extra free grains for some weeks to come.

The distribution of pulses may be more complicated as few States regularly incorporate them into their public distribution system so far. Senior officials under the Consumer Affairs Department say that the groundwork has just begun, with States having sent in their requisitions.

While a sufficient stock of 34.25 metric tonnes of pulses are available with NAFED, these are whole grams directly procured from farmers, and are yet to be milled and processed, for which the Centre will need to rope in private players. Also, unlike FCI, which has procurement and storage facilities for rice and wheat in every district, pulses are procured from eight or nine districts only, creating more transportation and logistical hurdles, said an official.

For 52-year-old Mohammad Akhtar, standing in queue outside the Bhogal PDS shop for the second consecutive day after surging crowds prevented distribution on Monday, that may be too little too late. The garment factory worker does not even have money to pound the ration wheat he gets, let alone buy vegetables, dal or oil.

“I have only ₹40 remaining in my pocket which I am saving up for emergencies,” he says, adding that his family of four children are now dependent on the food served at a local government school.

Running out of food

“At this point, ration shops have become more crucial than ever before for the 40% of the Delhi population who are NFSA beneficiaries, at a time when lakhs of people are running out of food and are on the brink of starvation due to the lockdown,” says Amrita Johri of the Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan (Right to Food Campaign), which has started monitoring shops across the city during the lockdown.

“Out of the 31 shops we have checked so far, four of them — over 10% — were closed, with grave consequences for those who depend on them for sustenance,” she said, noting that further inquiry may have uncovered a black market operation being run out of one of the closed shops.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/emjpvq/article31221616.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31THLTPDSSYSTEM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-centres-extra-ration-promise-yet-to-be-kept-at-pds-shops/article31221617.ece
68,2020/03/31,"Coronavirus | Step up checking virus in patients, says virologist Jacob John","Jacob John says chasing the virus should be phased down in a strategy shift

At a time when hotspot containment measures are among the focus areas for prevention and control of the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), renowned virologist T. Jacob John has called for a shift in strategy — chasing the virus should be phased down and checking the virus in infected persons should be stepped up.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

“This is not a hotspot transmitting virus but it is a virus that transmits everywhere… Containment measures have to continue. But now, containment measures should have 30% priority, and healthcare testing 70% priority. Healthcare checking is another way of containment measure as we will be finding infected people who had no travel history,” said Dr. John, retired professor of virology, Christian Medical College, Vellore.

Silently infected

That community-based transmission is happening in India is not accepted, he stated. “We do not see it because the majority of people are silently infected and only a few will show symptoms. We are not looking at symptomatic people. We are looking at test results, tests based on travel and contact with those who have travelled. That phase is more or less over. Continuing to chase people who had travelled and their contacts is alright if we have sufficient manpower and energy. But today, what we need to understand is that the virus has widely spread,” he stated.

COVID-19 is a pandemic, meaning that all countries are affected. It means it is a widely transmitting virus, he said, adding: “In every pandemic, within countries, the virus will spread to every nook and corner where human beings live. Even in tribal areas where the neighbouring house is one mile away, the virus will reach there as people will have contact with someone. If not this month, next month. So that kind of a spread should be anticipated now, a widespread community spread is going to happen.”

Also read: Coronavirus | No community transmission yet, says Health Ministry

What should be done now? He said now is the time to prepare the healthcare system to face huge numbers of sick people. “That preparation is what we need now, not chasing the virus. Chasing the virus must be phased down and checking the virus in sick people must be stepped up. The strategy from now onwards should be lesser and lesser on efforts paid for travel-related search and more emphasis on illness-related testing,” he said.

Fever, cough

Dr. John added that it was high time that the strategy be shifted to testing people with fever and cough. “Anybody with fever and cough must be checked. Additional symptoms like fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, body ache are common to both influenza and COVID-19. High fever is common in COVID-19 but not in common cold. So, influenza and COVID-19 should be in one category, and all other respiratory infections in another. If there is a loss of smell, if taste disappears for one day, if there is breathing difficulty, it is more like COVID-19. Those people should be tested for influenza and COVID-19,” he explained.

“The testing strategy must expand to illness testing as the virus is on the loose in the community. Whether the government accepts it or not, it is already in the community,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5mzhya/article31221390.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31THLTJACOBJOHN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-step-up-checking-virus-in-patients-says-virologist-jacob-john/article31221391.ece

70,2020/03/31,Coronavirus | Plea in Supreme Court seeks free COVID-19 testing,"It challenges legality of March 17 advisory that caps the price for testing at ₹4,500.

A petition was filed on Tuesday in the Supreme Court seeking a direction to the government to provide free COVID-19 testing in all laboratories, including private ones.

The plea, filed by Delhi resident Shashank Deo Sudhi, challenged the legality of a March 17 advisory that caps the price for Coronavirus testing at ₹4500. Mr. Sudhi said the advisory was both discriminatory and a violation of the fundamental right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution.

“It is extremely difficult for the common citizen to get himself/herself tested in the government hospital/labs and being no alternative in the sight, the people are constrained to pay the capped amount to the private hospital/labs for protecting their lives. The respondents are completely insensitive and indifferent to the plight of the common citizen of the country who are already financially burdened on account of completely locked down with no possibility of being unlocked in recent future”, the petition said.

In the alternative, the petition asked the court to direct the court to “ramp up the testing facilities at the earliest, given the escalating mortality and morbidity rate across the country”.

Mr. Sudhi said ideally the COVID-19 tests should be conducted under NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories) accredited pathological laboratories as the non-accredited labs were not conforming to the standards of global best practices prescribed by International Laboratory Accreditation Co-operation (ILAC) and Asia Pacific Accreditation Co-operation (APAC).

Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu said on Tuesday that there was no space for quibbling “over some issues” at a time the country was facing a crisis. The situation, he said in a statement, called for presenting a united front.

“I urge the intellectuals and others to hold back issues, if any, till we overcome the crisis, while exercising their right to seek answers. I call upon them to come forward with suggestions for effectively tackling the menace,” Mr. Naidu said.

Public intellectuals have been critical of the government’s lockdown and the massive humanitarian crisis that has been caused. Many others have questioned the need for a separate “PM Cares” fund when the Prime Minister’s relief fund already exists.

The lockdown was inevitable and the extreme situation called for extreme measures, Mr. Naidu said. He appreciated the work of central and State governments.

“Central and State governments are doing their best to address the concerns and problems of the migrant labourers. I am confident that all necessary measures would be taken in quick time to address the same. Problems and issues being faced on the ground may be brought to the notice of the governments for resolving them in an appropriate manner,” he added.

72,2020/03/31,When ‘GOA’ helps dodge lockdown in Guwahati,"Locals paste hand-written notes on their vehicles reading ‘GOA' - Government of Assam to evade cops.

‘GOA’ is helping people flout the lockdown norms in Guwahati.

With the Assam police cracking down on people who had ventured out of their homes “unnecessarily” after the lockdown began, by levying fines on vehicle-borne violators and in several cases even seizing their vehicles, some locals resorted to sticking hand written notes on the front and rear of their motorcycles and scooters. And a few of these notes proclaim: “On GOA duty”. GOA expands to Government of Assam.

Some of the other notes read “On GOI duty”, “On medical duty”, “Request patient attendant service”.

“The documents of such people are being checked at check-posts across the city and action is taken if they do not have a valid reason to drive or ride,” Munna Prasad Gupta, Guwahati’s Commissioner of Police told The Hindu. “Some people have taken passes from the authorities concerned while those in essential services and exempted from lockdown restrictions are not disturbed,” he added.

Till Monday afternoon, the police had realised ₹5.64 lakh in fines from lockdown violators driving vehicles and detained 1,626 vehicles as well as 425 people.

Still, those with knowledge on the lanes and bylanes of the city were often found giving the police the slip. The lanes are where most grocery shops — some selling vegetables too — were attracting mostly masked locals who were seen discussing coronavirus conspiracy theories and their chances of surviving the “killer flu”.

At one store, anxiety to ensure the essentials had not run out saw a few shoppers forsake the distancing norms and crowd the counter. “Please stand apart for your own good and mine,” Tarunnagar resident Krishna Das requested a middle-aged man, who started to argue before others in the queue shushed him up.

But the Fancybazar and adjoining Machhkhowa areas remain a cause of concern for local residents. These two areas comprise the commercial hub of the northeast, not only that of Guwahati, and had witnessed a near-stampede when the administration relaxed the lockdown restrictions temporarily on March 28.

“Rows of vegetable vendors, buyers and wholesalers and their vehicles crowd the street where my house is located,” said Musaddar Hussain, who lives on Fayaz Ahmed Road in Machhkhowa. “The police arrive only after the business is done from early morning to noon. We live in such dread that we have double-locked our gate,” he added.

Mr. Gupta asserted that the police was ensuring that the shops, which were operating, were following the social distancing norms.

The near-empty roads, however, have not been an insurance against accidents. On Monday night, a web portal reporter named Dimpy Kashyap was killed when a two-wheeler she was riding pillion on reportedly hit an electric pole. Hours later, a car hit and injured a barking deer that came out of its habitat to explore the Noonmati area of the city.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hfgsfz/article31220593.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31THGUWAHATIMOTORIST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/when-goa-helps-dodge-lockdown-in-guwahati/article31220594.ece
73,2020/03/31,"INS seeks two-year tax holiday, import duty waiver on newsprint","Newspapers going above and beyond their call of duty in this crisis time, it says.

The Indian Newspaper Society in a letter to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has sought a two-year tax holiday and removal of all import duty on newsprint seeking an urgent relief for the collapsing newspaper sector.

State Helpline numbers | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

Sounding a note of alarm, the society said the industry has been hit by a “triple whammy of coronavirus, plummeting advertising and customs duty on newsprint which has led to a “hitherto unimaginable situation” where the domestic newspaper industry is on the brink of collapse in a very short period of time.

The newspapers circulation has been badly hit due to the lockdown. The advertising too has plummeted severely curtailing two key revenue streams for the functioning of the newspapers.

Last year, a 10% import duty was imposed on the newsprint taking the total custom duty on newsprint to 15%. In this year Budget, 10% of duty was removed but the newspapers still had to pay 5% duty, which the INS has demanded must be waived off.

“Media’s activity is essential, and our newspapers are going above and beyond their call of duty in this pandemic, with editorial and other colleagues...putting themselves at great personal risk to be at the front lines, to ensure readers get life-saving and other essential information day after day, in the safety of their homes,” the letter said.

It also pointed out that last year well-known English newspapers like the DNA and the Financial Chronicle shut their print editions, while Mumbai’s Afternoon Despatch and Courier had shut down entirely.

74,2020/03/31,Inclement weather adds to farmers’ worries in Punjab and Haryana,"Wheat, ready for harvest, requires bright sunshine at this stage, say farmers

As the wheat crop is all set for harvest in most parts of Punjab and Haryana, the forecast of rain with gusty winds during the next 48 hours has raised farmers’ anxiety as the inclement weather could adversely impact the yield, agri-experts and farmers said on Tuesday.

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), thunderstorms and light rainfall accompanied with lightning and gusty winds are expected in some parts of south-west and north-western parts of Punjab and north-western parts of Haryana between March 31 and April 1. The farmers are worried that the standing crop, all set for harvesting in the next few days, could be damaged.

“A feeble western disturbance in the region..is expected to be a little windy with light showers during the next two days. Isolated parts of Punjab could also witness hailstorms,” Surinder Pal, director at the IMD, Chandigarh, told The Hindu.

Gurbakhsish Singh, a farmer in the Bhawanigarh district Sangrur, said the wheat at this stage requires bright sunshine as it has to be harvested in the next few days. “Rain along with winds will flatten the standing crop, resulting in lower quality and reduced yield..the grain looses its shine once the crop is flattened,” said Mr. Singh, who has sown wheat in nearly 14 acres.

“There had already been several spells of untimely rains this season that have damaged the crop. Besides, I am worried about the shortage of labour on account of the ongoing lockdown and the combine harvesters too.”

Punjab is expecting a bumper wheat production that could cross 182 lakh tonnes this year. Last year, the State had witnessed an output at 182 lakh tonnes, according to the data from the Agriculture department.

Anand Sharma, Deputy Director General of the Agromet Advisory Service Division at the IMD, said: “The disturbance is not very strong and widespread. But yes, where ever there are rains along with winds it is likely to impact the yield,” said Mr. Sharma. Both Punjab and Haryana are major contributors of wheat to the Central pool.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/inclement-weather-adds-to-farmers-worries-in-punjab-and-haryana/article31220428.ece
75,2020/03/31,Coronavirus | MHA tells States to track foreign Tablighi members,"Home Ministry letter directed that they be screened, quarantined and deported, if possible.

The Union Home Ministry wrote to all States and Union Territories on March 21 to “identify, screen and quarantine” 824 foreign Tablighi Jamaat members who were travelling to different parts of the country.

Also read: Nizamuddin centre COVID-19 cases spark a controversy

While the Centre disseminated information to the States about the movement of the religious group’s members, the virus had already spread to various parts of the country.

In Jammu and Kashmir, 80% of the COVID-19-positive cases reported so far are linked to an index patient who attended a gathering at Alami Markaz Banglewali Masjid in south Delhi’s Nizamuddin. The patient died on March 26. In Telangana, 50% of the cases are linked to the meetings organised by the Markaz.

Also read: Coronavirus | 1,000 evacuated from Nizamuddin centre; sent to hospitals, quarantine facilities

On March 28, the Home Ministry shot off another letter to the States that around 2,000 Tablighi Jamaat members from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand who entered India on tourist visa appeared to be “potential carriers” of COVID-19. It asked the States to “screen, quarantine” and deport them if possible. All international flights were suspended on March 23 and the country was placed under a 21-day lockdown on March 24 to prevent the spread of the pandemic.

'Open domain reports'

The March 28 letter said “open domain reports” suggested that several people who attended a religious congregation, held from February 27 to March 1, at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, had tested positive, and hence “thorough screening of those who arrived from Malaysia is urgently needed.” By this time, many cases had been reported in Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.

According to the Home Ministry’s data, since January 1, 2,100 foreigners had visited India for Tablighi activities and the Bureau of Immigration (BOI) started sharing details of all international arrivals with the States from March 6.

But before the Ministry issued the letters, several States had already informed the Union Health Ministry’s control room in New Delhi about the positive cases linked to the Markaz. Health Ministry officials did not respond to messages.

On March 21, a day before the ‘Janta Curfew’ was observed, Jammu and Kashmir officials informed the Health Ministry’s control room of the 65-year-old index patient. The patient had tested positive. His contact-tracing revealed that he had travelled to Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Delhi, Deoband in Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Srinagar from February 16.

An SOS was sent to the Centre on March 21 that the patient had possibly contracted the virus from Indonesian and Thai Tablighi members whom he met in Delhi. Around 15,000 people are said to have come in contact with him directly or indirectly as he had travelled by road, rail and air.

His eight family members have tested positive, and 14 medical staff members, who attended on him at a Srinagar hospital, have been quarantined.

Before this, on March 20, the Telangana police detained 11 foreign nationals from a Tablighi Markaz (centre) in Hyderabad, who were quarantined following an alert from locals.

The Home Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that as on March 21, 824 foreign Tablighi workers were in different parts of the country for missionary work. Further, 1,530 Indian and 216 foreign members were staying in the Delhi Markaz (centre). “All the Tablighi Jamaat members staying at Nizamuddin are being medically examined since March 26” and over 300 of them had showed symptoms.

It said that since March 23, the lockdown has been strictly imposed by the State authorities and the Delhi police, including in and around Nizamuddin, and “Tablighi work came to a halt.”

As reported by The Hindu, the Home Ministry is set to blacklist the 824 foreign Tablighi members who came here on a tourist visa and participated in religious congregations and meetings.

Included in tourist visa

“Usually, all the foreign nationals visiting India as a part of Tablighi team come on the strength of tourist visa. The Home Ministry had already issued guidelines that they should not indulge in missionary work on tourist visa. The State police would be examining categories of visas of all these foreign Tablighi Jamaat workers and take further action in case of violation of visa conditions,” the Ministry said. An official said the role of the local intelligence unit of the Delhi police was also being probed as they failed to report the presence of a large number of foreign nationals at the Markaz.

Assam Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma tweeted on Tuesday that 456 people from Assam were near the Markaz in Delhi and the State government was acting swiftly to quarantine all of them.

“as and when they reach Assam or those who may have reached.”

On March 26, Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba wrote to all the States that there was a “gap” in the monitoring and surveillance of 15 lakh international air travellers who entered India from January 18 to March 23.

Five members of a mosque in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh, including the Maulvi, have been booked for allegedly hiding information about the presence of Indonesian nationals who had returned after attending the Tablighi Jamaat meeting in Delhi on March 21.

Eight under home quarantine

The eight foreigners have been put under home quarantine, said a police officer.

Additional Superintendent of Police Sanjay Kumar said the police located eight Indonesian nationals staying at the Jamunwali Mosque in Nagina. The eight were among the foreign nationals who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat meeting in Nizamuddin in Delhi, said the officer.

They had come to Delhi via Bangladesh, following which they went to Odisha and came to Bijnor on March 21, Mr. Kumar said.

Charges were pressed against the Mufti, the Maulvi and three other members of the mosque as an order under Section 144 was imposed during the prevalence of the COVID-19 and they had also been informed about it, the officer said.

76,2020/03/31,Coronavirus | Nizamuddin centre COVID-19 cases spark a controversy,"The centre is run by the Tablighi Jamaat, a global Islamic organisation.

A controversy erupted on Tuesday, a day after it emerged that a religious centre in Nizamuddin West in Delhi had hosted several thousand people earlier this month notwithstanding the novel coronavirus pandemic.

Several prominent leaders expressed contrasting views about the situation around the centre — Alami Markaz Banglewali Masjid — where hundreds of people were stationed after a religious conference was cut short due to the sudden lockdown.

The centre is run by the Tablighi Jamaat, a global Islamic organisation.

Hashtags ‘SamaajKeDushman’ (anti-social) and Islamophobia’ were trending in the wake of the incident.

Addressing a digital press conference here, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal termed the gathering at the centre “an irresponsible act”. He requested religious leaders across faiths to ensure no large gatherings took place in the city.

He said 441 of the 1,548 people, who were a part of the gathering, exhibited symptoms of COVID-19 and 1,107 had been sent to quarantine facilities.

Mr. Kejriwal said the Delhi government has asked the Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal to direct the police to register an FIR against the administration of the centre.

Meanwhile, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Amanatullah Khan questioned the Delhi Police on why it did not make arrangements to send back the trapped people even though he had informed the DCP South East and ACP Nizamuddin at around 12 p.m. on March 23 that around 1,000 people are trapped in the Nizamuddin centre.

Party colleague and Kalkaji MLA Atishi called for ‘strong’ action against both the police and the administrators of the centre. She sought to know what action the police took against the gathering, especially when a police station is in close proximity to the centre.

Activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan tweeted, “Read the actual facts about the Nizamuddin Markaz covid cases. There was an Int Conference going on there when the lockdown was suddenly announced. They kept the authorities informed at all times & kept requesting them to allow the visitors to be escorted out. Unfair to blame them.”

Amid the lockdown announced by the government in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Central Information Commission is planning to institutionalise digital platforms for its hearings so that Right to Information (RTI) applicants can attend them from their homes even after normalcy is restored, sources in the panel said.

Chief Information Commissioner Bimal Julka on Tuesday convened a full commission meeting using one of the digital platforms which can connect about 40 people at different locations for a video meeting, a first in the history of the transparency panel, they said.

Full commission meetings are normally held on Tuesdays where all the Information Commissioners are present to discuss various issues related to the functioning of the panel, the highest adjudicating body of RTI matters.

Encouraged by the success of the digital meeting, the Commission has decided to try it as a formal way of conducting hearings thereby doing away with the requirement of applicants to come to the national capital or to reach NIC centres in their respective districts to attend the meetings which can now be done through video conferencing, they said.

The Commission is planning to start using the digital hearings after April 15 once the lockdown is lifted, they said.

“We have asked all the registries of the Information Commissioners to start preparing briefs of the cases to be conducted digitally using applications on phones. We are testing a number of platforms to make it a success as the applicant can easily attend the hearing using these applications from the place of their convenience,” a senior official said.

The issue relating to Central Public Information Officers carrying original case files will be ironed out as modalities will be finalised, officials said.

The Information Commissioners have also started using the platform to communicate with their staff members simultaneously for the running of their registry, they said.

The commission, which has 35,000 pending appeals and complaints filed by RTI applicants, suspended all its hearings after the announcement of the 21-day lockdown from March 25 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

78,2020/03/31,Coronavirus lockdown | Migrant workers need visible and active support from govt: Yechury,"Attempts to create social disharmony must be resisted, says CPI(M) leader

With the government clamping down on the movement of migrant workers who are fleeing the cities in the absence of any means to earn, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said those who have stayed back need “visible and active” support from the government.

“Private charity, while welcome, is not a replacement for the government failing to discharge its basic constitutional duty,” Mr. Yechury said. Attempts to create social disharmony, tarnish sections, ostracise workers and the vulnerable by communal, casteist and sectarian forces must be resisted, he said. “ If not, India’s health and humanitarian crisis — with the Centre’s knee-jerk responses — will only worsen the situation.”

Mr. Yechury accused the Narendra Modi government of using the plank of “cooperative federalism” to come to power but failing to implement it. “He [Mr. Modi] must listen to the State governments and provide them all the support that they need, instead of trying to centralise power. The States are best placed to defeat it, with the Centre’s support,” he said.

Mr. Yechury said so far the government’s efforts to tackle the outbreak have been opaque. Union Ministers for Health and Home Affairs, who are the nodal persons to handle this crisis, don’t hold daily briefings. When there was a PM National Relief Fund, the government came up with PM CARES Fund without explaining what the need for the latter was. “We need clear and honest information from the Central government on COVID-19 virus. The attempt to divert and obstruct genuine queries is akin to playing with the lives of millions of Indians. Why are the Health Minister and the Home Minister not leading the briefing every evening?”

The ministry on Tuesday said it has initiated action on the prime minister’s advice to work for scientific evidence-based solutions and decided to set up a channel to enlist various suggestions and proposals from AYUSH practitioners and institutions, and examine their viability through a group of scientists.

Further, in follow-up to the call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to help stop big claims without evidence about treatment of COVID-19, the Ministry of AYUSH has initiated steps to curb such claims through creation of awareness, it said in a statement.

The ministry is using platforms like video-conferencing and social media to reach out to AYUSH practitioners and involve them in stopping and discouraging false and unsupported claims.

In a video conference held on March 30, nearly 100 thought leaders from different disciplines of AYUSH participated, and among other things, also resolved to work for spreading awareness against such inappropriate claims.

Taking up the matter suo motu, a Division Bench headed by Chief Justice Gita Mittal on March 30 asked the Inspectors General of Police of Kashmir and Jammu to ensure that adequate security is provided to healthcare providers who are making every possible attempt to control the spread of the coronavirus.

The High Court appointed Monika Kohli as amicus curiae to assist the court on matters related to COVID-19 in the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.

The two Union Territories have recorded over 60 cases of COVID-19 so far.

The court, which for the first time in its history held the hearing through video-conferencing and voice call, also took note of a grievance regarding the plight of the residents of the two Union Territories lodged in prisons in other parts of the country.

It was submitted before the court that people misbehaved with some doctors working at the two hospitals in Srinagar, where quarantining and isolation of suspected and infected patients were being done.

“The doctors have complained that the persons who have been isolated are misbehaving and have also resorted to damaging available facilities. The doctors are apprehensive about their own security at the hands of the persons who have been lodged,” lawyer Faisal Qadri from Kashmir told the court.

In its 11-page order, the court said, “There can be no manner of doubt that the safety and security of all health providers which would include not only doctors but also the nurses, the paramedics, mess boys, safai karamcharies as well as administrative staff at all government facilities has to be strictly ensured.”

“Such care and protection have to be provided to all healthcare givers in all hospitals in the Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh as well. We therefore direct the Secretary, Department of Health and Medical Education of both the Union Territories together with the IGP, Jammu, IGP, Kashmir and IGP, Ladakh to ensure that complete safety and security is provided to the personnel who are serving at all government facilities,” the court added.

It also said that “if necessary, the present security should also be beefed up to ensure that no person is able to leave the medical facility till the period of quarantine or isolation is completed” and reiterate its directions to the authorities to take strict action against the persons who are violating any instruction issued by the Central government especially where their conduct would result in the spread of the COVID-19 infection and endanger lives.

Ms. Kohli and Mr. Qadri also expressed deep concern about the safety and well-being of people, who have been lodged in jails outside Jammu and Kashmir, with regard to care which is required for their protection from the COVID-19 infection.

“We direct the Secretary, of the UT of J&K to ascertain and ensure that well-being of all such prisoners,” the order of the Bench of Justice Mittal and Justice Sindhu Sharma said.

The High Court also asked the Union Territory lawyer about the decision of a high-powered committee, as directed by the Supreme Court, which will examine prisoners who are required to be released from jails, but advocate Amit Gupta, representing the Union Territory, was unable to inform about the proceedings of this committee.

The court also took note of people going out in the morning and said it appears that there is some misunderstanding about the requirement of the lockdown as a large number of people are resorting to their usual strolls, loitering and morning walks in local parks, etc.

“A direction is issued to the law enforcing authorities and park owning authorities [all municipal corporations, development authorities] to prevent access to public parks, etc. which are normally used for such purposes by the citizens.

“The law enforcing agencies shall strictly ensure the lockdown and prevent any kind of activity which could adversely impact social distancing in any manner,” it said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mr93v2/article31218654.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-CORONA-JAMMU-NA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-provide-security-to-doctors-other-healthcare-providers-hc-directs-jk-police/article31218660.ece
82,2020/03/31,Coronavirus | Supreme Court upholds right to discuss COVID-19,"The court asks asks the media to publish official version to avoid panic; government told to issue a daily bulletin

The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the right to free discussion about COVID-19, even as it directed the media to refer to and publish the official version of the developments in order to avoid inaccuracies and large-scale panic.

It ordered the government to start a daily bulletin on COVID-19 developments through all media avenues in the next 24 hours.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

A Bench, led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, was responding to a request from the Central government that media outlets, in the “larger interest of justice”, should only publish or telecast anything on COVID-19 after ascertaining the factual position from the government.

A Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) report in the court, signed by Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, explained that “any deliberate or inaccurate” reporting by the media, particularly web portals, had a “serious and inevitable potential of causing panic in larger section of the society”.

The Ministry said any panic reaction in the midst of an unprecedented situation based on such reporting would harm the entire nation. Creating panic is also a criminal offence under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, the Ministry said.

But the court took a view balancing free press and the need to avoid panic in society during an unprecedented crisis. “We expect the media [print, electronic or social] to maintain a strong sense of responsibility and ensure that unverified news capable of causing panic is not disseminated. A daily bulletin by the Government of India through all media avenues, including social media and forums to clear the doubts of people, would be made active within a period of 24 hours as submitted by the Solicitor- General of India. We do not intend to interfere with the free discussion about the pandemic, but direct the media refer to and publish the official version about the developments,” the court ordered. Noting that the 21-day nationwide lockdown was “inevitable” in the face of an “unprecedented global crisis” like the COVID-19 pandemic, the government blamed “fake and misleading” messages on social media for creating widespread panic, which led to mass “barefoot” journey of migrant workers from cities to their native villages in rural India.

Fake news

“Deliberate or inadvertent fake news and material capable of causing a serious panic in the minds of the public is found to be the single most unmanageable hindrance in the management of this challenge... Will set up a separate unit headed by a Joint Secretary-level officer in the Health Ministry and consisting of eminent specialist doctors from recognised institutions like AIIMS to answer the queries of citizens,” the Ministry’s 39-page status report said.

The Ministry said the Narendra Modi government, in fact, took “pro-active, pre-emptive and timely” action 13 days before even the World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 a “public health emergency of international concern”. Very few countries responded as well as India.

But the mass migration of the poor would defeat the preventive measures taken by the Central government, the Ministry said. It said “there was no necessity for migrant workers to rush to their villages” when the Centre, fully conscious that no citizen should be deprived of basic amenities, had announced a ₹1.70 lakh crore package under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana to take care of their daily needs.

“Mass migration defeats the government’s preventive measures... They inevitably and unknowingly defeat the social-distancing norm,” Mr. Bhalla informed the court.

The mass migration had to be stopped to protect the rural population so far “untouched” by the virus. Some State governments had initially arranged buses for the migrant workers, but later decided not to allow further movement. “If infection penetrates rural India, the epidemic, which has taken the form of a pandemic, will manifest itself in a still severe form, making its unmanageable,” the report said.

At one point, the Ministry points out that census figures put the total migrant population at 4.14 crore, and now only 5 to 6 lakh persons, “by a very rough estimate”, were migrating back from the COVID-19-infected cities to their native places.

The report said 21,064 relief camps had been set up by the State governments and the Union Territories at the direction of the Central government and 6,66,291 persons had been sheltered. The Ministry said 22,88,279 stranded migrant workers, the poor, homeless and destitute persons were provided food.

The report said 15.25 lakh passengers were screened at airports, 40,000 people were screened at 12 major seaports and 65 minor ports and 20 lakh people were screened at all land borders. It said 3.48 lakh passengers were being monitored. The coronavirus testing facility had increased from just one laboratory in Pune in January 2020 to 118 laboratories across the country, with a capacity to undertake 15,000 tests a day. Besides, the government has coordinated with 47 private lab chains having more than 20,000 collection centres. Orders have been placed for 40,000 ventilators. The Centre said it had already instructed its Ministries and Departments, particularly the Defence Ministry, the Railways, paramilitary forces and the Ministry of Labour, to create dedicated COVID-19 blocks/hospitals. There were 1.35 lakh isolation beds on the ready and 637 train coaches across 17 different zones had been converted into quarantine wards. Essential commodities such as grain, salt, sugar, milk, fertilisers, petroleum products and coal were provided for. The Railways had loaded more than 3,435 racks with medical supplies in the last five days.

The government said it had started preparations against COVID-19 on the same day China went public about the disease. Thermal screenings at three major international airports had started on January 18. “Thermal screening of travellers began much before the first case was reported in India,” the Ministry highlighted.

A total of 21 travel advisories were issued, starting from the first one on January 30. The situation was monitored at the highest political and executive levels, led by the Prime Minister. The management efforts were coordinated by a Group of Ministers, led by the Union Health Minister, and a Joint Monitoring Group under the Director-General of Health Services provided technical support.

The report referred to how the public embraced the Janata Curfew. “People overwhelmingly expressed their gratitude to the frontline employees fighting coronavirus at 5 p.m. on the day of Janata Curfew by clapping, singing from their homes,” the Ministry said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ye339e/article31218564.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MIGRANTWORKERS2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-supreme-court-upholds-right-to-discuss-covid-19/article31218565.ece

She said the ministry was continuously monitoring the ongoing lockdown situation in coordination with the states and union territories and the situation till now has been satisfactory.

84,2020/03/31,Coronavirus outbreak | Congress urges govt to get more COVID-19 testing kits,"Offer interest subvention on three-month moratorium on loans and EMIs and arrange for harvesting and storage of Rabi crops, it says

As the 21-day lockdown completed its first week, the Congress on Tuesday asked the Union government to procure more coronavirus (COVID-19) testing kits, offer interest subvention on the three-month moratorium on loans and EMIs, and arrange for harvesting and storage of Rabi crops.

Watch | What is contact tracing?

In an online interaction with the media, former Union Minister Manish Tewari asserted that as India moved from secondary to the next stage of the pandemic, the government should procure and supply testing kits to the State governments on priority.

“We are testing 32 people for a population of 10 lakh, while in England, it is 1921 and in the United States, it is 2600....The only antidote to testing is test, test and more tests,” he said.

The State governments were keeping the testing kits for a time when the number of cases may shoot up, he claimed. So far, only four companies have been allowed to make the kits while 17 had applied for permission. The others have been asked to get approvals from the European Unions and the United States’ Food and Drug Administration before allowing their commercial production, he said.

“We would urge the government to find a way out without comprising on quality. Claims about India not seeing community transmission can be made only if there is large-scale testing,” he stated.

“India and Bharat exposed”

Mr. Tewari, who wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday to provide transportation to migrant workers, said the current lockdown once again exposed “India and Bharat” as migrant workers were forced to have a chemical-based showered for sanitisation in Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly district.

“There is one India who is watching Netflix while a father in Bharat has to walk for miles with his wife and children”. The exodus of migrant workers would add to the problems of farmers in States such as Punjab, where harvesting of Rabi crops was to take place in the next 15 days. The government should arrange for harvesting and storage of Rabi crops whose advance estimates suggest a production of 152.7 million tonnes of food grains. “We urge the Prime Minister, the Agriculture Minister and the Finance Minister to offer relief as small farmers will be hit the hardest”, he noted.

The fund, as per a March 30 Home Ministry order, accessed by PTI, is meant “to procure COVID-19 preventive items.”

Officials said a proposal to carry out relief works and providing essential commodities to those displaced or affected by the ongoing lockdown in view of the viral disease outbreak was first made by the paramilitary force on March 25 after which the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) granted the sanction.

Data | Which States recorded the most coronavirus cases, deaths, and the best testing rates?

The sanction for financial year 2019-20 has been made under the ‘civic action programme’ to the country’s largest Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) that has about 3.25 lakh personnel in its ranks.

CRPF Director General A.P. Maheshwari told PTI that the fund will be utilised to procure protective masks, sanitisers, food items and other essentials required by the people.

“All the CRPF formations in the country have been asked to step up their action and identify the population and areas in their vicinity who need help.”

“The force is on a mission mode to help the citizens of the country in these challenging times,” the CRPF chief said.

Maheshwari added that the force has received the ₹10 crore fund from the MHA and this money will be used effectively to deal with the situation arising out of the coronavirus outbreak.

‘Madadgaar’ helpline expanded

The force has also scaled up its Kashmir-based helpline called ‘madadgaar’ to make it services available to the distressed and needy across the country.

A senior official said staffers and family members of other Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) have also approached the helpline and are being assisted for delivery of essential items and dissemination of information.

The ‘madadgaar’ helpline number 14411 has received about 2,500 calls and got over 2.5 lakh impressions on its various social media platforms where people sought help in the wake of the viral disease outbreak and the subsequent lockdown imposed in the country from March 25.

The helpline will now work in close coordination with other CAPFs and State authorities to help the needy, the DG said.

Launched in July 2017, the helpline has recently floated a new WhatsApp number 70828 14411 for the benefit of the public.

“We have increased the manpower of the helpline and are further bolstering its capabilities,” Maheshwari said.

Air India pilots have expressed concern over “flimsy protective gear, inadequate sanitisers, shoddy disinfection procedure” as they embark on flights chartered by countries like Germany and the UK to repatriate their citizens stranded in India due to the nationwide lockdown over COVID-19.

Two pilots’ unions, the Executive Pilots of Air India and Indian Pilots’ Guild, have written to the Minister of State for Civil Aviation Hardeep Singh Puri raising questions about their safety as they continue to work on the front line during a pandemic.

The letter states that the personal protective equipment is “ill-fitting and flimsy and tears easily on rescue flights, sanitisers are not provided in sufficient quantities and disinfection processes are short of industry best practices”.

The pilots have also raised questions about the lack of medical facilities as the Air India Medical Services Department has been allowed to work from home, which the cockpit crew say implies, “that any illness suffered by the crew or their families because of these high-risk flights is the sole responsibility of the crew.”

The have also asked why the airline has not provided any additional medical insurance to cabin crew and pilots to cover them for any COVID-19 related risks. On the contrary, the airline has issued circulars to its employees informing them, “enquires on reimbursement of bills, sick leave, fitness certificate, are considered as undesirable”.

While some of these pilots have operated special flights to Wuhan and Rome to bring back Indians and have operated flights for countries like Israel to help their citizens return home, they have not been paid 70% of their salaries for the past three months and “have also recently been informed by our management of a substantial pay cut, while in the midst of the above mentioned COVID rescue operations!”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/oseopk/article31216764.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI31-03-2020000017A,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ai-pilots-say-safety-protocols-during-covid-ops-inadequate/article31216765.ece
88,2020/03/31,"Coronavirus | Health Ministry, Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser differ on mask use","It doesn't recommend the use of health mask or N95 mask that are expensive, not-reusable and largely used in hospital settings.

India’s highest science advisory body, the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser (PSA), and the Union Health Ministry appear out of sync on whether masks should be widely used by people.

The Ministry’s standing recommendation is that not everybody should be wearing masks. Among those who are not healthcare workers, only those who had a cough or exhibited signs of a flu or a respiratory illness need to be wearing them as did those caring for COVID-19 patients. The reason this isn’t recommended for the public at large — though now almost anyone on the street can be seen to be wearing them — is that it will lead to a shortage and unavailability for doctors, nurses and other hospital staff.

Also read: Coronavirus | AIIMS staff told to reuse masks, personal protection equipment

On Tuesday, however, the office of the PSA through the Press Information Bureau recommended the widespread use of masks. It endorsed, above all, home-made masks that could easily be made and were reusable with washing and sanitising.

“The proposed guide is meant to provide a simple outline of best practices to make, use and reuse masks to enable NGOs and individuals to self-create such masks and accelerate widespread adoption of masks across India. The key criteria for proposed designs are Ease of Access to Materials, Easy of Making at Home, Ease of Use and Reuse. Wearing of masks is especially recommended for people living in densely populated areas across India,” notes the advisory, which was made public via the Press

The office of the PSA is a key coordinating agency among government scientific bodies and industry to accelerate decisions on dealing with COVID-19. It does not recommend the use of the health mask or the N95 mask that are expensive, not-reusable and largely used in hospital settings.

K. Vijay Raghavan, Principal Scientific Adviser, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Also read: When do you need to wear a mask?

The Health Ministry, which is the nodal agency for monitoring the pandemic, said it was “studying the recommendations” of the office of the PSA.

Health Ministry spokesperson Lav Agrawal said at the daily press briefing on Tuesday, “The World Health Organization hasn’t given a categorical opinion on its [mask] usage. However, a technical committee is looking into this issue and suitable guidelines will be issued soon. Our stress is on social distancing. We request that not everyone wear a mask. We have defined guidelines on who should and shouldn’t be wearing one.”Ministry’s advisory

Its most recent advisory, as on the March 17, was that masks need be worn by the healthy only if they are taking care of a sick person with suspected COVID infection. It also advises masks for those who are coughing and sneezing.

Watch | Coronavirus: Can masks protect you?

Raman Gangakhedkar, who was also at the briefing as a representative of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said: “There’s a wide gap between the number of cases in the United States and India and the risk of exposure isn’t as much here. Hence only those sick or at risk of exposure should be wearing them.”

Other than the question of shortage, the scientific consensus was that COVID-19 was not an airborne disease and most people contracted it through coming into contact with infectious droplets picked up from surfaces.

“The government's policy regarding the use of masks is evolving. Probably they are now taking more notice of the fact there may be a sizeable number of asymptomatic carriers of the infection — some studies suggest nearly 25% of COVID-19 infected may be asymptomatic — and wearing a mask is a good precautionary measure,” said Sunit Singh, molecular virologist, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University.

The March 31 advisory from the office of the PSA recommends the use of home-made cotton masks that are reusable after appropriate washing and disinfection that can be done at home.

It also a cites a study that says “... if 50% of the population were to wear masks, only 50% of the population would be infected by the virus. Once 80% of the population wears a mask, the outbreak can be stopped immediately,”. This however is from a 2019 study in journal Risk Analysis and based on a modelling study on containing influenza outbreaks. Sars Cov-2 is comparably contagious but different in structure from influenza viruses.

On March 27, George Gao, Director, Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview to Science that the United States and Europe made “a big mistake” by not wearing masks. “Droplets play a very important role — you’ve got to wear a mask, because when you speak, there are always droplets coming out of your mouth. Many people have asymptomatic or presymptomatic infections. If they are wearing face masks, it can prevent droplets that carry the virus from escaping and infecting others.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/d6p16l/article31216535.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MASKKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-indias-health-ministry-office-of-the-principal-scientific-adviser-differ-on-mask-use/article31216536.ece

The anxiety and fear of the migrants should be understood by the police and other authorities. As directed by the Union of India, they should deal with the migrants in a humane manner.

Bobde, said.

The court ordered the government to ensure that migrant workers stopped from crossing the inter-State borders were given food, shelter and medicines. The government said it was imperative to stop the mass migration as there was a likelihood that three out of every 10 workers might be carrying the coronavirus. The court expressed its satisfaction with the government measures.

The Bench, through videoconferencing, asked the government to urge community and religious leaders to speak to the migrant workers lodged in shelters. It asked the government to have trained counsellors talk to the workers.

Authentic information

The court directed the government, represented by Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, to set up an expert committee and a dedicated portal within 24 hours to disseminate authentic information about the virus and stop the spread of fake news. A status report filed by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs said the propagation of deliberate or inadvertent false information was the “single most unimaginable hindrance” faced by the government in its battle against the virus.

The Bench, comprising Justice L. Nageswara Rao, asked the government to follow up on persons identified as infected and quarantined.

Mr. Mehta said the lockdown was necessary to stop the spread of infection, and all the people found walking back were shifted to the nearest shelters. When the court asked whether the State governments were following the Centre’s direction on mass movement, Mr. Mehta replied that the Centre had requested the States to do so. “We are facing an unprecedented situation. There is a need for unprecedented orders,” Mr. Mehta justified the 21-day lockdown.

Chief Justice Bobde said that Section 188 (disobedience to order promulgated by public servant) of the IPC makes it a penal offence to disobey orders made by government authorities in public interest. A person found guilty under the provision can face a six-month term of imprisonment or a fine of Rs. 1000 or both.

The Union government on Tuesday announced a new portal to help and inform stranded foreign tourists due to the lockdown following the COVID-19 outbreak.

“... with an aim to extend support to the foreign tourists who are stranded in India, [the government] has come up with a portal to disseminate information regarding the services that can be availed by foreign tourists who are stuck far away from their home land,” the Tourism Ministry said in a statement.

Portal ‘Stranded in India’ aims to act as a support network for foreign tourists stuck in various parts of the country.

“The entire world is facing a truly unprecedented situation arising out of the Coronavirus and it is a constant endeavour to ensure the wellbeing of tourists, especially the ones that travel from foreign countries,” it said.

Among other things, the portal will provide information on COVID-19 helpline numbers, call centres that foreign tourists can reach out for help and details of Ministry of External Affairs’ control centres along with their contact information.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xcid7h/article31215856.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KOLKATAPTI31-03-2020000018A,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-portal-to-help-stranded-foreign-tourists/article31215857.ece
92,2020/03/31,RAI’s Food Soldier initiative to ease supplies during lockdown,"Food Soldiers are those individuals engaged in supply, storage, retail and delivery of essential products

The Retailers Association of India (RAI) has partnered with the Centre and other players in the retail and food segment to launch, the ‘Food Soldier Project’, an initiative to ease supply of essential products in the wake of the ongoing nation-wide lockdown.

“Food Soldiers are all those individuals engaged in the supply, storage, retail and delivery of essential products who are risking their lives to ensure ythat consumer needs for food and essentials are met,” an RAI statement said.

The initiative is a strategic approach with three main objectives including optimising the supply chain for retailers of all sizes, including ‘kiranas’, ensuring that there is adequate staff in the stores and that consumers get timely delivery of essential goods in the comforts of their home.

The industry body said that modern retail has de-grown by 30 to 40 per cent in the last 15 days due to supply chain problems, shortage of manpower with attendance below 30 percent and lower customer entry due to social distancing.

Presently, consumers are buying pure low margin items and hence the reduced sales give a margin of around 12 per cent against the normal 21 per cent.

“Compulsory direct home delivery is not viable in a country where e-commerce is at only two percent. However, considering the large network of kirana stores of close to 12 million, Indians are not as severely impacted as the rest of the world for access to daily need items,” said the statement.

It further said that considering the acute shortage of manpower due to the exodus of workers and travel restrictions during the lockdown, offline stores are finding it difficult to manage walk-in customers and home deliveries at the same time.

To ease the situation and mitigate bottlenecks in the supply chain, RAI has formed effective WhatsApp groups across states which comprises government officials and representatives of private entities including corporates and retailers.

“Furthermore, steps are being taken to deploy the workforce that is employed with non-food retailers in the stores that are selling essentials to overcome the shortage of manpower. RAI is also in discussions with online food delivery firms like Swiggy and Zomato to tie-up with retailers for the last mile delivery of essentials,” the statement said.

With these steps RAI expects the situation to improve in the next three to four days.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lime9n/article31215841.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31MPFOODSOLDIERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rais-food-soldier-initiative-to-ease-supplies-during-lockdown/article31215842.ece
93,2020/03/31,Human Rights Watch tells Centre to withdraw Internet curbs in J&K amid COVID-19,"Rights group says restrictions can be deadly during pandemic.

The Human Rights Watch (HRW), a non-governmental rights group, has called upon India to withdraw restrictions on Internet in J&K and warned that shutting down or restricting access to the Internet could be deadly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“During a health crisis, access to timely and accurate information is crucial. People use the Internet for updates on health measures, movement restrictions, and relevant news to protect themselves and others. Internet shutdowns block people from getting essential information and services,” said Deborah Brown, senior digital rights researcher and advocate of HRW.

“During a global pandemic, when people around the world are isolated and access to information can mean life or death, it’s time to impose a moratorium on Internet shutdowns. Governments should ensure immediate access to the fastest and broadest possible service for all. During this global health crisis, shutdowns directly harm people’s health and lives, and undermine efforts to bring the pandemic under control,” Ms. Brown added.

The HRW named India among four countries, including Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Myanmar, where there are restrictions on access on Internet.

The group pointed out that for many children and others seeking education, Internet was needed to continue learning as schools shutter around the world.

“Internet shutdowns can have a greater impact on women, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals, people with disabilities, and older people who may rely on the Internet for online support services,” the HRW said.

India, it said, had the most Internet shutdowns, with at least 385 ordered since 2012. In Jammu and Kashmir, the Indian government imposed a complete communications blackout in August 2019, which stopped families from communicating and disrupted the local economy. Phone services were gradually restored, but it was only after the Supreme Court found the Internet shutdown illegal in January 2020 that service was partially restored, and only at 2G speed.

It said since COVID-19 had spread to India, people had reported “not being able to access websites that provide information about the pandemic due to highly restricted speeds that make accessing anything beyond text messages nearly impossible”.

“Countries should prioritize their responsibilities under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and avoid complicity in human rights abuses, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic,” the HRW said.

Internet has been partially restored in J&K. High-speed service is only available on the fixedlines. Only post-paid mobile connections have low bandwidth speed of 2G. Most pre-paid connections have no Internet service available.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/iqd3r1/article31215215.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kashmirjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/human-rights-watch-tells-centre-to-withdraw-internet-curbs-in-jk-amid-covid-19/article31215179.ece
94,2020/03/31,"Preventing stigma related to COVID-19 requires full-throated campaign, says expert Gita Sen","“It would have the effect of removing the fear that the information barrage is creating”

Gita Sen, director and distinguished professor, Ramalingaswami Centre on Equity & Social Determinants of Health (RCESDH), Public Health Foundation of India, spoke to The Hindu about how the stigma attached to COVID-19 is much like what was seen with HIV/AIDS and how it is a result of poor knowledge.

In this time of stress associated with COVID-19, why is a small group of people being stigmatised? How is this different from other health crises we have faced?

Stigma and fear are the result of people’s poor knowledge about COVID-19 and how it spreads. This is compounded by the large amount of fake news and false information being generated today. Some groups face the additional element that discrimination against them is already there, and COVID-19 has become one more reason to stigmatise them. In terms of stigma, the closest we have come is with HIV/AIDS patients. But HIV-related stigma did not extend, in general, to health workers.

Which are the groups most vulnerable to stigma related to COVID-19?

Three sets of people are being stigmatised now:

those in quarantine, whether they have tested positive or not – many state governments are violating medical ethics codes by publicising address details, marking doors of their homes with stickers and even large posters, stamping them with indelible ink – and stories are coming in of people being thrown out of their homes, shunned, etc

health workers from doctors down to the frontline workers are facing stigma and discrimination including losing their homes because their landlords somehow think they will be contagious

those who traditionally face discrimination like migrant workers, people from the northeast, victims of religious or other persecution.

What can we as government/community do to prevent this?

We have a long way to go because we haven’t even fully acknowledged the economic and health challenges of 80% of our people in what we have done so far. The main responses put forward thus far, needed as they may be, such as social distancing, handwashing and sanitising, nourishing food are out of reach for the large majority of people.

The most vulnerable groups to the virus are the poor in urban slums, migrant workers with no homes, people living in close proximity with little possibility of social distancing or even hand-washing. Very important among them are women who are the traditional providers of home-based health care, which is where many poor people get their health care. These same citizens of our country are undernourished and have few resources to combat non-communicable diseases even in ordinary times.

Think of a woman who has to feed her family, take care of sick people and is herself suffering from poor general health – that is the section that is going to be very vulnerable.

Preventing stigma requires a full-throated campaign of public information. How good it would be if the Union Health Minister were to give a daily briefing to let people know what is happening, together with creative social media campaigns about the virus itself that gets rid of the stigma? How valuable it would be if the Prime Minister were to speak against stigma, on behalf of health workers, on behalf of migrant workers and those suffering discrimination, in support of women?

We need clear, informative and fun messages of the kind that our social marketers surely know how to produce. Think how creative a series of Amul ads could be! People also need to understand that the same health worker that you stigmatise today may be the one who you may have to turn to tomorrow.

What effect would this have on the groups of people who are discriminated against?

It would have the effect of removing the fear that the COVID-19 information barrage is creating. And that is the most important need.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/on6p1q/article30805712.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-gita-sen-dandavid-twitter-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/preventing-stigma-related-to-covid-19-requires-full-throated-campaign-says-expert-gita-sen/article31215075.ece

West Bengal on Tuesday recorded the third death as a 48-year-old woman from Salkia in Howrah district succumbed to COVID-19. She was admitted to the Howrah State General Hospital and died late on Monday evening even before the test reports were received by the hospital authorities.

“We had got the samples by 12 noon and by later in the evening we confirmed that the patent from Howrah was suffering from coronavirus infection,” a doctor at the Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research and SSKM Hospital, a State-run testing facility in Kolkata told The Hindu.

The nurses at the State-run hospital in Howrah district, where the patient passed away, alleged that she was admitted at the general ward on Sunday and they were not provided with any personal protective equipment while treating her. A few of the paramedical staff blamed the hospital authorities for exposing the entire staff to an infected patient.

Her family members have been directed to remain in isolation. The police authorities are trying to ensure strict lockdown was enforced in Salkia. It was learnt that the woman visited north Bengal a few week ago.

On Monday, a 44 -year-old woman from Kalimpong died of the pandemic at the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital. On March 23, the State reported its first death when a 57-year-old man passed away at a private hospital in Kolkata.

96,2020/03/31,COVID-19: G20 Trade Ministers agree to ensure uninterrupted flow of vital medical supplies,"The Ministers stated that they will take immediate necessary measures to facilitate trade in those essential goods.

Trade and investment Ministers of the G-20 group have agreed to ensure fair trade and continued flow of vital medicines as well as other essential goods to tackle COVID-19 pandemic.

According to a joint statement issued after a video conference, the ministers agreed to support the availability and accessibility of essential medical supplies at affordable prices, on an equitable basis, where they are most needed and will guard against profiteering and unjustified price increases.

The ministers also called for working together for a free and fair international trade.

“As we fight the pandemic both individually and collectively and seek to mitigate its impacts on international trade and investment, we will continue to work together to deliver a free, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent, predictable and stable trade and investment environment, and to keep our markets open.

“We are actively working to ensure the continued flow of vital medical supplies and equipment, critical agricultural products, and other essential goods and services across borders, for supporting the health of our citizens,” the statement said.

The Ministers stated that they will take immediate necessary measures to facilitate trade in those essential goods.

They also agreed to implement those measures, upholding the principle of international solidarity, considering the evolving needs of other countries for emergency supplies and humanitarian assistance.

“We will ensure smooth and continued operation of the logistics networks that serve as the backbone of global supply chains. We will explore ways for logistics networks via air, sea and land freight to remain open, as well as ways to facilitate essential movement of health personnel and business people across borders, without undermining the efforts to prevent the spread of the virus,” they said in the statement.

It added that the countries will continue monitoring and assessing the impact of the pandemic on trade.

They also called upon the international organizations to provide an in-depth analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on world trade, investment and global value chains.

“We will continue working with them to establish coordinated approaches and collect and share good practices to facilitate flows of essential goods and services,” the statement added.

The leaders of the G20 last week pledged to inject USD 5 trillion into the global economy to counter the pandemic amid forecasts of deep recession.

They have also demanded that their salary, which is allegedly not paid since January, be immediately released for them to carry out their work.

Brijesh Kumar, general secretary of the ambulance worker’s union Jeevandayni Swasthya Vibhag, wrote to the GVK EMRI saying the workers be provided with proper gloves, masks, PPE kit, sanitizers and other necessary items. Their salaries should also be immediately released while also being provided with an incentive amount during the time of COVID-19.

Mr. Kumar also demanded that the ₹50 lakh insurance package announced by the Centre for health care workers be immediately implemented.

An ambulance worker in Pratapgarh Madhukar Singh provided a snapshot of the alleged shortcomings faced by them. “Four of us have got only 15-20 masks. How many days will they last? These masks get spoilt after two hours of use,” he told reporters.

Mr. Singh said that ambulance workers did not receive their salary for the last two months while having to work without proper masks, sanitizers or gloves.

“We don’t have sanitizers, gloves or masks for our safety, considering [we are working with] the Coronavirus-positive patients,” he said.

Hanuman Pandey, president of the union, said he spoke to U.P. Health Minister Jai Pratap Singh but was told to contact the private company employing the workers. “You are private employees, talk to your company, he told me,” said Mr. Pandey.

Around 16,000 ambulance workers are on the field currently. “We are on the verge of starvation as we have not get our salary for two months and on top of that, we are not getting any safety amenities,” he said.

98,2020/03/31,IRDAI assures fast track treatment for COVID-19 product proposals,"On servicing and claims of existing policyholders, the regulator said claims arising on account of COVID-19 should be processed expeditiously

Insurance regulator Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has assured insurers it will process on a fast-track mode applications seeking approval for products that cover risks arising out of COVID-19.

“Insurers are strongly encouraged to devise appropriate insurance products that would provide protection from risks arising out of Covid-19. The Authority is committed to process such product approval applications on a fast track mode,” K.Ganesh, Member (Life) of the IRDAI, said issuing COVID-19 related instructions to insurers.

On servicing and claims of existing policyholders, the regulator said claims arising on account of COVID-19 should be processed expeditiously. It wanted insurers to adopt simplified, expedited claim procedures for such cases. Other claims should also be processed within the prescribed period by making special efforts.

With regard to timeline for issue of policy documents, it said as a special case an additional 30 days is allowed for insurers to dispatch documents for policies issued between March 15 and April 30. Also, an additional 21 days is being allowed to redress all complaints during the same, one and half month period as against the normal response time of 15 days, due to the prevailing lockdown situation.

However, this additional response time is not applicable to complaints pertaining to COVID-19 for which the extant timelines will continue to apply. It directed insurers to prominently display on their websited a dedicated helpline number for policyholders and another helpline number for other stakeholders including agents and intermediaries.

Adequate staffing

The IRDAI communication said though insurance has been exempted from the lockdown, insurance companies and other regulated entities are advised to operate their offices with absolutely necessary staff to maintain essential insurance services, including claims settlement, authorisation for hospitalisation and renewal of insurance policies.

Calling for a Business Continuity Plan to be put in place by insurers, the regulator said the Plan among others should pertain to processes, transactions, reporting and customer services to be handled in a seamless manner to take care of the situation. Insurers also need to set up a Crisis Management Committee, comprising key personnel, to monitor the situation on a real time basis and to take appropriate, timely decisions on issues, including those about safety of staff, policyholders, intermediaries and agents.

The Crisis Management Committee should provide regular inputs to the Risk Management Committee of the insurer.

100,2020/03/31,Coronavirus: Highest 24-hour surge in Maharashtra; tally touches 302,"82 new cases in State; Mumbai’s total rises to 159; Buldhana district sealed off

Maharashtra reported a surge of 82 COVID-19 positive cases over a 24-hour span on Tuesday. The State’s tally has now shot to 302, with Mumbai alone registering 59 fresh cases. New cases have also been reported from Pune, Thane, Buldhana and Ahmednagar districts, and Mumbai’s suburban areas.

Steep spike

This is the State’s biggest surge in a single day since the novel coronavirus outbreak. With this steep rise, Mumbai’s tally of positive cases stands at 159; Ahmednagar district’s total figure has gone up to eight, with three new cases; and Pune district’s overall number is 48 with five fresh cases.

The tally in Thane and other municipal corporations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, including Kalyan-Dombivli, stands at 36, said State Surveillance Officer Dr. Pradeep Awate. He said, “A total of 23,913 people have been directed to be in home quarantine, while 1,434 people are in institutional quarantine facilities.”

In Buldhana, the administration sealed off the district in Amravati division at 33 points after two new cases were reported. On March 28, a 45-year-old man died of pneumonia in the district. The next day, his test results returned positive despite the man not having any history of foreign or domestic travel.

The administration has placed 60 people in institutional quarantine facilities who may have come into contact with the deceased. It is likely that the new cases are of those who had made contact with the man.

In Ahmednagar district, authorities said the three new cases that were reported from Jamkhed tehsil were of people who had come into contact with a group of 14 foreign nationals who had entered the district a fortnight ago to visit religious places. Among this group, a French national and another person from Ivory Coast in West Africa had tested positive.

“The new patients in Jamkhed had come into contact with the foreigners who were diagnosed for the virus,” said District Collector Rahul Dwivedi.

The rise in cases in Pune is also giving headaches to authorities in terms of contact tracing as the virus has spread to the district’s rural areas after a 40-year-old autorickshaw driver from Baramati tested positive last week.

Fearing a further spike, the Pune Rural Police have cracked down on people flouting lockdown orders. Officials booked at least five ‘morning walkers’ in Narayangaon and Kamshet. Pune Divisional Commissioner Dr. Deepak Mhaisekar said the swab samples of 34 persons who had come in close contact with the 52-year-old patient who died on Monday, had been sent to the NIV for testing.

Earlier, Pune Commissioner of Police K. Venkatesham sternly warned that vehicles of owners found flouting orders would be seized. The Pune Police have so far seized nearly 200 vehicles while maintaining surveillance using drones and CCTV cameras on people daring to violate the lockdown.

Similarly, the Sangli district police, in a vigorous crackdown on Tuesday, confiscated around 300 vehicles in four hours and booked several people for flouting lockdown regulations. Sangli has recorded 25 positive cases and 24 patients are members of a family from the district’s Islampur tehsil.

“You are therefore requested to kindly approach the SDM for early action. We are ready to compliance all your directions [sic],” it added.

In the March 25 letter, the maulana informed the area station house officer (SHO) that they were trying to shut down the centre as directed by the SHO on March 24.

In another letter to the police on March 29, they informed that further efforts to vacate the premises of the centre were stopped midway due to the lockdown announced by the Prime Minister.

The displacement of lakhs of migrants could have been avoided had Prime Minister Narendra Modi first consulted the State governments, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel said in an interview to The Hindu.

“Who is to implement the lockdown? Can the Union government on its own do so. The answer is no. Ultimately, it’s the State government’s job to implement it. Did the Prime Minister talk to any of the State governments before unilaterally announcing it? No,” Mr. Baghel said, speaking over phone from Raipur.

Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

Chhattisgarh has reported seven Covid-19 cases, with no deaths so far. It was one of the first States to announce a lockdown on March 21, four days before Mr. Modi announced a nationwide 21-day lockdown. “We have the Mumbai-Howrah highway cutting across the State and could not have taken a chance,” Mr. Baghel said the citing reason for an early lockdown.

‘Severe economic crisis’

The Union government should have reached out to the industry also and the economic package should have precluded the lockdown. It should have anticipated that once the lockdown was implemented scores of persons would not be able to earn a living and would obviously head out to places where they felt more secure.

“We are staring at a severe economic crisis,” he said.

“All skilled and unskilled labourers have left the factories because of the lockdown. The wheels of all industries have come to a screeching halt. I am no economist, but surely, we will see the economic impact of this lockdown in years to come.” The lockdown, he said, would have a similar impact of pulling down the economy as demonetisation had.

‘Second package needed’

The Chief Minister said that there was a crying need for a second economic package to reach out to those who did not benefit from Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcements of March 26 such as the landless labourers and workers in the unorganised sector, among others.

In a recent letter to Mr. Modi, Mr. Baghel had suggested that ₹1,000 a month should be transferred to MNREGA and workers in the unorganised sector for the next three months.

103,2020/03/31,Home Ministry asked States to identify 824 foreign Tablighi members,"It asked that they be screened, quarantined and deported, if possible

The Union Home Ministry wrote to all the States and Union Territories on March 21 to “identify, screen and quarantine” 824 foreign Tablighi Jamaat members who were travelling to different parts of the country.

Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

While the Centre disseminated information to the States about the movement of the religious group’s members, the virus had already spread to various parts of the country.

In Jammu and Kashmir, 80% of the COVID-19-positive cases reported so far are linked to an index patient who attended a gathering at Alami Markaz Banglewali Masjid in south Delhi’s Nizamuddin. The patient died on March 26. In Telangana, 50% of the cases are linked to the meetings organised by the Markaz.

On March 28, the Home Ministry shot off another letter to the States that around 2,000 Tablighi Jamaat members from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand who entered India on tourist visa appeared to be “potential carriers” of COVID-19. It asked the States to “screen, quarantine” and deport them if possible. All international flights were suspended on March 23 and the country was placed under a 21-day lockdown on March 24 to prevent the spread of the pandemic.

The March 28 letter said “open domain reports” suggested that several people who attended a religious congregation, held from February 27 to March 1, at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, had tested positive, and hence “thorough screening of those who arrived from Malaysia is urgently needed.” By this time, many cases had been reported in Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.

Watch | COVID-19: Dos and don'ts from the Health Ministry

According to the Home Ministry’s data, since January 1, 2,100 foreigners had visited India for Tablighi activities and the Bureau of Immigration (BOI) started sharing details of all international arrivals with the States from March 6. But before the Home Ministry issued the letters, several States had already informed the Union Health Ministry’s control room in New Delhi about the positive cases linked to the Markaz. Health Ministry officials did not respond to messages.

On March 21, a day before the ‘Janta Curfew’ was observed, Jammu and Kashmir officials informed the Health Ministry’s control room of the 65-year-old index patient. The patient had tested positive. His contact-tracing revealed that he had travelled to Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Delhi, Deoband in Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Srinagar from February 16.

An SOS was sent to the Centre on March 21 that the patient had possibly contracted the virus from Indonesian and Thai Tablighi members whom he met in Delhi. Around 15,000 people are said to have come in contact with him directly or indirectly as he had travelled by road, rail and air. His eight family members have tested positive, and 14 medical staff members, who attended on him at a Srinagar hospital, have been quarantined.

Before this, on March 20, the Telangana police detained 11 foreign nationals from a Tablighi Markaz (centre) in Hyderabad, who were quarantined following an alert from locals.

The Home Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that as on March 21, 824 foreign Tablighi workers were in different parts of the country for missionary work. Further, 1,530 Indian and 216 foreign members were staying in the Delhi Markaz (centre). “All the Tablighi Jamaat members staying at Nizamuddin are being medically examined since March 26” and over 300 of them had showed symptoms.

It said that since March 23, the lockdown has been strictly imposed by the State authorities and the Delhi police, including in and around Nizamuddin, and “Tablighi work came to a halt.”

As reported by The Hindu, the Home Ministry is set to blacklist the 824 foreign Tablighi members who came here on a tourist visa and participated in religious congregations and meetings.

“Usually, all the foreign nationals visiting India as a part of Tablighi team come on the strength of tourist visa. The Home Ministry had already issued guidelines that they should not indulge in missionary work on tourist visa. The State police would be examining categories of visas of all these foreign Tablighi Jamaat workers and take further action in case of violation of visa conditions,” the Ministry said. An official said the role of the local intelligence unit of the Delhi police was also being probed as they failed to report the presence of a large number of foreign nationals at the Markaz.

Assam Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma tweeted on Tuesday that 456 people from Assam were near the Markaz in Delhi and the State government was acting swiftly to quarantine all of them.

On March 26, Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba wrote to all the States that there was a “gap” in the monitoring and surveillance of 15 lakh international air travellers who entered India from January 18 to March 23.

Five members of a mosque in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh, including the Maulvi, have been booked for allegedly hiding information about the presence of Indonesian nationals who had returned after attending the Tablighi Jamaat meeting in Delhi on March 21.

The eight foreigners have been put under home quarantine, said a police officer.

Additional Superintendent of Police Sanjay Kumar said the police located eight Indonesian nationals staying at the Jamunwali Mosque in Nagina. The eight were among the foreign nationals who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat meeting in Nizamuddin in Delhi, said the officer.

They had come to Delhi via Bangladesh, following which they went to Odisha and came to Bijnor on March 21, Mr. Kumar said.

Charges were pressed against the Mufti, the Maulvi and three other members of the mosque as an order under Section 144 was imposed during the prevalence of the COVID-19 and they had also been informed about it, the officer said.

104,2020/03/31,Coronavirus | More labs being opened by ICMR across country,"‘Efforts to increase test capacity by the pooling of samples are being evaluated’

Principal Scientific Adviser to the government K. VijayRaghavan on Monday said the the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is amplifying Coronavirus test sites and more laboratories are being opened across the country.

He said the Indian industry is also working on vaccines, re-purposing, critical-care treatment and partnering with academia and start-ups.

“Many of you have pointed out the need for more diagnostic tests. The @ICMRDELHI is amplifying test sites and you will see many more being done. More laboratories are being opened for testing across states,” he said in a series of tweets.

He also said efforts to increase test capacity by the ‘pooling’ of samples are being evaluated.

This is not simple and needs the development and testing of optimisation algorithms so that one positive in a large pool is not missed, he added.

“There are new tests being rolled-out, globally, for the presence, or traces of the virus having visited a person. These can be useful as a first-pass, even if they are cruder than the ‘gold-standard’ RT-PCR. Indian labs are developing these kinds of tests too,” he said.

He said the Indian start-ups and incubators have been “astounding’ and working on the highest end drug-repurposing, using AI to predict targets, to making equipment and tools for treatment of coronavirus.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-more-labs-being-opened-by-icmr-across-country/article31214013.ece

Congress MP Manish Tewari has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the movement of the migrant workers, who are headed home due to the ongoing lockdown, should not be curtailed, instead it should be facilitated and the workers can be quarantined at their destination.

“Rather than trying to stop them at borders and quarantine them, it perhaps may be better to run some targeted railway specials to safely reach them across to their homes and hearth.

Officials, who are taking measures to prevent spread of coronovirus in the State, are making all-out efforts to trace the Tablighi Jamaat members who attended the Markaz prayers at Hazrat Nizamuddin in Delhi.

According to sources, more than 500 persons from Andhra Pradesh travelled to Nizamuddin and attended the prayers held from March 13 to 15. People from almost all districts attended the programme and a majority of them travelled by AP Express and GT Express between March 10 and March 20.

“Special teams have been constituted to identify the persons who attended Markaz. We are worried about second contacts from the public who attended Ijtema (annual congregation), as there is a spurt in COVID positive cases in the State,” said an officer.

Samples collected

Police with the help of the South Central Railway (SCR) and the district Collectors identified about 300 persons, who travelled in AP Express and referred medical tests and kept them under quarantine. Samples of some Tablighi Jamaat members have been collected and sent for testing.

120,2020/03/31,Naidu asks Jagan to holdonline all-party meeting,"‘Ensure door delivery of essentials by utilising the 4.5-lakh-strong volunteer network’

Telugu Desam Party (TDP) national president and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday wrote a letter to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, urging him to convene an all-party meeting through online facility to discuss the measures to tackle the COVID-19 crisis. Suggestions of all parties should be taken and decisions taken accordingly, he said.

Mr. Naidu, in the letter, said decentralised distribution of essential commodities at the doorstep was the need of the hour. The distribution of ration for ration cardholders had gone wrong and one old woman died during the process.

“Hence, we once again reiterate that the government has to immediately chalk out a plan for decentralised distribution of essential commodities at the doorstep utilising the 4.5 lakh-strong volunteer network.” This would also prevent people from coming into contact with each other, he said.

‘Help people deal with emotional distress’

In addition to the financial distress, many people are on the verge of nervous breakdown and counselling and necessary assistance should be extended to them. A financial assistance of ₹ 5,000 should be extended to each household , he said.

The government has to address key issues such as minimum support price to horticulture, aquaculture, sericulture and poultry farmers. Those who cultivated crops such as paddy and pulses during rabi should get a fair price for the produce. The government has to take immediate measures to save the farmers, he said.

Supply of proper personal protection equipment to frontline warriors, increase in medical infrastructure was required.

It had come to the TDP’s notice that more than 700 people from Andhra Pradesh attended a programme organised by Tablighi Jamaat at Hazrat Nizamuddin in Delhi from March 15 to 17. The government should take steps to trace the participants and conduct COVID tests. The government should realise that any complacency on its part would lead to a catastrophic situation, he warned.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/naidu-asks-jagan-to-holdonline-all-party-meeting/article31222114.ece
121,2020/03/31,Uneasy calm in Kadapa district as 17 from capital congregation untraced,"Deputy Chief Minister calls for voluntary quarantine

With only 24 out of the 59 members from Kadapa sent to quarantine on their return from Delhi after participating in the Nizamuddin Jamaat, there is uneasy calm among the residents of the district. At least 17 persons of the rest are learnt to be ‘not traced’ and their whereabouts are not known yet.

People from several places in the district participated in the Jamaat, but in the aftermath of the clamour caused with some of them showing signs of fever, the others have gone into hiding.

Deputy Chief Minister S.B. Amzath Basha on Tuesday appealed to such members to voluntarily come out, while urging the general public to disclose the details of such people in the hiding. “We have seen a huge number of deaths in western countries because of such indifferent attitude. There is no need to panic. If you cooperate with the government by furnishing your details and follow home quarantine, you will be saving your life and those of others,” he said at a review meeting. Notwithstanding his call, the silence seems to turn eerie as the 17 missing are feared to spread the virus to many others in the district by staying in close proximity to them, especially the easily susceptible ones. The police have launched a manhunt for those who are hiding.

The kin of such people in hiding show stiff resistance and pick up a row with the ward and village volunteers going to the households for verification.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/zic9lj/article31222105.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01-VJ-DEPUTYCM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/uneasy-calm-in-kadapa-district-as-17-from-capital-congregation-untraced/article31222106.ece
122,2020/03/31,U. Chalapathi Rao passes away at 103,"He is said to be among the last freedom fighters from Krishna district

Uppalapati Chalapathi Rao, 103, said to be among the last freedom fighters hailing from Krishna district, breathed his last in the early hours of Tuesday (March 31) at Poranki n Vijayawada.

Mr. Chalapathi Rao is survived by two daughters and a son. His nephew is N. Bhaskara Rao, founder chairman of the Centre for Media Studies in New Delhi.

Mr. Chalapathi Rao was known for his active role as a freedom fighter and then as a progressive liberal in the Congress Party. He was also one of the first few in the country to refuse the freedom fighter pension offered by the Union Government.

In 1953-54, Mr. Chalapathi Rao was instrumental in founding one of the early consumer cooperative societies at Mudunuru, the village where he was born and where his father Uppalapati Brahmayya, a prominent name in the region, built a high school which still stands. Influenced by social reformer Goparaju Ramachandra Rao (Gora), Mr. Chalapathi Rao promoted and followed simple living and honesty in public and political affairs.

He raised his voice against group politics in the Congress in 1955-60 and refused to succumb to caste and money pressures. The then Zilla Board Chairman, Kakani Venkatratnam, recognised his integrity and entrusted him the responsibility of ensuring justice to the poor at the grassroots.

He was also actively engaged in the construction of the Krishna District Freedom Fighters building at Bander locks in the city, over two decades ago, and was in constant touch with national leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/u-chalapathi-rao-passes-away-at-103/article31222097.ece

125,2020/03/31,"RTC staff to be deputed to police, revenue wings","Employees’ union takes exception, demands rollback of the decision

In the wake of the outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus, the government wants to depute 25% of the staff of the AP State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) (now Public Transport Department - PTD) to the police and revenue wings to meet the emergency situation.

The decision, however, has not gone down well with the RTC Employees Union leaders who insist that the corporation staff be allowed to work for its parent wing.

Request by Collectors

Following requests made by the district Collectors with the Regional Managers of the corporation for arrangement of transportation of the stranded passengers at border points and of people from the quarantine centres to villages besides shifting of vegetables and medicines, it was decided to depute the PTD staff to police and revenue departments.

The services of the Divisional Managers and the supervisory staff of RTC are to be utilised for emergency operations. Employees above 55 years of age would be made to sit in office or utilised for emergency duties while services of women employees would be utilised in the second phase. If their services were needed in the first phase, they would be deputed in batches by rotation.

Pregnant women and differently-abled staff have been exempted and all employees deputed for special duties will attend in full uniform.

‘Threats being issued’

RTC employees’ union leaders Y.V. Rao and P. Damodara Rao, in a statement on Tuesday, said after the RTC merger and creation of the PTD, they were part of the government and it was their duty to assist the government in such hour of crisis.

But they found fault with the ‘authoritarian’ attitude of the second-rung officials in the corporation who, they alleged, had threatened the staff of strict action if they failed to report to the respective departments allocated to them.

Practical problems

The leaders said deployment of RTC staff to ‘unrelated departments’ was not a good idea as they neither had any proficiency in handling the situation nor were they given any training for the purpose. They said the RTC management should also think of the health aspect of its staff being deployed to other departments.

In view of the lockdown, it would also be difficult for the RTC staff to reach their duties immediately, they pointed out and reiterated that the government roll back its decision and allow them to work from their own department.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/rtc-staff-to-be-deputed-to-police-revenue-wings/article31222057.ece

He was discharged only after all the three samples that were sent to the labs in the last three days tested negative.

The 65-year-old, who had a travel history to Saudi Arabia, was the first positive case from the city. His family members and a few other persons who had come in contact with him were identified and quarantined. One of his family members, a 49-year-old woman, also tested positive at a later date and is undergoing treatment at GHCCD. But according to sources in the hospital, even her samples had tested negative in the first test. Sources said that the woman would be discharged only after further tests.

Success story

Doctors have cited the 65-year-old’s case as a success story, as he has managed to make a recovery despite his age; across the world, people aged over 60 have been the most vulnerable to COVID-19.

Speaking to the media on Tuesday, the Minister said that in the next two to three days, ration would be supplied to all beneficiaries.

“People were seen standing in queues at ration shops from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m. in the wake of the countrywide lockdown. It takes time to weigh dal, sugar, and rice for every beneficiary, which is why the dealers are able to distribute ration to only 20 people in an hour. The ration shops will remain open until the last beneficiary receives the ration. To prevent the spread of coronavirus, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has ordered providing of ration without the need for taking fingerprints,” Mr. Rao said.

“TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu and his partymen are trying to defame village volunteers who are working hard under adverse conditions. Those who mocked village volunteers in the past are now asking why volunteers are not delivering ration at the doorstep of beneficiaries,” Mr. Rao said.

The door delivery system which was launched in Srikakulam should have been implemented across the State by August. But due to the coronavirus outbreak, the government is continuing with the existing system, the Minister said.

131,2020/03/31,Govt. steps in to help edible oil units resume operations,"Companies promise incentives, care for workers

Agriculture Minister K. Kannababu and East Godavari officials led by Joint Collector G. Lakshmisha on Tuesday ensured all support from the State government to the edible oil companies on the Kakinada coast to resume operations.

Operations in about 10 edible oil companies came to a grinding halt since COVID-19 lockdown came into force as workers stopped coming citing the health alert. The major groups engaged in the edible oil production and trade on the Kakinada coast include GEF, Adani, Wilmer, Ruchi, Kaleswara and Agarwal.

The representatives of the edible oil companies have sought the intervention of the State government to persuade the workforce to resume duties and sought permission for inter-State transportation.

“Since edible oil is an essential commodity, all the field-level initiatives are being taken to resume the operation of the oil companies and in return, the companies have also pledged some incentives and special care for workers till the lockdown is over,” Mr. Lakshmisha told The Hindu.

Addressing the representatives of the companies, Mr. Kannababu said that the State government would address the shortage of workers in the companies in Kakinada and Krishnapatnam.

138,2020/03/31,First two COVID-19 cases from Anantapur in A.P. test positive,"78 persons who attended the Tablighi Jamaat at Nizamuddin quarantined

Two persons, distant relatives of a COVID-19 victim - a 70-year-old woman from Gauribidanur in Karnataka - who tested positive on Tuesday have been quarantined along with other close relatives.

While the first COVID-19 positive person from Anantapur is a 10-year-old boy from Lepakshi, the second is a 30-year-old woman from Hindupur.

Confirming this, District Collector Gandham Chandrudu said both were relatives of the Gauribidanur woman who had visited Mecca and came visiting the families of these two persons, who have now tested positive.

Local transmission

The Mecca-returned woman died last week after suffering from symptoms of COVID-19. While 30 persons related to her were put under quarantine at Hindupur Government Hospital, another 145 persons were also being monitored as they had come in contact with the deceased woman in Anantapur district during her visit to Balaji Hospital in Hindupur.

Meanwhile, the district administration has declared two colonies - Tipu Colony and Dange Colony - ‘Red Zones’, where the COVID-19 positive patients resided. District Medical authorities, however, said both the positive patients had very mild symptoms and it was not a cause of immediate concern.

Cause for concern

However, the cause for utmost concern is the identification of 78 persons hailing from Anantapur who had attended a religious congregation at Nizamuddin in Delhi from March 15 to 17. Of the 78, 29, who returned to the city have been quarantined at the Cluster Livelihood Resource Centre in Anantapur and their samples have been collected. While four of them have not come to Anantapur as one has migrated to Hyderabad, the other is in Khammam, one is still in Delhi, while the fourth is somewhere in Bihar.

The remaining 45 persons got in touch with the district administration officials, and they are all being brought to the quarantine facility in the city. Further, their samples would also be taken as directed by the Union Health Ministry.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/first-two-covid-19-positive-cases-from-anantapur/article31216943.ece

142,2020/03/31,Positive cases cross 100 in Karnataka,"Thirteen new COVID-19 cases were detected in the State on Tuesday, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 101. One of the patients is a pregnant woman, who is stable. While two patients are in ICU, the remaining are responding to treatment.

Among the new cases are three labourers from Hospet, two of whom had been in close contact with a person from Rajajinagar in Bengaluru. They had travelled to Bengaluru on March 16 by the Jan Shatabdi train and travelled back on 18 by Hospet Express, said Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education). Their contact tracing is underway.

Primary contacts

Addressing presspersons on Tuesday, Mr. Akhtar said among the new patients was the wife of a doctor who had attended to the 76-year-old patient from Kalaburagi who passed away. Many of the new patients were primary contacts of previously infected persons, he said.

Speaking of the infections at Nanjangud in Mysuru district through a pharma company worker, Mr. Akhtar said the results of swabs of the raw material packages from the company had tested negative for COVID-19. “So, the possibility that the person could have contracted the infection from the packages has been ruled out. We are consulting with NIV, Pune, on whether we should test the raw material that the company got from China. We are also exploring if any foreign delegation or foreign visitors had come to the company prior to the first case showing symptoms,” he said.

As the guidelines mandate that all those with Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) should also be tested, the department has directed all private hospitals to mandatorily report to the District Surveillance Officer all SARI cases admitted under them.

“We have also recommended the empiric use of Chloroquine tablets for prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 and instructed Deputy Commissioners to ensure that health workers are provided with the tablets. We have adequate stocks to administer the first dose of tablets to health workers — once a week for seven weeks. Their family members will be given the tablet once a week for three weeks,” he said, adding that more stock is in transit.

No shortage of PPE kits

Mr. Akhtar asserted that the State had adequate stock of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits to meet the requirement. “We have placed orders and the supplies we are getting are sufficient to meet our requirement. We are not really taking into account bulk supply. What we are more interested in is regular supply to meet our needs,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/positive-cases-cross-100-in-karnataka/article31221962.ece

145,2020/03/31,"A crucial week in battle against COVID-19, say experts","The next one week will be crucial in the battle against COVID-19 and the State is gearing up to contain the spread of the disease.

Although Karnataka has been recording cases without any foreign travel or contact history, and spread in clusters is a cause for concern, more than 90% of the infected are those who either travelled or were in contact with someone who did. It has been a week since the Centre stopped the entry of international flights into India. If anyone who entered Karnataka on March 23 has developed symptoms in the past one week, it means he or she contracted the infection before March 23, said experts. “While the mean number of days for manifestation of symptoms after contracting the infection is five to seven days, the incubation period of the virus is 14 days. We have already finished one week, so the next one week to 10 days are crucial,” said V. Ravi, senior professor and head of neurovirology at NIMHANS.

While the government is taking measures to flatten the curve of cases, it is important for people to strictly follow the lockdown norms and maintain social distancing. “If the cases do not peak in the next 10 days, then we can say the lockdown has been effective,” he told The Hindu on Tuesday.

C.N. Manjunath, director of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Chest Diseases, who is part of the State’s COVID-19 task force, said that in severely affected countries such as China, Italy, Spain and the United States, there was a surge between the third and fourth weeks of the outbreak.

“Now, as the infection is also spreading in clusters, the focus should be on preventing this case to cluster transmission. The onus is on people to strictly follow the lockdown conditions. This is the only way to stop the spread,” he said.

K.K. Aggarwal, former national president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), said it was important for COVID-19 patients to continue to remain in quarantine even after the disappearance of symptoms.

Quoting a study published in the American Thoracic Society’s American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, he said the study showed that patients treated for mild infections did not shed the virus even after the symptoms disappeared. “They continued to be contagious for up to eight days after the symptoms disappeared,” he said.

Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education), said the department has strengthened contact tracing and is working in coordination with other States.“We have circulated a list of passengers from Karnataka who could have travelled to neighbouring States and have procured a list of their passengers who could have come to Karnataka.

146,2020/03/31,Waste from quarantined houses to be disposed of scientifically in twin cities,"An agency has been identified for the purpose; there are 36 such houses in Hubballi-Dharwad

In an initiative to check the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in the twin cities, the Dharwad district administration and Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation have taken steps to dispose of in a scientific way waste generated from houses where foreign-returned persons have been quarantined.

The administration has decided to dispose of waste from such houses through scientific process, as it would do in the case of bio-medical waste. As per a Government Order, waste from houses of quarantined persons is treated as bio-medical waste.

According to a release issued by the authorities, the regular pourakarmikas (civic servants) have been asked not to gather waste from such houses and that an agency has been fixed for the purpose.

Accordingly, waste from such houses is being collected by trained staff from Rio Green Environ India, located at Tarihal Industrial Estate in Hubballi. The staff wearing safety wear and protective gear are collecting waste and taking it to the unit where it is burnt in incinerators as per guidelines. Environmental Engineer of Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation Sridhar said that the data pertaining to home quarantined persons had been shared with the agency to enable it to collect waste on a regular basis. They would be assisted by health inspectors in case of any issues, he said.

Aniruddh Bengeri of Rio Green Environ said that apart from the requisite staff no other employee was being allowed to enter the incinerator premises and all necessary precautions were being taken. Shortly, a time-table for door-to-door collection would be finalised to streamline waste collection, he said.

Another environmental engineer attached to municipal corporation Nayana said that there were a total of 36 such houses in the twin cities.

“There are 20 houses of persons home quarantined in Hubballi and 16 in Dharwad. All necessary help is being extended to the agency concerned,” she said.

148,2020/03/31,‘Why deploy only teachers in COVID-19 combat teams?’,"Horatti writes to Chief Secretary and seeks review

Taking exception to only teachers being included in teams formed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, former Minister Basavaraj Horatti has shot off a letter to Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar.

In his letter, which was released to the media here, Mr. Horatti has drawn the attention of the Chief Secretary towards the latter’s circular dated March 26 pertaining to constituting 100 primary teams to combat the spread of COVID-19.

Move welcome

While welcoming the move to constitute the teams, which he said was relevant, Mr. Horatti pointed out that as per the circular there has to be one teacher in the primary team and two teachers in the secondary team.

“When I was Minister for Primary and Secondary Education and you were Principal Secretary of the department, the question of why only teachers were being deployed to various government works was raised. Subsequently, we had taken a decision that apart from teachers, employees of various government departments should be deployed to such works. Subsequently, a letter was written to the Election Commission against deploying only teachers for election work. An order was then issued to utilise the services of employees of all departments for government works,” Mr. Horatti recalled in the letter.

Latest circular

He has further pointed out that according to the latest circular on COVID-19 teams, apart from paramedical staff, only teachers had been included and other departments had been left out. “Already, various government departments have declared holidays and several have been asked to work from home. Such employees could be deployed for COVID-19 related work,” he has said.

Clarifying that he was not against deploying teachers for the work, Mr. Horatti sought to know why only teachers were singled out for such works. “In various departments there are instances of employees not being available during office hours even when there is a lot of work to do,” he has said.

Mr. Horatti has said that teachers should not feel that they were being targeted while allotting such work. “I only want responsibility to be shared by the employees of all departments. I have also brought this issue to the notice of the Minister concerned and I request you to review your decision to deploy only teachers,” he has said in the letter.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/m6pax8/article31221571.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31BGHORATTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/why-deploy-only-teachers-in-covid-19-combat-teams/article31221573.ece
149,2020/03/31,Fighting withdrawal symptoms in times of COVID-19,"With liquor not being available during lockdown, DIMHANS Director stresses need for proper counselling to addicts

At a time when the country is fighting COVID-19 through a 21-day lockdown, those addicted to alcohol are facing yet another kind of health issue.

Psychiatrists have stressed the need for proper counselling and treatment for such people as non-availability of liquor during lockdown is likely to adversely affect their mental health.

According to Mahesh Desai, Director of Dharwad Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (DIMHANS): “Alcohol is a neuro-toxin acting on the individual’s brain, depressing its activity. Continuous and long-term use can cause various mental and physical disorders. Since the time of abrupt stoppage of alcohol, a person dependent on it will experience withdrawal symptoms,” he said.

These symptoms might manifest as tremors (shaking of hands), sweating, restlessness, headache, and insomnia. More serious problems like seizures may occur in 12 to 48 hours of stoppage of alcohol consumption. In such a period, persons can also have hallucination. “Sudden stoppage of alcohol consumption might also lead to a condition called delirium tremens, which usually starts within 2-3 days. Under the condition, the person becomes disoriented and experiences sweating, visual hallucinations, high BP and in some cases, fever. Some may lose touch with reality,” he said.

Dr. Desai said all these conditions have definite treatment and persons with withdrawal symptoms or their relatives should immediately approach the nearest healthcare facility or DIMHANS.

DIMHANS has an exclusive de-addiction cell. “At the cell, we will offer counselling and treatment to those experiencing withdrawal symptoms,” he told The Hindu.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fighting-withdrawal-symptoms-in-times-of-covid-19/article31221558.ece

The party also said Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa must convene a meeting of the State-level bankers’ committee to issue directions to bankers on deferring repayment of loans by farmers and others by three months.

Besides providing food to people stuck on the border areas of the State, Mr. Shivakumar said the government should arrange transport for the poor to get to their native places. He also appealed for the provision of adequate publicity to State and Union government orders issued during the lockdown.

Directing party workers not to collect funds or materials from the public, Mr. Shivakumar instructed Congress leaders, legislators and workers to donate money to the party’s relief fund.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/provide-free-covid-19-treatment-open-more-testing-centres-congress/article31220855.ece

154,2020/03/31,"Not everyone has to wear face masks, states government advisory","The Health and Family Welfare Services Commissionerate on Tuesday issued an advisory stating that not everyone needs to wear a face mask. The advisory comes in the backdrop of many people, ranging from shopkeepers to policemen, demanding that everyone going out in public wear a mask.

The advisory states that a person has to wear a mask if he or she has symptoms such as cold, cough, fever or any other respiratory problem. Those caring for COVID-19 patients also need to wear a mask. While the former can wear a triple-layered mask, the latter has to wear an N-95 mask.

The advisory comes a day after the Bengaluru City Police circulated a video showing an officer giving a “lesson” to an individual for not wearing a mask.

Policemen across the State have been insisting that people wear masks when venturing out of their homes. Elected representatives too have joined this campaign.

However, the guidelines issued by the Union Ministry of Health do not indicate that wearing of face masks is compulsory for every citizen. Only those directly dealing with COVID-19 patients in hospitals are required to wear safety gear, including N-95 masks.

Triple-layered masks, which the police are insisting should be worn by people in public spaces, are advised only for those visiting healthcare facilities. The State government too has, on many occasions, asserted these facts.

Aditya V. Bharadwaj, a Mangaluru-based consultant physician and intensivist, said that wearing of masks was not essential for a healthy person and would not ensure that he or she does not contract the disease. However, those suffering from cold and cough are advised to wear triple-layered masks to prevent infections. N-95 masks, which are already in short supply, are meant only for healthcare professionals, he said.

Several pharmacies in Mangaluru, Bengaluru and other cities do not have stock of triple-layered as well as N-95 masks, and thus the authorities’ insistence on the public wearing them has left many befuddled.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/not-everyone-has-to-wear-face-masks-states-government-advisory/article31220674.ece

156,2020/03/31,COVID-19 lockdown: Pre-monsoon crop cultivation takes a hit in Karnataka,"Despite the State government being on overdrive to ensure that agricultural activities continue to be normal during this unprecedented crisis caused by COVID-19, officials are keeping their fingers crossed about pre-monsoon crop cultivation.

Besides the main crops such as ragi and maize, farmers cultivate green gram, black gram and sesame, especially in Mysuru, Chamarajanagar, Mandya and Hassan districts, during this season. A senior Agriculture Department official acknowledged that there is concern whether farmers will take up cultivation of these crops given the situation.

According to the official, the preparatory work for sowing normally starts by the first week of April. “In a few places, sowing has been completed, but it has not even commenced in many places. In agriculture timing, is very important. If sowing is delayed, it will hurt the yield and overall productivity,” he said.

He also said that people across the board were staying indoors and labour was in short supply. “We are appealing to farmers to continue with their agricultural activities while also staying safe. District administrations are working with dealers to ensure there is enough supply of seeds and fertilizers,” the official said.

Explaining the importance of pre-monsoon crop for the kharif crop that will follow, another official said that those who grow pre-summer crops normally let plants grow on their fields after harvesting the crops. “The plant stubs become green manure when farmers prepare the fields when monsoon arrives. Pre-monsoon crop contributes to less than 10% of the total agricultural production in the State, but remains important,” the official said. Though pre-monsoon crop depends on early rains in rain-fed regions, farmers with their own irrigation facilities do not wait for the rains.

Meanwhile, in the paddy belt in the irrigated regions of north Karnataka, the crop is waiting to be harvested. An official said the paddy in fields in Raichur, Ballari, Koppal and Gangavathi were ready for harvesting, but farmers were facing labour issues though the department has allowed them to get farm machineries for harvesting.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-lockdown-pre-monsoon-crop-cultivation-takes-a-hit-in-karnataka/article31219928.ece

158,2020/03/31,"Drop tax hike, Belagavi Cantonment residents urge State government","Some residents of the Cantonment area in Belagavi have written to the State government urging it to withdraw the increase in taxes being levied on property in their area in the city.

Members of the Belgaum Cantonment Residents Welfare Association have said that the Cantonment Board had decided to increase taxes exorbitantly from 175 % to 3,400 %.

“This is not only arbitrary and unilateral, but also unprecedented, unparalleled and savage,” Nitin Khot, a member of the association, said in the letter. Such increases are excessive and unfair. This has not been done anywhere in the other Cantonment areas in the country, he said.

Hundreds of residents are shocked at this decision taken by Barchaswa, Executive Officer of the Cantonment Board. He has received over 500 objections to the decision, they said.

“The rise is excessive. For example, the proposed tax increases are 3,469 % and 2,026 % for St. Paul’s School, 1,623 % for St. Joseph’s School, 1,052 % and 774 % for B.K. Model School, 2,008 % for Dr. Sanjay Porwal’s Cardiac Emergency Clinic, 2,328 % for a renovated bungalow that has reduced its plinth area. What is more, these increases have hit us during the worst economic crisis the country is facing after 1991. Two businesses in the Cantonment area have closed down due to losses,” Dr. Khot said.

Since its formation in 1831, the Belgaum Cantonment Board has not hiked its taxes in such an exorbitant manner. The tax rate increase has been between 10 % and 15 %, depending on the rise in the income levels of the town. Of the other Cantonment Boards in the country, the Chennai Cantonment Board has increased taxes from 3.5 % to 7 % and Pune and Secunderabad by 5 %.

In comparison, the Belagavi City Corporation has increased taxes only by 15 %, with a discount of 5 % for taxes paid before April.

Taxes on schools is not justified as Section 111 (2)(b) of the Cantonments Act 2006 exempts State-aided schools from paying taxes.

“We have explained our situation to the CEO in letters submitted to him, but in vain. He has also been insensitive to our demands,” the residents said. They have also written to the Union government seeking the intervention of senior Defence Ministry officials to withdraw the increase.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/drop-tax-hike-belagavi-cantonment-residents-urge-state-government/article31219681.ece

174,2020/03/31,Fighting the pandemic from behind the counters,"Chemist stores ensure constant supply of life-saving medicines amid the lockdown

They may not be on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19. But they are playing an important role amid the lockdown by ensuring the supply of life-saving medicines to people and keeping them safe.

In every locality, besides grocery and vegetable shops, it is the chemist stores that open every day without fail. With the rise in number of cases, scores headed straight for pharmacies seeking masks, sanitisers, and gloves. For people who are ill or on medication for various health problems, these shops often make the difference between life and death. Medicines, baby food, diapers and sanitary napkins – the shops, present in almost every neighbourhood, stock them all.

The lockdown though has forced chemists also to make adjustments to how they function. With fewer people stepping out of homes, the shops do not remain open late into the night.

Asim Basheer, who runs a chemist shop at Vallakkadavu, says he gets more customers in the morning hours. At night, they close around 8 p.m. if there are no customers.

Taking precautions

When they are open, they take social distancing very seriously. Only one customer is allowed at the counter, the rest have to wait a safe distance away. Home deliveries are being made initially, but have now been stopped. And medicines are sold only if doctors’ prescription are produced. While they quickly run out of masks and sanitisers each time these are replenished, they are faring better with medicines. There are concerns though over possible shortage as distributors do not have enough people to supply medicines to stores. “If medicines do not reach us, then we will have to go and pick them up,” says Mr. Basheer.

They have adequate stocks of drugs such as insulin or hormone tablets that require refrigeration apart from other medicines, but it is baby products that they are swiftly running out. “People are buying these in larger quantities fearing that these will become unavailable soon, especially if the lockdown gets extended,” he says. People are buying medicines too for a month or two together, Mr. Basheer says.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fc81db/article31222276.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01TV-MEDICALSHOP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fighting-the-pandemic-from-behind-the-counters/article31222277.ece

176,2020/03/31,COVID-19 | Case for reverse quarantine to keep the elderly safe,"Public health experts for quarantining specific geographic locality to look for community transmission

The death of a 68-year-old man owing to COVID-19 at Pothencode, near here, without any evidence of how he could have contracted the infection has thrown open the possibility that silent transmission of the disease could be happening in the community. However, one can clearly establish community transmission only when more such cases surface in the community.

Isolated cases

“One has to move away from the assumption that total prevention of COVID-19 is possible and accept that despite the best efforts, isolated cases with no known source will turn up in the community. Our best bet would be to try and contain the spread to a specific geographic locality and reduce the speed of transmission through stringent social distancing and lockdown measures. Low-level community transmission might actually render herd immunity to the community but special measures will have to be taken to protect the elderly during this time,” a public health expert said.

He pointed out that the significance of the route map of the deceased was more an indication of the places he could have acquired the infection from. For every single case of infection with unknown source, there will be several with mild infection and scores of those who are asymptomatic.

Geographic location

“In such situations, a core geographic location should be fixed, based on the recent activities and local travel history of the deceased. After leaving a good buffer zone around this area, all people within this geographic circle should be quarantined and all those with respiratory symptoms (if the infection has been passed on, symptoms would surface after the median incubation period) should be tested for COVID-19. Another strategy which should be immediately implemented wherever possible is reverse quarantine, wherein the elderly should be protected by keeping them separate from the rest of the people within homes and preventing anyone from introducing an infection to them,” a senior epidemiologist said.

Ideally, a hospital should be included within the circle of quarantined area, where facility to collect samples, oxygen facility, and appropriate ventilation should be arranged, where those who develop symptoms can be isolated and treated, rather than move them all to busier hospitals where there is risk of cross infection to other patients.

The Health Department has already swung into action and has locked down Pothencode and three adjacent panchayats for the next three weeks and people have been asked to stay at home.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/b8yet6/article31222168.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01tvCovid-19002,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/coronavirus-case-for-reverse-quarantine-to-keep-the-elderly-safe/article31222161.ece

Horticorp has launched a mission to address the shortage of vegetables and fruits in the State against the backdrop of the lockdown implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Talking to The Hindu, Horticorp managing director J.Sajeev said the corporation had already started procuring vegetables from farmers, who too were desperate for want of market for their produce.

The corporation had already procured over 100 tonnes of vegetables directly from farms in Thrissur, Ernakulam, Kottayam, Pathanamthitta, Idukki, Alappuzha, Kollam, and Thiruvananthapuram.

He said pineapple and mango procurement too started the other day. A total of 20 tonnes of pineapple and five tonnes of mango had been procured from Vazhakulam in Ernakulam and Muthalamada in Palakkad.

Horticorp had also started procurement of vegetables, mainly snake gourd, cucumber, pumpkin, beans, and spinach, from the 200-acre Mambara fields at Cheriyanad, near Chengannur, on Monday. The target of the corporation was to procure about 80 tonnes of vegetables a day from different parts of the State, he said.

Competitive rates

Mr. Sajeev said Horticorp was procuring vegetables at competitive rates from farmers. Vegetables and fruits procured from the farms were being transported to the 100 Horticorp outlets and 200 franchisees in different parts across the State for supplying them to the needy households.

The corporation would also supply vegetables to community kitchens opened across the State.

Mr. Sajeev said Horticorp had joined hands with AM Needs for supplying vegetables online in Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram.

He said the corporation would also procure banana from farmlands in Wayanad.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/whrv6f/article31222126.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01tvpt-farmproduce1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/horticorp-steps-in-to-address-shortage-of-vegetables-fruits/article31222103.ece
178,2020/03/31,Bevco working on logistics to make alcohol available,"KGMOA to observe black day, says order detrimental to individual’s health

Alcoholics who succeeded in securing prescriptions from doctors to get their daily dose of booze may have to wait for one more day to get their hand on the bottle.

Since the first day of every month is observed as dry day in the State, they may not be able to buy their quota of alcohol from the Kerala State Beverages Corporation (Bevco) on April 1. On April 2, Bevco may make alcohol available on production of the medical pass certified by the Excise Department.

Since the government has ordered the closure of liquor outlets, including retail outlets of the corporation, bars, clubs, and toddy shops, alcohol may have to be made available through the warehouses or godowns of the corporation, a senior Bevco official said.

Bevco is working on the logistics to make alcohol available based on the permits to be issued by the Excise Department. The quantity of the Indian Made Foreign Liquor to be made available will depend on the permit issued by the department, he said.

On Tuesday, the first day after the government issued an order permitting medical passes for the alcoholics, the Excise Department received as many as 30 applications.

“Some applications were rejected as the certificates indicating that the patient had alcohol withdrawal symptoms were issued by retired doctors. Only serving government medical doctors are authorised to issue such certificates,” said S. Aananthakrishnan, Excise Commissioner.

The valid applications are being processed. The role of the department is confined to the issuance of passes and the distribution of alcohol will be the responsibility of Bevco. The department expects a few more applications in the coming days as there can be more such persons, he said.

Those alcoholics who want to get medical passes should present themselves for examination at government hospitals. They will be provided a fixed quantity of alcohol if the doctor certifies that the person has alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The medical passes for procuring alcohol will be issued after the certificate is verified at the nearest range or circle office of the Excise Department, according to a government order.

Congress leader V.M. Sudheeran has urged Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to roll back the decision, which is unethical and against the accepted treatment protocol.

KGMOA protest

Meanwhile, the Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association would observe Wednesday as black day and all doctors in the Health Services would be wearing black badges to work. This is to express their protest against the order that makes doctors liable for an act that could lead to further deterioration of an individual’s health, directly or indirectly.

KGMOA president Joseph Chacko said the government order was unethical. “A prescription is incomplete without the treatment protocol. If a person is diagnosed with alcohol withdrawal symptoms, the treatment too should be written down.”",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/q6w6zc/article31221988.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01tvPass,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bevco-working-on-logistics-to-make-alcohol-available/article31221984.ece
179,2020/03/31,Shortage of feed hits chicken project,"Poultry farms in north Kerala districts struggle for survival

The Kerala Chicken, an ambitious project of the State government, has been hit as close to 1.5 lakh chicks in poultry farms in Kasaragod, Kannur, Wayanad, Palakkad, Malappuram and Kozhikode districts are struggling for survival due to shortage of poultry feed.

When the project was launched two years ago, 86 prospective farmers entered the venture expecting a better return from the project.

“Though we have got a sustainable income from the project for the past many months, now it turnds out to be a great loss owing to dearth of poultry feed,” Ashraf Mampuzha, a farmer says. He is rearing as many as 10,000 chickens.

It is a common sight in the farms where chicks fight each other for food and die, farmers say.

Fatal fights

Once it is wounded in the fight, it would die soon, Mr. Ashraf says adding more than 2,000 chicks rearing in various farms in Malappuram and Palakkad were killed in the fight in the recent past.

The farmers are also facing difficulty to market chicken and eggs owing to the difficulty in transporting it. The condition of other farmers in the State is not different, he adds.

Though the poultry feed haw been included in the essential goods, the border States of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka are not allowing trucks to enter the State, says M.V. Santhosh, administrative officer, Kerala Chicken project.

The decision has been taken at the ministerial level, but it is yet to be executed at the grassroots, he adds.

Abattoir

The Brahmagiri Development Society (BDS), the nodal agency for the project, has established the first multi-species abattoir in South India, the Malabar Meat products. It has been given ₹20 crore as part of budgetary allocations for hatching out the Kerala Chicken brand.

The project was launched to tap the ₹4,000-crore poultry meat market of the State, ensuring quality meat for consumers on affordable price and fair income for poultry farmers.

A cooperative initiative under the Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, the BDS will be supported by the Poultry Development Corporation and Kudumbashree in the mission.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ynp3kh/article31221894.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01tvwyChicken,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/shortage-of-feed-hits-chicken-project/article31221895.ece

“Since the lockdown began, the other security guard, with whom I have a rotational arrangement, is unable to reach here since he lives outside the city. So, I decided to stay here. Today is the fourth day. Sometimes, the flat association arranges food for me. If not, I order food from a restaurant here,” says Devadasan.

Mohanan, security guard at an apartment in Kowdiar, shares an almost similar plight. The only advantage that he has a scooter on which he takes a quick trip to his home at Kachani every morning.

“The other guard is from Nedumangad, and it is impossible for him to reach here as there is no public transport. The police sometimes stop me on my way home in the mornings. Only after repeated pleas do they allow me to proceed,” says Mohanan.

During this lockdown, many are not privileged enough to stay safe inside their homes. They are being forced to take the risk of travelling or taking up extra work, for their colleagues who have no way to travel. The lockdown has been especially hard on the daily- wage labourers, who stand to lose their wages if they do not appear for work.

Petrol pump staff

Most of the petrol pumps in the city are working with less than half the number of employees, as many of them live in the city’s suburbs or in the panchayats outside, where the rents are much lower. “I am able to work because my husband drops me here early in the morning from our home in Vazhayila. For many, transportation is a problem,” says Sandhya, who works at a petrol pump in the city.

At a petrol pump in Pattom, most of the women staff are not reporting for work, due to the lack of transport. “Four of our employees, all of them women, have not been coming for work. With hardly any vehicles on the road, the ones who are coming have less work too. The working hours of the 24-hour pump have been reduced,” says Thomas, the pump manager. Quite a few women, like a few working at a petrol pump in Kowdiar, walk all the way from their homes, several kilometres away.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bc89ol/article31221626.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29TVTVTOTALSHUTDOWN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/coronavirus-lockdown-for-quite-a-few-work-is-home/article31221627.ece
189,2020/03/31,One more tests positive in Kannur,"Virology lab starts functioning at MCC

On Tuesday, a man who returned from Dubai recently tested positive for COVID-19, taking the total number of those under treatment for the disease in Kannur to 44. Three persons, who had tested positive for COVID-19 earlier and were under treatment, have tested negative and have been discharged from the hospital.

According to District Collector T.V. Subhash, the 23-year-old man reached home from Dubai via the Calicut International Airport on March 22. He was admitted to the Thalassery General Hospital after he showed symptoms of COVID-19.

Mr. Subhash said there was shortage of certain medicines in medical shops in the district due to lack of adequate transport facilities during the lockdown. However, steps have been taken to address the shortage of essential medicines and they would be available in two days’ time, he added.

Testing of samples

Meanwhile, to expedite testing of samples, a virology lab has been set up at the Malabar Cancer Centre (MCC), Thalassery.

The lab is equipped with facilities to check 30 samples a day. It was set up on March 25 and received approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research on March 26.

The first test result was handed over to the Health Department on Monday.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/one-more-tests-positive-in-kannur/article31221439.ece

Prohibitory orders declared under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) have been extended until April 14 in Malappuram district. District Collector Jafar Malik has announced the extension in view of the nation-wide lockdown to check the spread of COVID-19.

Mr. Malik said gatherings of five or more people would not be permitted anywhere in the district during the period. He said all dharnas, marches, processions, and prayer gatherings would come under the ban.

191,2020/03/31,"In six days, the virus changed our lives forever, says victim’s son","Son of Kerala’s first COVID-19 victim urges others to follow safety measures

When the State’s first COVID-19 victim, a 69-year-old man from Mattancherry, was laid to rest last Saturday, none of his children could make it to bid adieu to their father owing to the strict safety protocols in place.

Now, his second son, who is in Dubai, has written a heartrending Facebook post, revealing the trauma of not being able to see his father one last time, while exhorting people to take the pandemic seriously so that no one else will have to go through the ordeal.

“My father was genuinely active, smiling and going about his usual routine, but in a matter of six days, this deadly virus changed our lives forever. We kept reading about the conditions in other countries where it hit the most — China, Italy, Spain etc., and never in our wildest dreams thought it could affect us. Well, it did, and we don’t know how, when, where and from whom he contracted the virus and these are questions, we will never get answers to,” he wrote.

His mother has also tested positive for COVID-19, and is currently under isolation in the same hospital. “The worst part – neither me, my elder brother or younger brothers could attend our father’s burial (due to travel restrictions/safety protocols being followed), and we cannot even be there by our mother’s side. Such is the impact of this virus, and its implications on our normal lives,” he said.

He then goes on to warn people how their carelessness could affect older people around them. “The virus can be anywhere, and anyone could be carrying it, without actually showing the symptoms, so please be aware and also educate your friends, family and peers on following the safety measures... Don’t wait until it’s too late,” he wrote.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/society/76iqa8/article31181274.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29SMKERALA3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/in-six-days-the-virus-changed-our-lives-forever-says-victims-son/article31221404.ece

193,2020/03/31,MSMEs seek bailout to recover from COVID-19 crisis,"The micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the State have sought urgent steps from the government to address their concerns in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.

In a letter to the Chief Minister, the Kerala State Small Industries Association (KSSIA) has sought allocation of at least ₹2,000 crore from the ₹20,000-crore financial package announced by the government to tackle the crisis.

Functionaries of some other industrial units, meanwhile, requested the authorities to permit them to clean and maintain machines and equipment on their premises during the lockdown.

A. Vijayaraj, general secretary of the Sign Printing Association, claimed the units’ costly equipment would be destroyed if they werenot cleaned regularly. He urged the Chief Minister as well as the State Police Chief to give permission for the purpose once in two days.

KSSIA president M. Khalid and general secretary A. Nizarudeen sought a one-year moratorium on repayment of term loans taken from banks and other financial institutions. These institutions may also be asked to provide additional working capital if there is a need, without collateral security.

The government should refund the excess input credit under the Goods and Services Tax (GST). There should not be any penalty or penal interest on delay in payment of power bills, provident fund and Employees’ State Insurance contribution and GST. The Kerala State Electricity Board should waive all fixed charges for the next three months and allow consumers to pay the bill for March in three equal installments.

Mr. Khalid and Mr. Nizarudeen pointed out that migrant labourers, who formed the backbone of MSMEs, should be persuaded to stay back in the State. There should be a moratorium on inspections for six months. The government and semi-government institutions need to release all payments due to MSMEs for products supplied and services rendered. Units producing hand sanitisers were finding it difficult to get spirit and the government should make it available, they added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/msmes-seek-bailout-to-recover-from-covid-19-crisis/article31221395.ece
194,2020/03/31,State registers second COVID-19 death,"68-year-old from Pothencode in the capital had severe co-morbidities

The State recorded its second COVID-19 victim on Tuesday with the death of a 68-year-old man, who had been in an ICU at the Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital (MCH) with severe co-morbidities for the past one week.

An official statement issued by the MCH said the deceased, a native of Vavarambalam at Pothencode here, had been admitted to the ICU on March 23 and his condition had worsened as he had severe co-morbidities, including high blood pressure and thyroid-related issues.

He had been on ventilator for the past five days after his kidneys failed, requiring him to be on dialysis.

His first test result on March 26 had come as negative and it was the second sample result on March 29 which showed him to be positive for COVID-19. The death occurred at 2.30 a.m. on Tuesday.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, briefing the media, said the case was being studied closely to ascertain whether it could be a case of community spread as the Health Department had not been able to pinpoint the source of infection.

Plan for Kasaragod

He said that a special action plan was being planned in Kasaragod where the maximum COVID-19 cases had been reported and where the potential for transmission seemed to be high. Under the plan, a panchayat-level data would be collected of those who have any respiratory disease as well as their contacts and samples would be sent for testing.

Seven test positive

On Tuesday, seven people newly tested positive in the State.

Mr. Vijayan said all except one of these cases were primary contacts. Two cases each were from Thiruvananthapuram and Kasaragod, while one case each was from Kollam, Kannur and Thrissur.

Kerala has so far reported 241 COVID-19 cases, out of which 215 are currently under treatment. There have been two deaths, while 24 recovered from the illness and have since been discharged. Over 1.63 lakh people are currently in the surveillance network, including 658 who have been isolated in hospitals.

Kasaragod has the maximum number of people isolated in hospitals at 163, Kannur has 108 and Malappuram 102.

He said the Aster group had offered a COVID-19 package deal wherein the government could utilise 750 of its hospital beds in various districts. Aster DM group has also offered the service of its doctors in Aster hospitals to treat people who are isolated in buildings around the hospitals in various districts.

This, the Chief Minister, said was something the Health Department was already contemplating because it would keep suspected COVID-19 patients from mixing with others in regular hospitals and amplifying the transmission of infection.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/e1qb0h/article31222200.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01tvCovid-19004,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-registers-second-covid-19-death/article31221382.ece

196,2020/03/31,Whiteguard volunteers reach out with vital drugs,"Through Medi Chain, bikers bring medicines for critical patients living in villages

The Whiteguard volunteers of the Muslim Students Federation (MSF) are reaching out to the terminally and critically ill patients living in different parts of Kozhikode, Malappuram, and Palakkad districts with medicines not locally available to them.

The humanitarian scheme titled Mission Medi Chain is being carried out by involving the volunteers at panchayat, zonal and district levels. They said they were careful not to form any groups of more than three persons as the COVID-19 lockdown demanded extreme caution.

V.K.M. Shafi, district coordinator of the Mission Medi Chain, said that they had started the programme to help the patients who had no other means to get their medicines and other important medical equipment for survival. The team reached out to 10 patients at places like Koppam, Ongallur, Padinjarangadi, Thrithala, Purathur, Ponnani, Kakkad and Edarikode on day one.

Using local contacts, the panchayat level volunteers will enquire if any home-bound patients are in urgent need of medicines that is not locally available. The demand will be communicated to the zonal and district level volunteers through a WhatsApp group, and the volunteers in cities and other areas where medicines are available will procure them.

“Two of our volunteers will carry the medicine on their bikes to the next panchayat or zone, from where it will be carried to the next zone by another team, and from there by another team. Thus, we ensure that none travels far and leaves their locality or zone. But, we make sure that all of them will be in uniform and wear helmets, protective masks and gloves, and use sanitisers,” said Mr. Shafi.

On Saturday, a patient at Purathur was provided with the cancer medicine available only at the Kerala Government Homoeopathy Cancer Centre at Wandoor. A team brought the medicine from Wandoor to Malappuram; then another team took it to Kottakkal, another to Tirunavaya, another to Tavanur and yet another to Purathur.

“This service will not cost much for us individually as a chain of volunteers is involved. But we are very careful in this critical time,” said Mr. Shafi.

He said the police too were generous considering the humanitarian nature of the help they provided. Apart from him, Shafeek Vachal, Rauf Varikkodan and Shafeek Kadameri are also coordinating in their respective areas.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hj5plh/article31221338.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01tvmpm-Medi-Chain,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/whiteguard-volunteers-reach-out-with-vital-drugs/article31221339.ece
197,2020/03/31,300 from State attended Nizamuddin meeting,"Several attendees quarantined, none of them test positive

The government on Tuesday braced itself to contain a possible spread of COVID-19 infection from a large group of persons who had returned from the Tablighi Jamat centre at Nizamuddin in New Delhi in early March.

At least 300 persons from Kerala had attended the back-to-back meetings from which the disease had radiated to outlying States.

Officials said there was cause for concern but not panic. The first batch had left the centre on April 5, and at least 80 persons reached Kerala. A random check revealed that none of them had tested positive for the virus, and most had passed the incubation period unaffected. However, the situation could change as the testing gets more extensive.

Of the 300 attendees, an estimated 150 persons from the State had left the centre to other regions for religious work. The government was ascertaining their status. Some had hunkered down in New Delhi to weather the curfew.

The police had tracked down the seminarians to different parts of Kerala. One, a retired chemistry professor from Pathanamthitta, had died in the national capital.

The Kerala Police are on overdrive to identify local people who might have put themselves at risk by interacting closely with the returnees. Law enforcers are analysing the mobile phone usage history of the attendees to retrace their movement.

The State government is also concerned that scores of persons from nearby Salem, Madurai and Erode had stayed at the sprawling Tablighi seminary in New Delhi along with the Keralites.

The State has strong social and commercial links with the regions in Tamil Nadu. The police said delegates in Tamil Nadu might have been in touch with their friends and relatives in Kerala. An official said the delegates had sheltered in mosques in different parts of the country during their journey back from New Delhi. The police were trying to identify the spots.

A senior State police official said religious leaders from Thailand and Indonesia had attended the meeting. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs has identified most of them and send advisories to their respective countries.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/300-from-state-attended-nizamuddin-meeting/article31221070.ece
198,2020/03/31,Kannur-Virajpet route can be considered: Karnataka,"‘Kerala should send request to Karnataka Home Department’

The Karnataka government on Tuesday submitted before the Kerala High Court that it could consider the demand of the Kerala government that the Kannur-Iritty- Koottupuzha-Mangoor- Virajpet route be opened for transportation of essential commodities if an appropriate letter was sent by the authorities in Kerala to the Karnataka Home Department.

Karnataka Advocate General P.K. Navadgi made the submission when a public interest litigation against the erection of earth embankments on arterial inter-State roads by Karnataka came up before a Division Bench of Justice A.K. Jayasankaran Nambiar and Justice Shaji P. Chali.

Additional Advocate General of Kerala Ranjith Thampan submitted the Kerala proposal.

Advocate General of Karnataka also submitted that the Kannur-Iritty- Mananthavady- Sargur- Begur- Nanjangud- Mysore and Kannur- Sulthan Bathery- Gundlupetes- Mysore routes have been opened for transportation of essential commodities and will continue to be so throughout the lockdown period.

The court directed the Kannur District Collector to immediately send a communication to the Secretary of the Karnataka Home Department so that the matter could be considered by the latter immediately. The Bench asked the Karnataka and the Kerala govenrments to make submissions on the arrangement that could be made for catering to the medical needs of patients in Kasaragod based on the proximity of the hospital concerned in Karnataka.

The Karnataka Advocate General submitted hospitals in Mangaluru district were already overburdened due to COVID-19 pandemic and it was difficult to cater to the needs of patients from Kerala.

Counsel for the petitioner, Kerala High Court Advocates Association, pointed out that Karnataka's action amounted to infringement of right to life and health care under Article 21 as well as right to freedom of movement under Article 19(1)(d) of the Constitution.

The Bench posted the petition for further hearing on April 1.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kannur-virajpet-route-can-be-considered-karnataka/article31220950.ece

200,2020/03/31,COVID-19 | North Kerala cases have roots in Dubai’s Naif,"UAE authorities are carrying out door-to-door screening

Fresh evidence has emerged that a majority of the COVID-19 cases in north Kerala, especially in Karasagod district, could be linked to Naif neighbourhood, one of the densely populated areas in the emirate of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Already the State Health Department has confirmed that the SARS-CoV-2 positive cases could have reached the northern parts of the State possibly in March first week. With more confirmed cases, the Dubai health authorities are carrying out a door-to-door screening in Naif district. The Al Ras area has been locked down for two weeks from Tuesday to intensify disinfection.

“The connection between Naif, one of the congested areas in Dubai, and Kerala is well known. Many could have been carriers of the disease. Social distancing of these expatriates may have been challenging for them. Now, identification and isolation are being carried out,” Balu Bhaskar, Director, Intensive Care Medicine, The American Hospital, Dubai, told The Hindu over phone on Tuesday.

Immune system

Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus is pervasive, he said those infected could be more than the actual numbers.

“But the immune system of those living in Naif could possibly be strong,” said Dr. Bhaskar, an India-born Australian citizen, who is a specialist in critical care medicine.

“In the last two decades, the area has turned into a low income neighbourhood. It is a sort of glorified slum in Dubai. Here, nationality or religion does not matter,” Vinod Chacko, a entrepreneur and resident of Dubai for the last 25 years, said.

He said the old apartments that house the blue-collar workers at Naif and its vicinity have spacious rooms. “The rent is comparatively low and there are no stipulations on the number of tenants. An apartment with three rooms has more than 30 occupants and these include people from delivery boys to mobile shop salesman to waiters,” he said.

Naif district is not just home to the gold souk and museums, but also to auto spare parts, textiles, electric and electronic goods.

201,2020/03/31,TCMC issues guidelines for online consultation,"It will be for minor ailments and routine follow-ups

The Registrar of Modern Medicine Council under the Travancore-Cochin Medical Councils (TCMC) has issued guidelines for online consultation of patients and prescription of medicines in the State.

The consultation shall be for minor ailments and for routine follow-ups. The doctor should be aware of the medical history of the patient. No injectable should be prescribed. Prescription for clinically suspected COVID-19 cases cannot be allowed.

The doctors should record the identity of the patient for whom prescription is given. The prescription should be on the letter head of the registered medical practitioner with name, registration number, registered qualification, and full signature. This should be in PDF format and each patient’s history should be recorded with serial number. The prescription must superscribe an order number, date of the order and the word ‘online consultation.’

The doctor must be a registered person under the TCMC medicine council and the patient must be within the radius of direct consultation. Medical records should be prepared in each online consultation in PDF format and it should be emailed to the TCMC after the current period of lockdown. No consultation outside the TCMC jurisdiction is allowed.

The online consultation should be subject to the prevailing laws. Any violation will invite penal action. The Registrar said that the TCMC may at any point withdraw the order enabling online consultation without prior notice, and it may automatically be cancelled once normality returns in Kerala.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tcmc-issues-guidelines-for-online-consultation/article31220829.ece
202,2020/03/31,"WhatsApp, Google Duo come to prisoners’ aid","HC directs trial courts not to insist on personal appearances of sureties

Video calling facilities offered by WhatsApp and Google Duo are coming to the aid of undertrial and remand prisoners of Kerala, thanks to the COVID-19 threat.

Also, the Registry of the Kerala High Court has directed trial courts not to insist on personal appearances of sureties and submission of bail bonds in bail applications. Instead, the courts will accept scanned copies of relevant documents, including bail bonds by email, and release eligible prisoners on bail.

Lawyers can initiate the bail application by emailing a request to the Principal or Additional District and Sessions Judge holding charge of the district. Once the judge grants permission, the advocate can upload the application along with relevant documents signed by sureties to the official email ID of the court or the judge concerned. The judge would pass the order after hearing the public prosecutor and the advocate through video call or call conferencing facility and verifying the documents, in accordance with the law. The judge will forward the documents to the jail superintendents along with the release memo, according to an office memorandum issued by K. Haripal, Registrar General.

The prisoners who are not covered by the one-month amnesty scheme introduced for decongesting Kerala jails can make use of the facility.

The lawyers of the prisoners who are thus released should submit the originals of the bail bond documents with necessary court fee stamp to the court concerned within three days of the withdrawal of the lockdown and the resumption of the normal working of the courts, Mr. Haripal said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/whatsapp-google-duo-come-to-prisoners-aid/article31219924.ece
203,2020/03/31,Revenue fall may force govt. to tighten purse,"Move to keep monthly committed expenditure at an affordable limit

The government is reported to be contemplating tough expenditure curbs to cushion the mounting strain on State finances following an alarming dip in its own revenue.

Finance Department sources told The Hindu that harsh measures have become inevitable to overcome the crisis triggered by COVID-19 and different options are being explored to rein in all expenses, including the monthly committed expenditure, to an affordable limit. A lion’s share of the income is now being channelised for meeting the committed expenditure and that would come up for a thorough scrutiny, the sources said.

“The decision of the neighbouring Telangana government, which is a revenue surplus State, points to the intensity of the crisis. Considering the lack of inflow of resources and the additional expenditure incurred for virus containment, it has already issued orders for deferring payment of wages and salaries. Though not to an extreme limit, Kerala government too would have to opt for stringent measures in the current context,” the sources said.

Income sources

The prime income sources, returns from the sale of lottery tickets amounting to ₹1,350 crore, and excise duty have virtually dried up following the lockdown and prohibition. Tax from the sale of petrol and diesel have slimmed down to a trickle. The declining oil sale had been a matter of concern for the government for the past few months.

Fall in Goods and Services Tax collection and impasse in the realty sector have compounded the fiscal woes of the government. Moreover, the government had to grant entertainment tax concession, more time for paying power and water bills and also vehicle taxes and other concessions in view of the looming virus threat.

The additional expenditure incurred for providing free ration and kits of essentials to legions irrespective of their economic status and bolstering COVID-19 testing and other health care facilities in hospitals are all being met from the frugal resources at its command.

The State government on Tuesday braced itself to contain a possible spread of COVID-19 from a set of persons who returned after a conference from the Tablighi Jamaat’s international headquarters at Nizamuddin in southwest Delhi from March 13 to 15.

At least 25 persons from the State attended the meeting from where the disease radiated to outlying States. The police tracked down 10 of the delegates to their homes in Kannur district and one to his house in Wayanad. The respective district authorities have quarantined them. The remaining are in New Delhi. One of them, a retired chemistry professor from Pathanamthitta, died in the national capital.

The government has asked the other persons to hunker down in New Delhi. The government there has shifted many of them to hospitals or quarantine centres.

205,2020/03/31,COVID-19 | Control room set up at Alappuzha Collectorate,"Migrant workers could directly call 0477 2239040 for any issues they face

A round-the-clock control room has been opened for migrant workers at the Alappuzha district collectorate in view of COVID-19.

Besides, 6,945 people were in home quarantine.

The district had witnessed two COVID-19 cases. The person who tested positive for the disease last week was at a hospital. Of the 273 samples collected so far, 243 have been tested negative.

Kerala recorded its second COVID-19 death on March 31 after a 68-year-old man, who had been in a critical condition in the ICU at Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College here since the past one week, died.

An official statement issued by the Thiruvananthapuram MCH authorities said that he was admitted to the ICU on March 23 and that his condition had worsened progressively as he had several co-morbidities, including high blood pressure and thyroid-related issues. He had been on the ventilator since the past five days after his kidneys failed, requiring him to be on dialysis.

His first test had come out as negative and his second sample showed him to be positive for COVID-19 on March 29.

The Minister for Tourism, Kadakampally Surendran, told reporters that the Health Department had not been able to pinpoint the source of the man’s infection as he had not been anywhere abroad nor had he been in contact with anyone with known history of foreign travel.

“He developed mild respiratory symptoms after March 17 and had been to the local primary health centre at Thonnackal twice. He was taken to a private medical college hospital at Venjaramood on March 23, from where he was referred to Thiruvananthapuram MCH on the same day.

208,2020/03/31,The Dharamshala International Film Festival comes home to viewers,"DIFF set up an online Viewing Room on its website on Tuesday, where it will be streaming its alumni films, free of cost to viewers across the world

“Bringing independent cinema to the mountains,” has been the catchline of the Dharamshala International Film Festival (DIFF). Now it’s unspooling the indies on a computer, laptop, mobile or tablet near you. In a unique attempt in the Indian film festival circuit, DIFF set up an online Viewing Room on its website on Tuesday where it will be streaming its alumni films, free of cost to viewers across the world.

DIFF will be showcasing a set of four to six films every couple of weeks.

The idea of sharing the films that the festival has showcased over the years took root ten days back. “Seeing the situation, the fact that everyone is at home, we thought of doing something positive,” says festival director and filmmaker Ritu Sarin. They reached out to the alumni filmmakers and were overwhelmed by the tremendous response they got in return.

“With COVID-19 reshaping the world, we have been thinking about how to reach out [to the DIFF regulars and patrons] and at the moment the filmmakers also don’t know what the future holds for them,” says Ms Sarin. The idea then, for all, has been to keep up the spirits and seek inspiration in these uncertain times in cinema itself.

The entire venture is being run on the goodwill between the filmmakers and the festival. “DIFF is run by a no profits trust. It’s [Viewing Room] in keeping with the spirit of the festival,” says Ms Sarin.

The programming too reflects the festival’s thrust: political and socially conscious cinema. At a time when online content consumption is rising exponentially, DIFF is not offering the regular popular stuff but a carefully curated list of rare, alternate films with artistic merit, underlined with a humane touch and reflecting the political realities of our times. When we are being forced to shut out the world, these films open a small window to it; when individuals and their respective countries are on a lock down mode, they offer a fantastic, expansive political and cultural peep into our uncomfortable realities, COVID or no COVID.

Sean McAllister’s A Syrian Love Story (2015) is a heartbreaking documentary that dwells on the human toll in the Middle Eastern conflict, through its focus on five years of the life of a couple that first fell in love in a Syrian prison and fled to France via Lebanon to seek political asylum. But could they truly abandon the home called Syria? Naeem Mohaiemen’s experimental film Tripoli Cancelled (2017) looks at the unsettling feeling between being at home and in asylum through a week in the life of a man stranded in an abandoned airport. Jeon Soo-Il’s A Korean in Paris (2015) is about a man cast away in the French capital in search of his wife who suddenly goes missing on their honeymoon. Prasanna Vithanage’s With You Without You (2013) juxtaposes the healing power of love against the personal traumas and political strife in the wake of the Civil War in Sri Lanka.

Coming up in the weeks ahead: Emad Burnat and Guy Davidi's 5 Broken Cameras, Abhay Kumar's Placebo (2014), Andrew Hinton and Johnny Burke's Tashi and the Monk (2014) and Ritu Sarin and Tanzing Sonam's When Hari Got Married (2013).

Meanwhile, Jio Mami Mumbai Film Festival With Star, even as it opened for entries for its next edition in November, has begun sharing a comprehensive list of films across 21 years that have screened at the festival and in their year round programme, also pointing out the streaming platforms where these titles can be accessed. The festival came up with the first list of international and Indian (both features and shorts) for the year 2019 on Sunday.

New York Indian Film Festival might have been postponed for the while but, to stay in touch with its members and supporters, festival director Aseem Chhabra has begun recommending one film or show a week — kicking off with Aijaz Khan’s Hamid — that is available on streaming platforms in the US. They are calling it our weekly “NYIFF At Home Festival”.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/m2bu1h/article31219300.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/korean,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-dharamshala-international-film-festival-comes-home-to-viewers/article31219301.ece
209,2020/03/31,Disney+ Hotstar to officially launch on April 3: Here are the subscription plans and shows on offer,"After a beta version trial in March, the brand will be available to Indian users with three different subscription plans in April

Hotstar has finally officially announced the upgrade of its website to Disney+ Hotstar in India on April 3.

Before the official launch, Disney+ Hotstar will host a ‘virtual red carpet event’ on April 2 with the premiere of The Lion King at 6pm and The Mandalorian at 8pm.

Disney+ Hotstar users will be able to interact on the social feed on the platform during the premiere, and also get a chance to chat with some of their favourite actors as well.

211,2020/03/31,Easter egg symbolism to behind-the-scenes stories: What are Kollywood directors up to?,"This period of uncertainty has taken a toll on all sections of society and the film industry is no different. Tamil filmmakers have been utilising this time to share some interesting behind-the-scenes instances from their movies

The Mankatha story

Director Venkat Prabhu’s Mankatha had a rippling effect on Tamil filmdom, in the way characters were written for mass heroes. The film, starring Ajith Kumar in the lead, opened to rave reviews from critics and audiences alike, primarily appreciating for its unadulterated portrayal of the anti-hero. Apart from the innumerable references to “Thala”, Mankatha was more popularly known as the movie for which Ajith Kumar prepared biryani for the entire cast and crew. Sharing that ‘biryani’ incident on Twitter, Venkat Prabhu dug up his old tweet which he posted during the making of Mankatha. In the tweet, he wrote, “We shot the interval block today. So when you see it in the theater, remember this was the scene where Thala cooked biryani for us.”

Talks about Mankatha 2 have been on and off and nothing has yet been finalised. Like the character who goes to enquire about Vinayak Mahadev in the climax, we are also waiting with bated breath.

The song that became the movie

A movie about impotency isn’t a subject material that you would normally expect from a debut filmmaker. But that was the catch for RS Prasanna, who made the warm and fuzzy romantic-comedy Kalyana Samayal Saadham (2013) starring his namesake actor Prasanna and Lekha Washington. One of the major highlights of the film was the way Prasanna captured the intimacy between the couple in the song ‘Mella Sirithal’, which became an instant earworm. Giving the audience a glimpse into what went into the making of the song, Prasanna posted a screenshot from the screenplay of Kalyana Samayal Saadham. He said, “The description of the script of Kalyana Samayal Saadham that became ""Mella Sirithai"" the FB song that went viral and helped us reach the audience.”

Prasanna has been using the quarantine time effectively on Twitter, sharing notes and recommending books for budding filmmakers. It must be noted that Kalyana Samayal Saadham was remade in Hindi as Shubh Mangal Saavdhaan with Ayushmann Khuranna and Bhumi Pednekar in titular roles.

Uncut gems

The youngest among the lot, Karthick Naren, chose to do something different. In a series of tweets, Karthick began to ‘decode’ his second directorial, Mafia: Chapter 1, for the benefit of the audience who otherwise felt disappointed with the end product. “Would like to share few hidden details, easter eggs and homages that may have gone unnoticed,” he posted on the micro-blogging platform.

Since then, Karthick received both praises and brickbats for his ‘decoding’ thread. Starring Arun Vijay, Prasanna and Priya Bhavani Shankar, Mafia opened to mixed reviews when it hit theatres last month and is now streaming on Amazon Prime. Meanwhile, Karthick has moved on to his next project featuring Dhanush in the lead. Written by Malayalam writers Suhas and Sharfu, D43, as it is called, is expected to release later this year or early next year. He also awaits the release of his long-pending Naragasooran.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/29t0dn/article31218245.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/K,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/what-are-directors-upto/article31218247.ece

Kiran Hegde works in public relations and took to film-making out of passion. The result was the psychological thriller, Manaroopa, which Kiran wrote, directed and produced. The film, which was released last November 22 is on now available on Amazon and has won many awards at many international film festivals.

Kiran shot Manaroopa in his village. “The geographical area is familiar to me. The Western Ghats for the forest scenes were also familiar terrain for me.”

Though the film didnot draw enough attention during its release in theatres last year, it has garnered enough attention online. And now the director is flooded with offers from the Kannada film industry, yet he is reluctant.

“I have been approached by a few production houses, but I don’t want to make films with songs and romance. And if I make a film like Manaroopa, the masses may not like it and I don’t want anyone to suffer losses because of my passion or style of filmmaking. So I am in a dilemma as to what I should do.

213,2020/03/31,"Kanika Kapoor tests COVID-19 positive for 5th time, her condition remains stable","On March 20, the Bollywood singer herself announced on Instagram that she had tested positive for the novel coronavirus

Bollywood singer Kanika Kapoor’s fifth sample test for COVID-19 has also come out to be positive.

Sample tests are being carried out on the coronavirus patients every 48 hours.

Kanika is presently admitted to the Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS).

Director of the institute, Prof. R. K. Dhiman said that the singer’s condition was stable and there was no cause for worry.

Kapoor has tested positive for coronavirus for the fifth consecutive time.

Kapoor has been in hospital for over a fortnight. On March 20, she herself announced on Instagram that she had tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

Her announcement caused a major scare in the country as she had been to parties attended by several bigwigs.

The singer, who had returned from the UK, forced the political elite like former Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and her son Dushyant Singh into quarantine. This was followed by the chain effect forcing other leaders like Derek O’ Brien, Anupriya Patel, Sanjay Singh and many others to go into self-isolation.

Kapoor has faced flak for not revealing her travel history and not going into self-isolation soon after arriving from London. The Uttar Pradesh government has also filed a case against her.

It all started when former BSP MP Akbar Ahmed Dumpy threw a birthday party on March 14, which was attended by many socialites and royals. In the list, were Uttar Pradesh Health Minister Jai Pratap Singh, Congress leader Jitin Prasada, Rajasthan’s former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia and her MP son Dushyant Singh among others. And, among the others was Kanika Kappor also.

The party was one among the three hosted by the father-in-law of former Union minister Jitin Prasada which high profile dignitaries attended.

Legendary singer Lata Mangeshkar, actors Priyanka Chopra, Alia Bhatt, Vicky Kaushal, among others on Tuesday pledged money to various relief funds aimed at combating the coronavirus pandemic in the country.

Whether in cash or kind, more and more personalities from the Indian entertainment industry are coming forward to offer support during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Mangeshkar announced on Twitter that she was donating Rs 25 lakh to the Chief Minister’s Assistance Fund as part of her “duty to help your government during this difficult time”.

“I have a humble request to all that we should help the government as much as possible in the fight against the government,” the veteran singer wrote.

Priyanka Chopra, along with popstar husband Nick Jonas, donated an undisclosed amount to 10 charities including Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund (PM-CARES), UNICEF, Goonj, Doctors Without Borders, No Kid Hungry, and SAG-AFTRA.

Taking to Twitter, the Quantico star said these organisations are doing “amazing work” by helping those impacted by the COVID19 outbreak.

“They are feeding the hungry, supporting doctors and first responders, helping low income and homeless communities, and supporting our colleagues in the entertainment industry,” she tweeted.

Nick said the idea behind highlighting these organisations was to create awareness.

“We are continuing to pray for everyone affected by #Covid19 and hope that everyone is doing their part to help flatten the curve!” the Jonas Brothers member said.

In an Instagram post, actor Katrina Kaif also said she has donated money to both, Maharashtra Chief Minister’s relief fund and PM-CARES.

“Heartbreaking to see the hardship and suffering this pandemic has unleashed in this world,” the Zero star wrote.

Alia Bhatt pledged her contribution to the PM-CARES Fund and the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund (Maharashtra).

“At a time of great difficulty, while the nation is in lockdown, the central and state governments are working tirelessly to combat COVID-19. I salute the efforts of all those on the frontlines who are putting themselves at risk so the rest of us stay safe,” she wrote in a statement on Twitter.

Vicky Kaushal said he was contributing Rs 1 crore to PM-CARES and Maharashtra Chief Minister’s Relief Fund.

“While I’m blessed enough to be seated with my loved ones in the comforts of my home, there are many who are not as fortunate...

“We are in this together and we’ll win this together. Let us all do our bit for a healthier and stronger future,” the Uri: The Surgical Strike star said.

Sara Ali Khan also pledged an undisclosed amount towards the relief work in order to combat COVID-19 spread in the country.

“I pledge to donate to the PM CARES Fund and the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund (Maharashtra)... Every contribution counts, and solidarity is our only hope against this pandemic,” the “Love Aaj Kal” actor wrote on Instagram.

Dressed like superhero Batman with a face mask, actor Ali Fazal distributed food to the ones in need.

“We’ve collected some stuff to send to Vile Parle. Near number 5 petrol pump there are a lot of people in desperate need for food... Any others out there? Keep doing the work... big or small doesn’t matter,” he captioned a video driving his car.

Popular Marathi actor Sai Tamhankar also donated Rs 1.50 lakhs to CM Relief Fund.

“Let’s do this! Together! Do your bit in any and every possible way #LetsFightCoronaTogether,” she tweeted.

Actor Prakash Raj said he was feeding 250 homeless daily wage earners in Kerala’s Kovalam city every day.

“#COVID2019india ..#kuchkarona Feeding 250 homeless..daily wage workers at Kovalam every day ..it’s not just Govt’s RESPONSIBILITY.. its OURS too. Let’s celebrate humanity,” the Bharat Ane Nenu star tweeted.

215,2020/03/31,Coronavirus effect on Tamil film industry’s daily wagers: Is there light at the end of the tunnel?,"As Kollywood wound to a halt with the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown, the fate of assistant directors, background dancers, caterers and many more is left hanging in the balance

A text message from a light man to RK Selvamani, president of Film Employees Federation of South India (FEFSI), was what alerted the Tamil film industry to a crisis brewing in its background.

Even prior to the nationwide lockdown imposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, film industries across the country had been advised to stop production in light of the Coronavirus outbreak. The future of several thousand workers (a majority of whom are daily wagers), that the film industry employs, rendered jobless at least until April 15, is now up in the air, and FEFSI, as the umbrella organisation representing the 23 crafts unions these workers belong to, has its task cut out.

A member of the production boys union, M Vallarasu, whose job it is to provide catering support to people working on a film set, says that the 21-day lockdown is “indigestible” for daily wagers like him. “To compensate for the shortfall in wages accrued over this period, I will need to work without a break for the next three or four months, if shooting resumes that is,” he adds.

Uncertain future

The question of when a shoot will resume is tricky; the end of the lockdown period does not mean that a film crew will pick up from where they dropped off: logistics, for example, will be a nightmare. And if you happen to work in a film like the Silambarasan-starrer Maanaadu (infamous for its many stop-starts), like Vallarasu was, then the prospect of having to remain out of work for much longer becomes a reality, and it is not a particularly pleasant economic situation to find oneself in.

“I will have to borrow from someone, but the problem is that nobody is willing to lend in this situation. I have asked. They tell me to come back when work has resumed. I’m thinking of pawning my wife’s jewels, but if I step out, I have to be wary of the police seizing my vehicle,” says Vallarasu, who lives in rented accommodation in Ramapuram with his wife and two daughters.

Of immediate concern for K Venugopal, a member of the technicians’ union and a daily wager since 1992, is the internal squabble within FEFSI that has resulted in a bit of ostracism from the umbrella agency.

Venugopal, whose job it is to handle the audio recorder on a film set — rewinding and forwarding the tape endlessly as the choreographer demands retakes-upon-retakes — does not want to come clear on the issue that caused the resentment, but is “hopeful” that an extraordinary situation like the Coronavirus pandemic will push people to think of everyone’s welfare.

“The actors have been giving money and rice bags. There is no announcement yet though from FEFSI on when it will be distributed to us. How to pay my rent for the next month is what I’m thinking about,” says Venugopal, who earns about ₹1,350-1,400 per day for his work.

The worst affected, according to a few in the film industry, are the assistant directors.

Says Soundararajan aka Soundar, a prominent junior artiste, member of the directors’ union and an associate of filmmaker P Vasu, “The supporting artistes also have it cut out. Most of them get paid between ₹300-500 to be part of a scene.” He adds: “Most assistant directors have little in terms of savings to their name. Say, if you are an assistant to Atlee, and he makes a film with Vijay, you would have been paid well, but even then you will run through your earnings when Atlee doesn’t make a film. Now, imagine this situation for the assistants of lower profile filmmakers.”

Numbers matter

Actors like Rajinikanth (₹50 lakh), the Suriya Sivakumar family, Vijay Sethupathi and Sivakarthikeyan (₹10 lakh), producer Kalaipuli S Thanu (250 bags of 25kg rice) and actor Yogi Babu (50 bags of 25kg rice) among others have made a few contributions. A similar situation in Bollywood, reportedly, attracted the intervention of actor Salman Khan, according to BN Tiwari, head of Federation of Western India Cine Employees, the FEFSI equivalent in Mumbai.

If this was the case with the big screen, then small screen technicians, by the looks of it, are in an even more precarious situation. SJ Edward Raj, who prefers to be quoted as Thalapathy, the president of Federation of Small Screen Technicians (FESST), says that the small screen employs “more number of technicians” than the film industry at the moment. His assessment is on the back of the number of active technicians on the field.

“At least 50 television serials are shot in various parts of the city on a daily basis. Let’s assume at least 50 technicians are on hand in all of these locations. Most of them are daily wagers,” he says. Thalapathy adds that he has reached out to small screen’s bigwigs and wealthy production houses for support, but his efforts are curtailed by the fact that unionisation of technicians is not as effective as in the film industry. “The upkeep of the union itself is a big struggle for us in the small screen. In FEFSI, the respective crafts union will demand that members give five to 10% of their earnings back to the union. What we do is to mediate in case of payment dispute or help our members’ kids to get a school or college seat. Beyond that, we don’t have the means,” he says.

Whatever funds flows into FEFSI, Selvamani will have a tough time splitting the share. The official member count of FEFSI is around 25,000. Some union members, however, insist that the membership is much higher.

RK Selvamani | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Says B Sridhar, a background dancer, whose union has around 850-odd members, that it is because most members are inactive, or have already sought out alternate employment because the film industry cannot be trusted to provide regular employment. “In the case of background dancers, only those with height, personality and glamour will be chosen to dance alongside the hero. Otherwise, the production won’t call. The ones who get no work naturally gravitate towards other employment. I know people who drive Uber cars for a living. The problem is even these alternate forms of livelihood have now been affected,” he says.

Which leads to the distinct possibility of many inactive members turning towards FEFSI for monetary support. Selvamani, for his part, and other FEFSI office-bearers, are dependent on the generosity of the bigger names in Tamil cinema to keep the contribution channels open to help battle the crisis.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/iau4hr/article31216363.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPFILMSET3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/coronavirus-effect-on-tamil-film-industrys-daily-wagers-is-there-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel/article31216364.ece
216,2020/03/31,How ‘Netflix Party’ helps you watch movies at the same time as your friends,"The free Google Chrome browser extension helps quarantine binge-watching be a little less lonelier

Tired of self-quarantining and missing binge-watching on Netflix with your friends or partner? Many of us have even taken to calling our loved ones and asking them to stay on the phone while we go through an episode together... but it doesn’t have to be that difficult.

Now, a new free tool for Google Chrome called Netflix Party makes this lockdown a whole lot bearable: it lets you start, pause and stop a show, movie or anime you watch on the platform at the same time as a group of people. You don’t have to be constantly Whatsapping people to find out which point in the episode they are on, or coordinate bathroom breaks. There’s even a chat window on the side where you can discuss plot points and moments that are going on, exactly like you would if you were next to each other.

It’s simple enough to use, and the only caveat is that everyone watching needs to have a Netflix account. The platform is offering a 3-day free trial for new subscribers, even for those who don’t.

Downloading and using Netflix Party is quite straightforward: After logging into you Netflix account, visit the www.netflixparty.com website, and download the Google Chrome extension. A grey NP icon will be visible now in the browser toolbar.

Next, after you find a show or movie that everyone wants to watch, click and open the stream.

The NP (Netflix Party) icon would have changed from gray to red. Click the icon and select Start the party. You are the host, so you can either decide to be the only controller pausing and playing the show, or the other option is to let anyone in the group take control.

Now, copy the URL from the pop-up box and send it to everyone you want to invite to the party. The chatroom appears on the right side of the screen, where everyone joining the party will be visible and give in their comments. What next? Netflix and chill... from a safe, socially-acceptable distance.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/gvmekn/article31215682.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/np1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/how-netflix-party-helps-you-watch-movies-at-the-same-time-as-your-friends/article31215684.ece
217,2020/03/31,Want a dinner date with Khaleesi? Donate to the coronavirus fund,"‘Games of Thrones’ actor Emilia Clarke has offered a virtual dinner for people donating to her charity

Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke has offered a dinner date to people donating money to SameYou, her charity that supports those recovering from brain injuries and strokes, in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

The new initiative by the foundation aims to help the National Health Service, the publicly funded healthcare system of the UK, free up beds for coronavirus patients by helping people recover from brain injuries at home.

In a video shared on Instagram on Monday, Clarke said 12 donors will be randomly selected from around the world for a virtual dinner with her.

“We’ll cook it together and eat it together. And we will discuss lots of things — isolation and fear and also funny videos. And, you know, the fact that I can’t really cook. So it’s going to be fun,” the 33-year-old said in the clip.

Clarke has set the donation amount to 250,000 pounds.

The drive is in partnership with the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Massachusetts and the University College London Hospital.

“We are creating a virtual rehabilitation clinic so brain injury survivors have somewhere to go and somewhere to feel safe and somewhere to not feel so alone and isolated, which I think is a good thing. We need to do all we can to release as many beds as possible to free up our hardworking NHS,” Clarke said.

The actor founded SameYou after revealing that she had suffered from two brain aneurysms in the early days of Game of Thrones.

218,2020/03/31,"The Telugu short film ‘Manasanamaha’, unveiled during lockdown, wins appreciation","Written and directed by Deepak Reddy, the short film is a romantic drama narrated in reverse

A new Telugu short film titled Manasanamaha (streaming on Kala Mediaworks channel on YouTube) has been winning hearts. Written and directed by aspiring feature filmmaker Deepak Reddy, the short that’s a little over 16 minutes has a youngster musing on the nature of love and recounting experiences from three past relationships.

Manasanamaha is a relationship drama, narrated for the most part in reverse.

Deepak hadn’t planned to unveil the short film during lockdown. He had completed it around six months ago, shown it to a few leading producers in the Telugu film industry and wants to make it a full-length feature film.

Earlier, a prospective producer had even advised him against uploading the short film digitally, since the story idea will be revealed. While the feature film plans are still on, the Coronavirus outbreak and the ensuing lockdown made Deepak consider uploading Manasanamaha on YouTube for everyone to see. “The feature film script is different, and the production scale is larger, so we went ahead with the digital release,” says Deepak.

Manasanamaha was written in 2018 and filmed within six days; the crew are all Deepak’s colleagues at Kala Media. The firm was established in 2014 by Deepak and his business partner Harinath Gungamari and specialises in wedding photography, corporate and ad films. From time to time, they make short films. Manasanamaha is Deepak’s fourth short film.

The short stars Viraj Ashwin, Drishika Chander, Srivalli Raghvender, Prithvi Sharma and Bunny Abhiran. Produced by Shilpa Gajjala, the short has music by Kamran and playback singer Yazin Nizar has sung a song. The narrative stands out for its technical finesse; the sound design and mixing was executed by Sachin Sudhakaran of Sync Cinema, who has worked on much appreciated films like D-16 (Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru in Tamil).

Edurolu Raju’s cinematography captures the transition from one frame to another as the story progresses through several long takes. Sometimes it’s a leaf, a glass of water or a mug of beer that transits from one frame to another, connecting the sequences. “Most of the editing was planned at the scripting stage,” says Deepak.

Since the story is narrated backwards, from the break-up to the first meeting, and all the actions happen in reverse, pre-visualisation was crucial. Deepak’s team designed 2D animated storyboards so that the crew had no ambiguity in what to execute.

Scratch the surface of what appears like a simple rom-com and Deepak presents the protagonist Surya as a metaphor to the sun, romancing women who represent different seasons — Chaitra (spring), Varsha (monsoon) and Sita (winter). He equates it to “the sun going through different seasons”. Since the story unfolds from Surya’s point of view and in reality, thought processes can be random, the first few minutes offer glimpses into Surya’s observations and thoughts. Eventually, Deepak had to bring in a structure to narrate the story.

Deepak is an engineer who got drawn towards cinema. After his engineering graduation in Kurnool, he briefly worked with an IT firm. He then enrolled in a film school in Hyderabad but eventually dropped out, not wanting to be bound by film theories. “I wanted to know the rules of filmmaking only to break them,” he says.

Before Tharun Bhascker’s Pellichoopulu (2016), Deepak remembers that it wasn’t easy for outsiders to break into the Telugu film industry and pitch stories to producers. His family, too, wanted him to be financially secure. That’s how he and Harikanth had started Kala Media.

In the meantime, Deepak also did a masters programme in the US. Not wanting to be disconnected with cinema, in 2016 he made the short film Hide and Seek, which won him appreciation in Telugu film circles.

The love for cinema was further fuelled when he was asked if he could assist and coordinate things on the sets of Sekhar Kammula’s Fidaa, when the crew was filming in the US. “That’s when I decided I had to make films. I convinced my mother and returned to India in mid 2017,” says Deepak.

Once in India, he felt he needed to understand the business dynamics of the film industry before he turned director, and started Weekend Cinema, a marketing and distribution company and has so far distributed 14 films.

The next step is to make his directorial debut through a feature film.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/k0cgss/article31214918.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/manasanamaha2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/telugu-short-film-manasanamaha-unveiled-during-lockdown-wins-appreciation/article31214919.ece
219,2020/03/31,Coronavirus | 57 more test positive in Tamil Nadu; highest single-day rise,"Fifty of the patients had taken part in a conference in Delhi; total count is 124.

Tamil Nadu recorded its highest ever single-day rise in the number of persons testing positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday: a total of 57 persons tested positive, taking the total tally to 124.

Of them, 50 — all men — had travelled to Nizamuddin in Delhi to take part in a conference in March. Twenty-two of them were from Tirunelveli; 18 from Namakkal district (12 from Namakkal, one from Paramathi Velur and five from Rasipuram); three from Villupuram; two from Madurai; four from Kanniyakumari and one from Thoothukudi.

All patients are undergoing treatment in isolation wards of government medical college hospitals.

The Health Department has traced 515 of the 1,131 persons, who returned after the conference in Nizamuddin, to various districts of the State.

Health Secretary Beela Rajesh made an appeal to the remaining persons to come forward and report to officials so that they could be quarantined, thereby preventing transmission to their family members and the community.

“If we identify them [people who returned from Delhi after attending a conference] and isolate them and cordon off the area, further spread in Tamil Nadu can be prevented,” Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam told reporters. He also said some of those who returned had either switched off their phones or left for some other location.

Dr. Rajesh said many of them returned to the State by flights and trains, while some of them visited other States and returned by road.

“Intensive containment plans were rolled out in all areas, where the persons, who had returned from Nizamuddin and tested positive, resided. We are tracing the contacts of all 515 persons, and have cordoned off the localities. We are in the process of involving the police in tracing the others. This is why we have requested those who had attended the conference to come forward. Even if they have travelled to some other State, they can inform us,” Dr. Rajesh added.

Other seven patients

Among the remaining seven patients, four were from Chennai, and were admitted in Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) and private hospitals. A 43-year-old man, a resident of Pozhichalur with travel history to Trivandrum, tested positive and is admitted to RGGGH. He is a family contact of a previously positive patient, 73-year-old woman of Pammal, who had no travel history.

A 28-year-old co-worker of another earlier patient, a 25-year-old woman who worked in a shopping mall in Chennai, has also tested positive. He is admitted to Government Medical College Hospital, Tiruvannamalai.

A 35-year-old man from Kanyakumari also tested positive and is admitted to the Government Medical College Hospital, Kanyakumari.

The number of persons under hospital isolation increased from 364 on Monday to 630 on Tuesday. A total of 2,354 samples were lifted for testing so far. As of now, 77,330 persons including those who had arrived at airports, and in trains, persons with travel history identified during door-to-door surveillance are under home quarantine.

220,2020/03/31,State police to create a healthy standby force,"At least 25,000 personnel will remain under home quarantine and will be available for duty on call

The Tamil Nadu police will maintain a third of its total strength — at least 25,000 popersonnel of different ranks — as a “healthy standby force” for deployment during exigencies in the wake of the outbreak of COVID-19.

The reserve strength would be under home quarantine and be available for duty, on call, round-the-clock. The move follows the guidelines issued by the National Disaster Management Authority and the Ministry of Home Affairs to all States, underscoring the necessity to have a healthy standby strength, police sources said on Tuesday.

The reserve strength would be rotated every week and personnel joining duty would be subjected to a mandatory health check-up. With hardly any public movement or traffic on the roads due to the nationwide lockdown enforced with prohibitory orders issued under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code, police deployment has already been reduced to the bare minimum, sources said.

In a related development, the Chennai Police on Tuesday launched aerial surveillance by deploying drones to monitor major junctions/residential areas and intervene in the event of any public congregation.

At least a dozen drones were hired from a private firm and the surveillance launched in Guindy, Kotturpuram, Adyar and along the GST Road up to Tambaram.

“The drones provide high quality live visuals which are transmitted to the control room and senior police officers for appropriate action. We are now able to get footage of happenings in remote or congested locations that are not easily accessible. Patrol vehicles will reach any scene of disturbance or congregation in less than five minutes,” Additional Commissioner of Police (South) Prem Anand Sinha said.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Tuesday announced the deferment of co-operative loan repayment, property tax and other dues by three months in view of the COVID-19 lockdown. The measures would benefit middle- and low-income groups, farmers and entrepreneurs.

The Chief Minister also called on Governor Banwarilal Purohit at the Raj Bhavan to brief him on the measures taken by the government to deal with the pandemic and its impact.

He announced an extension of the deadline for the payment of property tax and water charges to the local bodies by three months, until June 30.

“Many firms are not in a position to pay salaries and businesses have been severely affected. Daily-wage labourers are among the worst-affected. We are hoping that the CM's announcement would bring them temporary relief as far as their dues are concerned,” a top official told The Hindu.

Mr. Palaniswami announced a three-month extension of the deadline (until June 30) for the repayment of loans obtained from co-operative banks, fishermen’s cooperative societies and handloom weavers’ cooperative societies.

He extended by three months the deadline for the payment of dues to co-operative housing societies and the Tamil Nadu Housing Board, until June 30.

He also announced an extension of the deadline for the repayment of loans obtained by Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), which have obtained loans from the Tamil Nadu Industrial Investment Corporation (TIIC) Limited.

The deadline for the repayment of soft loans obtained from the State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu Limited (Sipcot) has been extended by three months. The deadline for the payment of operational and maintenance costs by units located in Sipcot industrial parks has also been extended by three months.

Mr. Palaniswami said a ‘COVID Relief and Development Scheme’ would be implemented, with an allocation of ₹200 crore for providing loans to help meet the urgent capital requirements of around 2,000 MSME units that have obtained loans from TIIC.

He also extended till June 30 the validity of various licences and fitness certificates obtained under the Motor Vehicles Act, which were due for renewal. The same will apply to licences obtained under the Weights & Measures Act and the Tamil Nadu Shops & Establishments Act that are due for renewal. “Medical experts are insisting that people should remain indoors and prevent the State from entering stage 3 [of the pandemic]. The people should follow the time restrictions announced by the State government for getting essential supplies. I urge the people not to believe rumours.

222,2020/03/31,"Pay migrant workers on time, govt. tells employers","Houseowners will face action if they force them to vacate

In view of the COVID-19 lockdown, the Tamil Nadu government has directed all District Collectors to ensure that employers pay migrant workers on time and provide for their accommodation for a month without charging rent.

The government has also advised employers against deducting any amount from the salary of the workers.

The landlords of properties where migrants are living on rent “shall not demand payment of rent for a period of one month. If any landlord is forcing labourers and students to vacate their premises, they will be liable for action,” Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam said in an order, citing a communication from the Centre.

Separately, in a statement, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami appealed to all houseowners to defer the collection of rent for March and April by two months in view of the difficulties faced by tenants under the current circumstances.

The Chief Secretary, in his order, directed Collectors and others to ensure adequate arrangements including temporary shelters and provision of food, among others, for the poor and needy, including migrant labourers, who have been stranded due to the lockdown.

“The migrant people who have moved out to reach their home States/home towns must be kept in the nearest shelter by the respective District Collectors/Commissioner, Greater Chennai Corporation after proper screening for a minimum period of 14 days as per standard health protocol,” the G.O. stated.

The authorities were also directed to ensure that all employers — be it in the industries or in shops and commercial establishments — paid the wages of their workers “at their workplaces on the due date without any deduction, for the period their establishments are under closure during the lockdown”.

Talking to reporters, Mr. Shanmugam said he had chaired a meeting with various associations from different States to ensure that migrant workers were provided shelter and remained safe. “Many of them want to go back home but we have urged these associations to insist that the workers stay back under the present circumstances.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/gxsfkj/article31222001.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01MIGRANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/pay-migrant-workers-on-time-govt-tells-employers/article31222002.ece
223,2020/03/31,Centre should ensure aid reaches the poor: PMK,"Only 75% of the bank accounts have been linked with Aadhaar card, which complicates the proposed cash transfer

: PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Tuesday said that the Centre should immediately facilitate the transfer of COVID19 lockdown financial aid to the poor in States.

In a statement, Dr. Ramadoss said that while Tamil Nadu Government has said that it will start distributing financial aid and relief measures such as rice and pulses from day after tomorrow, there is no news on when the financial aid and distribution of relief by the Central government will be passed on to the poor and the needy.

“Tamil Nadu Government's relief measures will be given in one go while Centre's relief measures will be passed on to those in need over the next three months. Rs. 1.70 lakh crore will be distributed to 80 crore poor by the Centre. Most of aid should be transferred directly to their bank accounts,” said Dr. Ramadoss.

He further said that only 75% of the bank accounts have been linked with Aadhaar card, which complicates the proposed cash transfer and majority of the poor beneficiaries don't even have a bank account.

""Since many in interior villagers do not use online transactions and will use ATMs. Out of 2.30 lakh ATMs in India, only 43,000 are in the rural areas. In the time of a lock down, it is not possible to replenish the ATMs or bank officials. This has created concerns about when the financial aid will reach the beneficiaries,"" said Dr. Ramadoss.

He said that the financial aid package is not special allowance given during festivals but what is necessary for their livelihood.

""With more than 10 days gone in the lock down, the poor are wondering where their next meal is going to come from after spending all their savings. The financial aid announced by the government should reach them as quickly as possible,"" he said.

Dr. Ramadoss urged the Centre to ensure that the financial aid and other relief measures are provided to the poor without any further delay by next week and make use of State Government's infrastructure if the need arises.

“Those who do have bank accounts or have linked their accounts with Aadhaar should be given cash in hand as an exemption,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/centre-should-ensure-aid-reaches-the-poor-pmk/article31221583.ece
224,2020/03/31,"Woman suspected of murdering husband granted bail, thanks to COVID-19","Her husband was addicted to alcohol and also to torturing her

The Madras High Court has granted interim bail to a woman suspected of strangulating her husband to death, and then making it appear as if he had committed suicide, by taking into consideration several factors including the threat of COVID-19.

Justice P. Rajamanickam took the decision despite stiff opposition by Additional Public Prosecutor M. Mohamed Riyaz who took instructions over the phone and told the judge that post mortem results proved it to be a clear case of homicide and not suicide as claimed by the petitioner.

According to the petitioner’s counsel V.G. Anbarasu, his client had got married to the deceased about 22 years ago and the couple now had a 19-year-old daughter and a 14-year-old son. Her husband was addicted to alcohol and also to torturing her.

On February 26, 2020, he came home inebriated and picked up a quarrel with the petitioner. He also eventually assaulted the petitioner and their daughter before going to his bedroom where he was later found to be hanging using a sari.

Acting on the basis of a complaint lodged by the petitioner, the New Washermenpet police in the city initially registered a First Information Report (FIR) under Section 174 (police to enquire and report on suicide) of Code of Criminal Procedure.

However, after a short preliminary investigation, the FIR was altered to Sections 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) and the petitioner was arrested on February 28 from when she remains in judicial custody.

After taking all facts into consideration, the judge in his order said: “Considering the fact that the deceased is a drunkard and also the fact that the petitioner is in custody from February 28 and also the fact that the petitioner is having two children and also in view of the emergent situation which has arisen on account of COVID-19 pandemic, this court is inclined to grant interim bail.

“Accordingly, the petitioner is directed to be released on interim bail till April 27 on executing own bond by her for Rs.10,000 to the satisfaction of the Superintendent, Central Prison, Puzhal. Post this matter before this court for further orders on April 20.”

In a move to help villagers who were left jobless due to 21-day lockdown, Chinnvarikkam village’s former vice-president Baskar chipped in to donate one bag of rice to 750 poor families of the village.

Mr. Baskar said that these people were working at leather industries, shops and as construction assistants on daily wages in Ambur and other places . “After the lockdown people were under house-arrest and were desparate. They do not have any work. In order to maintain the curfew norms, it was decided to donate 25 kg of rice to every family living in Chinnavarikam Chennappanagar, Raghunathapuram, Meganampalli and surrounding villages,” he said.

The rice bags were delivered in batches to their door steps, he said.

227,2020/03/31,Tiruvallur introduces take-away vegetable bags to reduce crowds in markets,"Each cloth bag will contain a selection of basic vegetables so that people do not have to crowd marketplaces, officials said

In a move to prevent crowding in market places and prevent the spread of COVID-19, the Tiruvallur district administration has arranged take-away vegetable bags on a trial basis from Tuesday.

Each cloth bag, priced ₹100, will contain half a kilogram of onions, tomatoes, broad beans and drumsticks and a quarter kilogram of brinjal, potatoes and carrots, as well as two green plantains, green chillies, one bunch of spinach and one bunch of curry and coriander leaves.

The programme has been started on a trial basis in Uzhavar Sandhais in Avadi and Red Hills and 100 bags have been provided at each market. The move will be initiated in Tiruverkadu, Tirutani, Tiruvallur and Poonamallee too. This will be expanded to other places based on demand.

“If a person goes to the market, he will have to spend at least 15 minutes to purchase the vegetables. This will lead to crowding in the market as many others will wait for their turn. To prevent this we have come up with this idea. People can take the bag and leave after paying the money. It will have all the essential vegetables,” said G. Pandian, Deputy Director, Agriculture.

M. Kalaichelvi, 60, a resident of Putlur near Tiruvallur welcomed the move. “Being an elderly person I cannot wait for long in the queue. It took me two hours to purchase vegetables from supermarkets,” she said.

Mageswari Ravikumar, Collector, Tiruvallur, said that similar bags will be made available for meat and fish too. “Slowly we will be providing them at the ward or street level. So people do not have to leave the locality to buy these items. We are also promoting door delivery of groceries and medicines. For details people can check http://stopcoronatiruvallur.com/,” she said.

230,2020/03/31,"After markets, no physial distancing at Siddha clinics","Social distancing went for a toss with hundreds of people thronging the Siddha clinic inside the Government Pentland Hospital, Vellore

As people have started adhering to social distancing norms at markets, many have sought herbal concoctions from Sidhha clincs and dipenaries to tackle the coronavirus crisis.

It has been advised for those on home quarantine to use this concoction if they experience symptoms of fever and throat pain . People started stocking the herbal concoction powder (‘Kabasura Kudineer’) in large quantities and now huge crowds in front of th Siddha counters cane be witnessed . The name of the concoction was derived from kabam (cold), suram (fever) and kudineer (concoction).

Social distancing went for a toss with hundreds of people thronging the Siddha clinic inside the Government Pentland Hospital, Vellore, on Tuesday. In spite of the repeated appeals by the staff pleading the people to be calm and maintain a distance between themselves , it all went into deaf ears. District administration had asked the people to adhere to social distancing in the current context of lock down, one could see people gathering around the clinics and new markets.

Initially, the flow of shoppers was minimal and there was discipline on their part to adhere to social distancing. But the social distancing went for a tailspin in the Government Pentland Hospital, which has been announced as the main treatment centre for treating patients with COVID-19.

At the old bus stand, one of the venues for the vegetable market, people thronged the vegetable stalls since morning. While officials were seen advising the people to wear masks and maintain social distancing, the locals reluctant in adhering to the rules.

With the officials relaxing the lockdown period from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. to enable the public to purchase essential commodities, vehicular traffic was back on the main roads. Though the police had put barricades on the service roads of Chennai-Bengaluru Highway and other important intersections, motorists sneaked through the spaces between the barricades.

‘Effective at early stages of flu’

Like ‘Nilavembu’ concoction that does wonders for patients suffering from dengue and chikungunya, the ‘Kabasura Kudineer’ will save patients suffering from symptoms of flu, said IMPCOPS president R. Kannan.

He said that ‘Kabasura Kudineer’ comprising of 15 herbal ingredients, should be administered to patients suffering from flu at the early stages . However, he cautioned against the level of mixture with limited ingredients, which are readily availabe in the market.

Since the Siddha formulation provided effective and permanent remedy for chikungunya and dengue, the district administrations made arrangements for ‘Nilavembu Kudineer’ distribution in the siddha clinics of the districts .",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dpu03z/article31218125.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/after-markets-no-physial-distancing-at-siddha-clinics/article31218126.ece

235,2020/03/31,"Coronavirus: Cable operators unsure of collecting rent during lockdown, want passes to be issued to address breakdown issues","With the 21-day lockdown in place in the country in a bid to flatten the curve of the spread of COVID-19, cable operators are unsure of how to collect the monthly cable bills from their customers and also want the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and TRAI to direct broadcasters to make pay channels as Free to Air for the next two months.

D.G.V.P. Sekar, president of the Federation of Cable TV Association of Tamil Nadu, told The Hindu that local cable operators might find it difficult to collect their monthly rent from customers in view of the lockdown and the restrictions imposed on movement on people.

“Many of us will feel the heat. Recovery of monthly subscription from our customers might happen only after two to three months which will make life difficult for a lage number of operators. We cannot go out to address any breakdowns or line cuts or service issues as people have been advised to not allow visitors as well. Apart from this, people have been mandated to work from home, which means that if they face any issues in cable service or their Internet which a large number of cable operators provide, we are unable to attend to them, as we have not been given passes,” Mr. Sekar said.

Mr. Sekar has also written to Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam seeking a direction to issue staff of cable tv operators with passes so that they will be able to address any issues faced by their subscribers during the lockdown.

In the letter, he said that many of the cable operators also provide internet services through various service providers and since internet has been notified as an essential service, he sought a direction to be issued to district collectors to provide them with passes. “The government is also in the cable TV business. They need to address our concerns,” he told The Hindu.

P. Sakilan, who runs TCCL, too said they were unsure of collecting the subscription from their customers. “Collecting rent is the biggest problem. We don’t know how to manage this situation as from April 1st week we have to collect rent. We are now thinking of collecting it via online mode,” he said.

Mr. Sakilan said if broadcasters ask for payments in this situation, many MSO’s will find it hard. “Broadcasters will ask for payments and we are automatically billed,” he said and said MIB and TRAI should immediately issue guidelines for encryption-free service for two months.

Mr. Sekar has also written to MIB and TRAI seeking a direction to broadcasters to provide pay channels free of cost till the outbreak subsides, taking into consideration the welfare of cable TV operators and consumers.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/vwzsom/article31216508.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/COVID19DAY6,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/coronavirus-cable-operators-unsure-of-collecting-rent-during-lockdown-want-passes-to-be-issued-to-address-breakdown-issues/article31216509.ece

Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri on Tuesday questioned the ‘meagre’ allocation of ₹3,000 crore for the fight against COVID-19 and asked why the State government was not prepared beforehand to handle the crisis.

In a statement, Mr. Alagiri said the Kerala government has allocated ₹20,000 crore, the Centre ₹15,000 crore to take measures against the outbreak of COVID-19 and for relief measures. “The Tamil Nadu government has allocated ₹3,000 crore. With such a small allocation, it is a big question mark whether this Edappadi K. Palaniswami government can save the 7 crore citizens of the State who have been locked down in their homes with fear,” Mr. Alagiri said.

He also questioned the Chief Minister over the State’s alleged lack of preparedness to tackle the spread of the virus. “The health department in the State has just 2,100 ventilators. The Coronavirus’ spread has been looming for the past three months. But only yesterday (Monday), Mr. Palaniswami announced that efforts are underway to import 2,500 ventilators, 25 lakh N-95 masks from abroad. There can be nothing else so irresponsible than this delay,” he said.

Mr. Alagiri further said Mr. Palaniswami should remember that the AIADMK won just over 1% votes more than the opposition parties in the State in the last elections. “Mr. Palaniswami has said there is no need for an all-party meet to discuss COVID-19 measures. He must know that the ruling party and opposition are two sides of the same coin. How did Mr. Palaniswami get the courage to act in a dictatorial manner?

A 43-year-old man, a resident of Pozhichalur with a travel history to Thiruvananthapuram, has tested positive and is admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. He is a family contact of a previously positive patient -- the 73-year-old woman of Pammal who had no travel history.

A 28-year-old co-worker of another earlier patient -- a 25-year-old woman, who worked in a shopping mall in Chennai -- has also tested positive. He is admitted to Government Medical College Hospital, Tiruvannamalai.

239,2020/03/31,Inter-State border resembles a conflict zone,"Many even took to sidetracking and crossing the Penganga when stopped by police on the bridge

But for sympathetic authorities on either side of the inter-State border that Adilabad district shares with Yavatmal district of Maharashtra on the bridge on Penganga river on NH 44, the scene would have resembled a conflict zone as groups of migrant workers and others made desperate efforts to cross the dividing line during the last two days in the manner that refugees do.

The steady stream of hundreds of workers, mostly ‘fleeing’ the lockdown from Hyderabad on foot carrying rations and other bare essentials as head loads to destinations as far as Kanpur and Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh, among others, even took to sidetracking and crossing the river when stopped by the police on the bridge.

People like Dileep Uttam, Veerender Sonkar and Sarvan Sonkar from Movaiyya in Fatehpur district of UP, who sold ice-cream in Ghatkesar, had managed to partly walk and partly hitch a ride offered by sympathetic lorry drivers, to cover the 320 km to reach the border on March 30, only to be told that they would not be allowed into Maharashtra. They waited for sometime and joined another group of migrant workers from Hyderabad which sidetracked the NH and crossed the river.

Some of the workers were not lucky in so far as food was concerned as they missed the groups of do-gooders who supplied meals at regular intervals all along the road. Ram Bilas Kushwaha and his group of 14 got to eat only once during the 24-hour that the members were on road before they reached the border.

Like most of the migrants on the road Prem Niyogi, a skilled floorer from Madhya Pradesh, was on the edge of despair. “I fled as the contractor did not pay up my wages for the last week and forced us to go away to our native places,” he revealed, summing up for a majority of the fleeing people.

“The Telangana government should seek cooperation from other State governments to where the workers belong so that the latter can at least reassure them with regard to food and shelter,” opined a police officer. “The workers should be assured that the lockdown is going to end sooner than later and there will be plenty of work in the coming days,” he added.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/j3dguh/article31222249.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY01MIGRANTLABOUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/inter-state-border-resembles-a-conflict-zone/article31222244.ece
240,2020/03/31,Telangana bid to trace close contacts of Delhi returnees,"Nearly 2,000 from State attended Delhi meeting

Tracing the primary and secondary contacts of close to 2,000 people who recently returned to Telangana from a two-day religious programme in Delhi is the task staring at the State police machinery right now. As number of coronavirus positive cases among these returnees started rising, intelligence and local police teams are going to every nook and corner of the State to identify their primary and secondary contacts.

Identification of these contacts, also described as close and casual contacts, has become crucial to check further spread of COVID-19. Preliminary inquiries suggested that there could be a few hundred persons from the State who attended the meeting in Delhi.

When a septuagenarian from Hyderabad died while undergoing treatment at a hospital late on Saturday, routine inquiries by Health and police officials revealed that he returned to city after attending a religious meeting in Delhi. With his samples testing positive for COVID-19, police began verifying with Delhi authorities only to realise that close to 2,000 people from Telangana participated in the Delhi meeting.

Late on Monday night, police identified nearly 1,300 members. By Tuesday evening, 700 more were identified. “The figure is likely to rise at least by another 200 from the inputs we are getting from districts,” a police officer unwilling to be named said.

Police have details of about 2,000 persons who had travelled to Delhi and returned to the State. But the biggest challenge for them is tracing their primary and secondary contacts. “We are sending these people to hospitals for tests and quarantine. Immediate family members are their primary contacts and all of them are being home quarantined,” police officials said.

During initial inquiries, not many people came forward to divulge details of fellow participants at the Delhi meeting. “But when word spread that six of those who attended the meeting died , many voluntarily started giving details,” the police said.

Along with details of railway reservations, the police are trying to identify how many travelled in general compartments to reach Telangana. “No one has clear information on this. Nevertheless, we’re trying our best to trace them,” the authorities said.

Not leaving anything to chance, police teams are asking the Delhi meeting attendees to recall who all they met and where all they moved after their return. List of persons they had met and places they had gone around are being prepared to identity secondary contacts.

“Considerable number of these people are from middle or lower middle class families. Taking all facts and circumstances into consideration, efforts are on to ascertain to what extent the virus might have spread,” the police officials said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/6o1z0e/article31221806.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy01MARKAZ-PRAYERS3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/telangana-bid-to-trace-close-contacts-of-delhi-returnees/article31221060.ece

242,2020/03/31,HC commutes rapist’s life term to 10 years jail,"Observing that the rape of a minor in Maripeda police station area of Warangal district reported in 2014 “did not fall into the category of rarest of rare case”, Telangana High Court has commuted the life imprisonment awarded to the convict to 10 years rigorous imprisonment.

The judgment was passed by a bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy in a criminal appeal filed by Banoth Ravi. The latter charged with section 376 (2) (i) of Indian Penal Code and provision of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act was convicted by the lower court and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment.

The bench upheld his conviction under provisions of both the laws. Though the sentence was commuted, the bench made it clear that he shall not be granted the benefits of parole either by the jail authorities or the courts.

In October 2014, 30-year-old Ravi allegedly lured the minor to his maternal grandmother’s house in Thirumalayapalem of Khammam district. He was accused of repeatedly violating her there for three days. Holding him guilty of the crime, the trial court awarded life imprisonment to Ravi.

The bench observed that before awarding harshest punishment to a person, the courts should ensure the crime falls under the category of the rarest of the rare. “For, the harshest punishment cannot be inflicted as a knee-jerk reaction to an accident,” the bench observed.

Though the prosecution had proved that the accused had violated the victim, medical evidence did not indicate that the crime was committed under aggravated circumstances, the bench observed. Even after sexually assaulting her, the accused did not maltreat the victim. “Hence the case certainly does not fall within the category of being the rarest of rare case,” the bench noted.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hc-commutes-rapists-life-term-to-10-years-jail/article31220975.ece
243,2020/03/31,BJP urges CM to rethink on salary cuts,"Provide proper safety gear to frontline staff, says BJP State chief

Telangana BJP president Bandi Sanjay has urged Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to rethink on reducing the salaries of government employees and pointed out that it has sent a wrong signal to scores of frontline staff working in the medical, health, municipal and police departments against the spread of COVID-19.

In a letter addressed to the Chief Minister, a copy of which was released to the media on Tuesday, Mr. Sanjay pledged support to the government’s initiatives on COVID-19, however, he wanted it provide more support to doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, sanitation workers, police constables and officers working round-the-clock by paying them salaries in full.

In addition, the government should ensure they are given the right protection wear to discharge their respective duties like masks, special suits, sanitisers and so on. The Karinmanagar MP said TS became the first State in the country to impose a cut in salaries and pensions earning itself a dubious distinction when Prime Minister Narendra Modi called upon the private sector and others not to retrench workers but provide them with full salaries during the lockdown period.

“Telangana had claims to be a wealthy State but within a fortnight of lockdown, the government has thrown up its hands, it is unbelievable. What is the message being sent across to the private and unorganised sector when the government itself wants to cut the salaries and pensions? Citizens already under strain due to the Coronovirus outbreak and lockdowns have become even more despondent,” he claimed.

The BJP leader also called upon the Chief Minister to take steps to ensure that lakhs of construction labour are benefitted from the accumulated ₹2,300 crore of building cess by sending the money directly into their bank accounts as the step has been cleared by the Central government.

Mr. Sanjay appealed to the partymen to come to the rescue of the poor and the downtrodden by providing them with essential provisions and food wherever possible. Heeding his call, senior leaders like former president K. Laxman, city president N. Ramchander Rao and others had begun supplying rations to poor people in their respective areas.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bjp-urges-cm-to-rethink-on-salary-cuts/article31220900.ece
244,2020/03/31,Pensioners term cut unconstitutional,"Private sector likely to follow example, say Left parties

Opposition parties and pensioners alike have opposed the government’s decision to defer payment of portion of salaries and pensions to the government staff and pensioners citing the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) on the economy.

The Telangana Pensioners Joint Action Commission said the government’s decision was “unconstitutional” while the Opposition parties said deferment of payment of portion of salaries and pensions would impact the services that are being delivered by employees during the crisis. They demanded that the government rescind its decision so that the morale of the employees was kept intact.

In a letter addressed to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, opposition parties led by CPI (Marxist) State secretary T. Veerabhadram and his CPI counterpart Chada Venkat Reddy said medical professionals, police personnel, sanitation staff and other departments that were working overtime to contain the spread of the virus risking their own lives and they would be adversely impacted by the decision.

It was not appropriate on the part of the government to claim that the State’s economy suffered on account of 21-day lockdown. The decision comes at a time when the Chief Minister himself assured that he would convince the Central government and the RBI to opt for overdraft facility if need be to bridge the gaps in finances. “It is not proper on the part of the Chief Minister to retract from his claims in so short a time,” the letter said.

Moreover, the decision comes in the light of the orders issued by the government asking the private sector to ensure that salaries of the employees were paid promptly without fail. The government’s decision could influence private sector which too could opt for arbitrary cut in the salaries being paid to the employees. They demanded that the government should instead reduce subsidies given to the rich and corporates and could consider levying new taxes on them to augment its resources rather than cutting down on the payments to employees.

They demanded that the government conduct an all-party meeting to discuss about the situation arising out of the COVID-19 impact on the State so that an action plan could be evolved to effectively tackle the situation.

Pensioners JAC representative K. Lakshmaiah said the decision was unconstitutional as Article 360 of the Constitution provided for cutting the salaries only during a financial emergency. In case of other calamities, the employees/pensioners could decide about the quantum of assistance they would extend for the relief works. Even the Epidemic Diseases Act 1897 adopted by the government did not contain any provision relating to cuts on salaries of the employees, he said adding the government should immediately rescind its decision.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/pensioners-term-cut-unconstitutional/article31220835.ece
245,2020/03/31,"Slashing salaries is ridiculous, says Congress","Demands white paper on State finances

Telangana Congress has strongly opposed the decision of State government to slash the salaries of employees and described it as ‘hasty’ and ‘ill-timed’.

In separate statements here, Bhongir MP Komatireddy Venkata Reddy, former minister Shabbir Ali and TPCC treasurer Gudur Narayan Reddy accused Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao of demoralising the government staff who are working overtime to save people in this hour of crisis, and cuts in payment for pensioners was ridiculous.

Mr. Venkata Reddy demanded that the Chief Minister first release a white paper on the funds spent by the State government to deal with the coronavirus and the estimated revenue loss to the State’s exchequer due to lockdown. If just eight days of lockdown has forced government to reduce salaries by 50% it shows that there is something seriously wrong with the State finances, he said. “This is happening in a State where the CM day-in and day-out claims Telangana was the richest State in the country,” he said.

Mr. Narayan Reddy said every month the State Government spends nearly ₹ 1900 crore on Salaries and nearly ₹ 860 crore on pensions. By affecting a cut by 50% in salaries and pensions, the State government, on an average, could save about ₹ 1370 crore in a month. “The Chief Minister should first give details of amount spent on treatment of coronavirus patients, including the cost on quarantine centres, upgradation of existing health infrastructure, establishment of new hospitals and related expenses. Further, he should come up with details on likely impact of coronavirus lockdown on the State’s economy,” he said.

He said Finance Minister Harish Rao presented a budget of ₹ 1,82,914 crore for the financial year 2020-21 only 22 days ago. He has projected a revenue surplus of ₹ 4,482 crore in financial year beginning Wednesday. Even if the overall expenditure and losses due to coronavirus reaches ₹ 20,000 crore, then it would be around 10% of total budget. “The Chief Minister cannot force the employees and pensioners to bear the burden for his inability to manage State’s finance in an effective manner,” he said.

Mr. Shabbir Ali said that the State government took the decision at a wrong time as it would demoralise the entire staff. “One can imagine the reaction of doctors or nurses, who are working relentlessly to treat coronavirus patients. They will be in an emotional shock and it will have a directly impact on their performance,” he said.

Further, a cut in the pensioners’ amount by 50% was ‘insane’. “All retired employees have no other sources of living. They spend a large part of the pension amount on medical bills and food. How will they manage with just only 50% amount?” he asked.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/slashing-salaries-is-ridiculous-says-congress/article31220777.ece
246,2020/03/31,Why tenders for KLIP now: Revanth,"Public hearing for Pharma City scheduled during lockdown, says Congress MP

Congress MP A. Revanth Reddy has questioned the government’s motives to issue notices to farmers for land acquisition for Pharma city when the entire country was worried over the spread of coronavirus.

In an open letter to Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao here on Tuesday, he said that revenue officials have issued notices for land acquisition for Pharma City and that a Open House was scheduled to be conducted on April 3 when the government itself has declared lockdown till April 14. “What is the logic behind this,” he asked.

When the country is facing a catastrophe, as a responsible opposition Congress is supporting the government, but it will raise issues of public interest and the ‘deceitful’ steps, he said in the letter.

Mr. Reddy also said that tenders to the tune of ₹11,710 crore were called on Monday for lifting the third TMC water from the Kaleshwaram project. Tenders for another ₹10,580 crores were being called in a couple of days, he alleged and asked why the government was in a hurry to call for these tenders now. He said when the offices of companies were locked and government employees too were facing lockdown, how will they go to office and come up with the estimates, he asked.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/why-tenders-for-klip-now-revanth/article31220675.ece
247,2020/03/31,"Govt. clarifies that it is not salary cut, only deferment","Unable to pay full salary due to COVID-19 impact on economy

The State government has asserted that there will be no cut in the salaries paid to different sections of employees and that it has decided to defer the payment of full salaries in view of the impact of Coronavirus on the state’s economy.

The government clarified that the orders would come into force for the gross salary for the month of March payable on April 1 and the measure would continue to be in force till further orders. The government, according to sources, took the decision as there was steep fall in the revenues in view of the lockdown imposed across the State from March 22 and the lockdown would continue till April 14.

Accordingly, it had ordered deferment on payment of wages/salaries, including all allowances and perks/pensions had been contemplated. The deferment in gross salary in respect of the Chief Minister, Cabinet Ministers, MLAs, MLCs, chairpersons of corporations and elected representatives of local bodies would be 75 % while it would be 60 % of gross salary in respect of All India Services officers, including IAS, IPS and IFS officers.

The deferment in respect of all other categories of the employees would be 50 % in gross salary, except for Class-IV employees and in respect of Class-IV employees, outsourcing and contract staff, the deferment would be 10 %. Similar deferment would be effective for retired employees as per their category and deduction of salaries/pensions of employees of all PSUs/government aided institutions/organisations would be on par with the government employees.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/govt-clarifies-that-it-is-not-salary-cut-only-deferment/article31220595.ece
248,2020/03/31,Andhra Bank fades into history,"Post-amalgamation no major change for customers for now

Come April 1, it will be curtains for Andhra Bank as one of the oldest and well-known household names in the region gets amalgamated with Union Bank of India.

A part of the Central government plan to create four larger banks by merging 10, the move will see Andhra Bank over time coming to be identified as Union Bank of India.

While its fading into history is certain, what, however, will remain in public memory is the long association it built with lakhs of customers, earning their trust and rendering decades of service. For the Telugu States, it will be second, home grown bank they will have to let go. State Bank of Hyderabad (SBH) was the first when it got merged with the State Bank of India (SBI) in April 2017.

Under the present plan of the Centre, four sets of merger will come into force on Wednesday. One of them will see Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank amalgamating into Union Bank of India. The combined entity will be the 5th largest public sector bank and will have the 4th largest branch network of any bank in India, Union Bank of India said.

Hoary history

Andhra Bank was founded by freedom fighter Bhogaraju Pattabhi Sitaramayya and commenced business on November 28, 1923 with a paid up capital of ₹ 1 lakh and an authorised capital of ₹10 lakh. The present network of the bank comprises nearly 2,900 branches and almost 3,800 ATMs.

Union Bank of India Managing Director and CEO Rajkiran Rai G. had recently said the combined entity will have 9,500 branches and 12,000 ATMs across the country. Of the 9,500 branches, 700 plus are to be rationalised because of their proximity. But it will not happen immediately. Maybe around 300 branches will be rationalised in the first year, he had said.

Thus it is expected to be business as usual when Andhra Bank customers walk into their branches, for some time April 1 onwards. Sources in the bank said for now it will be a balance sheet merger. While other changes were on cards, their implementation has slowed down because of the COVID-19 triggered lockdown. Clarity on various other aspects was also awaited, the Andhra Bank official, who did not wish to be named, said.

Technical integration

Mr. Rai had said the amalgamation will create an employee base of 75,000, of which 37,000 are from Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank put together. He said the technology integration is likely to take one year.

FAQs on Union Bank of India website said all branches of the three banks will continue to operate for now. There will be no closure of ATMs for now. The existing account number, IFSC code, MICR code, debit card number will continue even after amalgamation. Existing cheque books and pass books will continue to be valid and any change will be communicated in advance. Post amalgamation, customers of Corporation Bank and Andhra Bank will be able to access Union Bank of India’s ATMs and vice versa without any additional charges.

249,2020/03/31,Stage set for distribution of 12 kg rice from today,"The stage is set for distribution of 12 kg rice each to the members of the white ration card holders from Wednesday.

The process follows the announcement of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao that 12 kg rice would be distributed to each of the members of the cardholders’ families in view of the ongoing lockdown. An estimated 3.36 lakh metric tonnes of rice worth little over ₹1,100 crore had been earmarked for the purpose and the rice would be distributed through the 17,200 fair price shops spread across the State.

The Civil Supplies department would distribute tokens duly mentioning time slots on them to the cardholders to avail the benefit and the measure has been adopted to avoid overcrowding at fair price shops. Social distancing for consumers is made mandatory and the fair price shops have been instructed to ensure availability of soaps, sanitisers at their premises.

The department has decided to exempt bio-metric authentication at the e-POS machines for cardholders who draw their ration regularly. Instead, the department has decided to utilise the third party authentication option ensuring the presence of sarpanch, village revenue officer or panchayat secretary for authenticating the cardholders drawing their ration.

Bio-metric authentication is however mandatory for cardholders who did not draw their ration for the last three months to avoid misuse. In the instructions issued on Tuesday, the department said the officials concerned should submit daily progress report to the office of the Chief Secretary at 5 pm without fail.

The department has asked the officials concerned to position sufficient stocks at the fair price shops so that there would be no inconvenience to cardholders while drawing their ration. Moreover, there is no limitation of time for distribution of the rice as token system with specific timeslots was being introduced. The government had also announced intentions to credit ₹1,500 each in the accounts of the cardholders enabling them to buy essentials other than rice like vegetables, pulses and others.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/stage-set-for-distribution-of-12-kg-rice-from-today/article31220445.ece
250,2020/03/31,No more Andhra Bank caps in sport,"A major sponsor in local sporting events

It’s curtains for Andhra Bank as an entity in sports as it is going to be merged with Union Bank of India from April 1. The bank had achieved a formidable reputation in the sports field and had built a strong affinity with the people of the Telugu-speaking States since its inception.

It will be a different experience, especially for the cricketers who have been representing Andhra Bank, which first played in the HCA League in 1971-72 season as an Institution Team.

The Bank boasted of some 50 first-class cricketers and four internationals — M.V. Narasimha Rao, S.L. Venkatapathi Raju, V.V.S. Laxman, Hanuma Vihari — apart from kabaddi internationals like K. Jagdishwar Yadav, Srinivas Reddy (well-known coach in Pro Kabaddi League) and Sudhakar Goud.

Interestingly, when the chief executive handling Andhra Bank team in the HCA sent the membership renewal fee he was politely told to wait by the latter to get some clarity. Now, a senior HCA official confirmed to The Hindu that they would continue to recognise Andhra Bank till all the formalities of name change and other related issued are addressed. Luckily the domestic season is starting only by June.

A. Nandakishore, former cricketer and now qualified BCCI umpire says there is a tinge of sadness that this entity is lost. “But again, we are part of a system which has to keep going in the interests of the public,” he says.

Jyothi Prasad, who was in the India camp along with Sunil Gavaskar and others in 1978, recalls that the only time Andhra Bank played in the All India Moin-ud-Dowlah Gold Cup was in 1977 when it was led by India off-spinner S. Venkatraghavan and included Anshuman Gaekwad, Surinder Amarnath, Duleep Mendis besides the local players like himself, Vijaya Paul and V. Ramnarayan.

“Our Bank, led by Vijaya Paul, also has the distinction of completing four Grand Slams between 1974-79 winning all the four titles at stake — Behram-ud-Dowlah, Maharaja Kishen Pershad, Goraksekhar and Ghulam Ali,” recalls Jyothi Prasad, who recalls that the Bank gave everything to them and was like a mother to all the players.

By all means, it will be a different and touching experience when the former and Andhra Bank sportspersons move around under a new banner!",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/5n9oyl/article31220407.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy01cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/no-more-andhra-bank-caps-in-sport/article31220408.ece

The Hyderabad International Airport is continuing to handle COVID-19 relief and evacuation flights despite the shutdown. A special relief flight operated by Air India arrived to evacuate German nationals stranded in Hyderabad on Tuesday.

The special flight - AI 3005, a Dreamliner (Boeing B787-8) aircraft landed at 7.32 a.m. from Chennai and a group of 38 passengers including 19 females, 17 males and two infants from various places in the city reached the airport at around 6 a.m with the help of the German Consulate and TS government.

The passengers were serviced through the fully-sanitised Interim International Departures Terminal (IIDT) and a select group of personnel from GHIAL terminal operations, AOCC (Airport operations & control center), ATC (Air Traffic Control), CISF, immigration, customs, and others were available to ensure safe and seamless departure of the stranded passengers, an official spokesman said.

Special screening and safety measures were in place to protect against COVID-19 threat including thermal screening prior to entry and social distancing enforced through special queuing arrangements at all passenger processing points. A few German nationals picked up from Chennai were already seated in the plane when these passengers clambered on. The special relief flight departed to Mumbai at 9.22 a.m. and then to Frankfurt.

253,2020/03/31,Now call mobile rythu bazaar to your area,"Vegetable markets in congested places being shifted to spacious sites: Minister

In yet another measure to help people remain in their home or in their residential complexes during the lockdown imposed to prevent the spread of coronavirus, the State government has arranged mobile Rythu Bazars on call facility to residential colonies, apartments and apartment complexes.

Such residents could call on mobile number 7330733212 to register their locality or apartment name for the arrival of mobile Rythu Bazaar, Minister for Agriculture and Marketing S. Niranjan Reddy stated here on Tuesday. Besides, the youth willing to run mobile Rythu Bazaars could also call on the mobile number to take up the business.

The objective of all such measures was to ensure availability of vegetables to people near their homes so that they were not made to venture out to buy the essential farm produce. The government was trying to cover as many areas as possible with mobile Rythu Bazaars to provide vegetables at reasonable prices to people.

Meanwhile, a total of 254 mobile rythu bazaars sold vegetables at reasonable prices in 504 localities in the State Capital on Tuesday. The government has already allowed those operating the mobile vans to sell the fresh vegetables and fruits that they could collect an extra ₹5 a kg on sale of vegetables over and above the rates fixed by the government in the regular rythu bazaars.

Shifting of markets

All vegetable markets in the State which are currently located in congested placed were being located to sites where traders could sell the agricultural produce (vegetables and fruits) by setting up their shops within a safe distance from one another so that consumers could move safely and purchase their needs, the Minister stated.

He went round the Saroornagar Stadium on Tuesday to oversee the arrangements being made to shift the L.B. Nagar vegetable market to the stadium to minimise and prevent the spread of coronavirus. Suggesting the people to maintain social distance, the idea with which the vegetable markets were being relocated to spacious sites from the congested once, the Minister said the purpose of the exercise would get defeated if the people leave the caution to winds.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/3gj9r/article31221636.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy01ryuthubazar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/now-call-mobile-rythu-bazaar-to-your-area/article31219394.ece

255,2020/03/31,ICAR-IIRR scientists identify novel blast-resistant rice gene,"Popular BPT variety rice with blast resistant gene to become available to ryots soon

In a breakthrough finding that could go a long way in reducing yield losses of paddy due to the infestation of rice blast disease both on leaf and neck, a group of scientists at the ICAR–Indian Institute of Rice Research (IIRR) here have identified a gene that offers resistance to the most destructive disease in the crop.

The team of scientists led by Principal Scientist in Plant Biotechnology at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research-IIRR M.S. Madhav have found a gene that has helped effectively arrest both the leaf and neck blast diseases in paddy. The disease, which is prevalent not only in the Telugu States but across the country and outside, reduces paddy yield about 30%.

Outbreak of blast disease is a serious concern in many States in the country, including Telangana and Andhra Pradesh where its incidence has been rampant in recent years. High variation in day and night temperatures provide conducive atmosphere for the infestation and spread of the disease. It is estimated that the yield loss caused by the pathogen every year globally is equivalent to quantity required to feed nearly 60 million people.

“We have been doing research on finding a gene that can withstand or prevent the leaf and neck blast, known as ‘aggi tegulu – aaku tegulu and medavirupu tegulu’ in Telugu, for the last 20 years. But, all the genes extracted by our team for several local and overseas varieties could not prove effective on arresting leaf blast,” Mr. Madhav told The Hindu explaining their hard work.

However, the gene extracted from a wild variety called Oryza Glumaepatula native to South America has proved to be effective in arresting both the leaf and neck blast diseases on paddy both at laboratory level and during the ongoing field experiments. Mr. Madhav stated that a report on their research findings was recently published in an international journal Rice and it was available for access by everyone.

The team of scientists that also comprises S. J. S. Rama Devi, Kuldeep Singh, B. Umakanth, B. Vishalakshi, K. Vijaya Sudhakara Rao, B. Suneel, S. K. Sharma, Gopala Krishna Murthy Kadambari, M. S. Prasad, P. Senguttvel and Divya P. Syamaladevi, have transferred the gene into the locally popular rice variety BPT5204 or samba masuri through marker-assisted selection. “The blast resistant BPT variety would be available to the farming community in less than two years,” Mr. Madhav stated.

The outcome of the research is highly useful for development blast resistant varieties suitable for cultivation in diverse agro-climatic conditions for combating the disease for global food security, he added.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/mlnmyx/article31219049.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY31RICEBLAST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/icar-iirr-scientists-identify-novel-blast-resistant-rice-gene/article31219050.ece
256,2020/03/31,Discoms’ staff want stoppage of customer services with close human contact,"They fear handling cash remitted by consumers to pay bills with COVID-19 spread fear

At a time when the scare of spread of coronavirus has been making even the newspaper and milk delivery boys runaway from their work, partly due to fear among themselves and partly due to customers refusal to receive the products, some institutions engaged in “essential services” have been continuing their work unmindful of the fear among their employees.

Although all the four power utilities in the State have been categorised under the essential services by the State government even during the ongoing lockdown (to slowdown and prevent the spread of coronavirus) to ensure uninterrupted power supply to all categories of consumers, the staff of the two distribution companies (discoms) engaged in revenue collection and other customer services are a worried lot as they need to come in contact with people.

“Handling cash being remitted by consumers as part of payment of their energy bills is getting scary, in the wake of coronavirus spread and the news that the virus would spread through the currency notes too as they change hands very often. Besides, maintaining social distance is almost impossible as all those who come to pay bills are not completely aware of the current situation,” a revenue collection employee in Kukatpally, preferring to be anonymous, told The Hindu.

According to officials, there are about 80 customer service centres (CSCs) in the State, including 13 integrated CSCs, in the City and four outside offering various power-related customer services, including revenue collection. There are another 63 energy revenue offices where bill payment is accepted from consumers. Of them, 22 are in the City and 41 across the State.

The CSCs and ICSCs also offer services such as category change, name change and additional load request of existing consumers as also processing new service connection applications. However, they all require biometric authentication of the consumers. “We are taking care like cleaning the biometric authentication recording device with sanitiser after use by every consumer coming to us, but it all filled with risk. People, particularly from IT sector are coming to the centres for getting the work done since most of them are working from home now,” another discom employee manning an ICSC stated.

They want the government to discontinue the services which require close human-to-human contact such as collecting the biometric authentication as has been done by the passport and property registration services, which also involve biometric authentication, to prevent the virus spread. The biometric attendance system even in the corporate and few other main offices of the four power utilities has been discontinued by rolling back to signing of attendance register in the wake of coronavirus scare, but not the customer services involving such system, they pointed out.

MoP reduces LC by 50%

In an attempt to provide relief to the power distribution companies facing liquidity problems due to the delays in revenue collection in the ongoing lockdown, the Ministry of Power has recently directed the Central public sector generation and transmission companies to continue supply of electricity to discoms, irrespective of their large outstanding dues, during the present emergency.

The MoP has also made it clear that there would be no curtailment of supply of power to any discom. Further, the Ministry has also decided to reduce the payment security mechanism (letter of credit given to the generation companies) by 50% till June-end for continuing power supply.

Besides, directions have been issued to the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission to provide a moratorium of three months to discoms to make payments to generating companies and transmission licensees and not to levy penal rates of late payment surcharge. The MoP has also asked the State governments to issue similar directions to State electricity regulatory commissions.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ndl9sn/article31219034.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY31BILL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/discoms-staff-want-stoppage-of-customer-services-with-close-human-contact/article31219035.ece
257,2020/03/31,Returnees of Jamaat in New Delhi’s Nizamuddin stopped at Telangana-Maharashtra border,"32 of them were returning in a lorry; they also reportedly visited Ajmer

Authorities on the Telangana-Maharashtra inter-State border on Penganga river on NH 44 in Adilabad district intercepted a lorry carrying 32 passengers in the small hours Tuesday.

The passengers, who were headed for their homes in Medipally in Jagtial district were returning from the Tablighi Jamaat held at Nizamuddin in New Delhi between March 13 and 15.

Hitched or hired?

The group had reportedly visited Ajmer in Rajasthan after the New Delhi event. It was not clear whether they had hitched a ride on the lorry.

The local police informed their counterparts in Jagtial district.

258,2020/03/31,"Despite lockdown, fires ravage forests hinting at sabotage","A whopping 3,996 fires recorded during the last seven days only in Telangana

The lockdown apparently does not work in the forests of Telangana where fires are ravaging nature with unparallelled immunity, according to the Forest Fire Alert System based on satellite remote sensing technology. The State has recorded over 6,000 fires in its forests since November 1 last year, of which a whopping 3,996 were recorded during the last seven days only, both numbers being highest in the country as per the alerts put out by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) and the Suomi-National Polar Orbiting Partnership Spacecraft-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite part of the alert system.

The current record is actually lesser in number than the forest fires recorded in the State in the previous year but it is perturbing to note that there was a sudden and sharp spurt in the incidence corresponding with declaration of lockdown in view of COVID-19, indicating towards ‘sabotage’. For example, the Kawal Tiger Reserve (KTR) spread over former composite Adilabad district recorded 134 fires between March 1 and 21 while the number jumped to 477 for a much smaller period, between March 22 and 29.

March 29 was the worst of the days as it saw a mindboggling 103 fires raging in the KTR forest. A cursory study of the pattern of forest points this season reveals that the incidence is concentrated in KTR area falling in Nirmal and Adilabad districts mainly in Nirmal and Khanapur Forest Divisions in the former, and Utnoor and Ichoda Forest Divisions in the latter.

Conspiracy

According to department officials, the pattern shows some kind of conspiracy in that no compartment in given sections have been ignored by those who are lighting the fires. The pointer is, as usual, towards the beedi leaf contractors as tendu leaf is collected in most of these areas and towards the Multanis of Ichoda and Sirikonda mandals in Adilabad district as a large number of forest fire points have been the area of operation of these habitual timber smugglers.

“The fires have actually started even before the khallas or beedi leaf units were auctioned off. Multanis maybe setting the forest on fire either as a measure of revenge for the crackdown on their activities last year or are doing the bidding of the contractors,” a Forest official opined.

“Only patrolling by some armed force will save precious life in the wilds. The loss extends in hundreds of sq kms of forest area and if translated into money would run into several hundred crores of rupees,” added another official giving his reason for dealing with the phenomenon more stringently.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/vegg76/article31212949.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY31FOREST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/despite-lockdown-fires-ravage-forests-hinting-at-sabotage/article31212950.ece
259,2020/03/31,"COVID-19: Edutech companies buck the trend, go on a hiring spree now","They are trying to make the most of the increased demand for online tutors now

The lockdown resulting from COVID-19 pandemic has ensured that most things are in abeyance — and one would intuitively expect hiring plans to be high up on that list. That conclusion would not be entirely true, because the edutech sector is bucking the trend, hiring big-time.

Tutors who can teach new-age computer skills remotely to children — that are not taught in the classroom — are much in demand. These skills include how to code to design games and apps.

Gurugram-based Camp K12 is onboarding stay-at-home mothers with a technology background to teach coding to children.

CodingZen, a New Delhi-based coding academy that is on an expansion mode, has shifted its interest online.

“We cater to B2B schools, B2C centres and online market; we were not betting big on the latter,” says Varun Juneja, director - operations, CodingZen. They have also been catering to children in the United States for online coding programmes. “But the lockdown has contributed to increasing interest in online content among Indians too,” he says.

Juneja says the company was planning to hire 10-15 people but the extended vacation has led them to hire almost double the originally planned number.

“While many have signed up for a long-term association, some are only for the short term and these include school teachers who want to put their computer skills to better use,” says Juneja.

“We have found that mothers naturally excel at teaching as they connect instantly with children and know how to teach at their level,” says Sumitan Kaushal, head of operations, Camp K12.

To cater to the increased demand for live master classes and webinars, Harappa Education has roped in “faculty” from abroad. Before the novel Coronavirus outbreak, these facilitators were only preparing the curriculum, now they also engage in teaching.

Subject matter experts

Lido Learning that offers online tutors for grades IV to IX has ramped up hiring now.

“We are hiring close to 100 people a week, a majority are teachers,” says Sahil Sheth, founder and CEO, Lido Learning. A post on its website has expressed that mathematics and science tutors are required. Besides a bachelor’s degree and a high level of fluency in English, tutors must have a commanding screen presence that would hold the student’s attention, it says.

Increased duration

Previously, classes were held in the evenings, now they start from the morning as parents want children to stay in touch with academics even during a long break.

So, edutech companies ink in long-term plans that go beyond a narrow focus on summer vacation.

Companies that offer classroom-based learning say the crisis has forced them to look at new ways of disseminating information online. And those already entrenched in the online space are expanding further.

WhiteHat Jr continues to hire 40-50 people every week to meet its increased demand, and these are across functions. It conducts live 1:1 virtual classes in Python, AI and more for children from the age of six onwards.

“It’s not a temporary demand for us, we continue to hire people for permanent positions,” says Karan Bajaj, founder and CEO of WhiteHat Jr. The company has a 300-employee workforce.

“First time, we trained 30-40 people online and we are figuring out how to get them to be productive from the first week itself,” says Bajaj.",careers,https://www.thehindu.com/education/careers/1w2mow/article31221029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01OPOnline,https://www.thehindu.com/education/careers/covid-19-edutech-companies-buck-the-trend-go-on-a-hiring-spree-now/article31221030.ece
260,2020/03/31,COVID-19: Are we standing at an inflexion point in the history of work?,"As Corporate India continues to work remotely on a massive scale, this question is inevitable

The massive scale in which companies in India are remote-working now is a straw in the wind suggesting that the COVID-19 crisis will go down as a major inflexion point in the history of work.

It is likely to nudge the fence-sitters really hard, landing them on the side of the corporate garden where one will be treading on these pavers: One, greater digitialisation of work processes; two; greater reliance on distributed teams; and three, greater resolve to address long-pending questions around data protection.

Digitalisation mindset

“Before COVID-19, globally, even technologically much-advanced companies were willing to allow only 40 p.c. to 50 p.c. of their workforce to operate on the basis of a remote-working arrangement,” begins Rituparna Chakraborty, president, Indian Staffing Federation. “Globally, companies consider only one-third of those in the 25 to 65 age group eligible for a remote-working arrangement. Among those in the entry-level jobs, and aged below 25, only 7 p.c. are said to be allowed to remote-work. To remote-work, one has to rise to a particular role, and that usually comes with age. Now, the percentage is bound to change in all categories. Though I would not say there would be a dramatic adoption of remote-working, post COVID-19, I could still safely say there would be a significant increase in the percentage of the workforce that would remote-work from now on, and that includes companies in India. At the least, there will be a greater openness to work in a format where the workforce is distributed. Another thing that is for sure: Undue dependence on physical structures of work will be questioned. The lockdown is unprecedented, and it has underlined the need to be prepared digitally. There would be a digitalisation mindset, with efforts being made to digitalise the work flow as much as possible. So, a scenario where on day one, fresh recruits are by default handed laptops that are fully configured for remote working is not a far-fetched idea.”

Dynamic workplaces

Aditya Mishra, director and CEO, CIEL HR, points out that if the lessons from COVID-19 are internalised, there will be a rise in the number of companies that have a hard-desking policy. At present, those that have one constitute a miniscule part of the corporate world.

“In a futuristic scenario arising organically from the COVID-19 experience, companies may be inclined to considerably reduce costs incurred on account of real estate. On any given day, only a portion of the employees will report at the office for work, and this will be done to effect savings on overheads. So, if an organisation has 1000 employees, say, only 500 desks may be provided for, and this would enable the company to work in a smaller work space. At any given point, half of the workforce will be remote-working. As this workplace is dynamic, “desks” would be designed to fit roles, and not individuals. So, there won’t be a specific desk for anyone to return to, day after day. There will be executive desks, and if you are an executive, you log in to an executive desk with a password, and the password will also ensure that the phone has your number for that day. Similarly, there will be manager desks, and a manager can log in to one of them.”

Business agenda

Rituparna says the COVID-19 crisis may signify a point from where one can only expect a broader leadership mandate for remote-working, as the possibility and benefits of remote-working, particularly in the area of transactional work, have stood to reason, even in the case of traditional companies, some of which may be having an in-built resistance to a flexibility-driven working culture, “So far, remote working was a human-resource agenda, and now the odds are high that it will become a business and finance agenda as well,” she explains.

“Already, many organisations have a policy that allows sections of its employees to work from home for a given number of days in a month or year. This number will go up,” says Aditya.

The empathy factor

Earlier, the resistance to remote-working would have come from a section of the workforce, usually at the managerial level, and now when uniformly, across the board, the workforce is being pitch-forked into a mass remote-working arrangement, there is bound to be marked difference in the way managers perceive remote-working.

“There is a tendency to look down upon those who opt for work-from-home often, and there are also companies that would consider restructuring the compensation package of those who work-from-home often. But now, with everyone from the top of the totem pole to the bottom having had a taste of remote-working, that too in an incredibly remarkable way, hopefully, remote-working is seen for what it is — a tool that can be extremely effective, if used wisely, as something that tackles productivity-sappers such as long commutes. It can also be a counter to a 9to5 work culture that has fallen into such a rut that clock-watchers manage to pass off undetected, despite lack of sufficient productivity. In a remote-working arrangement, the work completed at the end of the day alone matters. A well-planned remote-working system can usher in a metrics-driven work culture,” says Aditya.

Data security

One challenge to promoting a remote-working culture that is as obvious as daylight is data security. Kamal Karanth, co-founder, Xpheno, a specialist staffing organisation, says: “The corporate world is accustomed to scenarios where even contract-based work is carried out at the office due to the demand for data protection, Now, due to the current exigency, a lot of work is being carried out of the office, because there is no other way to do it. Though two or three weeks make a short sample size, still from here, one can expect more openness to having non-IP work done outside office systems, either by remote-working employees or freelancers; and two, greater efforts to improve data security by making a variety of checks, including multi-factor authentication more cutting-edge.”",careers,https://www.thehindu.com/education/careers/7xuiat/article31220861.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01dcWFH,https://www.thehindu.com/education/careers/is-the-covid-19-crisis-pushing-us-to-a-new-work-culture/article31220862.ece
261,2020/03/31,Hyderabad artists paint their perspective of the COVID-19 lockdown,"Hyderabad Art Society launches a new initiative for artists to paint their perspective of the ongoing COVID-19 lockdown

“It is a small but positive step to motivate artists,” says artist Ramana Reddy. As the president of Hyderabad Art Society, Ramana has launched a new initiative ‘Paint Your Thoughts — Theme: Corona’ for artists experiencing a new life during lockdown.

The idea shaped up a few days ago when he pondered on art’s contribution to society. “Art gives strength; I thought of an activity for artists where they can reveal their inner feelings and respond to the situation.”

He makes it clear that the artists will not present art from a scientific perspective or do art analysis. “We are not creating any awareness on the novel Cornovirus. We are confined indoors and experiencing different feelings. The art is to dwell and look inward at our emotions during this lockdown period. We could depict art from a philosophical context or talk about our responsibility,” he says and quips, “Being responsible, we stay at home but as creative people, we will let our thoughts fly. Artists will not only wash their hands but also wash their brains.”

Ever since he announced this initiative on artists’ WhatsApp group, the response was tremendous. “There was a rush of messages from artists wanting to know about the medium, colours and size they can use. Some artists even wanted feedback from me on images they created of an empty town and virus depicted as Dracula. They are free to decide on their themes but only make sure their canvas is 3 x 4 feet so that there is ample space for others to display.”

There is no time period mentioned to finish the works. Once lockdown ends and normalcy returns, the plan is to have an exhibition of all the works. “This collection will also document this period. Art plays an important role in the documentation of an era,” he says and recalls the origin of Bonalu. “When an epidemic got relived, Bonalu was a tribute to the goddess and became a significant part of Telangana culture.”

262,2020/03/31,Maya’s dance recital in Matunga before the lockdown,"Episodes from the Ramayana were chosen by Maya Shivakumar for her thematic dance performance as part of Rama Navami festival in Matunga

The Covid 19 threat had already crept in and the city of Mumbai was gearing for a lockdown to control the spread. Programmes scheduled were about to be shut down. On the eve of the ban of public gathering, Maya G Shivakumar and her disciples of ‘Nrithyamaya,’ presented an interesting and devotional repertoire of Bharatanatyam, as part of the Ram Navami festival, at the Sree Asthika Samaj, Matunga.

Propitiating Lord Ganesha, the evening began with ‘Mahaganapatim,’ the Dikshitar kriti. Ranjanimala of Thanjavur Shankara Iyer represented the various facets of Devi.

Varnam in Kharaharapriya, Talam Adi, a composition of Thenmadam Narasimhachari, in praise of Lord Rama was performed by Maya. Episodes from the Ramayana, reinstatement of Sugreeva as the rightful King of Kishkinda by Lord Rama post the battle with his brother Vali, and how Kara and Dushana, Surpanaka’s demon brothers who come in search of Rama to avenge the treatment meted out to her, are mesmerised by Rama’s appearance, were the highlights of the Varnam.

Deft footwork

Maya executed the brisk jatis composed by her with deft footwork. Her abhinaya was captivating with myriad emotions on display and complemented her neat nritta. She could command the undivided involvement of the viewers, despite the lengthy duration of the varnam, and the applause at the end indicated the approbation of the attentive audience. Popular ‘Bho Shambho,’ presented by the students was vibrant with intricate choreography.

Smita Bhat performed ‘Yaarendru Raghavanai.’ Arunachala Kavi’s composition. Maya said that this piece was taught by her Guru late T.K. Mahalingam Pillai when she was young. The item began with an enamoured Sita desiring the golden deer and Rama setting out to capture it with Lakshmana standing guard. The cry by Mareecha, Sita pleading Lakshmana to help her husband, Lakshmana trying to convince Sita that nothing can harm the valiant Rama are the other items portrayed in the sequence. Smita’s entry as the golden deer was endearing and she did a fairly good job portraying Lakshmana’s agony.

Annamacharya kriti in praise of Lord Hanuman, in ragam Dharmavati set to Adi talam, highlighted two incidents from Hanuman’s life — Hanuman as a toddler eating the sun mistaking it for a fruit and how he rescues Rama and Lakshmana by killing the demon Mahiravan who had kidnapped them to the nether region.The recital concluded with a tillana in Sumanesa Ranjini ragam with complex footwork and captivating formations.

Maya, with years of training, has evolved into a mature performer, creative choreographer, setting her own jatis, and a meticulous trainer carrying on the tradition of Bharatanatyam.

The comprehensive anchoring and narrative descriptions of the pieces by Maya helped audience to relate better to the episodes. The colourful costume of the artistes coupled with synchronised movements enhanced the visual appeal.

The pre-recorded music — with vocals by Chandana Bala Kalyan, constituted Satish Krishnamurthy on the mridangam and Mangala Vaidyanathan on the violin. Nattuvangam by Maya was impeccable and added musical value to the dance.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/niibru/article31215689.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20frMayaJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/mayas-dance-recital-in-matunga-before-the-lockdown/article31215692.ece

265,2020/03/31,Steep hike in positive cases in Jaipur worries health experts,"Walled City area sealed to stop any movement of people

The steep hike in the number of COVID-19 positive cases in the Ramganj area of the Walled City of Jaipur has left the administration and health experts worried amid the measures to prevent community spread of the virus. Twelve persons, including a man who returned from Oman recently, have been diagnosed with the infection in the locality.

The Rajasthan government on Tuesday ordered sealing of the Walled City, which was earlier placed under curfew, to completely stop the movement of people. Additional Chief Secretary, Home Rajeev Swarup asked all residents of the Walled City to return home and said no outsider would be allowed into the sealed area.

Of the 12 infected persons, 11 belong to a single family residing in a multi-storey building in Ramganj. The 45-year-old man, who first tested positive several days after he returned from Oman via Dubai on March 12, came in contact with a large number of people before he developed the symptoms of the disease and went for diagnosis.

‘Panic in the area’

Suraiya Parveen, a retired government school teacher residing in the Walled City’s Ziledarji Ka Chowk, said though there was panic in the area, strict actions being taken by the administration would instil confidence among the people. “We will be helping the healthcare authorities by staying at home... My son has imposed a ban on all family members from venturing out.”

With the total number of 21 COVID-19 positive cases — including those of an Italian tourist couple — detected in the city, Jaipur is just behind the worst-affected Bhilwara town which has so far reported 26 cases. Medical & Health Minister Raghu Sharma said active surveillance and house-to-house survey were under way to find out the people who may be carrying the virus.

Meanwhile, about 3,000 pilgrims stranded in the localities near Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti's dargah in Ajmer have appealed to the authorities to make arrangements for sending them to their native States.

The fire safety firm is directly or indirectly responsible for 29 COVID-19 infected persons in Gautam Buddh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Bulandshahr, and Bareilly. On Tuesday, another employee of the factory tested positive in Duhai village of Ghaziabad. Sanjeevani Hospital of Greater Noida was also sealed after a person was found infected with the virus in the hospital.

After transferring the District Magistrate, the State government named A.K. Chaturvedi, the State Immunisation Officer, as the nodal officer of Gautam Buddh Nagar and Ghaziabad. He has superseded the Chief Medical Officers of the two districts.

In Ghaziabad, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath inspected the preparations at Santosh Medical College before changing his programme. He was expected to visit Meerut and Agra as well, but as the news of COVID-19 in the centre of Tablighi Jamat in Delhi’s Nizamuddin spread, he flew back to Lucknow.

Isolation wards

Ramping up its efforts to deal with the virus, the Ghaziabad administration has acquired sections of five major hospitals, including four private ones, in the city for the creation of 405 isolations beds, an official release said. District Magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey has acquired these hospitals under the Disaster Management Act and the Essential Services (Maintenance) Act.

The hospitals are ESI Hospitals in Sahibabad (30 beds), New Sarvodaya Hospital (100) in Kavi Nagar, Flores Hospital (75) in Vijay Nagar, Narinder Mohan Hospital (100) in Mohan Nagar and Max Hospital (100) in Vaishali.

267,2020/03/31,COVID-19: When ‘GOA’ dodges lockdown norms in Guwahati,"Riders pasting notes on vehicles to get past police; action being taken if no valid reason found

‘GOA’ is dodging the police in locked down Guwahati.

The police have been cracking down on people across Assam who ventured out of their homes “unnecessarily” after the lockdown began.

₹5.64 lakh in fines

Till Monday afternoon, the police collected ₹5.64 lakh in fines from traffic violators and detained 1,626 vehicles besides 425 people.

This made many vehicle users, specially two-wheel vehicle riders, glue hand-written notes on the front and rear of their motorcycles and scooties. A few of them read: “On GOA duty”.

‘GOA’ expands to Government of Assam.

Other such notes read “On GOI duty”, “On medical duty”, “Request patient attendant service” and so on.

Some have managed to get past the police, some not.

“The documents of such people are being checked and action is taken if they do not have a valid reason to drive or ride. Some people have taken passes from the authorities while those in essential services and exempted from restrictions are not disturbed,” Guwahati Commissioner of Police Munna Prasad Gupta told The Hindu.

Those who know the lanes and bylanes of the city often give the police the slip. The lanes are where grocery shops – some selling vegetables too – attract mostly masked people for discussing conspiracy theories and their chances of surviving the “killer flu”.

Many adhere to social distancing but some forget in a bid to be the first to take the foodstuff home. “Please stand apart for your own good and mine,” Tarunnagar resident Krishna Das requested a middle-aged man.

But the Fancybazar and adjoining Machhkhowa areas remain a cause of concern for the local residents. These two areas are the commercial hub of the Northeast, and had witnessed a near-stampede when the administration relaxed the lockdown restrictions temporarily on March 28.

“Vegetable vendors, buyers and wholesalers and their vehicles crowd the street where my house is located. The police arrive only after the business is done. We live in such dread that we have double-locked our gate,” said Musaddar Hussain, who lives on Fayaz Ahmed Road in Machhkhowa.

Mr. Gupta denied the police were allowing vegetable trucks into the city and claimed they were ensuring the shops allowed to operate were following the social distancing norms.

The near-empty roads, however, have not been insurance against accidents. On Monday night, a web portal reporter, Dimpy Kashyap, died when the two-wheeler she was on hit an electric pole. Hours later, a car hit and injured a barking deer that came out of its habitat to explore the Noonmati area of the city.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/covid-19-when-goa-dodges-lockdown-norms-in-guwahati/article31221950.ece

Over 3,000 monkeys are being provided food by the management of the Tara Tarini hill shrine every day to save them from starvation.

This famous hill temple in Odisha’s Ganjam district has been closed to devotees since March 16. The annual Chaitra Jatra festival that attracts lakhs of pilgrims was also cancelled.

The monkeys live in the woods on the hill on which the Tara Tarini temple is built. They had grown dependent on devotees for sustenance. The nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19 has prevented the monkeys from getting their quota of fruits, nuts and ‘prasad’ (food offered to the deity) from devotees.

“To save the animals from starving and to stop them straying into nearby villages, we decided to feed them every day from March 17. As there are no visitors to take ‘annaprasad’ of the temple, it is being given away to the monkeys at the hill top,” said Executive Officer T.K. Reddy.

In fact, the quantity of ‘prasad’ being cooked has been increased to feed the monkeys. “When prasad falls short, we again cook upma for these monkeys, adding vegetables and tomatoes,” Mr. Reddy said. Now, the monkeys have started gathering around noon at the hilltop to get their meal for the day.

Villagers’ gesture

On the request of the Tara Tarini temple administration, some nearby villages have started providing rotis for the monkeys. Villagers are also sending vegetables from their fields for the animals. But now, the monkeys — which are getting used to cooked food, fruit and nuts — seem to be turning up their noses at raw vegetables.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/k0eobx/article31221798.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1th-monkey1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/monkeys-get-a-feast-at-hill-temple-in-odisha/article31221802.ece
269,2020/03/31,Coronavirus | Doctors suspect community transmission in Indore,"Lack of contact, travel history amid spike in cases spur suspicion about transmission

As most COVID-19 patients in Indore, where 17 persons tested positive on Tuesday, have no contact or travel history, health workers are grappling to identify the source, indicating the most populous and largest city of Madhya Pradesh may already be witnessing the community transmission stage.

Also read: Experts speak on tackling COVID-19

“We are not able to detect the source as such, because there is no person with international travel history who’s tested positive,” said Salil Sakalle, Professor, Community Medicine, Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College, Indore, the only facility testing for the illness in west Madhya Pradesh.

Dr. Sakalle pointed out there were some patients with national travel history. “During travel, they probably might have come in contact [with those infected],” he said.

Indore bears the burden of 44 patients, most residents of congested localities, of the 66 cases in the State. In addition, three persons from the city have succumbed to COVID-19. Besides, eight cases in Jabalpur, six in Ujjain, four in Bhopal, and two each in Shivpuri and Gwalior have been registered.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through sentinel samples.

“Coincidently almost all positive cases, including first ones, have come from congested areas, so probably they have done a lot of community transmission,” said Dr. Sakalle. Though pockets have been identified, that doesn’t spell a possible wiping out of the virus locally. “If we are able to contain it in certain pockets and cover all contacts, then maybe we can make it controlled. We have no way to control their [overall] number,” he added.

Also read: Coronavirus | No community transmission yet, says Health Ministry

Aggressive testing in relation to other cities like Bhopal and Jabalpur has yielded more numbers too. Until March 30, the college had tested 261 samples since March 21. “Most cases in the first lot for Indore were those admitted to government and private hospital ICUs whose samples we took to test for acute severe respiratory illnesses when the testing for COVID-19 was restricted to only those with travel history abroad. When the ICMR revised the guidelines, we ran their samples for COVID-19 too, and many tested positive,” explained Dr. Sakalle.

Subsequently, those who had come into contact with these persons tested positive too. “Those who’re dying, are either elderly or have some comorbidities of diabetes or hypertension,” he said.

The city’s cosmopolitan culture, Indore being a transit corridor, the recent political instability in the State and residents not taking the lockdown seriously have all aggravated the outbreak of the illness in Indore, opines Anand Rai, part of the Indore COVID-19 response team.

“There are at least 80-90 flights to Indore per day. It’s the economic hub of Madhya Pradesh unlike Bhopal, and boasts a mix of cultures,” Dr. Rai explained.

The district administration has pulled out all stops, rolling out an odd-even road rationing scheme from March 28 and drawing containment areas within a 3 km radius around the houses of patients. where traffic is prohibited and all residents quarantined. In a spiralling trend, four persons tested positive on Saturday, while seven did on Sunday .

“Still, those staying in clusters, due to low literacy levels refuse to abide by the lockdown as the illness is an invisible enemy,” said Dr. Rai. “There will be 300-400 positive cases in the coming days,” he predicted.

Moreover, Madhya Pradesh was currently combating the disease ‘half-heartedly’ in the absence of a Health or Home Minister in the fledgling BJP government, he asserted, adding that the recent transfers of district Collectors of Indore, Bhopal and Jabalpur had ruffled the administrative machinery.

In addition, the city buttressed a culture of cohesion and commingling which might re,sult in pushing up the numbers, said Ajay Sodani, Professor at an Indore-based college, who has been following the spurt closely. “People think like a community here. Sadly on the janta curfew day, scores of people came out on the streets together to clang thalis and beat drums.”

Furthermore, he said, government officials at times were sending out a wrong message. “They are encouraging people to cover faces with cloth masks. However, it has to be a triple-layer surgical or an N95 mask. These disappeared from the market long ago. The WHO has said that those made of cotton should not be worn in any condition.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/yquztr/article31221486.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-TESTINGKITS-AP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-doctors-suspect-community-transmission-in-indore/article31221452.ece

“We have decided to deliver pension right at the doorsteps of citizens who are 80-years and above or those who are infirm”, Chief Postmaster General (CPMG) of West Bengal circle Goutam Bhattacharya told the PTI.

He said delivery of pension at the doorsteps will start from April 4 onwards and the beneficiaries have already been intimated in this regard.

“This is an extraordinary situation for which we have taken this measure. For others, pension will be disbursed from April 3 as the previous two days fall under annual closing”, he said.

People coming to post offices for pension withdrawals or cash deposits will have to maintain social-distancing as per government guidelines and hand sanitisers will also be provided.

For those delivering the pension amount at home, adequate security will be given to avert any untoward incident, he said.

Mr. Bhattacharya said the main priority of the Postal Department is to see that there are no problems regarding cash withdrawals from savings accounts.

“Not all the post offices will remain open during the lockdown period due to lack of manpower as many of our staff come from neighbouring districts, but the major ones like head and sub-post offices will be kept open”, he added.

The ATMs of the post offices, which are inter-operable with banks, will remain open across the State.

The Postal Department has also given priority for transport of medical kits and other related parcels to other places.

“Since trains are not running, we are sending these parcels by road wherever possible. For long distances, the items are being transported by cargo flights of Air India, Spicejet and Blue Dart”, he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/16rwrc/article31219603.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-postal-department-india-post,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-post-offices-in-west-bengal-to-deliver-pension-at-home-for-elderly-people/article31219588.ece
273,2020/03/31,Coronavirus scare | Hospitals in Kolkata turn away other patients in need of care,"Women with UTI and high fever are seen as potential coronavirus cases

A 24-year-old cabin crew staff from Sikkim, working with a major airlines and based out of Kolkata, had a dark night at the government-run Bangur Hospital in south Kolkata. She was admitted to the hospital with a mild fever, which was certified as unrelated to coronavirus fever. However, she was kept overnight in a coronavirus isolation room “filled with people who were coughing”.

“I have had a history of UTI (Urinary Tract Infection) and so I went to see the doctor after experiencing stomach pain. I visited two hospitals, KPC in Jadavpur and one in Tollygunge (Bangur Hospital) and they asked me to go to the Infectious Diseases [ID] Hospital in Beliaghata,” the woman said.

‘No one listened’

She was told at the Beliaghata ID Hospital that she did not have symptoms of the coronavirus and she was not admitted. “But I was again asked to return to Bangur and made to stay in the hospital for the night, among many patients who were coughing. I repeatedly said that I would catch the virus in the hospital, as I do not have it. But no one listened,” she told The Hindu. Moreover, she was asked if she was from China.

Finally, her family members in Gangtok and her employers intervened. Ministers from Sikkim spoke to their counterparts in the West Bengal government and the authorities at the Bangur Hospital, after which she was discharged.

The cabin crew member’s is not uncommon. Women with UTI are having a particularly harrowing time as UTI patients usually run a high fever. The key problem, however, is that people with high fever or a cold and cough are denied entry in medical facilities that are not treating coronavirus patients. This is becoming a “huge problem”, said doctors.

If doctors are scared, who will fight the battle?

A leading gastroenterologist thumped his desk when asked about non-admission of patients in health facilities.

“This has now become a nightmare. When my patients are admitted with UTI-related fever or liver ailment-related fever, they are refused [treatment] by top private hospitals in the city,” he said, on condition of anonymity.

Some nursing homes have also been shut down in view of the crisis.

“If hospital managements, who have to be at the forefront of this battle, get scared, then who is going to fight and win it?” the doctor asked. He blamed hospital managements for refusing to treat patients with “plain fever” though doctors are “going to work”.

The management of one private hospital said that they did “not have too many options other than to take precautionary measures”.

Pradeep Ghosh, secretary of the Bengal Chemists and Druggists Association in North 24 Paraganas district said that doctors from Kolkata were not reaching the districts. “Local MBBS doctors are managing the situation for now as senior doctors and experts are not coming,” said Mr. Ghosh, who resides in Barrackpore, about 50 km from Kolkata.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/business/d7nima/article29752229.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th19BUHEALTHCARE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-scare-hospitals-in-kolkata-turn-away-other-patients-in-need-of-care/article31219329.ece
274,2020/03/31,"Srinagar COVID-19 victim attended Nizamuddin event, travelled widely","Tracing the travel history of Jammu and Kashmir’s first coronavirus victim.

A Srinagar-based businessman who attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Nizamuddin travelled by air, train and road to Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and back to Jammu and Kashmir before he died of COVID-19, raising fears he may have infected many others along the way, officials said on Tuesday.

The businessman died on March 26 in a Srinagar hospital, 19 days after he set off for the national capital. He could have infected scores of people during his travels and about 300 people have been put under quarantine because of him, officials said.

Recapping his movements, officials said he left by air from Srinagar to Delhi on March 7 to attend the congregation of the Tablighi Jamaat, an orthodox Muslim organisation at the centre of the coronavirus spread with 24 of the 2,000-odd participants testing positive.

Six people in Telangana who attended the meeting in the city’s Nizamuddin West area died on Monday.

Officials said the Kashmiri businessman left Delhi on March 9 and took a sleeper coach of a train for Deoband, where he attended a meeting at the Darul Uloom seminary. Two days later, on March 11, he took another train to Jammu. Many of the passengers who travelled with him in the trains have been put under quarantine after authorities dug out their details.

In Jammu, he met up with his doctor friend and both addressed a religious congregation in a mosque in Samba on the outskirts of the city. The two were together till March 16 and stayed at a lodge — now sealed — in Bari Bramhmana outside Jammu city.

The doctor, now in a Jammu hospital in a critical condition, belongs to Rajouri district of Jammu region. At least 45 people from his area have been quarantined.

On March 16, the businessman took a flight to Srinagar from where he drove to Sopore in north Kashmir, about 54 km away. Two days later, he returned to his home in Srinagar, again by road.

“He complained of chest pain and normal flu on March 21 and was taken to a nearby hospital and later to the super specialty SKIMS hospital in Soura on the outskirts of Srinagar,” an official said.

Doctors were initially of the opinion that he had a pollen allergy, common in Kashmir during spring. The next day, however, his condition deteriorated and he was shifted to the Chest and Disease Hospital in the city where he died on March 26. He was the first COVID-19 fatality in Jammu and Kashmir.

As news spread about the death, officials began tracking his movements closely. He is believed to have spread the virus to at least four people from Bandipora district who had attended his Sopore congregation and maybe more as well.

The passenger lists of the flights on which he travelled were also pulled out and every individual was picked up and put under necessary quarantine, they said, adding the two doctors who had examined him were also taken for quarantine.

Authorities across the country have swung into action to trace the contacts of those who attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation, attended by hundreds of people, including from Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia.

Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain said 1,033 people in Nizamuddin West have been shifted to various places. “An estimated 700 people who attended this congregation have been quarantined while around 335 people have been admitted to hospitals,” he told reporters.

Besides, all those who participated in the event are being screened.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/srinagar-covid-19-victim-attended-nizamuddin-event-travelled-widely/article31218044.ece
275,2020/03/31,Muslims should not be blamed for spread of coronavirus: Omar Abdullah,"“People tweeting stuff with hashtags like Tablighi virus are more dangerous than any virus.”

National Conference leader Omar Abdullah on Tuesday said Muslims should not be blamed for the spread of coronavirus in the country.

He was reacting to netizens’ response to reports that several people who tested positive for COVID-19 had attended a congregation of Tabligh-e-Jamaat, a Muslim religious organisation, at Nizamuddin in Delhi earlier this month.

“Now the #TablighiJamat will become a convenient excuse for some to vilify Muslims everywhere as if we created & spread #COVID around the world,” Mr. Abdullah said in a series of tweets.

“At first glance it would appear the #TablighiJamat were nothing if not irresponsible in the way they went about things but that’s not unique to them. The majority of Muslims in India have heeded government guidelines and advice the same as anyone else,” he added.

Mr. Abdullah said those people who were associating the COVID-19 with the Tabligh-e-Jamaat were more dangerous than any virus.

“People tweeting stuff with hashtags like Tablighi virus are more dangerous than any virus nature could ever conjure up because their minds are sick while their bodies may very well be healthy,” he said.

Over 2,000 delegates, including from Indonesia and Malaysia, attended the congregation from March 1-15, officials said.

Five members of a mosque in Bijnor, including the maulvi, have been booked for allegedly hiding information about the presence of Indonesian nationals who had returned after attending the Tablighi Jamaat meeting in Delhi on March 21. The eight foreigners have been put under home quarantine for COVID-19, said a police officer.

Additional Superintendent of Police, Bijnor, Sanjay Kumar said the police located eight Indonesian nationals staying at the Jamunwali mosque in Nagina. The eight were among the foreign nationals who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat meeting in Nizamuddin in Delhi, said the officer.

The eight had come to Delhi via Bangladesh, following which they went to Odisha and came to Bijnor on March 21, Mr. Kumar said.

Charges were pressed against the mufti, maulvi and three other members of the mosque as Section 144 was imposed during the prevalence of the COVID-19 and they had also been informed about it, said the officer.

The five have been booked under Section 3 of the Epidemic Act and Sections 268 (public nuisance), 269 (whoever unlawfully or negligently does any act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code.

277,2020/03/31,Coronavirus | Odisha churches resort to live-streaming of worship,"‘We have been doing this after the government issued an alert about the unfolding situation,’ says Paresh Das, Secretary, Church of Christ (Union Church).

At a time when religious congregations are seen as places that facilitate faster spread of Coronavirus, churches in Odisha are using technology to make the faithful participate in Sunday worship from remote locations — a first in local church history.

After the Odisha government asked the authorities of religious institutions to practice social distancing, Internet-based social media came to the rescue of the church leadership.

Bhubaneswar-based Church of Christ (Union Church) and Koraput-based Jeypore Evangelical Lutheran Church (JELC) have been reaching out to people by either beaming the Sunday worship live through social media or making available deferred live-recording of the prayers.

“We have been pre-recording the Sunday prayer, songs, reading of the Bible passage by pastors and the sermon. The same is then sent out through different social media channels at the appointed time of worship. We have been doing this after the government issued an alert about the unfolding situation,” said Paresh Das, Secretary, Church of Christ (Union Church).

“After the government alert was issued, the church premises have been kept closed. Besides the Sunday worship, we have prayer, Bible study, women's and youth programmes through the week, which are also being made available in the homes using the same technology”, he said.

“The beauty of it is that all these worships are now being watched by people around the world who are blessed,” Mr. Das said.

“This coastal region has faced three major cyclones in the past two decades. But it could never interrupt Sunday prayers in the church. This is, perhaps, the first time since the inception of the capital city we are not congregating for worship in the church. However, we extend full cooperation to the authorities as we realise the need of the hour,” he said.

The 140-year-old JELC authorities said old-timers apprehended the suspension of Sunday worship. However, everyone was happy to participate in prayer even though they were not able to be physically present in the church.

On a Sunday, the pastor would go to the church and lead the worship before empty benches. But the prayer would be beamed live through social media. As most of people have got smartphones they could watch and participate in the worship live. Technology had been helping the people to tide over this unprecedented crisis, said church sources.

“The worship is linked to people’s faith. Although people are emotional about worship, they are also aware about the life-threatening potential of this Coronavirus. It is important to protect one’s life as well as those of others’,” said Asish Pal, Bishop of JELC Church.

Bishop Pal said, “we had never faced such a situation in our history that we had to suspend prayer in churches. Nearly about 500 congregations in undivided Koraput district alone have been debarred from coming to worship. Churches are following the lockdown measures prescribed by both the State and the Central governments.”

Holy Week celebration unlikely in churches

Churches said there was now little possibility of holding the Holy Week celebration of Good Friday and Easter Sunday in the churches in April second week. In the Easter Sunday prayer, about 5000 people gather at the cemetery at Jeypore.

Meanwhile, civil society organisations have decided to take the help of the public address system available in 75 temples in western Odisha to make people aware about COVID-19. “We are already in discussion with village heads to allow use of loudspeakers for making people aware about the extraordinary situation,” said social activist Saroj Barik.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cl5gmp/article31216856.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ODISHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-odisha-churches-resort-to-live-streaming-of-worship/article31216826.ece

As many as 17 positive cases of COVID-19 were on March 31 reported in Indore, the most populous city in Madhya Pradesh.

Coronavirus has infected 44 persons in Indore alone, of the 65 cases in the State. In addition, three persons from the city have succumbed to it.

“The results for 17 persons confirming the infection were received from the AIIMS, Bhopal, today,” Akash Tripathi, Indore Commissioner, told The Hindu.

“Coronavirus will be defeated, Indore will win,” said Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, in a video message. “Indore is the city of dreams. And because of awareness of its residents, it has ranked the cleanest city in the country thrice. But now it is fighting the COVID-19 outbreak. We have to defeat it at any cost.”

Appealing to residents, Mr. Chouhan asked them, for the sake of their family and friends at least, to stay indoors for a few days. “Break the chain of social contact. The administration is trying to provide essential commodities to residents at home. Yes there are positive cases, but this doesn’t mean it can’t be treated.”

Four persons tested positive in Indore on Saturday and seven on Sunday.

280,2020/03/31,Private hospitals in Jaipur reserved for COVID-19 treatment; MoUs signed in Assam,"Hospital buildings will be used as isolation and quarantine centres when needed in urgency

Scaling up its efforts to tackle the COVID-19 outbreak, the Rajasthan government has reserved 84 private hospitals, with a total bed capacity of 9,377, in Jaipur district to meet a crisis situation. The hospital buildings will be used as isolation and quarantine centres as and when urgently required.

Also read: Data | Which States recorded the most coronavirus cases, deaths, and the best testing rates?

The orders in Rajasthan came after an important decision was taken last week in Assam, where the State government signed memorandums of understanding with 85 private hospitals for “transferring the load of other patients” to these healthcare facilities so as to enable three of the State’s six medical colleges to focus on the COVID-19 cases. No positive cases have been detected so far in Assam.

Jaipur Collector Joga Ram said the private hospitals would have to, when demanded, hand over their buildings within two hours to the Chief Medical & Health Officer or Sub-Divisional Officer. The order was issued under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and the Rajasthan Epidemic Diseases Act, 1957.

The hospitals include multi-speciality medical institutions in Jaipur city as well as smaller medical facilities and nursing homes in the nearby towns, such as Dudu, Bagru, Chaksu and Sanganer. Jaipur has witnessed a steep increase in the number of COVID-19 patients during the last two days, as 12 positive cases were detected in the Ramganj area, which has been placed under curfew.

The isolation centres are at present functioning in the Sawai Man Singh Government Hospital and the Rajasthan University of Health Sciences’ hospital in Jaipur. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said at a review meeting here that several private institutions and undertakings had also offered their buildings as infrastructure for treatment of patients infected with coronavirus.

In Assam, the initiative for signing the MoUs began on March 27 with the inking of agreements with as many as 34 private hospitals and nursing homes in Guwahati. “The agreement is for two months now, beginning March 28. All cases, except for cancer, maternity and emergency that come to the medical colleges are being transferred to the private hospitals according to their specialities,” Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.

The State government, he added, had also floated tenders for setting up five prefabricated hospitals with 300 beds each with the intensive care unit and ventilation facilities to deal with the COVID-19 cases.

A village youth, Bablu Kumar Mahto, 20, told the local medical authorities that they could be infected. A medical team of doctors and local authorities reached the village on March 24 to examine the two villagers.

The samples of the two were taken for test and they and their family members were peeved at Bablu Kumar.

“They caught Bablu Kumar while he was alone on March 29 and beat him up badly. He was severely injured and was taken to Runni Saidpur primary health centre from where the doctors referred him to another hospital Shrikrishna Medical College and Hospital in neighbouring Muzaffarpur district. But, he succumbed to his injuries on way to the hospital,” said Guddu Mahto, brother of the youth.

Chief Minister Amarinder Singh ordered sealing of the State’s borders, while announcing the extension of the curfew till April 14.

Captain Amarinder asked the Finance Minister to come out with a contingency financial plan to overcome the crisis and ensure an uninterrupted medical and essentials supply pipeline. The current battle would be a long-drawn one and would need more support from the Centre, he said.

The Chief Minister also allowed the Local Bodies department to extend, by three months, the services of the 2,000-odd sanitation workers due to retire on March 31 to deal with the prevailing situation.

“All restrictions should be strictly enforced till April 14, after which the State will decide in line with the government of India’s further decision,” said Captain Amarinder, adding that the lockdown was the only way to prevent the spread of the disease.

283,2020/03/31,Himachal scholarship scam | CBI chargesheets 12 accused,"The CBI registered the case in May 2019 on a request from the State government to probe alleged corruption in the disbursal of scholarships under State and Centrally-sponsored schemes for reserved category students.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday filed a chargesheet against 12 persons, including the then officials of the Directorate of Higher Education in Himachal Pradesh’s Shimla, for alleged misappropriation of funds allotted for pre/post-Matriculation scholarships.

Among those arraigned are the then superintendent (Grade-II), assistant director-cum-district development officer, and four other superintendents (Grade-I), besides the former head cashier of the Central Bank of India; and two then campus directors, vice-chairman, chairman and officiating principal of the K.C. Group of Institutions in Una, the agency said.

The CBI registered the case in May 2019 on a request from the State government to probe alleged corruption in the disbursal of scholarships under State and Centrally-sponsored schemes for reserved category students.

Initially, an inquiry was conducted through a State Project Officer on complaints over non-receipt of scholarships.

Preliminary findings suggested complicity between officials of the Education Department, Central government, bank officials and institutions. The income/caste certificates of the students were not verified before disbursing loans. More than 80% of the total money disbursed was allegedly granted through private institutions.

284,2020/03/31,Odisha seeks Centre’s nod for paying allowance under MGNREGA,"We must minimise suffering of the people, particularly those at the bottom of the pyramid, says Naveen Patnaik

The Odisha government has sought the Central government’s approval to pay unemployment allowance to workers engaged under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) for the job losses caused by the COVID-19 lockdown.

The Naveen Patnaik government has estimated an expenditure of ₹380.39 crore for unemployment allowances in the State. In Odisha, 36,10,797 active workers are enumerated under the rural employment scheme in the current year. They are now deprived of work under the MGNREGA due to the 21-day lockdown.

‘Protect livelihood’

“To protect their livelihood, an amount of ₹380.39 crore, which is one fourth of the wage rate as per the MGNREG Act, will be spent,” Mr. Patnaik said, seeking the sanction of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a letter.

“While we are taking all preemptive steps as a nation to minimise the damage due to COVID-19, a global pandemic. We must also see that the suffering of the people, particularly those at the bottom of the pyramid, is minimised,” he said.

Stating that people have responded to the PM’s lockdown call, Mr. Patnaik said, “While we continue our fight with the impending challenge, poor people, particularly MGNREGA workers, have been badly affected due to the 21-day lockdown.”

Wages proposed

The Odisha government has proposed a wage of ₹188 per day from March 25 to March 31, and a revised wage of ₹207 per day to be paid for the following two weeks, from April 1 to April 14.

The State has sought to release unemployment allowances to the bank accounts of active MGNREGA workers in Odisha.

“This is a welcome step. MGNREGA workers will be benefited during the time of crisis if the Centre approves the request. We want the State government to pay ₹5,000 and ration for one month to all people, irrespective of whether they have their names on the list. Moreover, migrant workers should be given shelter, food and allowances,” said Suresh Panigrahi, a Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) leader.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/odisha-seeks-centres-nod-for-paying-allowance-under-mgnrega/article31212247.ece
285,2020/03/31,"Coronavirus | Curbs on migrants workers will worsen crisis, say activists","Sealing of borders and total lock-down will escalate panic, warn grass roots groups.

A day after the Union Minister of Home Affairs ordered that the movement of migrant workers be restricted, groups representing informal workers on Monday said the decision would lead to chaos for the workers already suffering due to the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown.

As the country observes a three-week lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 to contain the spread of the virus, daily wage workers have been left with no work and income forcing large groups to make their way back home, many on foot due to the ban on all public transport.

In a statement, the Working People’ Charter and Aajeevika Bureau termed the MHA’s order on Sunday “unrealistic” as it “ignores many harsh realities that workers have been persistently facing in cities, which have now been compounded several times over due to the lock-down”.

The statement said the government needed to acknowledge the situation that had compelled workers to return to their villages and that these conditions were “likely to worsen” with new advisories.

Police action

“Total sealing of borders and total lock-down will escalate panic and aggravate chaos and crowding of migrants attempting to reach their homes...There is a real danger that the order will grant unabated power into the hands of the police to physically detain or assault migrants who are merely trying to fend for themselves in this moment of crisis,” the statement read.

The groups highlighted the need for compassion in dealing with the situation, adding that the police should be directed to show restraint in their interactions with the workers. While the government has told employers to pay the workers and landlords not to collect rent for the lock-down period, the groups said the instruction needed fast-track legal aid and grievance response systems.

Union raise concerns

Trade unions also raised concerns about the condition of the workers. The Centre of India ln Trade Unions (CITU) wrote to the Prime Minister on Monday asking the government to ensure “through statutorily enforceable measures and proactive enforcement and not by just advisories, that all workers including migrant workers are not removed from their employment and are paid their wages and that they are not vacated or forced to pay rent by the house owners.”

CITU also said the Centre should coordinate with state governments to make sure no one goes hungry and that migrant workers have adequate food and shelter.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-curbs-on-migrants-workers-will-worsen-crisis-say-activists/article31212098.ece
286,2020/03/31,Coronavirus | An unending journey to their homes,"With no means of transport to get back to their villages, migrant labourers have been walking hundreds of kilometres

At 11 on Monday morning, fifteen-year-old Balmiki Kumar is sitting on a wooden bench under a tree inside the campus of the Patna High School in Gardanibagh locality. His tattered black backpack is bloated with stuff. He is unwilling to go inside the vacant rooms of the school to rest. “I want to go to my home in Sitamarhi district as soon as possible and be with my family”, he says. He wants to say more, but is exhausted after his long tiring journey of over 1,000 km from Delhi’s Noida.

For the last five months, Balmiki Kumar had been in Noida (sector-12), a suburb of Delhi, where his elder brother Rakesh Kumar works as a tailor. Both the brothers were living in a room they rented for ₹2,000 a month and were earning around ₹15000 on an average.

When Balmiki Kumar, a school dropout, saw people leaving for their home States in hordes in the third week of March, he didn’t understand what was happening. “I didn’t realise the gravity of the situation even when my elder brother told me an unknown virus is killing people and everything is going to be shut soon. I chose to stay back while my brother left with the others”, he says. But when his landlord told him to vacate and it became increasingly difficult to get food, he too decided to leave. “I stuffed some clothes and packed flattened rice mixed with spices in my bag and set off on my journey on March 25 with only with ₹1,000 in my pocket”, he says. “I survived on water and the flattened rice for five days.”

But how did he find his way on the road? “Using GPS on my mobile”, he says pulling out a large screen phone from his pocket. “What option did I have?…I walked all day and through the night, only resting briefly by the roadside,” Balmiki says holding up his worn-out rubber slippers.

When he crossed the U.P. border at Kaimur and reached Danapur near Patna early on March 30, the district officials took him to the Patna High School campus at Gardanibagh — one of the four places where arrangements have been made for food and stay for migrants in the city.

Robbed on train

K Raju, 50, was not so lucky. Resting in a corner classroom on the first floor of the school, he says all his belongings, including mobile phone and Aadhar card, were stolen on the train. “Now I’m an identity-less Indian,” he says. He is from Vijaywada in Andhra Pradesh working in a hotel in Secunderabad in Telangana. “When the lockdown was declared, everyone was leaving for their homes…I too boarded a train but it took me to Danapur station, near Patna on March 28. From there, some officials dropped me here at the school and now I’ve no money, no phone, nothing at all to go anywhere or connect with anyone”, he says. Mr Raju, unmarried, has only an elder brother who too is stuck in Mumbai. Clad in a lungi and a half-sleeves shirt, his only belongings are a polythene bag and a towel.

Most of the school’s 30 rooms the district administration has taken under its control are empty. Some local social activists are helping with the food. “Now, hardly five-six people are staying here…most of them have left for their villages,” says social activist Raj Shekhar Gupta. A policeman is at hand and there is an official maintain maintaining a logbook. A large room is cluttered with cooking gas cylinders, beds and cots. Under a tent in one corner, food is being served. “Most people in the queue are poor people from nearby areas…how can we deny food to anyone in such difficult times?”, asks Mr Gupta. Bihar, so far, has had one COVID-19 death and 15 positive cases.

Almost home

Jitendra Mandal and his five friends reached Patna from Ghaziabad, near Delhi, riding on two motorcycles. They are from Goradih village in Bhagalpur, some 280 km east of Patna. “We started at 4:30 pm on March 28 and reached here today (March 30) at 11 am”, says Jitendra Mandal. “More than 50 people from our village are still stranded there… we fix marble in homes and offices there”, he says. “All our savings of the last six months have been spent on petrol”, they rue.

“It will take another seven hours,” they say as they mount their motorcycles to resume their journey. “We want to reach home before dusk.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/tl2tb3/article31211954.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THLTCOVIDLOCKDOWN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-an-unending-journey-to-their-homes/article31211955.ece
287,2020/03/31,Coronavirus | Odisha says cost of treatment will be borne by the State,"Separate wards being set up in major government and private hospitals in different regions.

Odisha on Monday announced that all the expenses relating to the treatment of any person testing positive for coronavirus in the State would be borne by the government.

The two COVID-19 hospitals being set up in association with two private medical colleges in Bhubaneswar will exclusively take care of COVID-19 cases, and all the expenses for the treatment of such patients would be borne by the government, the State government’s Chief Spokesperson for COVID-19, Subroto Bagchi, said.

While work is being undertaken on a war-footing to set up the two COVID-19 hospitals in the capital city, the government has also moved to create separate wards for COVID-19 patients in major government and private hospitals in different regions of the State.

Samples tested

Mr. Bagchi informed that a total of 370 samples had been tested in the State till noon of Monday, and the number of positive cases was still three. While all three patients were undergoing treatment in Bhubaneswar, a total of 76 persons were under isolation in different hospitals, he said.

A total of 55 contacts of the first two cases are being tracked, and 112 contacts of the third patient had been identified, with communication established with them, Mr. Bagchi said. Stating that about 90% of the State’s people were staying home and obeying the government’s instructions during the lockdown, Mr. Bagchi expressed concern over the threat posed by the 10% people ""moving around without any genuine reason"".

Speaking about the foreign returnees who have been advised home quarantine, State Director General of Police (DGP) Abhay said that a total of 61 cases were registered across the State for violation of quarantine protocol.

Arrested for violation

Advising people not to panic but stay home as per the government’s instructions, the DGP said that 1,400 persons had been arrested for violating the lockdown rules. He sought people’s cooperation in maintaining social distancing to fight the spread of the coronavirus.

288,2020/03/31,Coronavirus | Health activists in Rajasthan demand door-to-door care,"A range of mother and child healthcare services have been adversely impacted.

With the suspension of outreach activities for immunisation, a range of mother and child healthcare services have been adversely impacted in Rajasthan during the lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus. The restrictions have also led to a halt in the registration of new pregnancies, and impeded the distribution of iron and folic acid tablets to pregnant women.

Health activists here on Monday demanded that the State government launch door-to-door immunisation and antenatal care (ANC) activities to address the issues of malnutrition and infection among women and children. They said that the discontinuation of village health and nutrition days' observance would especially hamper the healthcare services.

The Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, which functions as the State chapter of the People's Health Movement, has submitted a memorandum to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot seeking his intervention in the matter. “It is very crucial to maintain the continuity of services, or else it will make an adverse impact on maternal and child health scenario in Rajasthan,” the memorandum said.

Strategy needed

Chhaya Pachauli, director of voluntary group Prayas, said no official orders had been issued for continuing the routine services after the suspension of village health and nutrition days. “Mere assurance of the Chief Minister will not help. What is the strategy? How will the government ensure that women receive ANC and the required care?” she asked.

Ms. Pachauli said that since the mobilisation activities could not be carried out in the villages because of risks related to COVID-19 transmission, the door-to-door immunisation, ANC and nutritious meal distribution should be undertaken on an urgent basis. Institutional deliveries had fallen across the State, and a case of the death of a woman and her newborn twins was reported from Kota after the lockdown was enforced, she said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-health-activists-in-rajasthan-demand-door-to-door-care/article31211444.ece
289,2020/03/31,"Amidst lockdown and death, tea garden workers in Bengal demand wages","Right to Food campaigners warn of worsening distress is one of the State's most backward regions.

The lockdown for preventing the spread of the coronavirus could not have had come at a worse time for the tea gardens of north Bengal, for it coincided with the flush production of the Darjeeling tea industry. The first flush, which is harvested in March, and the second flush of May, are the biggest source of revenue for the tea gardens of the region, and till a few days ago, despite the lockdown, plucking of tea leaves continued in some gardens.

The Tea Board of India on March 26 issued a circular clearing any confusion on the matter. The notification stated: “All tea gardens in the country are under lockdown and are not operational. Thereby, all stakeholders are advised not to take cognisance of the messages that are going around to the contrary in social media.”

On Monday, when the first COVID-19 death was reported in north Bengal, several tea gardens’ unions demanded that an immediate lockdown was necessary in the tea gardens, but the State government should also ensure that workers were paid their wages. A 44-year old woman, a resident of Kalimpong, died at the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital in the early hours of Monday. She was the second coronavirus casualty in the State.

Workers’ survival

“An immediate lockdown of [tea] gardens is necessary, but with the survival of the workers in mind. We insist that employers should be made to pay full wages for the period of lockdown. As wages in tea gardens are generally paid on a weekly or fortnightly basis, the same procedure should be followed,” read a letter sent to the Chief Secretary of the State.

The letter, sent on behalf of 19 organisations, including several tea garden unions that work for the Right to Food campaign in the State, highlights that West Bengal employs 2.5 to 3 lakh tea garden workers, thus supporting about 10-12 lakh people, and is the backbone of the economy of at least three districts in north Bengal — Darjeeling, Jalpiaguri and Alipurduar.

Right to Food campaigners in the State also made a similar demand in a press release, noting, “Employers should be made to pay full wages for the period of lockdown. In case of default, State Government should pay the wages [and] should recover the amount from employers.” The campaigners said that such an effort would cost the State government ₹176 crore.

‘Below survival’

“Our experience regarding wages in tea gardens has not been good. Unless the State government intervenes, there can be no certainty about our wages, which in the industry have always been much below survival level ,” Binay Karketta, a prominent tea garden union leader based in Alipurduar, said. Mr. Karketta said that wages for a tea garden worker stands at only Rs.176 per day and dependence on the public distribution system could lead to hunger in isolated and farflung tea gardens.

Saman Pathak, general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), Darjeeling district, admitted that there was some confusion regarding whether the gardens would remain open or closed.

“The industry will suffer but after the [COVID-19] death reported in the day, workers do not want to keep the gardens open. This will lead to further distress in the gardens. Unless the State is going to ensure wages, the situation will get from bad to worse,” Mr. Pathak said.

The CITU leader said that tea gardens have a history of chronic hunger and remain one of the most backward regions of the State, and a total closure may dispel doom.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/uzn1ye/article31211400.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30MARCHTEAWORKERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/amidst-lockdown-and-death-tea-garden-workers-in-west-bengal-demand-wages/article31211401.ece

He also said that of the calls received through the helpline number, about 200 calls pertained to groups of 100 or more people stranded in other States. “All help is being extended to them through the respective State governments,” Mr. Bagchi said.

“It is matter of concern that people are stranded away from their home. Till the situation is normalised, they will have to wait there. All assistance is being extended to them through highly placed Odia officers and Odia organisations,” said Mr. Bagchi.

291,2020/03/31,"20 co-passengers of patient traced, quarantined in Goa","Remaining 20-odd have returned to Mumbai, says Sawant

The Goa government on Monday said it has quarantined 20 air passengers identified through contact tracing of a COVID-19 patient from the State, who flew on a Vistara flight from Mumbai to Goa on March 22.

Chief Minister Dr. Pramod Sawant said around 40 people arrived in Goa by Vistara flight UK-861 from Mumbai that day. “As per our information, only 20 of the 40-odd passengers of the flight are in Goa. The rest have returned to Mumbai,” he said.

The COVID-19 patient had travelled from the Bahamas to Goa via New York and Mumbai.

On Monday, the integrated disease surveillance programme of the Department of Health Services, Goa, issued a public appeal to passengers of the flight to contact the helpline or the nearest health centre.

Officials said while the flight manifest is available, the process of verifying the passengers’ location and other details is time consuming and challenging, since some register landline numbers or that of their ticket booking agent or site.

The Chief Minister told reporters that ₹52 crore from the district mineral fund, available to States that have a mining industry, will be used for the dedicated COVID-19 hospital and other measures to tackle the outbreak. The government has designated ESI Hospital in South Goa district headquarters Margao as a COVID-19 hospital.

Dr. Sawant admitted that Goa is facing shortage of medicines and said he had directed the Food and Drug Administration director to hold talks with all stakeholders.

The Chief Minister said there is no shortage of vegetables and fruits in the State, with the Goa Horticulture Corporation, through its 1,200 counters, distributing 268 tonnes of vegetables procured from Belagavi in Karnataka on Monday.

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), however, said ruling BJP MLAs and ministers were using the supplies as a self-promotion exercise. “Giving control to MLAs in Goa over distribution of groceries is not mitigating, but leading to a bigger disaster. Stores have run dry while ruling party MLAs are controlling its distribution,” AAP leader Elvis Gomes said.

Mr. Gomes tweeted a poster showing how Panaji BJP MLA Babush Monserrate was offering home delivery of supplies like rice, dal, sugar, oil, vegetables and other essentials for a ₹800 package. Leaflets announcing this had the MLA’s photographs on them. Such packages are, however, not available to the needy from other constituencies, and residents of areas like St. Cruz and old Goa, outside Panaji city limits, he said.

Dr. Sawant said MLAs have been given the task so as to keep the number of volunteers involved under check. “I also visited a shelter camp set up by the government for the needy and stranded labourers from outside Goa. We will ensure that people in distress are taken care of in this hour of crisis,” he said.

Guardian Minister Satej Patil said the administration is closely monitoring at least 75,000 people from the district, who recently returned after travelling to Pune and Mumbai — hotspots of the virus.

“It is observed that several people are not rigidly following lockdown orders, nor maintaining social distancing. In the past few days, the police authorities have seized more than 770 vehicles and collected fines totalling to more than ₹6.5 lakh from errant residents flouting the lockdown,” Mr. Patil said.

He warned that if people did not fall in line, even shops selling essential items would have to be shut down.

The district technically recorded its first case on March 26, after a girl from Kolhapur’s Peth Vadgaon had come into contact with a family from Islampur in Sangli district whose 24 members have tested positive for COVID-19.

However, this case is clubbed with the cases in Sangli, as the girl is placed in an isolation facility in Miraj.

Almost immediately after this case, a 37-year-old man from Mangalwar Peth in Kolhapur, who had returned from Pune, tested positive.

On Sunday night, the test samples of a woman related to this man returned positive as well, taking the total district tally to three. However, four other close relatives have tested negative. “As a precautionary measure, all four relatives have been placed in institutional quarantine facilities,” said a district official.

In all, samples of 31 suspected COVID-19 patients that were sent for testing have returned negative, authorities said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/senior-citizen-dies-of-pneumonia-in-kolhapur-tests-negative/article31212796.ece
293,2020/03/31,MSMEs concerned over bank branches not receiving communication on interest repayments,"Several public sector banks announced on Tuesday that they had permitted a three-month exemption for repayment of interest on loans. However, the micro, small and medium-scale enterprises (MSMEs) expressed concern as several bank branches here said they had not received the required communication.

On Tuesday, the last day of the financial year, the representatives of MSMEs starting going to the banks and asking details about exemptions regarding repayment of interest.

They expressed concern as the bank branches, except a couple of banks, here told the customers that they had not received any communication yet on the exemptions that were announced by Reserve Bank of India Governor recently.

Coimbatore District Small Industries Association president R. Ramamurthy said he had asked the members to submit letters individually to the respective bank branches seeking exemption from repayment of interest.

“There was anxiety among the members as they feared auto-debit from their accounts,” he said.

Nil interest

The banks should ensure that even if the amount had been deducted, it is reversed to the accounts of the units. The banks should charge nil interest on all loans and cash credits to the MSMEs during the lockdown period, he added.

All banks and financial institutions should extend ad-hoc additional credit of 25 % for working capital. The MSMEs work on week basis and plan their finances accordingly.

The units will have no collection this week and hence will not have money next week. They will have to pay wages, meet the other mandatory needs when the units re-open. So they need the ad hoc amount, he said. The accrued interest should be recovered from June 30, he said.

Stimulus package

He urged the government to come out with a stimulus package to the MSMEs for loss of business during the lockdown period.

M. Raveendran, president of Coimbatore Compressor Industries Association, said there were several MSMEs in Coimbatore that supplied components to the railways. They had not received payments since November last year. Since the industries are under lockdown now, they are not able to receive the dues. The railways should take special steps to release the dues to its suppliers, at least partly, he said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/msmes-concerned-over-bank-branches-not-receiving-communication-on-interest-repayments/article31222037.ece

According to G. Thilagavathi, head of the department of textile technology department of PSG College of Technology, the fabric was tested at South India Textile Research Association (SITRA) and it had met the synthetic blood penetration test standards. The centre has non-woven fabric lamination machinery and the breathable membrane used in making infant beds was laminated at the centre for this project. The fabric was then tested at SITRA. It has been stitched into a coverall and the seams need to be tested too. The centre will test the seams and if these meet the standards, the coveralls can be stitched.

“This fabric will not allow micro-organisms to penetrate. Some industries are also said to be getting into production of these coveralls here,” she said.

The Centre of Excellence has the capacity to make nearly 5,000 metres of fabric a day and the stitching can be outsourced, she said.

295,2020/03/31,68 Coimbatoreans who attended Nizamuddin conference traced,"The Health Department has traced 68 persons from Coimbatore who had attended the conference of Tablighi Jamaat at Nizamuddin in New Delhi earlier this month, which led to large-scale spread of COVID-19 in many States including Tamil Nadu.

An official from the Health Department involved in COVID-19 management said that the participants of the conference were tracked down based on information received from the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

Tamil Nadu had alerted the Ministry when two Thai nationals who came to Erode after attending the conference tested positive for COVID-19 on March 21.

Alerts

This input to the Centre would have made them issue alerts about other participants of the conference, said the official. Of the 68 persons, 51 were from Pollachi, Anamalai and Mettupalayam areas while 17 others were from urban areas within the Coimbatore Corporation.

Coimbatore District Collector K. Rajamani said in a statement that 82 persons from the district had attended the conference.

They had reached Coimbatore on March 23 and 24 by train.

As many as 17 persons from Coimbatore city and seven from Pollachi-Anamalai areas were under observation at the Government Medial College and ESI Hospital.

Nearly 280 staff members from the Health Department and the district administration were split into 70 screening teams for this survey, which was completed on Sunday, according to the sources.

The survey was done for the residences in the containment and buffer zones demarcated around the residence of the district’s first COVID-19 positive case in Tiruppur city, the sources added.

298,2020/03/31,"Corporation closes vegetable, fish markets","Coimbatore Corporation officials have shut down the temporary vegetable market the civic body had set up at the Mettupalayam Road Bus Stand and the fish market on Perur Road, Ukkadam.

The civic body closed the fish market on Monday and the Bus Stand market on Tuesday to prevent people from crowding and vendors from disobeying instructions.

When the fish market reopened on Sunday, there was such a crowd that no personal distancing was possible. To avoid the recurrence of such a situation, the Corporation had shut down the fish market.

Likewise, the Corporation officials had divided the vegetable vendors at the Anna Retail Vegetable Market, MTP Road, into two groups and sent one to the Bus Stand and the other to the Ramalingam Higher Secondary School ground to prevent crowding and help people from all areas get vegetables without difficulty.

But a section of the traders from the school, after having finished their sales, left the place around 11 a.m. on Tuesday to continue their business at the Bus Stand.

The way the traders acted defeated the very purpose for which the Corporation had divided them into two groups – to maintain personal distance, the officials said and therefore the officials shut down the Bus Stand market.

The Anna market too was shut for vegetable vendors. The civic body had, however, allowed the grocers to run their business from there.

The Corporation officials said the civic body was working on a mechanism to ensure that both sellers and buyers practised personal distancing.

Arrangement

The arrangement for the vegetable vendors would be that a group of vendors would sell their goods on odd days and the second group on even days.

The Corporation was also looking at allotting two or three places in every police station limits in the city for fish and meat vendors.

The Corporation, in consultation with the Coimbatore City Police, would soon finalise the list of places to be shared with the vendors and buyers, the officials added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/corporation-closes-vegetable-fish-markets/article31221967.ece
299,2020/03/31,Rumours make people flock to ration shops in Rathinapuri,"Plan was to handover tokens for govt.’s assistance at cardholders’ doorsteps

The Coimbatore Corporation Higher Secondary School, Rathinapuri, where the district administration had shifted three fair price shops, was a scene of chaos on Tuesday as people, defying lockdown, rushed to collect tokens.

The administration officials said soon after the shops’ supervisors opened on Tuesday to prepare distribution of tokens, people rushed into the school on hearing rumours that the supervisors would be distributing tokens.

The tokens were for distributing the State government’s special assistance of ₹ 1,000 for rice cardholders and essential commodities for all cardholders. The administration would begin the distribution on April 2.

The plan on Tuesday was to distribute the tokens at card holders’ door steps to comply with the lockdown and personal distancing norms. But, in violation of the norms, around 500 cardholders rushed to the school allegedly after being informed by some AIADMK men.

As word spread, more people rushed in forcing the supervisors to alert the officials at the District Supply Office, Coimbatore City Police and also the Coimbatore Corporation.

The officials said while they sent back many cardholders saying that they would have their tokens door delivered, they allowed a few people to stay behind, not wanting to disappoint them. And even as the few waited, they ensured that they maintained the mandatory three feet personal distance.

Sources at the District Supply Office said that in the next two days, supervisors at the 1,419 fair price shops would distribute tokens to all the 10.29 ration cardholders, including the 9.76 lakh rice cardholders.

The supervisors would be distributing tokens in such a way that they did not cater to more than 100-150 cardholders a day, depending on the number of cardholders attached to a shop.

The tokens would have the cardholder’s name, street, the day on which they would have to be at the shop and also the time to ensure that the shops were not crowded.

Refuting the allegation that the ruling party men in his ward were behind people rushing to the school, former AIADMK councillor of the area, R. Prabhakaran, said none of his party men was involved and alleged that it was the DMK.

DMK’s former councillor Loganathan denied the allegations.

304,2020/03/31,Have to educate people and save lives: Yuvraj Singh,"Drawing from personal experience, Yuvraj stresses the need to be disciplined in dealing with solitude

As the world strives to cope with the COVID-19 virus, Yuvraj Singh, having been through spells of fear and dreadful solitude, speaks to The Hindu on how to stay positive and the need to be extremely disciplined.

Your views on the current situation in the world following a lockdown...

It’s heartbreaking to see so many people dying all over the world. People, rather than panicking, should visit the official health sites (WHO and Union Health Ministry) to really understand what the disease is. I was also very scared in the beginning (of cancer) but then I got the right information, went to the right doctor and hospital. There is rampant misinformation about the virus on social media. First of all people need to stop reading (social media) and look for correct information.

How much have you understood from various official campaigns?

Kids and middle-aged people should avoid hugging their parents (over 60 years) and grandparents. It is your responsibility not to spread the virus. My heart bleeds for the migrant workers because they are very susceptible to catch the virus. We have to guide and protect them. We have to educate people in rural areas.

Don’t you think each individual matters in this fight?

Yes. People often remark ‘How much will my one vote matter.’ If everyone begins to have this attitude, then what if five lakh people say how would an individual vote matter. In effect, it would mean five lakh people will miss sending the right information to others. We have to save lives.

How are you coping with it?

Everybody has to find a routine to follow. Can’t keep brooding. If you do that, eventually you will get bogged down. I begin with a gym training (in the house). If you don’t have a gym, start doing exercises at home. Do lots of reading. You can do yoga, meditation, rather than mourn at the situation.

Your experience of the lockdown?

I have seen stars for the first time since I started living in Delhi. No air pollution and no noise pollution. We must take a pledge now that, when things improve, I won’t take my car out for a day, spend a day with the family, respect Mother Earth, plant trees, etc. [We need to] Cut down on creating pollution of any kind.

On the cricket front do you see anything amiss from your time?

Today, the youngsters get such (lucrative) IPL contracts even before playing for India that they don’t want to play four-day cricket. The attitude towards four-day cricket and Test cricket is very poor.

How do you view the recent struggles witnessed by Rishabh Pant and Prithvi Shaw?

They play under lot of pressure. I keep speaking to Rishabh. Prithvi is a great talent. But there are too many expectations from them. Lot of noise when they fail. Too much of scrutiny. I think we need to give them some time because they are the future.

How to deal with Pant and Shaw then?

Coaches and seniors have to be in touch with them constantly and tell them there are certain things they can’t do on and off the field. They really need guidance because they are at a fragile stage. They can either become great players or their careers could break.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/uwmgec/article31221834.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01YUVI1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/have-to-educate-people-and-save-lives-yuvraj-singh/article31221835.ece
305,2020/03/31,"India tour of Australia | Smith and Warner presence will make Australia formidable, says Tim Paine","Under Paine, Australia for the first time in 71 years lost a home Test series against India 1-2 in the 2018-19 bilateral contest.

The experience of 15,000 Test runs between Steve Smith and David Warner will certainly give Australian batting unit a formidable look when they take on India in a four-match series at the end of the year, feels skipper Tim Paine.

Also read: Australia captain Tim Paine upset over video review system

Under Paine, Australia for the first time in 71 years lost a home Test series against India 1-2 in the 2018-19 bilateral contest. However, Smith and Warner were then in the midst of their ball-tampering suspension and the team was in a transition phase.

“This is a different team, no doubt their team will be slightly different as well, but it’s two high quality teams, a really anticipated series purely because of the quality of cricket, not for what’s happened before. India and Australia as a rivalry, it’s a series a bit like the Ashes that we all look forward to,” Paine was quoted as saying by ‘Cricbuzz’.

Not only the seasoned duo but the extremely talented Marnus Labuschagne also adds the necessary depth that the batting unit didn’t have last time around.

“I think you put in 15,000 Test runs with two guys alone, Steve Smith and David Warner, Marnus Labuschagne’s come on in leaps and bounds and he’s now a top three or four batsman in the world himself.

“You put that amount of runs into a cricket side, last time we didn’t have... we know how good India’s bowling line-up is and last time we just weren’t quite good enough if we’re totally honest against that attack, whereas this time I think we’ll be a different kettle of fish. We’ve got three of the best batsmen in the world in our top six,” the captain said.

Matthew Wade playing purely as a batsman also is an advantage, opinedd Paine, who will continue to keep wickets.

“Matthew Wade back firing adds a real toughness to it, Travis Head improved a lot since he played India last time. So I think it’s going to be an exciting series, there’s no doubt about it.

“The batting line-ups on show are going to be as good as you will see, it’s going to be exciting for fans and it’s going to be who handles (the pressure), we know the conditions over here are going to offer the quicks something and I think it’s going to be awesome to watch, so I can’t wait to play in it,” he said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/waraaq/article31220413.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SMITHANDWARNER,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-tour-of-australia-smith-and-warner-presence-will-make-australia-formidable-says-tim-paine/article31220414.ece
306,2020/03/31,"No IPL, no salary concerns for franchises; domestic players will also be affected, says ICA chief","BCCI is looking at an alternate window as chances of a curtailed IPL in May look dim but nothing concrete has come out.

No play, no pay.

This could well be the fate of players, who have signed up for this year’s IPL, which has been postponed and seems unlikely to go ahead unless BCCI figures an alternate window later in the year, compromising a few bilateral commitments.

“The system of IPL payments is that 15% is paid a week before the tournament starts. 65% more is paid during the tournament. The remaining 20% is paid within a stipulated time after the tournament ends,” a senior official of an IPL franchise told PTI.

“The BCCI has specific guidelines. Obviously, no player will be paid as of now,” he added.

In fact, the economic implications of a season without IPL could be huge, admitted BCCI Players’ body — the Indian Cricketers’ Association — president Ashok Malhotra.

He feels that even domestic players may have to accept pay cuts if losses run into thousands of crores amid the ongoing lockdown to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

Right now, BCCI is looking at an alternate window as chances of a curtailed IPL in May look dim but nothing concrete has come out.

The country is currently under a 21-day lockdown till April 14 while IPL has been postponed till April 15. The pandemic has caused mayhem worldwide, killing over 37,000 people so far.

The economic upheaval caused by it has led to players of England and Australia to admit that they are bracing up for pay cuts.

Another franchise official clarified that the salaries of the players are not insured for a pandemic.

“We will not get any money from insurance company as pandemic is not covered in the clause. Each franchise has salary overheads ranging between ₹75 to 85 crore. How can we pay if there’s no action,” he asked.

“From English Premier League, La Liga to Bundesliga, players are taking pay cuts. Also there is no certainty anywhere as to when things will get normal,” the official, who has been part of at least IPL 10 editions, added.

Both of them said in unison that BCCI needs to see what can be done even though they understand that the parent body stands to lose close to ₹3000 crore.

“It’s not just the Dhonis and the Kohlis who will be affected. Surely they would feel the pinch but for many first-timers, the ₹20, 40 or 60 lakh is serious life-changing money after all the hard work. Hope the BCCI has a plan in place,” he said.

BCCI treasurer Arun Dhumal, however, said that at present, there hasn’t been any discussion about pay cuts.

“There has been no discussion at all on pay cuts. IPL obviously is BCCI’s biggest tournament. But at this point, it is very difficult to do calculations and estimate losses. The calculations are complex and till office-bearers get together, we can’t say anything,” Dhumal told PTI.

However, former India Test player Malhotra feels that one needs to be practical in understanding the situation. In case of domestic players, it might not be a pay cut but probably the much-awaited pay hike could be put on hold for some time.

“The BCCI earns its money from cricket. If cricket is not happening, where will the money come from? We have to be sensible here.

“So, it’s not just international cricketers but domestic players will also be affected. It’s not the board’s fault. This is an unavoidable situation,” Malhotra said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/lyofk2/article31217428.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IPLTROPHY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/no-ipl-no-salary-concerns-for-franchises-domestic-players-will-also-be-affected-says-ica-chief/article31217429.ece
307,2020/03/31,Bangladesh Cricket Board approves allowance for women cricketers to cope with COVID-19 shutdown,"The cricketers who will benefit are the ones who appeared in the 2018-19 women’s National Cricket League and have been in BCB’s selection camps in 2019-20

Dhaka The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has decided to pay a one-time allowance of 20,000 Taka to its women players to help them cope with the shutdown of all events due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

BCB President Nazmul Hassan, who is also a member of parliament, said the players need support given the current situation. The cricketers who will benefit are the ones who appeared in the 2018-19 women’s National Cricket League and have been in BCB’s selection camps in 2019-20. BDT 20,000 amounts to a little over ₹17,000.

“Just like their male counterparts, the majority of women cricketers also look towards domestic events for earnings. Besides, we had training camps scheduled for women players which have been hampered by the prevailing COVID-19 situation,” Mr. Hassan said in a press release.

“The cricketers have been forced to pass a period of non-activity and they need our support,” he added.

Last week, the BCB announced a one-time financial aid to their male players, who do not have central contracts or first-class contracts of the board. They are to be given BDT 30,000 each.

“With the tournament and league looking at an indefinite period of shut down, cricketers who are not part of the BCB’s contracts are likely to face financial hardship as they may have only received partial payment from their respective Premier League Clubs.

“This assistance is for that section of the players,” Mr. Hassan had said.

310,2020/03/31,HC panel eases criteria for release of undertrials,"To decongest jails in the wake of COVID-19, 1,500 convicts identified to be released on ‘Emergency Parole’

A high-powered committee, headed by a Delhi High Court judge, has relaxed the criteria for release of undertrial prisoners on interim bail from city jails in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic.

The Supreme Court recently took up the issue of overcrowding of prisons as a matter of serious concern, pursuant to the spread of COVID-19 across the globe. The Delhi government had constituted a high-powered committee, comprising Delhi High Court judge Justice Hima Kohli, Executive Chairperson of State Legal Services Authorities, Principal Secretary (Home) and Director General (Prisons) for working out the modalities of the plan.

To decongest prisons, a total of 1,500 convicts have been identified to be released on “Emergency Parole” for a period of eight weeks. At least, 500 undertrial prisoners were identified on the basis of earlier criteria to whom interim bail for a period of 45 days has been granted.

The interim bail criteria for UTPs, who are facing trial in a case, prescribes a maximum sentence of seven years or less. It has also been relaxed for UTPs who are in custody for a period of one month or more. In the case of women UTP, if she is in custody for a period of 15 days or more, she can avail of the benefit of relaxed interim bail criteria.

The conditions for interim bail has, however, not been relaxed for inmates who are undergoing trial for intermediary or large quantity recovery under Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropics Substances Act.

312,2020/03/31,Delhi govt. to feed 10-12 lakh from today,"Creating more centres to provide food, says CM Kejriwal

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said the Delhi government is preparing to arrange 3,000 centres, each with a capacity of feeding 500 people per day, to feed 10 to 12 lakh people in need from Wednesday.

Currently, food is available at around 800 locations in Delhi.

From tomorrow, 2,500 schools and 250 night shelters will start distributing food to 500 people, each bringing the total number of centres between 2,800 and 3,000.

To avoid crowding

“We were feeding 3.5 lakh-4 lakh people daily until now, and we will start feeding 10-12 lakh people from tomorrow. Upon further deliberations on this, we found out that people were crowding at the food centres. So we decided to create more centres,” he said.

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said 10 schools in the Patparganj Assembly constituency had been assigned the task of providing food to 15,000-20,000 people everyday.

These, he said, included the Govt. Co-ed Senior Secondary School, Chilla; RSKV West Vinod Nagar; RSKV, J J Colony Khichripur ; MCD Primary School, Dhobi Ghat, Block 6,7,8; RSKV/SBV East Vinod Nagar ; RSKV/SBV Patparganj ; RSKV/ SBV Mandawali No.1; RSKV/SBV Mandawali No 3; EDMC Primary school Chander Vihar ; and EDMC Primary School, Mandawali Village.

313,2020/03/31,Defiant migrants ready to confront anything that comes their way,"They refuse to admit the futility of their efforts to reach home

They knew there were supposed to be no buses — State-run or private — to ferry them home; they were aware that inter-State borders had been sealed given the nationwide lockdown to contain the community spread of the COVID-19 epidemic.

Still, migrant workers putting up at a government shelter set up near the transit hub of Pari Chowk in Greater Noida refused to acknowledge either the futility of their efforts or that of their hope here on Tuesday.

While those with families, including children, sat on the main road adjacent to the Jhandewala Mandir Dharamshala camp with their bags packed, just in case some means of travel appeared, small groups of young men tried not to attract attention as they walked neighbourhood streets adjacent the highway to Delhi.

Lone travellers on the Yamuna Expressway above, with heavy backpacks on their shoulders, had planned a 100-km-long walk to Agra and said they were willing to take their chances both with a police confrontation and with whatever else came their way as long as they could inch closer home.

Ramjeet Singh, who was employed at a prominent refrigeration company’s manufacturing unit in Haryana’a Manesar, and his family of four quietly waited in the courtyard of the Jhandewala Mandir Dharamshala camp a stone’s throw away from the swanky Pari Chowk metro station.

Tried and failed

The only residents of the camp, which according to the administration has a capacity to house 200 inmates, Mr. Singh admitted they had tried and failed each attempt made by them to travel to Etah since they ended up here on Sunday evening.

“We started from Manesar on Friday evening and reached the Gurugram border on foot at night but it was sealed. After spending the night there, we walked, hitched rides and were able to somehow make it to Greater Noida on Sunday night; but by that time the bus service on the Yamuna Expressway had stopped,” he said, his attention turning to inspect every vehicle passing him by on the main road as he spoke.

“The police asked us and some boys, waiting for a bus, to make our way to this camp. We were exhausted so we spent the night here. My family and I were able to wash and bathe after two days. We decided to go home when those boys got into a private vehicle. We thought we could also get one, but when we couldn’t, the police asked us to return to this camp. So we walked back,” he said.

His wife, Kiran, said it wasn’t as if she had any complaints against the facilities on offer. “There is food and there is a place to sleep; but it’s not home,” she said.

On the Yamuna Expressway, Aniket Kumar, an out-of-work factory hand who was employed at a factory in the Ecotech area, trudged along with only his heavy backpack for company. “I will walk as far as possible. I just have to go to Agra,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/qgw16s/article31224160.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/migrants,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/defiant-migrants-ready-to-confront-anything-that-comes-their-way/article31222215.ece
314,2020/03/31,DMRC running 2 trains daily to keep system ‘healthy and functional’,"Stations on all lines being manned round the clock by staff

Two metro trains are being run daily from each terminal station, twice a day even as commercial operations remain suspended till April 14 due to the nationwide lockdown announced to curb the COVID-19 outbreak, in a bid to keep the system “healthy”, a Delhi Metro official said.

Working in shifts

With a complete shutdown of operations since March 22, the Delhi Metro network with 286 stations spanning over 390 km, was being maintained by a reduced number of staff, working in shifts, to ensure the “functionality of the system” remains intact, the official said.

“Two trains run daily from every terminal station in the morning and evening hours except on the Airport Express Line and the Grey Line. On these two lines, train movement will be done every sixth day, in the morning hours only,” said a senior DMRC official.

The official added, “The train movement exercise is aimed at ensuring good health and functionality of all the systems like track, traction, signalling, telecommunication and so on, which are required for smooth running of the metro services on normal days.”

Terminal stations on all lines, interchange stations and depot entry or exit stations were also being manned round the clock, officials said while adding that the unmanned stations are inspected by the station managers, every sixth day.

“Purpose is to visit the stations and check the health of the system periodically and ensuring all the systems are working fine,” the official said.

A group of staff are also deployed at the Operation Control Centres in Metro Bhawan and Shastri Park, with a staff of 2-3 persons per shift, instead of the usual 10-12 people per shift.

Safety reasons

“Additionally, supply to commercial outlets especially, shops or kiosks may be cut off due to safety reasons. All equipment whose functionality is not required due to non-functioning of the metro service for public will be switched off during the lockdown period,” the official said.

Metro officials added that CISF personnel manning all stations were also periodically monitoring CCTV footage to report any unusual activity at empty stations.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kblmm4/article31222150.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31DELPRIYADMRC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dmrc-running-2-trains-daily-to-keep-system-healthy-and-functional/article31222151.ece
315,2020/03/31,"Relief camps’ inmates feel trapped, want to return","Set up in the wake of exodus of migrants, occupancy at these centres is very low

A makeshift relief centre at a “gaushala” in Manesar village here, near Delhi-Jaipur highway, is the new “home” for Dheeraj and his wife and their two-year-old daughter, for at least next two weeks now.

Though the daily needs of his family are being taken care of, they feel “trapped” like hundreds of other fellow inmates and want to return to their village in Uttar Pradesh’s Hardoi.

“Sahab ji, khana to mil raha hai, lekin biwi bachche ke saath kab tak yahan reh sakte hain [Sir, the food is being provided, but for how long can one stay here with wife and the child],” said Dheeraj, a migrant labour at a textile mill in Panipat.

Borders sealed

His family along with 60-odd workers had boarded a truck to Agra from Panipat on March 28 night with the help of local police, but landed at the relief centre after the truck driver dropped them at Bilaspur and the administration sealed the borders.

“We panicked after the exodus began and decided to leave. But the truck driver left us in the lurch. We slept at a petrol pump on Monday and the police picked us up and left us at this centre on Tuesday morning,” said Dhruv, also part of the group. He said that their landlord had threatened them to break the locks to their rooms and throw their belongings on the road. “Sir, please arrange for us to reach our village,” he pleaded.

The centre, set up in the wake of largescale exodus of migrant workers after the lockdown, has around 300 workers, including women and children, from Punjab, Rajasthan and Haryana’s Jhajjar, Rewari and Gurugram districts.

The inmates said food was available all through the day and doctors also visited to attend those in need of medical care.

Helping arrange food and milk for the inmates with the help of his friends and administration, RTI activist Ramesh Yadav said that Deputy Commissioner and Police Commissioner had visited the centre couple of times to oversee the arrangements.

The district administration has been running around 30 night shelters in Gurugram to provide food and shelter to the poor, especially, to the migrant workers. However, the occupancy at these centres is very low, a little over 800.

To open more centres

“We have been running 17 centres in Gurugram city, but it has only 297 inmates. We plan to open 16 more centres. Most of the migrant workers have already left, so the occupancy at these centres is very low. These centres now mostly act as food distribution points for the poor,” said Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran, Estate Officer-II, Vivek Kalia.

District Development and Panchayat Officer Narender Kumar, in charge of 10 shelters in the rural areas, said the centres had only 567 inmates. He said they planned to open 20-odd more such centres.

Having come to Haryana in search of labour during Rabi crop harvest season, around two dozen labourers from Uttar Pradesh’s Pilibhit were left stranded due to lockdown just two days before they were slated to return. The police guided them to a community centre at Sector 15 Part-II, now a makeshift relief centre.

“We need not worry for food, but every time we call back home our families ask us to return. Our parents, wife and kids cry when we speak to them,” said Dinesh.

Many inmates, however, complained that there was no arrangement for soap to wash clothes and a few of them were in need of medical care as well. Security guard Mahabir said at least 35 people were staying at the centre that had a capacity of only 150 people.

Daily wagers at MCG’s Kadipur night shelter said they did not get enough to their fill, and only a few of them had masks. The inmates are provided food twice a day. The makeshift relief camp at Kherki Daula village, off NH-48, however, lied empty.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/587f6c/article31222119.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31DELPRIYACAMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/relief-camps-inmates-feel-trapped-want-to-return/article31222120.ece
316,2020/03/31,"Working with inadequate safety gear, say CATS ambulance staff","Vehicles not fumigated and disinfectant not sprayed; company denies claims

Drivers and emergency medical technician staff of CATS ambulances alleged that they are not being provided with adequate safety gear and are scared for their lives while transporting patients.

A driver, on condition of anonymity, alleged that the quality of masks, gloves and sanitisers is poor and the amount inadequate. “There is no Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) kit — which is used especially, when dealing with COVID-19 suspects or positive cases — given to us. The sanitisers which are given to us are mixed with water. The ambulances are not fumigated and disinfectant is not sprayed,” he alleged.

Lack of measures

Elaborating on the hazards of lack of these measures, he said that if a person who has symptoms of COVID-19 is transported to a hospital and the next call is for a pregnant woman, “in such a case, if the ambulance is not sanitised, it can be dangerous not only for us staffers but also for other patients”.

CATS ambulance staff union president Narender Lakra said that drivers and EMT staff are scared to drive and are worried for their lives but are working because of monetary needs. He also said that of 264 ambulances, only about 100 are operational and running on the road. “At the time when they should be operational to the maximum, only one-third of them are running. The reason is that most of them need repairs,” he said.

Punished for protesting

A driver, identified as Sunil Kumar, alleged that he has not been getting work since he raised his voice against inadequate safety gear on March 17. “A couple of us gathered and protested demanding safety gear. The authorities got to know and told me that that we will not get work anymore and since then, I haven’t been called,” he alleged.

Sources said that according to an internal report prepared everyday, at 4 p.m., there were 130 calls received regarding COVID-19 cases but only about 40 CATS ambulances were operational across the Capital.

Adding to the fear, Mr. Lakra, claimed that one EMT staff has been tested positive but the claim has been denied by GVK-EMRI Pvt Ltd State head Manish Tinku. The Delhi government has outsourced operation and maintenance of CATS ambulances to this private company.

Denying all claims, Mr. Tinku said that protective gear like masks, gloves and sanitisers were provided to all staffers in all ambulances. “The PPE kits are limited but so far, about 250 cases of COVID-19 have been transported and the kit was provided to the staffers. More sanitisers are being purchased,” he said.

Mr. Tinku also said that about 200 CATS ambulances are supposed to operate in the Capital, of which 130 are operational. “The number 264 is old. Also, 50 of 70 which are not operational are due for repairs. We have taken special permission from the government for three workshops which have started helping us since Monday for repairs,” he added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/7b6wn7/article31222063.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31DELPRIYACATS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/working-with-inadequate-safety-gear-say-cats-ambulance-staff/article31222064.ece
317,2020/03/31,Andaman and Nicobar tribes under heavy security,"Measure taken after nine people who visited Delhi tested positive for COVID-19

After nine persons, who visited Delhi from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands earlier this month, tested positive for COVID-19, the authorities have stepped up security near the areas in the islands that are inhabited by indigenous tribes.

An officer said out of the 10 persons who tested positive in the islands, nine of them visited Delhi to attend an event in Nizamuddin and returned to Port Blair via Kolkata on March 24. The tenth infected person is the wife of one of the patients. The Andaman police and the administration have made arrangements to keep the infected people in quarantine. They were part of a religious gathering in Delhi earlier this month, attended anti-CAA protests and also visited Old Delhi, said officials.

“One of the persons was put under home quarantine but his wife got infected. We have quarantined the couple. Except for the people who attended the religious congregation in Delhi, no other person has been found infected,” the officer added.

Director-General of Police, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Dependra Pathak, said: “All of the suspected persons were screened at the Port Blair airport and shifted to quarantine. We sought help from the health department and later it was found that they went to Delhi for the religious meeting.”

Mr. Pathak added that they are strictly following MHA guidelines and implementing a complete lockdown.

When asked about the safety of isolated tribes, he said tribal habitats are no-go areas and attract severe prosecution. Further, movement of people or vehicles has been stopped even near their habitats. For instance, the ATR passing through the forests has been closed.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/andaman-and-nicobar-tribes-under-heavy-security/article31221987.ece
318,2020/03/31,"Gathering at Nizamuddin a highly irresponsible act, says Kejriwal","Govt. claims to have written to L-G, asking him to refer the matter to the police

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said the gathering at the Nizamuddin Markaz (centre) was a “highly irresponsible act” and the government had written to Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal asking him to refer the matter to the police.

According to a Raj Niwas spokesperson, these directions came on Tuesday evening with Mr. Baijal directing the police to take “appropriate action as per law” in relation to the case. Of the 97 COVID-19 cases in the city, 24 were from the Nizamuddin centre or the Tablighi Jamaat, Mr. Kejriwal said.

Rise in cases

“There is no denying that there has been a considerable rise in COVID-19 cases in Delhi. Around March 12-13, people from across the nations gathered for a religious congregation. Many of them left for their homes but many stayed back. We are now bringing out the people who have stayed back and tests are being conducted now, out of which 24 cases have come out to be positive,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

He added: “In the last three days, 1,548 people have been brought out of the centre, 441 have been moved to hospitals and 1,447 to quarantine facilities.”

The Chief Minister said the world was affected by the disease with even developed nations under its ambit. Thousands of peoplehad lost their lives in the U.S., Spain, Italy, China and many more, he added.

If religious congregations of different faiths continued, it was going to be “a huge problem”, he said, terming the congregation at Nizamuddin “a serious act” and requesting religious leaders across different faiths to ensure that no gatherings are encouraged.

“Navratri has been going on but we have seen no crowd on the streets and in the temples. Gurudwaras have been shut, people are not going to masjids, Mecca is empty, Vatican City is empty,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

“Many people have gone back to other cities after attending this event. I hope not but think about the people that have been already affected by this. With folded hands, I request all the religious leaders and people to cooperate with the government,” he added.

The government had written to the L-G for filing an FIR against the mosque administration, he said, adding: “Several reports of how the officials did not act on time are also coming up. If the involvement of any official is found out, strict action will be taken against them. Lives of many people present in the centre have been put at risk; six persons died after attending the event and reaching Telangana,” he added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/91394a/article31221981.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/delhi-covid1col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/gathering-at-nizamuddin-a-highly-irresponsible-act-says-kejriwal/article31221982.ece

322,2020/03/31,Coronavirus | Officials of Tablighi Jamaat charged with defying restrictions,"Over 400 people with COVID-19 symptoms hospitalised, over 1,000 quarantined.

With at least 24 of its occupants testing positive for the novel coronavirus, an Islamic centre in the national capital has turned out to be the latest hotspot of COVID-19. More than 400 people with symptoms were admitted to different hospitals and over 1,100 shifted to government-run quarantine facilities in Delhi alone over March 30 and 31, officials said.

Hundreds of others who returned home after staying at the centre over the last fortnight might have carried the virus to several States, authorities fear.

Coronavirus | Nizamuddin centre COVID-19 cases spark a controversy

Thousands of people from across the country, as well as from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Saudi Arabia, attended a gathering at the centre earlier this month over a number of days, officials said.

A large number of them were stuck on the premises as the country went under lockdown on March 24. Markaz Nizamuddin is the international headquarters of Tablighi Jamaat, a puritanical Islamic sect.

The Delhi police on Tuesday registered a case against Maulana Saad and others of Tablighi Jamaat under Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, read with Sections 269, 270, 271 and 120-B of the IPC, for violation of government directions in respect of restriction of gatherings and safety measures, including physical-distancing.

The centre said in a statement that many participants could not disperse after all means of transport came to an abrupt halt on March 24, though it tried to make special arrangements with permission from the authorities. “Under such compelling circumstances, there was no option for Markaz Nizamuddin but to accommodate the stranded visitors with prescribed medical precautions till the situation becomes conducive to their movement or arrangements are made by the authorities,” the statement said.

Close community interactions in prayer, dining and travel among Tablighi Jamaat followers put them at a high risk of the contagion. Participants at the recent congregation included people from Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Jammu and Kashmir and Kerala — in cases already known.

One attendee, a Srinagar-based businessman, died of the disease on March 26. He had travelled by air, train and road to Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and back to Jammu and Kashmir. At least 300 people who came in contact with him have been put under quarantine.

Coronavirus | Nizamuddin markaz had sought help from authorities for vacating premises

Eleven people who returned to Kerala have been put under quarantine; six from Telangana who attended the congregation have died. In Andaman and Nicobar Islands, six people who returned from the event have tested positive. The Assam government has asked people to voluntarily report themselves if they were present at the congregation. Around 300 people from the State attended the event.

All symptomatic people still in Delhi were being tested for COVID-19. “We are still in the process of shifting people from the Markaz [the centre]. The symptomatic people are being moved to hospitals and the asymptomatic people are being moved to different government-run quarantine facilities,” a senior official of the Delhi Health Department told The Hindu. “The asymptomatic people are not being tested immediately, but we will be closely monitoring them. This is in keeping with the Central government’s guidelines,” the official said.

323,2020/03/31,‘Ghaziabad couple kept socialising after testing positive’,"Noida firm they work for is under the scanner

Officials of the Ghaziabad health department were left shocked upon learning that a couple who had tested positive for COVID-19 by a private lab drove from the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida to the MMG district hospital here in their private vehicle instead of an ambulance.

The couple was referred to Ghaziabad but before the ambulance could be ready, they left the premises, GIMS director Dr. (Brig.) Rakesh Gupta said, adding that the incident will have to be investigated.

Twelve in isolation ward

Ghaziabad Chief Medical Officer (CMO) N.K. Gupta said, “The woman did not disclose information about where she worked and did not quarantine herself. Her husband also kept socialising. We have prepared a list of 90-odd people whom the couple came in contact with. A total of 12 have been admitted to the isolation ward of MMG district hospital.”

With the couple testing positive, Ghaziabad has reported seven COVID-19 cases so far, including two who have recovered.

The woman works for a firm which has been under the scanner for withholding information about a U.K.-based auditor who had visited the company and stayed in Noida for three days.

So far 23 cases, directly or indirectly, are linked to the firm, said a health department official.

FIR lodged against firm

Gautam Budhha Nagar CMO Anurag Bhargav said an FIR had been registered against the firm. “The managing director of the company also returned from the U.K. on March 1 and remained asymptomatic for a while. He got himself tested by a private firm and has been found positive. His contact history is being traced,” said Dr. Bhargav.

According to the district health department, a list of 161 employees of the company has been prepared for screening.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ghaziabad-couple-kept-socialising-after-testing-positive/article31212738.ece
324,2020/03/31,Haryana police seal inter-State borders,"Violation of guidelines leads to 610 FIRs and 745 arrests

The Haryana police on Monday sealed all its inter-State borders to prevent migration of workers to effectively control the spread of COVID-19. The move came days after the restriction of non-essential services triggered the mass exodus of the migrant workers to their houses in adjoining districts from across the State.

Besides, 610 FIRs have been registered in Haryana for violating lockdown guidelines, 745 persons arrested and 3,407 vehicles impounded.

Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) Navdeep Singh Virk said that the Haryana police had made arrangements to ensure lockdown in the State. The movement of migrant labourers had been contained by persuading them to move to any of the 461 shelters set up for their stay.

The food at these shelters is being provided with the help of NGOs, social workers and the local administration. Police officers and jawans posted at various check-points are offering help to people especially the poor, homeless, needy and sick.

As per the government instructions, industrialists and factory owners have been advised to extend all sorts of help to their workers in the given situation, he added.

Mr. Virk said that during the lockdown, all public activities are banned except the essential and emergency services, but cargo movement in vehicles is allowed on the State and national highways. Keeping this in view, the people must avoid roaming on roads unnecessarily.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/haryana-police-seal-inter-state-borders/article31212730.ece
325,2020/03/31,"For the homeless, govt. releases digital map of relief camps","Most of the people on the streets unaware of provisions

With a majority of people cooped up in their homes for the 21-day lockdown, the only people seen roaming the streets are migrant workers and the homeless who are still unaware of the Delhi government’s scheme providing shelter and hot food at various locations across the city.

To help guide the homeless to the camps, the Delhi government has released a customised Google Maps link which shows the locations of the facilities. But with no access to technology, the homeless remain unaware of such provisions.

Most of the people The Hindu talked to on Monday asked to be directed towards a location where they could get some assistance. The Delhi government has said that it has made arrangements to serve four lakh meals daily, distribute extra ration and provide accommodation at night shelters and schools.

Ranjan, a construction worker from Etawah in Uttar Pradesh, who along with his wife and children had spent all of Sunday trying to reach the Delhi border to find some transport to reach home, was huddled under a flyover near Lajpat Nagar on Monday.

“I tried to reach home but the police did not let us go any further. I was working at a construction site but it has been closed. I do not have a roof over my head and we do not have food,” he said, unaware that there were two schools in Andrews Ganj nearby that were providing free food.

Dharam Pal, another migrant worker who was sent back from the border, said that the police stopped him and asked him to head home but nobody informed him about the night shelters or where they were located.

Several non-migrant workers also said that they did not know that the Delhi government was providing accommodation at schools. Mohammad Mitoo a rickshaw driver living on the pavement opposite Lodhi Hotel, said: “I used to make ₹300-₹400 everyday but for the past week I have not made a penny and have been living here with my wife and three children. I have ₹1,500 in savings and some rice and dal which I hope will last me till I can work again.”

He said that he prefers to live on the street as the night shelter across the road is being used by the ‘regulars’ and it has no space for him and his family. He was unaware that there were four relief centres nearby.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/for-the-homeless-govt-releases-digital-map-of-relief-camps/article31212729.ece
326,2020/03/31,Hundreds of migrant workers queue up for ration,"Police have a tough time to maintain order

Hundreds of workers from other States living in the city queued up on Tuesday morning at the Quli Qutb Shah Stadium to collect their quota of 12 kg rice and ₹500. The queue for men wound round the stadium till the inner lane of Ghansi Bazaar.

“I have been waiting from 10 a.m. from the time I got to know that they will distribute rations today,” Sahadev, who hails from Howrah and now lives near the Mehbub ki Mehndi area, said. Many of the men in the queue have been rendered jobless as all the workshops and goldsmith enterprises have shut shop due to the lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19.

Police had a tough time maintaining order among people and at the same time, keep space between them.

The distribution began at 3 p.m. and by 4 p.m., only 39 beneficiaries walked away with the rice and money. “It is taking time as we have to ensure the documents are correct and there is no misrepresentation,” said an official, who was collecting thumb impressions and checking the address on the Aadhaar card.

“We have done away with biometric verification for this due to the fears about spread of the virus. The beneficiaries should have residential address of other states,” said the official, adding that the distribution will continue the next day as they may not be able to supply rations to all the waiting beneficiaries.

“I wouldn’t have queued to collect this. But we don’t know when we will again start getting work and earning money. Something is better than nothing,” said S.K. Abdul, who shapes the moulds of gold ornaments. “The business was poor even before this. With this, I don’t know when we will start earning decently,” said Abdul, whose wages are linked to productivity.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/k1pjxv/article31222283.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy01MIgrantlabour,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hundreds-of-migrant-workers-queue-up-for-ration/article31222278.ece
327,2020/03/31,463 Delhi event returnees spotted,"Of these, 74 who had COVID-19 like symptoms shifted to govt. hospitals

A total of 463 persons, who had returned to the city after attending the Tablighi Jamaat event at Delhi, have been located by exclusive teams constituted by the State government on Tuesday.

Of these, 74 persons who had COVID-19 like symptoms have been shifted to Gandhi Hospital and Government General and Chest Hospital, Erragadda. Tests will be carried out on them to determine coronavirus infection, if any.

Forty-one persons have been shifted to other quarantine facilities designated by the government for isolation. The remaining 348 have been asked to observe home quarantine for the mandated 14 days. Their family members too have been asked to remain under home quarantine.

Those shifted to government designated quarantine facilities include aged and vulnerable persons with co-morbidities apart from those with insufficient space at their respective dwellings to observe quarantine.

Of the 1,030 persons who had attended the religious event at Delhi from across Telangana, 603 were from the city, a statement from GHMC informed.

A total of 140 persons have remained untraceable due to ambiguity in addresses, and efforts are on to trace them, it added.

Two hundred exclusive teams, with members drawn from Police, GHMC, Revenue, and Medical and Health departments, have been constituted and deployed to locate the persons based on their addresses on Tuesday. They went from door to door inquiring and collecting details about the health status of the persons concerned and their family members, apart from their contract trail.

Apart from these, already 150 teams had been on the ground across various divisions in GHMC area, keeping a watch on the persons under home quarantine, and identifying foreign returnees who need to observe quarantine for the stipulated 14 days.

The teams check on the persons twice a day, and see if the mandatory home quarantine is being observed. Those found to be violating the norms are being shifted to government designated centres.

Top SCR officials were shaken up when the Telangana and Andhra Pradesh governments sought passengers details on the trains from New Delhi/Hazarth Nizamuddin and Secunderabad and Visakhapatnam between March 13-15 by which people returned from the Tabligi Jamaat congregation.

“We have given details of passengers to both the governments to trace them. It has come to our notice that most of the returnees had travelled by AP Express, Telangana Express, Tamil Nadu Express, GT Express, AP Sampark Kranthi and Duronto Express,” informed railway officials. Although it has been nearly two weeks since the journey, they don’t want to take any chances and are checking on the staff, 15 in each of the trains, for any COVID-19 symptoms in the last fortnight.

“The quarantine period has already passed and so far we have not received any adverse information. However, we will put them in quarantine, if necessary, in our official accommodation or respective homes for sometime and test them,” said senior officials, when contacted.

Incidentally, SCR had put 14 railway staff like ticket checking inspectors, catering, electrical and sanitation staff, who had travelled in the AP Sampark Kranthi Express from Hazrath Nizamuddin to Ramagundam/Tirupathi last month, for two weeks of quarantime.

330,2020/03/31,Health dept. suspected a pattern from last weekend,"One of the first cases in TS had a travel history to the Delhi congregation, followed by more cases

It was from last weekend that officials from Telangana Health and other departments started suspecting that people who returned after attending a three-day-long religious congregation in New Delhi could have contacted coronavirus. One of the first cases in the State, with the travel history, was detected on March 26. It was followed by more cases in Hyderabad, Rangareddy and other districts, which gave root to the suspicion.

Alerts were sent to senior officials in multiple departments who got on to the task of further investigation and the suspicion turned into a pattern. On Monday night, the State government confirmed that six persons who attended the religious congregation contacted COVID-19 and died in the past few days. Several persons from the State had attended the congregation and many contacted coronavirus.

The information on the number of people from each district was collated and sent to the Health department which was passed on to District Medical and Health Officials (DMHO). Based on the names, phone numbers, addresses in some cases, staff from Health department, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), and other departments went to their homes to enquire if any with the travel history developed symptoms.

“Those who attended the religious congregation and showing symptoms are admitted in isolation wards of government hospitals. Samples were collected and sent for tests. If there are no symptoms, they are admitted in quarantine centres,” officials said.

The rank and file of the Health department got on to the task of finding the dates they have returned to their home towns in Telangana, the places they have been to, people they met and other details. List of primary contacts, secondary contacts was prepared.

“If any of the suspects tests positive, we will start monitoring the health condition of his contacts,” another official said.

In fact, it was learnt that family members of a few COVID-19 patients, who attended the congregation, walked into government hospitals with requested to get tested. They were admitted and samples were collected for tests.

331,2020/03/31,"‘On the very same day, 95% of the Markaz was empty’","Groups of preachers returned and then the numbers rose, says Telanganaite who attended congregation

Over a dozen persons who were part of a Jamaat — a batch of Muslim preachers — from Hyderabad are quarantined in a property said to be a high-rise building in the Narela area of Delhi, a source inside the Banglewali Masjid, the Alami (Global) Tablighi Jamaat Markaz (Centre) said.

The source, who is a worker of the 96-year-old organisation, is from Telangana and left for the event on March 21. Requesting anonymity, he told The Hindu, “These people from Hyderabad are quarantined in buildings with 14 or 15 floors in Narela. There are two rooms in each flat and each room has one person. We are told that the place where they are kept is okay and so far there have been no problems.”

Unofficial estimates suggest that between 800 and 1,000 people from both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh visited the Banglewali Masjid – where the meeting, known as jod – was organised. On March 7, a jod of senior Tablighi Jamaat (TJ) workers, in charge of their own jurisdictions, from across the world was convened. Around 10 persons from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh were said to be a part of this particular meeting. The TJ treats Telangana and Andhra Pradesh as a single jurisdictional unit. A jod of workers from Telangana and AP was organised from March 15 to 17, after which they dispersed to different parts of the two Telugu States.

The TJ has maintained that it has complied with all directions of the local authorities in Delhi. “On the very same day, 95% of the Markaz was empty as people were being sent according to the States from where they belong. A senior Mufti (cleric) was doing this and I am a witness to this,” he said.

Since the Banglewali Masjid serves a nerve centre for all Tableeghi activities, groups of preachers who were in different parts of the country returned. The numbers then rose.

Curfew announced

“Soon after they came, the Janata Curfew was announced. We sent many people out of the Markaz in an orderly fashion. But several international visitors were stuck. And after the Janata Curfew it became even more difficult to clear the premises as transport came to a grinding halt and flights were cancelled. Of course, we sought the authorities’ help to clear the Markaz,” the source said.

While the source said that batches of workers were being taken away for quarantining and testing as he spoke, he is still in the Banglewali Masjid overseeing the process.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/on-the-very-same-day-95-of-the-markaz-was-empty/article31220907.ece
332,2020/03/31,Hectic efforts on to identify Jamaat returnees in TS,"As many as 1,030 persons from Telangana had attended Markaz prayers in New Delhi earlier this month

With as many as 1,030 persons from 29 districts of the State identified as ‘returnees’ from attending Markaz prayers in Nizamuddin in New Delhi earlier this month, the district administrations are on an overdrive to zero in on those suspected to be infected with COVID-19.

On Tuesday, top district officials were on their toes to prepare a list of persons who had attended the religious congregation between March 13 and 15 in New Delhi. The New Delhi Tablighi Jamaat returnees have now become the object of intense focus of authorities in former composite Adilabad district after emerging as the biggest group to have been infected with COVID-19. The administrations in Adilabad, Kumram Bheem Asifabad, Mancherial and Nirmal districts are sparing no efforts in tracking them down, intending to put them into the mandatory isolation either at home or at special centres readied for the purpose.

Mandal-wise teams comprising officers from revenue, medical and police departments have been making efforts to track down the returnees. The list of persons who have attended the Jamaat has been obtained from the local Jamaat authority. The task, however, has been rendered difficult as many devotees had gone to the national capital on their own from rural places and do not figure in the records. For example, over 50 of them have been identified as having participated in the religious congregation from Adilabad district, but only a group of 12 were in the records of the Jamaat.

Authorities in Nirmal district also tracked down more than 50 Jamaat returnees so far. All of them have been put in isolation wards in the polytechnic college in the district headquarter town.

Second largest contingent

As many as 80 persons have been identified to have visited Hazrath Nizamuddin in Delhi from the integrated old Nizamabad district and which is the second largest number in the State.

Collector C. Narayana Reddy said that 39 persons who came back from Delhi along with the retired employee who was detected to be COVID-19 positive were shifted to a quarantine centre. Besides, 55 others who came in contact with them after their arrival were also shifted to isolation wards. However, none of them except the retired employee carried coronavirus symptoms, he said.

The Collector said that all the members of their families were kept in isolation wards under the observation of medical and health department. The entire area inhabited by these people has been under surveillance and survey was done with police, revenue and medical and health staff for three days. Therefore, people need not be panicky, he added.

46 identified in Medak

The administrations of Medak, Sangareddy and Siddipet districts have identified as many as 46 persons who attended the religious meeting.

In Sangareddy district, the administration identified 29 persons and brought them to MNR Medical College located at Fasalwadi, the outskirts of the district headquarters.

Collector M. Hanumantha Rao and Additional Collector Veera Reddy and other senior officials visited the hospital and examined the arrangements. The officials were directed to post a police force at the hospital as a precautionary measure.

Some of the identified persons, residing in Sangareddy, Kandi and other areas, have already been brought to the hospital in ambulances on Tuesday afternoon and the process was expected to bring identified persons from Kohir, Zaheerabad and some other places. Samples will be collected from them and will be sent to the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB). The officials have informed that it would take about 24 hours to get results after samples were sent.

On the other hand, the administration has also identified another nine persons who attended similar meetings held at Faziabad and Lucknow between February 10 and March 19. In Siddipet district, five persons were identified and they were shifted for quarantine at Surabhi Medical College.

In Medak district, 14 persons were identified and already put in quarantine about four days ago. Two of them reside in Hyderabad. One person proved positive, while reports of two persons are yet to come. The remaining persons were discharged from Gandhi Hospital where they were sent.

11 quarantined in Karimnagar

Meanwhile, the Commissionerate of Police here had identified all the 11 persons who had attended Markaz prayers and shifted them to quarantine centres in Karimnagar town.

“We have collected the swab samples from the quarantined persons who participated in the prayers. We are also on the job of identifying people who were in direct contact with the 11 persons and would quarantine them very soon,” they police sources stated.

In Vemulawada, police identified four persons and shifted them to quarantine. The police are on the lookout for around 20 persons from Peddapalli town who participated in the prayers in Delhi recently. On the other hand, in Sircilla textile town, the police have started shifting the persons to quarantine, sources stated.

On tenterhooks

The district administration in the erstwhile Warangal district was on tenterhooks after coming to know that scores of Muslims attended a religious meeting at New Delhi and came back silently without submitting themselves to quarantine.

According to Warangal Urban district Collector Rajiv Gandhi Hanumanthu, a total of 32 persons from the district went to New Delhi to attend the religious conference. Of them, 19 were identified and shifted to MGM Hospital for treatment. He made a fervent appeal to the others to identify themselves and come forward.

Mahabubabad district Collector V P Gautham said two persons from the district attended the meeting at Delhi and both were brought to the district hospital in the early hours of Sunday. Also members of seven to eight families with whom they came in contact were put on home quarantine. “A total of six persons are admitted to the hospital on suspicion and no positive case is reported in the district till date,” he explained.

54 from Nalgonda

All the 54 persons, who attended the Markaz prayers, hailing from undivided Nalgonda, are stable and safe, Minister for Energy G. Jagadish Reddy said on Tuesday.

Mr. Reddy said the number, as confirmed to him by officials, was 31 from Nalgonda, 12 from Suryapet and 11 from Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri districts – a total of 54.

According to Yadadri- Bhuvanagiri District Collector Anita Ramachandran, six persons – one from Rajapeta mandal and five persons from Yadagirigutta were transferred to Gandhi Hospital on Sunday. On Monday, more persons from the two mandals and from Bhuvanagiri town were also identified and quarantined.

Police officials in Suryapet were proactive in identifying 12 persons and also geo-tagged their residences last week, on March 27, with inputs from the intelligence wing. Of the 12, one residing in Hyderabad was moved to the facility at Gandhi Hospital, and the rest are at the Imampet isolation centre. They hailed from Arvapally, Suryapet town, Kodad and Mellacheruvu.

In Nalgonda, medical and police officials were seen conducting door-to-door enquiries in the old town on Monday, to gather information and trace more of the 31 persons.

Surveillance intensified

The Bhadradri-Kothagudem district administration has stepped up efforts to trace all those who participated in the Markaz congregation to get them screened for COVID-19.

The move comes close on the heels of the reported death of a few participants due to COVID-19 in various parts of the country on Monday. The authorities have intensified surveillance to identify and quarantine all those who attended the religious event from the district.

As many as ten participants of the religious event have been traced and sent to government quarantine facilities in the district on Tuesday.

In a statement, Collector M V Reddy appealed to people to pass on information if they come across persons who attended the recent religious congregation held in New Delhi, to the 24×7 control room on phone numbers 08744 241950, 9392305104 and 9392307840.

Free medical screening and treatment will be provided, he noted.

335,2020/03/31,Hyderabad’s Furtado’s School of Music uses an app to keep kids in tune during the COVID-19 lockdown,"Dharini Upadhyaya of FSM, Hyderabad, on how learning music helps children calm down and how their app, FSMBuddy, can be of use

Music ranks high on our list when we are looking at ways to cheer ourselves up. While most of us find solace in our playlists, opening up of online music education has given much cheer to music students. Sixteen-year-old Shannon Ryan was worried about missing his guitar classes when the lockdown was announced owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. To his relief though, Furtados School of Music, the centre in Hyderabad where he attends his weekend classes, has announced the launch of online teaching.

Expressing his excitement over taking classes from home, the teenager says it’s just like having his tutor in front of him physically. “The online classes are conducted on one-on-one teaching and we are given assignments too through the app.” However, the online teaching was not without its challenges, says Shashank Murthy, tutor at FSM. He says he felt overwhelmed at the numbers in the beginning. “This was totally new to me and I wondered how I’ll pay attention to each and every student. But eventually everything fell in place and the classes are going on smoothly now.” Through the app, all the tutors at FSM are even assessing their wards’ performance efficiently, informs Shashank.

‘Spirit and enthusiasm’

Says Dharini Upadhyaya, co-founder and co-CEO, Furtado’s School Of Music, “Music helps children calm down during this time. It’s something that directly impacts their spirit and enthusiasm. I have personally seen my son doing his online music class twice a week and feeling completely thrilled and excited.”

Dharini, along with her friend Tanuja Gomes, chucked the corporate job in search of a “more satisfying pursuit.” Their love for music led them to start FSM in July 2011 in Mumbai. “We had a vision to make quality music education accessible to children and individuals, young and old, making the entire learning process fun-filled, joyous and memorable, says Dharini who at present opened 15 centres all over India in locations such as Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Akola and more.

Sharing details about the recently-launched app FSMBuddy, Dharini says, “Online education is growing at a rapid pace, with the growing demands from parents and educators for the convenience it provides. We wanted to make music learning accessible to all and with this started the thought of teaching online. We then decided to not limit it only to music but also for other arts. Thus began the journey of FSMBuddy. This platform will enable teachers to put up their courses and start teaching students across the world. It will help students to interact with not only teachers but also students from other parts of the world which will give them multi-cultural experience.”

The online learning will have fabricated courses and packages for the convenience of individuals and parents. Each of the course pricing is based on a lot of factors like the instrument, grade and type of class, informs Dharini, and adds that the new courses to be launched include other right brain development skills such as book review, storytelling, painting and more.

Are they open to taking new learners who have no background in music? “Absolutely yes! We believe music is for all and enjoying it is as important as learning it. Over these years, we have noticed people with no background in music have outshone others and absolutely enjoy their music journey. We have students from the young and tender age of four years to a lot of teenagers, parents and also grandparents. It is all about having love and passion!”

336,2020/03/31,This Sri Lankan musician stranded in Bengaluru has no choice but to wait out the lockdown,"If you were on Church Street, just before the lockdown came into effect, chances are you would’ve seen Prabu Shyam singing and strumming his guitar on the sidewalk. He’d have been hard to miss with his mirrored shades, shorn pate and bearded dreadlocks the length of his torso.

Prabuddha Shyamal, who goes by Prabu Shyam as an artiste, is the quintessential wandering musician. A certified business accountant with an MBA, he decided to pursue music. “I realised I did not want to be office-bound and work like that for the rest of my life. I wanted to do what I enjoy,” he says, adding, “My aim is to make a record and introduce my style of music to the world. There is a sense of self-satisfaction in playing your own music.”

Hailing from Sri Lanka, Prabu was in Eastern Europe when he decided to heed the call of music and make it his life’s choice. Since then, he has travelled the world, from busking (singing in public for voluntary donations) and accepting invitations to perform. He was also a contestant on the Lithuanian chapter of The Voice in 2017. He arrived in India sometime last year, touring different parts of the country from Ladakh to Goa. Bengaluru was the last leg of his journey and he was supposed to have left last week for Sri Lanka to record his début album.

This self-taught guitarist also plays the bass guitar and percussion instruments such as the cajon and drums. Rock ‘n’ roll, the blues and hip hop are Prabu’s forte as well as classic rock ballads. He lists ‘Summer of 69’, ‘Hallelujah’, ‘Like a Rolling Stone’ and ‘Sweet Child of Mine’ as the go-to songs in his back pocket.

“After all my travelling, I was happy to be finally heading home, but it looks like I have to be in India for a while longer,” says the musician who is now Bengaluru-bound after flights were suspended and airports shut down following the lockdown.

Despite the inconvenience, Prabu is grateful to the manager of the hotel he is staying in, for accommodating him. “They even let me cook a few Sri Lankan dishes there when I feel homesick,” he says, not wanting to name the establishment.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/8nukfb/article31217579.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20200318175323,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/this-rolling-stone-is-gathering-moss/article31217580.ece
337,2020/03/31,Akshay Kumar’s gesture for Nupur Sanon’s ‘Filhall unplugged’,"The actor makes a special appearance in Nupur’s new song, a cover version of her earlier single ‘Filhall’

Budding singer Nupur Sanon’s chemistry with actor Akshay Kumar was palpable in the music video of B Praak’s mellifluous number, ‘Filhall’, which released last year.

Nupur has now come up with an unplugged version of the song, ‘Filhall Unplugged’ and Akshay is once again a part of it. She says the number wouldn’t be the same without him.

Considering the fact that Akshay had shooting commitments and other assignments when the song was filmed, Nupur says she was surprised when she called him up and he readily agreed to make an appearance in the video. “Filhall’ can never be ‘Filhall’ without Akshay sir, and the female version would have been incomplete without his presence. I was shooting for the cover when I called up Akshay sir and requested him to be a part of it in some way,” recalled Nupur, adding, “He agreed even though he was shooting for a film far away. He finished his shoot, came for a few minutes, gave the best shot and took the video to another level!” Nupur is the younger sister of actress Kriti Sanon.

338,2020/03/31,'The Journey Within' is Jayanthi Kumaresh latest composition,"An online state of mind: Jayanthi Kumaresh composes, while Iman Das continues his online music tutorials

Veena artiste Jayanthi Kumaresh was part of the Janatha Curfew Online Festival on March 22, organised by pianist Anil Srinivasan. “Although the lockdown weighs us down, we have to follow government guidelines,” says Jayanthi who has had to cancel many concerts. “My husband, violinist Kumaresh, and I were supposed to play at the Theatre de la Ville in Paris. I was also supposed to be part of the 17-concert tour at the performing art centres in the US. Organised by Zakir Hussain, Kala Ramnath was to join me on violin. Both these tours were cancelled,” says Jayanthi, who has created ‘The Journey Within’, a 12-minute musical rendition of her state of mind.

“Presenting my feelings on the veena is my way of self-expression. It will be released this week on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram. We have to get used to online concerts as the world goes increasingly digital. I am not saying this because Ramanavami festivals are cancelled this year. Musicians need a platform and in today’s scenario, virtual platforms are accessible.”

Jayanthi has earlier been part of many musical web series. With the aim of getting people getting Marghazhi ready before the music season in Chennai, Jayanthi had lessons on what to look for in a Carnatic concert and how to identify ragas.

Music across the world

“Everyone needs melody in life, especially in these distressing times,” says Hindustani vocalist Iman Das, who has trained more than 500 students across the globe. The Bengaluru-based singer was supposed to present a tribute to the ghazal singers of yesteryears in Whitefield. The tribute was cancelled because of the lockdown.

Das, who has been releasing singles and albums online for the last two years, is happy to use the virtual space to “connect with his students worldwide.”

Das has more than 200 students from across the globe including US, UK, Europe, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Dubai and India in his Omkar Music Academy. “We have to be grateful that we are all still singing from home given the grave crisis we are in. All my group classes are being conducted on Google Hangout and Zoom. It is rather amusing to see that people from my neighbourhood and students in Sweden are all now part of my online classes. Many IT professionals, doctors and theatre professionals abroad were apprehensive that the lockdown may cause their classes to be cancelled. I assured them that everything will go on. They were relieved, as they have more time for practice now.”

Das is not alone in giving online classes from home. “My wife, Snigdha Sinha, a Bharatanatya dancer, is also conducting classes through Skype.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/1tpqg3/article31216748.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JayanthiKumaresh-3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/this-is-how-classical-musicians-are-keeping-themselves-busy-virtually/article31216751.ece
339,2020/03/31,Civil defence force a boon for fire dept. in time of crisis,"Volunteers join personnel to supply food and extend help to people

The 900-odd civil defence force (CDF) volunteers under the Fire and Rescue Services Department in Ernakulam have proved to be a boon for the department in helping the needy amid the pandemic threat.

They are working along with the over 450 department personnel in 18 fire stations to ensure that food prepared in community kitchens is handed over to those staying in camps and on the streets.

The CDF was an initiative at training members of the public in disaster mitigation measures, thus making them an effective first line of defence in the event of natural or man-made disasters.

“The volunteers are involved in the distribution of food packets prepared at community kitchens functioning in each panchayat. They are also helping us in providing medicine to the needy,” said Gogy J.S., District Fire Officer.

The formation of the CDF was inspired by the exemplary volunteerism shown by the people of the State during two successive floods. “We had given them training in saving lives, reducing damage to properties and enhancing the morale of people during disasters. Any Indian citizen who has completed the age of 18 years with formal education up to fourth standard can sign up as a CDF volunteer,” said Mr. Gogy.

Those enlisting as volunteers are expected to respond with social commitment and without profit motive and should have the physical attributes to turn up for rescue work during emergencies. The volunteers have been trained in imparting first aid and acting effectively in an emergency situation.

They now travel along with firemen in vehicles owned by the department to the nook and corner of the district to extend help to the needy on a daily basis. Special care is being given to the elderly staying alone and to mentally-challenged persons.

Those in distress can call toll-free number 101; a nearby fire station or the district control — 04840-2205550 — to seek the help of the department.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/civil-defence-force-a-boon-for-fire-dept-in-time-of-crisis/article31221842.ece
340,2020/03/31,Fishers urge govt. to lend helping hand,"Call for help to open ice plants, defer kerosene permits survey

Fish workers have appealed to the government to help open ice plants as well as to defer the survey for deciding on kerosene permits for fishing boats to late April or early May in view of the COVID-19 outbreak.

An appeal to the government by the Swathanthra Matsya Thozhilali Federation said confusion prevailed due to the absence of clear directions on fishing operations and catch of sale in the midst of a nation-wide lockdown.

There were also differences of opinion among fishers regarding the sale of catch, especially as there were no police or fisheries personnel at most of the sales points.

Normal fishing operations have been suspended in the wake of the lockdown. Only some gill net boats with up to seven fishermen and thermocol boats are operating. But, the sale of catch is a problem as there may be crowding. Ensuring the supervision of fisheries and police personnel at non-traditional sales points could help fishers sell their catch by turn. The traditional fish landing centres and harbours have been shut in view of the government-led action to contain the pandemic.

Fishers also appealed to the government to ensure the availability of daily provisions along coastal areas. Most of the shops in coastal areas had run out of supplies, said the Federation spokesperson.

The union of fishers has also said that the time to catch fish farmed in paddy fields along coastal areas should be extended to April 31.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/fishers-urge-govt-to-lend-helping-hand/article31221317.ece

343,2020/03/31,When society abroad showers themwith privileges as token of love,"Health professionals here seek adequate supply of personal protection equipment

Sagitha Joseph, an anaesthesiologist, hardly ever received any appreciation for her work when she used to work at a private hospital in the city.

Then last year, Ms. Joseph, originally from Kakkanad, shifted to Belfast in Northern Ireland where she is now employed as specialist anaesthesiologist with a hospital under the Belfast Trust, which is affiliated to the public-funded healthcare system, the National Health Service.

“Here our work is much appreciated unlike back at home where no one bothered to do that and all credit went to the surgeon. And since the outbreak of Covid-19, the privileges showered on the medical and health workers have reached another level,” she said over phone from Belfast.

They are now given extra pay for the hours beyond the weekly hours they commit and even services like parking, which used to be a paid one before, is now free. Supermarkets replenish their stock and dedicate a full hour during Sundays for health and medical workers.

“People just flood us with snacks like sandwiches and pizzas daily as a token of their love while a store gives us limitless supplies of soaps, shampoos etc. We also enjoy special discounts at restaurants and fuel stations,” said Ms. Joseph overwhelmed by the care shown by society towards health and medical professionals.

Supply of PPE

When this was brought to the notice of a doctor back here, he said, on condition on anonymity, that while clanging utensils and clapping hands were a definite morale booster, authorities must ensure supply of adequate Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and three-layered N-95 masks to medical workers serving on the front line against the pandemic.

“While the government is striving hard to check the epidemic from crossing to the next stage, they should simultaneously make arrangements for stocking enough PPE and N-95 masks so that the health system does not come crashing down if and when the epidemic sneaks into the next stage. Steps should be taken to channelise the supply of masks to the health professionals on a priority basis instead of making it available to the public through medical shops,” he said.

Quarantine

Joseph Chacko, president of the Kerala Government Medical Officers Association, also insisted on the adequate supply of PPE. “Besides, a system should be implemented in hospitals so that at any given time a certain number of doctors, nurses and paramedical staff are going through a 10-day quarantine period reducing the risk of all of them exposing themselves to infection at the same time,” he said.

Insurance

Sujanapal Achuthan, secretary of United Nurses Association, said that while a country like India cannot afford to give the kind of privileges accorded to medical staff by advanced European countries, the insurance coverage of ₹50 lakh declared by the Centre as part of the lockdown package is a great confidence booster. “It is a reassurance to health workers that their families will be taken care of even if something were to happen to them. We all live for our families, don’t we,” he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/when-society-abroad-showers-themwith-privileges-as-token-of-love/article31220378.ece
344,2020/03/31,Biomedical waste disposal not a worry for COVID care centres,"Indian Medical Association Goes Eco-Friendly handling the task

With extremely contagious biomedical waste getting generated at all coronavirus disease (COVID-19) care centres in the State, the Indian Medical Association Goes Eco-Friendly (IMAGE) is reaching out to each such centre to safely dispose of the refuse.

Gloves, masks, incubating tubes, and personal protection equipment make the bulk of the waste besides other materials such as cotton wool and syringes.

With the lockdown in place, the daily collection of biomedical waste from other hospitals has come down by about 25%, according to IMAGE. The government has provided permission for movement of IMAGE vehicles. IMAGE is now collecting 42 to 43 tonnes of biomedical waste daily, which include about 1,200 bags from COVID care centres. Each bag weighs about 4 kgs.

“COVID centre waste is collected in separate vehicles as mixing it with other biomedical waste would create issues in safe disposal,” said Dr. Sharafudheen K.P., secretary, IMAGE -CBWTF (Common Biomedical Waste Treatment Facility). Of the 58 vehicles that are collecting waste from hospitals across the State, eight were exclusively for waste generated at COVID care centres, he said. IMAGE is now collecting waste from 63 COVID care centres in the State.

“The amount of waste depends upon the number of patients in the centres...All biomedical waste from these centres is incinerated,” said Dr. Sharafudheen.

IMAGE is also maintaining a register of employees, vehicle drivers and supervisors who deal with waste from COVID centres and their activities.

IMAGE started collecting waste from COVID centres on March 19. On the first day, 86 barrels of waste were collected from 35 COVID care centres. There were 465 bags in these barrels. On March 27, 1,127 bags from 193 barrels were collected from 55 COVID care centres, while on Sunday, 1,042 bags from 168 barrels were collected from 61 centres.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/biomedical-waste-disposal-not-a-worry-for-covid-care-centres/article31220035.ece
345,2020/03/31,"Dairy, poultry farmers in deep trouble with sales plummeting and feed shortage","Tamil Nadu refused to allow lorries carrying milk from Kerala for conversion in factories in the State following the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

The 21-day lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19 pandemic has turned the world of dairy and poultry farmers upside down with problems ranging from plummeting sales to severe feed shortage hitting them hard.

The Ernakulam Regional Cooperative Milk Producers Union has said it will procure only 2.75 to 2.76 lakh litres of milk everyday from April 3 from farmers in Ernakulam, Kottayam, Idukki, and Thrissur districts.

The action follows the steep fall in sales. John Theruvath, president, said the apex cooperative had no other choice but to curtail procurement to cut losses. “It will be financially unviable to procure more than the quantity we have decided upon,” he said on Tuesday.

The Milma’s Ernakulam region used to sell around 3.5 lakh litres of milk a day on a local procurement of around 2.75 lakh litres. The deficit being sourced from the Malabar region as well as from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. However, the situation has turned on its head. Now the procurement is around 3.5 lakh litres and sale is around 2.75 lakh litres per day. The excess milk comes from farmers who have been selling their produce in the unorganised sector during the normal times.

The situation has been compounded after Tamil Nadu refused to allow lorries carrying milk from Kerala for conversion in factories in the State following the spread of the pandemic. Excess milk used to be turned into skimmed powder in Tamil Nadu factories in the past. However, a consignment of 70,000 litres has not been allowed into Tamil Nadu now.

Dairy Department sources said that Milma might even consider stopping all procurement or drastically cutting milk procurements in view of the situation.

Cutting procurement is the only way to curb losses. Milma is already in a bad financial position with the fall in sales, Mr. John said.

However, online sale of milk has boomed. There was order 3,000 litres of milk online on Monday. The orders are expected to go up in the coming days, Mr. John added.

Poultry scene

Poultry farming in the State has plunged into a crisis this week with bird aggregators from Tamil Nadu “disappearing” altogether from the State and feed supply drying up, said Baiju Kadavan, president of the Kerala Poultry Farmers Association, here on Tuesday.

He said there are around two lakh poultry farmers, who run small farms with 2,000 to 5,000 birds. They source their chicks, feed, medicines and expertise from Tamil Nadu entrepreneurs, who buy back the birds for ₹7 a kg. However, with feed supply drying up for a fortnight now, the aggregators have gone missing totally. The other poultry farmers too are in trouble because of the feed shortage, said Mr. Baiju

With the farmers in distress, chicken price came down to ₹45 a kg on Tuesday. The problems associated with bird flu in some of the northern districts had added to the speed of the price fall, he added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/dtcpii/article31223924.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01KIMILK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/dairy-poultry-farmers-in-deep-trouble/article31219804.ece
346,2020/03/31,Lockdown brings ‘culinary experts’ back to kitchen,"Collector urges them to be careful with supplies

On Wednesday, Narendar Ananda Bhat simply took over the kitchen for a day, and his wife Gayathri was quite happy to play second fiddle.

Having cooked for more than five years during his bachelor stint in Singapore and Dubai, Narendar, a young private company executive residing at Elamakkara, was testing his culinary skills after a long break.

“It was nothing fancy, just macroni and soya chunks roast with chapathi. It came out good. My wife loves my cooking,” he said with considerable pride.

Forced indoors with long hours of boredom staring at them, many are rediscovering their long forgotten hobbies, and cooking has emerged as their favourite.

Dinesh Venkateswaran, another youngster who recently quit his job in Bengaluru and came back to his home at Maradu, also turned to cooking amid breaks between binge watching of films and web series. “The fish curry I tried turned out real yummy. I have been cooking on and off during my stay in Bengaluru,” he said.

The district administration, however, seems to be worried about the strain such mass return of part-time culinary experts may have on the limited resources at a time of prolonged lockdown. So, on Wednesday night, District Collector S. Suhas came up with a timely reminder for all those “planning to experiment on their culinary skills” on his official Facebook page.

“Please use limited ingredients. Please don’t waste food. It may lead to an artificial scarcity in the grocery stores. Choose wisely between luxuries and necessities. And, it is even dangerous to exhaust your supplies and keep venturing out of the house frequently and visiting the grocery stores,” said the Collector before concluding the post, reminding how crucial it is to embrace austerity in place of extravagance during these trying times.

The post has since then gone viral and is being widely shared over social media platforms. When the post was brought to his notice, Dinesh admitted that experimenting in the kitchen at such a time may not be a good idea. “So, respecting the request of the Collector, let me do with just gruel for a day,” he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/lockdown-brings-culinary-experts-back-to-kitchen/article31219559.ece

Many in distress have been calling health experts to seek solutions.

Most of them have lower back pain, tail bone pain, neck pain with stiffness, cramps, knee pain and even vertigo,” said Tiji Mathew Thomas, a city-based physiotherapist.

“Most of the pain is caused by bad posture. Those working with laptops should keep the upper one-third of the monitor at eye level and use a separate keyboard and mouse at their forearm level, like when they are using a desktop. Sit with the back leaning against the chair back and the curve over the lower back supported on a rolled towel or cushion, with ears at the level of shoulders,” he said.

N.S.D Raju, senior ophthalmologist, advised people working from home to reduce the brightness of the screen. “The eyes get strained as we stare at the digital display of mobile phones, television and computer screens for long. Always read or watch in a well-lit room. Focusing on a distant outdoor object through the window helps relax the iris muscles. Ensure that you get adequate sleep of at least eight hours,” he said.

Pulmonologist Zone Xavier Thaliath suggested doing breathing exercises to maintain the vital capacity of lungs and to ensure good oxygen levels. “Those already on medication for various ailments should continue taking the medicines. Physical activities like walking will help in managing stress. Proper hydration should also be ensured,” he said.

Mr. Thomas had a word of caution to those glued to the television for extended hours. “Sit in front with knees bent and feet on the floor. Never watch television with the neck rotated to one side. Do not sit with the tail bone taking the full load and legs crossed and stretched forward. Instead, the thigh or the back of the knee should be supported. Otherwise, the knees will hang and this strains the ligaments and structures over the back of the knee,” he said.

Experts warned against reading and using laptop in bed with two or more pillows stacked over. If you are sleeping on the sides, the pillow should have enough height to keep the neck in line with the spine, they said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ensuring-that-work-from-home-is-pain-free/article31219554.ece

351,2020/03/31,"For many, lockdown a welcome break","Families find time to bond, some take to a minimalist lifestyle

Dancer Gayathri Muraleedharan says she now wakes up to the chirping of birds. It is something that she would like to do even when the lockdown days are over. But, her house at Chalappuram in Kozhikode is along the roadside and it is the loud noises of vehicles that are likely to greet her after the 21-day period.

The lockdown has taught many people to acknowledge the finer aspects of life and value many things that they tended to neglect in the mad rush of daily life. “I just learnt that my daughter could draw. We never encouraged her to try it in the past,” says homemaker Lahana Sarath.

For jeweller Dayanand, the lockdown has been an opportunity for “system refresh”, which, he says, should be done at least once a fortnight every year. “I now understand myself better,” says he.

For families in which both partners are working, the lockdown has come as an opportunity for family bonding. “We are usually never home during the day. Now, we sit together and talk for hours and share household work. This time together was much needed,” says Kunhu Fazal, an entrepreneur.

At many homes, under the careful watch of elders, children are getting valuable life lessons. “Earlier, I had to run after my kids to sit down and eat. Nowadays, they are at the table on their own, at the right time,” says Reena A.K., a homemaker.

People are also undergoing some major lifestyle changes due to the lockdown, the prominent of which is minimalism. “We have learnt to use our resources carefully, especially in the kitchen, be it cooking oil or cooking gas,” says Ms.Muraleedharan. Many say minimalism could also help in cutting costs, in view of the uncertain days ahead. There are others who feel that they are on a healthier diet these days, with junk food out of the way.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/for-many-lockdown-a-welcome-break/article31221407.ece
352,2020/03/31,Auctioning resumes at Vengeri market,"Farmers in Kozhikode and Malappuram who are facing a double whammy of sorts following the outbreak of the H1N1 flu earlier and the 21-day lockdown to prevent the COVID-19 spread, got a relief on Monday with the Department of Agriculture resuming the auctioning at the Agricultural Urban Wholesale Market at Vengeri.

However, fewer than a dozen farmers reached the auction centre amid tight norms that were in place as part of the precautionary measures against the infectious disease. Horticorp and a few traders in Kozhikode participated in the auctioning, Narayanan Kalpakassery, chairman of Sangha Maithri, an apex body of farmers’ clubs in Kozhikode, said.

Mr. Kalpakassery said that these fresh vegetable collected by Horticorp was sold at reasonable rates to customers at the stalls. “Farmers have got a fair price for their produce. They had been informed via SMS and WhatsApp messages about the auction. The auction will again be held on Thursday,” he said.

Regarding complaints on the non-payment of dues such as transportation subsidy, he said that the farmers had been asked to submit details such as certificates from the Krishi Bhavan.

Mohammed Haji, a farmer of Karassery grama panchayat, said that many farmers depending on the bi-weekly auctions at Vengeri, had not received payment for the transpiration allowance for the past one year.

Around 200 farmers have registered with the Vengeri market till now.

354,2020/03/31,Toiling hard on streets with immense satisfaction,"Residents are moved by sanitary workers’ laudable dedication

TIRUNELVELI

No one is watching them even from a distance. But the sanitary workers, sporting masks and gloves, clean the garbage scattered everywhere along the almost deserted roads of Drivers’ Colony in NGO Colony. While a male sanitary worker with the long garden broom gathers garbage strewn all around, two female workers collect the degradable and the non-degradable waste in separate bins kept in a battery-operated garbage vehicle.

“Vanakkm Amma... Romba nandri amma,”... the greetings from Drivers’ Colony Residents’ Welfare Association president Nallaperumal diverts the sanitary workers’ attention from collecting the garbage and they reciprocate it with folded hands and broad smile. And their work continues even as everyone is behind doors of this middle class residential area as COVID -19 scare is everywhere.

The sanitary workers, drawing paltry daily wages, start their work at 6 a.m. sharp and the work continues until the target given for them for the day is achieved. Besides cleaning the garbage, the sanitary workers desilt the drainage channels, sprinkle bleaching powder along these desilted drainage channels, spray disinfectants around the wet nauseating silt and their colleagues remove this silt in the lorries once it dries-up.

The cash-starved and short-staffed Corporation has deployed 1,077 sanitary workers in Tirunelveli, Thatchanallur, Palayamkottai and Melapalayam Zones to carry-out the cleaning operations in the wake of the dreaded pandemic threat. Their laudable work attracts everyone’s attention as they, without anything from anyone, concentrate on their work. Since there is no roadside teashop, they have to wait for the arrival of a vendor without stopping their work.

Apart from this routine work, sanitary workers in small groups are taken for cleaning operation and putting lime powder circles in the temporary vegetable markets created with 479 shops to ensure ‘personal distancing’ to avert community transmission of SARS –CoV- 2 virus.

Moreover, the sanitary workers deployed along the streets housing the individuals under home quarantine have to spray disinfectants thrice a day besides the regular work of keeping these areas clean. The increased arrival of the homeless and the labourers to the ‘Amma Unavagam’ has burdened them with more work.

Most of their families have three children and most of them are studying in the schools. “We’ve told them not to come out of our houses as COVID – 19 threat is everywhere,” the women sanitary workers say even as their work continues.

Though most of these workers are entangled in debt and their borrowings from the local moneylenders continue, there is no sign of worries on their face as they draw immense satisfaction from their work.

“This is the job that feeds us and our families... We should do it with utmost dedication and do it as we do usually even as pandemic threat looms large everywhere now,” the sanitary workers say while leaving the Drivers’ Colony area with the collected garbage even as no one is monitoring them.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/owbrg9/article31221472.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01MASanitary-worker,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/toiling-hard-on-streets-with-immense-satisfaction/article31221473.ece

As 23 persons from Tirunelveli, mostly from Melapalayam in Palayamkottai, have been tested positive for COVID – 19, Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish has asked Police Commissioner Deepak M. Damor to ensure complete isolation of Melapalayam from rest of the city till April 14.

In a communication to the Police Commissioner, Ms. Shilpa said all roads leading to Melapalayam should be closed for vehicular traffic and entry of people to avert possible infection of the virus as a large number of people from abroad and other States had returned to Melapalayam. The residents of Melapalayam should remain indoors.

Since arrangements had been made to ensure the sale of essential commodities and vegetables in all street-corners, unnecessary movement of the public in Melapalayam should be completely checked.

Moreover, personal distancing in the points where vegetables and essential commodities are sold should be ensured. While movement of all vehicles inside Melapalayam should be strictly prohibited, one person from each family can be allowed to buy the vegetables and the essential commodities.

Those who come out of their houses to go to hospitals should be allowed to go only with medical records and separate registers maintained to record their return from the hospital, Ms. Shilpa said.

The Collector, while asking the Police Commissioner to deploy police personnel in adequate numbers in all check-posts to be erected around Melapalayam, did not mention in the communication that these actions are being taken after 17 persons from Melapalayam have been tested positive for COVID – 19 on their return from a religious conference in Delhi.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/covid-19-positive-cases-melapalayam-isolated/article31221258.ece

Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish has formed three teams to monitor the sale of fruits and vegetables at the right price, uninterrupted supply of food, medicine and other essential commodities for the aged and the physically challenged and food and shelter for the neglected and homeless people.

n a review meeting held at the Collectorate on Tuesday, Ms. Shilpa formed the three teams, each headed by a gazetted officer.

Ms. Shilpa said the district administration had created temporary vegetable markets in several places to avoid crowding and to ensure personal distancing to avert possible viral infections in the wake of COVID – 19 threat. Though officials attached to the Department of Agriculture had been deployed in these places to monitor the prices of the vegetables and fruits, the public can still have one more mechanism to redress their grievances, if any, in connection with the price of these farm produce.

Similarly, an officer had been entrusted with the job of ensuring proper serving of food and shelter to the homeless neglected persons while the third team will take care of the uninterrupted supply of food, medicines and essential commodities to the senior citizens and the physically challenged.

Backward Class and Minorities Welfare Officer (for complaints pertaining to price of fruits and vegetables) – 0462 – 2500141 / 2501141.

Adi Dravida and Tribal Welfare Officer (for food and shelter for the neglected) – 0462 – 2501074 / 2501076.

District Social Welfare and District Differently-Abled Welfare Officer (for supply of food, medicines and essential commodities for senior citizens and the physically challenged) – 0462 – 2501034.

“If there is any problem in these domains, the officials concerned may be contacted to get their grievances redressed,” Ms. Shilpa said.

Meanwhile, the public want to have more vegetable shops to avoid crowding in the existing temporary shops. Since the middle and the upper middle class population of NGO ‘A’ ‘B’ ‘C’ and New Colonies, Drivers’ Colony, Udhaya Nagar, Thirunagar, Mahizhchi Nagar, Thirumal Nagar, Thamizh Nagar, Canara Bank Colony, Azhagar Nagar, Teachers’ Colony, Perumalpuram, State Bank Colony, housing more than 5,000 families, have to go to the already heavily crowded ‘Uzhavar Sandhai’ either at Melapalayam or Maharaja Nagar, a new vegetable market may be opened on a sprawling 4 acres of land near NGO Colony Periyakulam, now being used by the boys for playing cricket.

“When NGO Colony was developed, the 4 acres of land was earmarked for constructing a cinema theatre, which is still lying vacant. Hence, this sprawling space may be used for creating a vegetable market, which will drastically reduce crowding in the farmers’ markets at Melapalayam and Maharaja Nagar to ensure personal distancing,” suggests Nallaperumal, secretary, Confederation of Residents’ Welfare Associations of Ward 27.

He also said similar measures could be put in place in the areas where there was need.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/teams-formed-to-care-for-neglected-physically-challenged-senior-citizens/article31220636.ece

Despite having a higher population than Italy, Tamil Nadu had a far less number of COVID-19-infected people, thanks to the right action taken at the right time by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, said Dairy Development Minister K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji.

Reviewing the COVID-19 preventive measures being taken at a few local bodies here on Tuesday, Mr. Bhalaji said that precautionary measures were being taken on a war footing. “The CM has been working hard day and night to contain the spread of the viral infection with a view to safeguarding the people of Tamil Nadu and migrant workers in the State,” he said.

Italy had over one lakh people infected with COVID-19, whereas Tamil Nadu had only 67 persons infected so far, he added.

Mr. Palaniswami had declared a lockdown in the State even before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the curfew across the country, he added.

The effective steps taken by the officials of various departments had contained the spread of the virus with the death of only one person, who had contacts with those from other countries, he said.

Mr. Bhalaji asked officials to continue closely monitoring disinfecting activities taken up across the district. Community kitchens were catering to the aged, differently abled, mentally retarded and homeless people as well as those living below poverty line, he added.

Virudhunagar Collector R. Kannan said that bags of 22 essential grocery items were being door-delivered to the people. He said that the grocery items were grown in rain-fed regions without using chemical fertilizers.

363,2020/03/31,‘Students must schedule their day meaningfully to avoid anxiety’,"Mental health experts suggest various measures that can be adopted by the youth community during the 21-day lockdown

The current spread of COVID-19 pandemic across the country has affected the psychological and mental well-being of different age groups.

With disruption in their everyday routine and lifestyle, children and adolescents are among the most vulnerable groups who are also influenced by their parents’ anxiety, stress and change in lifestyle.

However, following a well-planned schedule and keeping themselves engaged with different activities throughout the day can reduce anxiety among them, say mental health professionals.

The experts also point out that the 21-day lockdown can be a golden period for families to spend quality time with each other .

C. Ramasubramanian, a senior psychiatrist and founder of M.S. Chellamuthu Trust and Research Foundation, says that a section of students are regularly consuming more content on COVID-19 through various social media platforms, thus leading to unnecessary panic and anxiety.

“Ultimately it will lead to depression. To overcome this, some children might resort to consumption of banned tobacco products,” he warns.

To overcome this, students must prepare a meaningful schedule. They must exercise regularly; spend time with their family members, and unwind themselves with hobbies such as reading books, listening to music and gardening.

Lack of clarity over the schedule in conduct of Class 10 State Board examinations has also created anxiety among students appearing for them.

However, a positive attitude is essential as students can utilise the period effectively and excel in their examinations, says S. Selvamani, project head of Happy Schooling programme, an initiative implemented in Madurai Corporation schools aimed at promoting emotional well-being of students.

“Students must see this as a period where they can analyse themselves and explore the career choices that they would like to pursue in the future,” he says.

Net addiction

Lakshmi Vijayakumar, psychiatrist and founder of SNEHA, says prolonged use of electronic gadgets and addiction to social media is also discouraged.

“They can rather use social media platforms to do group yoga or exercise. They can also use the time to learn new skills and help in household chores,” according to her.

Mr. Selvamani says that this time can be seen as an opportunity for parents and their children to understand the needs of each other.

Dr. Ramasubramanian says that children and their parents must stay indoors as part of the lockdown. “They must be confident that everyone can stay united and overcome the pandemic successfully.”",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/students-must-schedule-their-day-meaningfully-to-avoid-anxiety/article31220011.ece

Since only three persons had been in the isolation ward till Monday and one youth from Samooharengapuram, who tested positive for COVID – 19, is undergoing medication in the ‘treatment ward’, there was a little relief among the residents here as they console themselves with the thought that penetration of the pandemic in one of the hottest districts of Tamil Nadu is less.

When the social media were abuzz on Tuesday with the information that 23 persons had been admitted to the TVMCH’s isolation ward, most of the residents here lost their peace. Besides making calls frantically to the journalists to confirm the panicky news that they have received, they also wanted to know if they had tested positive for COVID – 19.

Of the 24 persons, 17 are from Melapalayam, 3 from Pettai, 2 from Valliyoor, 1 each from Kalakkad and Seythunganallur near Palayamkottai in Thoothoukudi district.

Sources in the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital here said 23 of the 24 persons, who attended the Tablighi Jamaat conference in Delhi, had COVID – 23 symptoms and had been admitted to the isolation ward.

“We’ve lifted samples from these cases and we, at this stage, cannot say anything on this issue. We’ve to crosscheck the results we got at TVMCH with the results with a Pune-based lab,” a senior doctor of TVMCH said without saying anything concrete about the outcome of the clinical investigations done here.

Another senior doctor of TVMCH said the samples would usually be sent for crosschecking only when the patients test positive for a viral infection.

“Since the samples of these 23 patients have been sent to Pune for crosschecking or confirmation, one can infer that they might be COVID – 19 positive as per the results of TVMCH,” he explained.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/sudden-spurt-in-admission-to-isolation-ward-panics-people/article31219956.ece
365,2020/03/31,‘More number of mobile vegetable markets planned’,"Move is to prevent residents from stepping out of their homes: Collector

Ramanathapuram

Collector K Veera Raghava Rao has announced that the district administration would start operating more number of mobile vegetable markets here on Tuesday.

Speaking to reporters after the launch of three vehicles carrying vegetables to sell them door-to-door to residents, he said that the objective was to prevent residents from stepping out of their homes in such times, when the COVID-19 virus was threatening the mankind across the globe.

The Tamil Nadu government had announced a number of people-friendly measures so that the virus chain can be broken and distanced. Moreover, the idea of personal distancing in public places was to ensure that the community spread was contained. The ideal move would be to stay indoors for the next 15 to 21 days unless there were any emergencies, the Collector suggested and commended the work of the doctors, para-medical teams, revenue and police officers and among others in preventing and fighting the COVID-19 in the district.

The district administration had opened up three make shift markets - at Raja School Grounds, New Bus Stand and at Pattinamkaathan respectively., where vendors would sell vegetables, fruits and flowers. The officers were in the process of identifying bigger and spacious locations in the district where in similar make shift markets can be opened, where the mandatory social distancing would also be possible.

With the cooperation and able diagnosis at the Government Hospital, the district had so far not reported any positive cases of COVID-19. At the same time, all the foreign returnees were kept under strict surveillance, Mr. Rao said and added that the officers who attended the review meeting at the Collectorate, were told to disseminate about the COVID-19 to the people and ensure that there was no panic.

The police for their part, made consistent appeals to the motorists not to venture out on their two-wheelers and cars. Unless there was any emergency, or the people had to attend to any essential services, they should stay indoors.

The political representatives including MP Nawaz Kani, MLA and former Minister Manikandan and others jointly appealed to the people to cooperate with the officials in fighting the COVID-19.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/dl3aqa/article31219507.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA01RMD-COLLECTOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/more-number-of-mobile-vegetable-markets-planned/article31219508.ece
366,2020/03/31,Challenging times for these people,"Lack of stable income and access to food supply in a time of pandemic has deeply impacted physically challenged couples like M. Jeyaraman and J. Santhi.

The couple rue their inability to provide two square meals a day to their two children. “We are borrowing heavily and apprehensive about how long it will take for us to recover. Also, we are unable to buy and stock up because of our condition. Had we been notified in advance, we could have taken steps to buy adequate basic provisions,” Mr. Jeyaraman says.

R. Mariammal, member, Tamil Nadu Crawling Differently Abled Persons Federation, says the State government has deprived them of all dignity. “We usually earn a living by selling small plastic toys or writing petitions outside the Collectorate. Now, many have taken to begging. It is the only way to get food on the plate and, unfortunately, there are not enough passersby to even throw some change at us.”

Although Amma Canteens are open and free food is supplied, only a few have access to them. “Those who are able to stand in queues end up buying in bulk quantities. Since we crawl, it takes us a long time. People are merciless now since they too need to care of their families, Jeyaraman points out.

K. Nagabaskar, another physically challenged person, says though the Corporation has provided phone numbers for home delivery of groceries, they are never reachable. “When I finally connected with someone, I was told that my house was far away and delivery was not possible.”

A delivery executive with an app, he does not have enough money to fill petrol for his two-wheeler for the day-long work. Things look dire and the next two weeks will be a personal disaster, he says. He expects the recovery to be tough.

S. Raja, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Crawling Differently Abled Persons Federation, wants the State government to ensure that the physically challenged are seen and heard by authorities. “We should be provided with additional income so that we can sustain ourselves. We should not have to resort to begging again as many of us have made huge efforts to come out of it.”

He adds that ration shops must deliver additional essential commodities to their homes.

Collector T. G. Vinay says administrative staff, particularly Tahsildars, have been asked to ensure that differently abled persons in each block are identified and cared for.

Since many of them have complained about lack of intervention from authorities, he promises to look into the matter.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/challenging-times-for-these-people/article31219365.ece

Ola on Tuesday announced a scheme to provide interest-free loans to drivers on its platforms to address the immediate liquidity crisis faced by drivers across the country.

Drivers of cabs have been hard hit under the COVID-19 lockdown with many not having funds to make ends meet.

This scheme, called Sahyog, is available for all drivers of all categories including Ola Auto, Ola Rentals and Outstation and will be distributed using the microfinance lending platform, Avail Finance.

The loan will aim to supplant the incomes of thousands of driver-partners who haven’t had a steady source of income due to the ongoing pandemic. All eligible drivers will be able to access loan amounts of up to ₹1200 per week, disbursed over the course of three weeks.

Drivers can use the credit amount to pay for their planned household expenses or repayments. The credit shall be set off against earnings on the platform over a period upon return of normalcy in business.

Speaking on the initiative, Anand Subramanian, Spokesperson and Head of Communications, Ola, said, “The financial well-being of our driver-partners and their families in these challenging times is of prime importance to us. There is an immediate need for access to instant cash to pay for household expenses which they are unable to foot, given the loss of income due to the ongoing lockdown.

“Sahyog enables them to access micro-credit instantly, in their registered bank accounts, allowing drivers and their families to tide through these difficult times with much needed liquidity. We are committed to doing everything we can to reduce the economic burden and safeguard the interests of our driver-partners and their families through these unprecedented times.”

379,2020/03/31,"COVID-19 | Petronet LNG, Bharti Enterprises, Hero Group announce ₹100 crore each","Contributions will be made to PM CARES Fund as well as other relief efforts

Petronet LNG, Bharti Enterprises and Hero Group have separately committed ₹100 crore each to support efforts to combat COVID-19 in the country.

While Petronet LNG said that the entire sum of ₹100 crore will be contributed to the newly created PM CARES Fund, Bharti Enterprises and Hero Group will be putting a part of contribution in the fund and part of it will be spent on other relief efforts.

“Bharti Enterprises and its companies Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel and others are contributing a sum of over ₹100 crore for India’s fight against COVID-19… A significant portion of the corpus will be immediately contributed to the PM CARES Fund,” the company said in a statement. It added that the balance amount will be directed towards sourcing masks, PPE and other key equipment for the doctors, healthcare workers and essential services personnel.

Over a million N-95 masks are being procured and will be made available on an immediate basis, it said. In addition to this, the employees of Bharti Enterprises will also make personal voluntary contributions towards this cause through a platform set up by the company. The group companies will match the amount contributed by their employees, and the same will be contributed towards the COVID-19 initiatives.

Similarly, the Hero Group said that of the total amount pledged for the ongoing COVID-19 relief-efforts in India, half (₹50 crore) will be contributed to the PM CARES Fund and the remaining half will be spent on other relief efforts.

The Hero Group (BML Munjal family) companies contributing to this fund include Hero MotoCorp, Hero FinCorp, Hero Future Energies, Rockman Industries and Hero Electronix. Hero Enterprise and AG Industries have also contributed to this fund, the company said.

Besides, the BML Munjal University has offered its 2000-bed hostel for use as an isolation and treatment ward by the local health department.

380,2020/03/31,"Indian refiners hit by lockdowns, oil price war, and a faltering global petro-order","Apart from the meltdown in demand, the oil glut in the market is unveiling another major problem — that of storing excess crude.

The steep fall in domestic energy demand driven by the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted India’s oil refining sector amid an oil price war and a severely stressed global petro-order.

Reuters had earlier reported that Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the refining heavyweight, and Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd. (MRPL), have served force majeure notices to their Middle Eastern crude suppliers, citing the Coronavirus epidemic — a Black Swan event. Force majeure notices are built into contracts, which relieve companies from making payments due to unforeseen calamities such as wars and natural disasters.

According to Reuters, IOC, which owns about a third of the country’s 5 million barrels per day (bpd) refining capacity, has sent a force majeure notice to most Middle Eastern suppliers. MRPL has already shuttered a third of its 300,000 bpd refining capacity.

Problem of plenty

Energy demand in India has plummeted as lockdowns, enforced to contain the spread of COVID-19 infections, have derailed the economy — they have included grounding of flights, and brought vehicular transportation to a standstill.

The stress in India’s refining sector follows extreme turbulence in the global energy eco-system. On Monday, U.S. oil briefly plummeted to less than $20 a barrel, breaching a major psychological marker. Apart from the meltdown in demand, the oil glut in the market is unveiling another major problem — that of storing excess crude. Freight rates of supertankers, which can store and transport large volumes of oil, are climbing as traders scramble to secure them for storage.

The problem of plenty is also driven by a savage price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia, the leader of the oil cartel Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and Russia, failed to agree on production cuts to shore up oil prices which were already in free fall due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In retaliation, the Saudis declared that they would ramp up production of cheap oil to grab shrinking market share — a move that Russians said they would mirror. Oil prices plummeted to $33 a barrel following the Riyadh-Moscow feud. That, in turn, badly hit the United States, whose shale oil producers need a much higher price to make their relatively high cost production sustainable.

Amid the turbulence in the energy sector, a riveting back story is also unfolding, pitting three major players against one another — Saudi Arabia, Russia and the U.S., which is currently the world’s largest daily producer and has, in the last decade, brought into the market its previously inaccessible shale oil.

Centrestage

Unsurprisingly, oil diplomacy triggered by COVID-19 is now reaching centrestage, with Washington reaching out to Saudi Arabia — its trusted postwar ally — to possibly define an exclusive bilateral arrangement, outside the OPEC, to put to floor under energy prices that are in free fall. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the U.S. Energy Department officials were trying to convince the Trump administration to exhort Saudi Arabia to quit the OPEC, and, instead, work with the United States to stabilise prices. On March 23, Bloomberg Television quoted U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette as saying that an oil alliance with Riyadh was one of “many, many ideas” being aired by U.S. policymakers.

The shale oil lobby in the U.S. is apparently also pushing the administration to lock Saudi Arabia in heightened energy diplomacy. In a letter to Keith Krach, the Undersecretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment, Congressman Michael McCaul said: “We cannot... allow our industries to become the victim of someone else’s price war, so I ask you to continue utilising every tool at your disposal to press Saudi Arabia and Russia to cut production.”

Russia signals

Amid the U.S.-Saudi Arabia diplomatic tango, Russia is signaling that it may now be ready to consider a new production arrangement with OPEC and other countries as part of OPEC+. “We are in contact with Saudi Arabia and a number of other countries. Based on these contacts we see that if the number of OPEC+ members will increase and other countries will join there is a possibility of a joint agreement to balance oil markets,” said Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, in an interview with Reuters.

Separately, Daniel Yergin, an energy historian said in an article in The Washington Post on March 25 that the G-20 countries, comprising both producers and consumers, should play a leading role in ensuring global energy security. “That would permit a discussion going beyond the present Russia-Saudi impasse, bringing in the United States and a larger group of producers and consumers, including Brazil, China, France,” and others, Mr. Yergin observed.

On Monday, the wheels of diplomacy were turning rapidly, with U.S. President Donald Trump declaring that he would be speaking to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, to discuss the Saudi-Russian price war. “Right after this call, I am speaking to a gentleman named Vladimir Putin,” Mr. Trump said on Fox and Friends. He stressed that the two will be talking about energy “among other things”, pointing out that Russia and Saudi Arabia “both went crazy” about oil, according to a CNN report.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/r0i55o/article31211603.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th25-bmppy-oil-GGP5PG1NU3jpgjpg-30march,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/indian-refiners-hit-by-lockdowns-oil-price-war-and-a-faltering-global-petro-order/article31211586.ece
381,2020/03/31,"U.S. crude off lows as Trump, Putin agree for energy talks","Oil markets faced double whammy in COVID-19 outbreak and Saudi-Russian race for market share

Oil prices steadied on Tuesday with the U.S. crude benchmark climbing off 18-year lows after U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin agreed to talks on stabilising energy markets.

However, the gains were capped as global demand continues to be slammed by travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

May Brent crude futures was 4 cents lower at $22.72 a barrel by 8.35 p.m. ISTafter closing on Monday at $22.76, its lowest finish since November 2002.

It hit a session-high of $23.87. The more-active June contract traded 18 cents lower at $26.24 a barrel. U.S. crude was up 55 cents at $20.64 after settling in the previous session at $20.09, its lowest since February 2002. It traded as high as $21.89 a barrel earlier in the session.

Oil markets have faced a double whammy from the COVID-19 outbreak and a race to win market share between Saudi Arabia and Russia after OPEC and other producers failed this month to agree on deeper supply cuts to support oil prices.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin agreed in a phone call to have their top energy officials discuss stabilising oil markets, the Kremlin said.

Although the futures market is seeing a recovery, physical cargoes are selling in some regions at single digits, with sellers offering hefty discounts. With a plunge in prices that has knocked about 60% off oil prices this year, a commissioner with the Texas State energy regulator renewed a call for restrictions on crude production because of a national supply glut.

However, U.S. crude producers are likely facing cuts in April anyway as there are no buyers in physical markets for crude in the Permian, the biggest shale basin the country, or the U.S. Gulf Coast, said Scott Shelton, energy specialist at United ICAP.

“It's just a matter of time before we see the producers be forced by the crude gatherers to cut as one cannot 'gather' crude when there are no buyers or tanks to store it in,” he said.

In a sign of how well the market is supplied, the front-month Brent futures contract for May is trading at a discount of $13.95 a barrel to the November contract, the widest contango spread ever seen, ahead of the May contract's expiry.

A contango market implies traders expect oil to be higher in the future, encouraging them to store oil now to sell later.

Saudi Arabia, de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), plans to boost its oil exports to 10.6 million barrels per day (bpd) from May on lower domestic consumption, a Saudi Energy Ministry official said.

Global oil refiners, meanwhile, have cut their throughput because of the slump in demand for transportation fuel, with European refineries reducing output by at least 1.3 million bpd, sources told Reuters.

Exxon Mobil Corp closed a small crude distillation unit at its 502,500 bpd Baton Rouge refinery in Louisiana because of low demand, sources said.

The chief economist for global commodities trader Trafigura said that oil demand could fall in the coming weeks by as much as 30% from consumption at the end of last year.

385,2020/03/31,Testing for COVID-19 in India,"India needs to develop the capability to mass-produce kits

Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based tests are recommended as diagnostic tests for COVID-19. The test detects the presence of viral RNA in human samples. PCR is a process where a few copies of DNA are amplified to produce millions of copies. In addition to human samples, the test needs primers, probes, enzymes, nucleotides, enzyme cofactors, and buffer solution. Primers and probes are short stretches of DNA, specific and complementary to regions of the viral genome or target region. Unlike primers, probes are labeled with fluorescent molecules that bind the target region in between where the forward and reverse primers bind. The test uses two primers (forward and reverse) and one probe against each target region of the viral genome. The WHO recommends using at least two target regions for the diagnostic detection of the virus. In the test, first, the viral RNA is converted to DNA. The DNA is then amplified with the help of enzymes, primers, and probes. Each step of the test uses multiple cycles of target melting, primer binding, extension, and probe dissociation. The steps are repeated for 15-40 cycles to produce millions of copies of the viral target DNA, each with its fluorescent signal, which is read by an instrument.

For accurate results

Although RT-PCR tests are quantitative, sensitive, and specific, assay and quality-control measures are essential to get consistent and accurate results. A positive control verifies that the assay is running as intended and identifies authentic negative samples. An internal control checks the process of RNA extraction from the nasal or throat swab and identifies sample-to-sample variation. A negative extraction control verifies the absence of cross-contamination during RNA extraction and RT-PCR reaction set up. Additionally, no amplification control and no template/ negative control are essential in the RT-PCR set up to reduce erroneous test results. Labs around the world are using primers and probes against different SARS-CoV-2 genes/regions in their assays successfully.

The main difference between tests done in a research lab and a diagnostic lab is that the results from the latter are used for clinical decision-making. Therefore, the diagnostic labs need to be certified and follow the standard operating procedures (SOP), maintain directionality of sample flow, and make sure that the lab personnel are properly trained. Also, all diagnostic labs need to maintain documentation on all tests and reporting. RT-PCR results can vary from lab to lab due to many variables. Hence, regulatory agencies mandate the use of SOP, specific lot numbers of reagents and instruments, and software to run diagnostic tests.

Challenge for India

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has approved 176 labs, including 47 private labs, to conduct the tests. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 20 manufacturers and kits for diagnostic testing for COVID-19. The first test kit that received FDA approval, the Cobas SARS CoV-2 kit from Roche, is also approved in India. The second, the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit from Thermo Fisher, is in the process of getting validated by the ICMR labs. Both these kits are optimised with specific instruments. Additionally, ICMR has validated kits from three Indian manufacturers. Although ICMR has stated that the agency will provide the primers, probes and master mix for RT-PCR to the select 123 government labs, it is unclear whether they are the same primers and probes as per the U.S. CDC protocol or the agency has designed its own. For private labs, ICMR has issued an advisory and recommends the use of any FDA-approved kits with primers and probes. As long as proper certification and training are in place, any accredited lab using the WHO/CDC suggested protocols can yield satisfactory results.

Currently, the import of some critical reagents, especially the probes, makes the tests expensive to offer in India. India needs to develop the capability to mass-produce kits and all its components within the country. While developing and use of indigenous kits is beneficial in the current outbreak, it cannot take short cuts. While prioritising indigenous kit development, it must ensure that sensitivity, specificity, accuracy are in place before the kits get approved for broader use.

India also needs to invest in developing alternate assays, like serological assays to detect the antibodies IgG and IgM in blood, to test for the infection. Unlike the RT-PCR test, the antibody-based test can help identify individuals who got cleared of the viral infection but were once infected. Antibody tests with similar accuracy and specificity as the RT-PCR test are needed for mass screening. Innovative tests will take interdisciplinary scientific effort and investment. Till then, India can use the existing tests in labs with accreditation and rigorous training to detect each of the COVID-19 cases accurately.

386,2020/03/31,A threat to food security,"Keeping global food chains alive is crucial amid the COVID-19 crisis

The COVID-19 pandemic is putting an enormous strain on public health systems around the world. Millions of people are in some form of quarantine. We know that the human toll will be high, and that efforts to turn the tide carry a heavy economic cost. To reduce the risk of an even greater toll — shortage of food for millions — the world must take immediate actions to minimise disruptions to food supply chains. A globally coordinated and coherent response is needed to prevent this public health crisis from triggering a food crisis in which people cannot find or afford food. For now, COVID-19 has not entailed any strain on food security, despite anecdotal reports of crowded supermarket sieges. While there’s no need to panic — there is enough supply of food in the world to feed everyone — we must prepare to face the enormous risk that food may not be made available where it is needed.

Disrupting food supply

The COVID-19 outbreak, with all the accompanying closures and lockdowns, has created logistical bottlenecks that ricochet across the long value chains of the modern global economy. Restrictions of movement, as well as basic aversion behaviour by workers, may impede farmers from farming and food processors (who handle most agricultural products) from processing. Shortage of fertilizers, veterinary medicines and other input could also affect agricultural production. Closures of restaurants and less frequent grocery shopping diminish demand for fresh produce and fisheries products, affecting producers and suppliers, especially smallholder farmers, with long-term consequences for the world’s increasingly urbanised population.

Uncertainty about food availability can induce policymakers to implement trade restrictive measures in order to safeguard national food security. Given the experience of the 2007-2008 global food price crisis, we know that such measures can only exacerbate the situation. Export restrictions put in place by exporting countries to increase food availability domestically could lead to serious disruptions in the world food market, resulting in price spikes and increased price volatility. In 2007-08, these immediate measures proved extremely damaging, especially for low-income food-deficit countries and to the efforts of humanitarian organisations to procure supplies for the needy and vulnerable.

Steps forward

We should all learn from our recent past and not make the same mistakes twice. Policymakers must take care to avoid accidentally tightening food supply conditions. While every country faces its own challenges, collaboration between governments and the full gamut of sectors and stakeholders is paramount. We are experiencing a global problem that requires a global response. We must ensure that food markets are functioning properly and that information on prices, production, consumption and stocks of food is available to all in real time. This approach will reduce uncertainty and allow producers, consumers, traders and processors to make informed decisions and to contain unwarranted panic behaviour in global food markets.

The health impacts of the unfolding pandemic on some of the poorest countries are still unknown. Yet, we can say with certainty that any ensuing food crisis as a result of poor policymaking will be a humanitarian disaster that we can avert. We already have 113 million people experiencing acute hunger; in sub-Saharan Africa, a quarter of the population is undernourished. Any disruptions to food supply chains will intensify both human suffering and the challenge of reducing hunger around the world. We must do everything possible to not let that happen. Prevention costs less. Global markets are critical for smoothening supply and demand shocks across countries and regions, and we need to work together to ensure that disruptions of food supply chains are minimised as much as possible. COVID-19 forcefully reminds us that solidarity is not charity, but common sense.

387,2020/03/31,Locking down two different Indias,"While some can practise social distancing, most Indians simply cannot as they have no social security

What could possibly have been the reason for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to give only a four-hour notice for the lockdown? If the requirement was to keep the population indoors, strictly enforcing social distancing, how abjectly this has failed! Lakhs of migrant labourers have been jostling to get any form of transport back home; walking and sleeping in the heat and rain, in the open, through day and night, dodging the police and sometimes even hiding under tarpaulin in trucks. Almost as many have died undertaking this inhumane journey as people have lost their lives due to COVID-19 so far. What answers does Mr. Modi have for them? This is the largest manually induced distress migration in independent India. Tragically, it could have been handled much better.

Decision without planning

COVID-19 is a disaster that came with prior warning, and therefore did not warrant an arbitrary, unplanned and ill-prepared decision. The Prime Minister’s 8 p.m. top-down lockdown announcement was not accompanied by practical and necessary relief measures. It brought uncertainty, confusion, and insecurity to an unprepared people. The announcement was rapidly followed by suspension of all public transportation — again with practically no notice. A unilateral lockdown order, keeping millions of migrant labourers in suspended animation, was bound to fail. With doomsday predictions and no work, and no guarantee from the government, migrant labourers logically sought the security of their distant homes, like all of us have. They decided to travel any way they could, including by foot, to go home. Policymakers and the ruling elite have no clue about the lives of the unorganised workforce.

Contradictory and uncoordinated government orders followed in rapid succession adding to the chaos. Bus services were suspended, and then orders were revoked. On March 29, for instance, with lakhs walking home, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued orders to stop the home-bound and quarantine them for 14 days. The propagandists uttered platitudes of support reiterating mandatory ‘social distancing’. The pretended ignorance of how the labour force lives — crammed together, 10 in a room — makes such statements pointless. In the slum or basti, social distancing is a non-existent concept. No order will work unless the government recognises and addresses the dire circumstances of the so-called informal sector. Those secure in isolated rooms in spacious homes, with a huge food stock, cannot wish this problem away.

This lockdown is shaping itself as the expedient response of an elite terrified of falling victim to a virus. There is clearly little imagination or application to work out a plan of action based on compassion and understanding of conditions on the ground. This virus upends the sharp divide of the two Indias we have manufactured. COVID-19 was spread by the callousness of those who arrived from abroad, many of them afluent and influential, and who violated quarantine. The lockdown has a disproportionate impact on the socioeconomic conditions of the poor and unorganised sector. Desperation has not robbed them of dignity or independence. There is surprisingly no anger being expressed — yet. All they want is to go home.

A week of the lockdown has brutally exposed the callousness and indifference to the realities of India’s informal workers. Stranded without income security, transport or food, the walk home became a logical choice for these workers. Men, women and small children, wearing makeshift masks and walking for miles every day through different States, proclaim that if death comes, they would rather it be at home.

Ensuring food and transport

People will stay where they are, only if real support is provided. It is impractical and perhaps impossible to force these workers into 14-day quarantine camps as the MHA order states. What’s worse are the consequent orders taking action against officers who responded to the human tragedy by organising transport, or the callous Haryana government order setting up “jails” for the migrants on the road. These workers are not criminals and fugitives. If the government can ship Indians abroad back to India at substantial cost, there is no reason why this transit can’t be better organised. Those already walking home should reach safely with proper screening en route, food in their stomachs, practical health protocols in their minds, and some reassurance in their hearts. When they reach their blocks, they can be put under observation, further screening, isolation, testing, and quarantine where required. Their families also have to be given minimum guarantees of food, health, and some income by the government for the next few months. We must remember that they are primary breadwinners, and the added anxiety of the survival of their families back home is also pulling them back.

Draconian orders and platitudes will not work. Governments must show leadership, resolve, commitment, and compassion. Resources have to be effectively and optimally used. There is no excuse for hoarding the 58 million tonnes of current foodgrains stock when only four million tonnes are required by the PDS every month. As many have demanded, over and above the Finance Minister’s announcement of free grains to Food Security Act card-holders for three months, the government must use these resources to immediately provide States with at least an additional month’s quota, without conditions, to help prevent hunger amongst those who may have no cards. Hunger today not only walks the road, it stalks the land.

We have enough material resources in the country. Districts like Bhilwara in Rajasthan, which are “corona-sensitive”, have already requisitioned private hospitals, resorts, schools and college hostels for dealing with the crisis. Whether such resources are in private or public hands, this is a time that they must be made available for all, and put to use on the basis of greatest need.

While many front line functionaries such as sanitation workers, government officials and health care workers have been working zealously and extending assistance, the government needs to ensure that this response is uniform and persistent. Civil society must keep track of, and support, the most vulnerable. If supply chains of our most essential services are to be maintained, front line workers of all these servicesin the formal or informal sector must be given equipment, quick basic training, and adequate insurance. No life is more dispensable than the other.

There can be no social distancing without social security. Critically, to pull through this as a nation, we must reduce our inequalities and persevere in this together. An already individualistic tendency has been reinforced by forced isolation. COVID-19 will affect the producer and the consumer. We will live, or die, in this interconnected world together.

388,2020/03/31,The hunt for a cure begins with telling the truth,"In the pandemic fight, India must uphold the principle of truth and responsibility, starting at the highest levels

Staring into the unblinking eyes of a global pandemic, many of us are re-discovering the importance of truth. Indians who travelled abroad in recent weeks hid their travel histories. Some went to the extent of taking paracetamol to lower their body temperature, thereby bypassing tests at airports. We were shocked that bureaucrats, even doctors, helped relatives evade quarantine. Now things are at a pass that journalists are being threatened for revealing the truth about how ill-equipped doctors and health workers are, or how ill-organised the state response is. We fret about the dishonesty — of individuals and of governments — since our lives are at stake. Yet, what were we expecting? An overnight transformation of the nation’s soul?

A receding of truth

Truth is often mocked as an inconvenience, as the domain of fools or saints. ‘Mahatma’ Gandhi finds few takers. We use his tools, demonstrations, fasts, marches, but we shun his core principles. Gandhiji called for ‘Satyagrah’, for resistance via truth, and for truth-telling itself becoming an article of faith. After Gandhiji’s assassination, however, truth began to recede from public discourse. Eventually, it became entirely dispensable. Matters have come to such a pass now that politicians can shrug off falsehoods uttered in public as ‘chunaavi jumla’, a tale told to win elections. Thus, elections have been degraded to a tall tale telling contest.

Meanwhile, peace activists are labelled terrorists. Doctors are imprisoned for months, despite having devoted themselves to the care of some of the most vulnerable among us. Businessmen form shell companies to take loans from banks. Forest and environmental clearances are a different kind of brazen lie.

When was the last time there was a massive public uproar about our leaders concealing truth, or flip-flopping on facts presented in court, or lying in Parliament? Assuming falsehoods were based on faulty information, when was the last time our leaders apologised for misleading us?

Far from seeing it as a ‘sin’, as a symptom of moral degradation with life-and-death consequences for us, we have grown inured to falsehood. I have lost count of the number of times I have heard admiration in the voices of fellow citizens when they comment upon politicians’ penchant for endlessly, inventively, lying to the nation. How then, in the middle of a terrifying pandemic, do we suddenly expect honesty?

The building of public character takes generations. It requires leaders who uphold the principle of honesty, who urge us to re-examine our intimate and perceived reality. Here is one such nugget of reality: India spends only 1.28% of its GDP on health. Here is another: over 55 million Indians were pushed below the poverty line in 2011-12 because of out-of-pocket health expenses. And another: in 2014-15, the government led by Prime Minister Modi slashed an already pitiful health budget by 20%. And this: despite warnings from the World Health Organization, despite COVID-19 deaths being reported in China and Italy, India continued to export protective medical equipment.

There are many more truths to confront. Sanitation workers are not given any protective equipment but are not allowed to stay home. They are expected to handle infected masks with their bare hands. Nor are they given soap and water on the spot. Do we really believe that the government intends to control the pandemic?

On the lockdown

A lockdown is useless unless all citizens are guaranteed food and shelter and medical aid on call. A government that announces a lockdown without making arrangements for the poor, the elderly, the already ailing, is simply adding to the body count. That is another truth. The spectre of a miserable, lonely death confronts us. But for us to resist such deaths, we must reject all the lies and obfuscations that lead up to it. There have been concerted attempts to deflect responsibility there. Listening to certain media commentators, one would imagine that the current Prime Minister is a composite of Jawaharlal Nehru, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, rather than the incumbent Narendra Modi.

The crisis staring us in the face requires quick, empathetic, creative decision-making. Health workers are begging the government for adequate protective equipment. Diverting existing factories and resources to this cause could have been an overnight decision two weeks ago. The Prime Minister’s relief fund had thousands of crores of rupees sitting in it. Food, transport and sanitation for migrant workers could have been organised. It should have taken two minutes to issue an order. We still do not know if and when the order was issued.

The argument that governments can only do so much has collapsed. Truth is, we do expect the government to pull out all the stops when our own lives are threatened. It is also clear that highly subsidised universities are necessary. We need doctors, scientists, social scientists, gender researchers, and journalists working in collaboration. We all need health care, water, electricity, Internet access. We do not need detention centres. We certainly do not need to spend one paisa on refashioning the Parliament building.

Those of us who have access to diverse news outlets have watched the way Kerala, Cuba and South Korea responded to the pandemic. The simple truth is, systems work best when they work for all. It is also clear that we can have such systems, but the first necessary step is to surrender caste, class and religious biases. We must decide now whether we want to pull together into a universal safety net, or be devoured by the virus of falsehood.

389,2020/03/31,Short end of the stick: on assistance to migrant workers,"Migrant workers, who simply cannot fend for themselves, need urgent state assistance

It has been nearly a week since the Centre’s lockdown measures to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 came into force. But what was done as a means to address a public health challenge has now transformed itself into a humanitarian crisis for many among the poorer segments of India’s urban population. The most affected section has been the inter-State migrant worker community, thousands of whom have been leaving cities such as Delhi, even on foot, for their towns in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and elsewhere. Their plight was not unexpected. With a lockdown, migrant workers dependent upon casual and daily wage labour, unorganised retail and other such jobs, were severely affected and sought the comfort of the social net in their towns over the uncertainty of employment, and therefore of money and resources to fend for themselves over the 21 days. Physical distancing in a country where most people are involved in unorganised labour, and who are dependent upon fragile livelihoods defined in daily and even hourly wage earnings, was always going to be problematic. That the Central government announced the lockdown on March 24, with just a four-hour notice, made it even harder for these people to figure out ways to weather the challenge. Their exodus, by foot along highways finally compelled some authorities to start bus services, but these were abruptly halted. The Home Ministry issued notices to States to open highway relief camps while observing physical distancing norms. Later on Sunday, the Ministry directed State and Union Territory governments to enforce the lockdown strictly and prevent migrants from leaving cities; instead, there are to be temporary shelters with essentials for the stranded poor.

These belated steps can only work if implemented in a humane manner. Herding the families of the migrant workers into ill-equipped quarantine camps will only incentivise others to leave for their native States. Governments must use schools and college hostels for the migrants to stay and also utilise the Public Distribution System to provide food. All said, the suffering of the migrant worker is an indictment of the unpreparedness of governments to deal with the COVID-19 crisis. The first infected Indian in the country was detected in late January. The severity of the disease as it spread outside China and affected countries such as Italy was evident a little later, but there was enough time for the government to be prepared for the impending spread in India. Better coordination with the States and a more transparent approach would have helped people prepare for the lockdown. As infections have slowly begun to rise, there is little time to be lost in addressing both the public health problem and the lockdown’s economic impact. Much could have been done better, but the focus now must be on what can be done.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/short-end-of-the-stick-on-assistance-to-migrant-workers/article31211587.ece
390,2020/03/31,Unusually inept: On US surpassing China in coronavirus cases,"The U.S. can still pull itself out of the virus crisis, but not without tougher steps

The U.S. has surpassed mainland China as the country with the most number of novel coronavirus cases. On March 27, it recorded 85,486 infections; On March 30, it had nearly 75% (1,43,527) more cases than China (82,198). Even as Italy and Spain have reported large numbers, the daily increase in new cases has slowed down in Europe even while accelerating in America, thus shifting the pandemic epicentre to the U.S. However, unlike in China and a few other countries, America is yet to institute large-scale mitigation measures such as shutting down the three major hotspots —New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. On Saturday, U.S. President Trump backtracked on the possibility of imposing travel quarantine in these hotspots after a pushback from the New York Governor. New York has the most number of cases in the country — over 53,000, as on March 29. According to the CDC, residents in these hotspots are now “urged” to refrain from non-essential travel for the next 14 days. It is true that Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea managed to contain the spread without having to undertake stringent measures such as those seen in China, Italy, and even India. That is because these countries acted early, enforcing strong containment measures together with large-scale testing; this is not the case with America.

Also read: Coronavirus: U.S. announces $174 mn aid to 64 countries including $2.9 mn to India

Though South Korea and the U.S. reported their first case on January 20, it was only by end-February that the U.S. had a reliable test kit, unlike South Korea, which had the tests by February first week. While South Korea was testing thousands each day after the wave of cases came up in a hospital and among members of a religious sect, the U.S. began large-scale testing only in early March. America thus remained largely oblivious to the looming threat. There were just about 100 tests done each day till end-February. If the tests developed by the CDC were faulty, the testing criteria remained narrow and there was little surveillance for community spread. The FDA’s public health emergency, on January 31, did not make things easy for labs wanting to develop tests. Independent labs and hospitals could start testing using tests developed by private players only by February 27. As on March 28, hardly 1,22,000 tests had been done in the U.S. Instead of decisive actions, Mr. Trump made the situation worse with his dismissive attitude, this despite knowing that the virus was crippling China’s health-care system and had killed a few thousands. If agencies such as CDC, which are known to act swiftly especially in the face of a pandemic, were found wanting this time, the government’s priorities too were misplaced. The deadly combination is now playing out. But knowing how the U.S. can act, there is still hope of virus control. Tough steps need to be in place soon.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unusually-inept/article31211594.ece
391,2020/03/31,No lockdown for them: Friendly neighbourhood grocer comes to the rescue,"Supermarkets are struggling with disruption of supply chains, labour crunch and unsympathetic customers

With big online retailers struggling with backlog and deliveries, citizens are rediscovering their local kirana stores and supermarkets that have emerged as a lifeline across Bengaluru providing essential items and kitchen staples at a time when the city is under a lockdown on account of the COVID-19 pandemic.

But supermarkets are facing an uphill task with stocks running low on account of panic buying and disruption of supply chains, along with a labour crunch and sometimes unsympathetic customers.

Many shopkeepers are dreading the start of the month, when they will have turn away regular customers who usually buy supplies in bulk.

“I have been forced to close my store for five days as I have run out of supplies. The APMC yard opened on Tuesday, but only for a few hours. I couldn't restock my shop. Next, the yard will open on Thursday. I have over 80 customers who have been buying their monthly supplies from my store for years now,” said Rajashekhar, who runs a store in Kodigehalli, north Bengaluru.

Reputed retail stores are in the same boat. “Items have been flying off the shelves over the last 10 days due to panic buying. Now, it has relatively stabilised. But new stock is not arriving,” said Niyas M.K., one of the partners of M.K. Retail which has seven stores in east and south-east Bengaluru.

Staff shortage

Supermarkets are usually labour intensive and the biggest problem most of them face today is staff crunch. “Most of my employees have returned to their villages. We are presently working at 20% of our staff strength,” said Mr. Niyas, adding that they have suspended home delivery.

Contrary to popular perception, supermarkets have taken a financial hit.

“Even if stocks are available, the transport costs have shot up several times, which does not make business viable. We are worried about payment of rent and other bills,"" said Amarnath Setty, who runs a kirana store in Chamarajpet.

Lack of empathy

There is also the risk of contracting the coronavirus from customers. Almost all supermarkets are allowing only three or five customers at a time. However, not everyone is willing to cooperate.

“Many are impatient with the queue system and argue with us. We usually ask them to leave,” said a manager at a reputed corporate retail chain.

One of the more common complaints is difficult customers who refuse to understand the gravity of the situation.

“Many customers do not want to come out of their homes and are demanding door delivery. A customer argued with me insisting that instead of 10 people coming to the store risking infection, my employee should deliver to 10 houses,” said a grocer who runs an organic store in east Bengaluru.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/71urfq/article31221322.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGCOVID-19SCARE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/no-lockdown-for-them-friendly-neighbourhood-grocer-comes-to-the-rescue/article31221323.ece
392,2020/03/31,Protect pourakarmikas collecting waste from houses with home quarantined persons: HC,"High Court noted that the government needs to come out with a policy decision

Pointing out the risk posed to pourakarmikas while collecting waste from the houses where persons subjected to home quarantine reside, the Karnataka High Court has directed the State government to take special measures for protecting pourakarmikas who collect waste from such houses across the States.

A special division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice B.V. Nagarathna issued the direction on Monday while hearing PIL petitions on issues cropped up due to enforcement of measures to check spread of COVID-19, through video conferencing.

The State government has pointed out that the respective municipal authorities have already provided the pourakarmikas with personal protective equipment, like 2 face masks, one set of gumboots, four sets of hand gloves, apron, etc, as per the norms. Also, the government has stated that on March 19, it directed all the 282 urban municipal bodies to provide personal protective equipment, like face masks and hand gloves, to all the 17,767 pourakarmikas working in these local bodies in view of the COVID-19 outbreak.

However, the bench found that the government needs to come out with a policy decision to take special measures to protect pourakarmikas while collecting municipal solid wastes from the houses where person have been subjected to home quarantine. Further hearing was adjourned till April 3.

Though it was stated on behalf of the BBMP that one set of face mask, hand gloves, required quantity of sanitizers and disinfectant solutions have been provided and another set is to be provided, the counsel representing the BBMP Pourakarmika Sangha disputed these claims. Hence, the bench directed the BBMP to ensure that safety equipment is provided to every pourakarmika.

Transport and breakfast

The bench also directed the government to ensure that appropriate transport facilities are made available to the pourakarmikas across the State while pointing out that transport arrangement is of vital importance as, on failure to do so, this category of workmen will not be in a position to report to duty though they are playing a vital role during lockdown.

Though BBMP said that it is providing ₹100 as transport allowance to pourakarmikas, the bench found that it not practical when the public transport facility is shut across the State.

Also, the bench directed the government to ensure that all pourakarmikas are provided breakfast at mustering points in the morning, which will take care of their need for food as their duty timings have been restricted from 6.30 a.m. to 10.30 a.m. during the lockdown.

The bench also noted that the BBMP was already providing readymade breakfast to pourakarmikas at 545 mustering points.

Wakfs board must follow MHA order

The court directed the Karnataka State Board of Wakfs to take note of the March 24 order of the Ministry of Home Affairs prohibiting all religious congregations and closure of all places of worship, and should do the needful.

When it was pointed out by a counsel that direction should be issued to the wakfs board to take steps to control gathering at the time of prayer in mosques, the bench pointed out that the MHA’s March 24 order specifically directs closure of all places of worship to the public.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/protect-pourakarmikas-collecting-waste-from-houses-with-home-quarantined-persons-hc/article31220996.ece

“They are provided free food and essential items like toothbrush, soaps, toothpaste and sanitizers,” said an official.

However, one facility will not be enough given the number of migrant workers who have been rendered jobless.

394,2020/03/31,200 choultries and marriage halls to house the homeless,"City’s 10 homeless shelters are bursting at the seams

Vishwanath from Gouribidanur has been living in the homeless shelter at Upparpete for nearly two months. Over the past week, however, the already cramped shelter has been stretched to accommodate homeless people, migrant workers without jobs and those who are stranded in the city, like Babul Sheikh and his brother Abid Sheikh from Bihar.

The 10 homeless shelters of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) are bursting at the seams. To accommodate more people, a tarpaulin tent has been pitched in the open area next to the shelter on Goodshed Road.

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar said, “We have identified over 200 choultries and marriage halls across the city where temporary shelters for the homeless could be set up. The labour department is monitoring the situation, and temporary shelters would be set up on a need basis.”

According to S.S. Rajani, who has worked with the homeless, the overcrowding in shelters is dangerous. “Health officials talk about social distancing to check the spread of COVID-19. But with shelters overcrowded, this is just not possible,” she said.

In December 2018, the BBMP, with assistance from Impact India, a non-governmental organisation, undertook a survey of homeless persons in the eight zones. In the three core zones, nearly 4,000 homeless persons were found.

This number, which has risen over the years, did not include families living by the side of roads in small tarpaulin tents. For instance, around 30 families have been selling pottery on the street between ITI Gate and K.R. Puram government hospital for decades now. They live in tents by the road and have been bearing the brunt of the lockdown.

“The last time we ate was Monday afternoon. We are waiting for someone to give us food trusting God will send us food. The children have not been fed. There is no milk,” said Angoori Bayi, a labourer from Rajasthan.

Several social welfare organisations and NGOs have come together to help out. Anand Murthy, who manages the BBMP’s shelter in Upparpete, said that the civic body has been providing food packets to residents. “A few NGOs have donated biscuit packets, bottled water, coffee and fruits,” he said.

Circular from BBMP

In an attempt to stop daily wage workers from leaving the city, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has directed all companies and contractors working on BBMP projects to provide free groceries, food and shelter to the labourers, and ask them not to leave the city. “If the directive is not followed, legal action shall be taken against the contractors or companies,” the circular reads.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/v8k1y1/article31220356.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGSHELTERFORHOMELESS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/200-choultries-and-marriage-halls-to-house-the-homeless/article31220357.ece
395,2020/03/31,"Not allowed to collect fees, some schools mulling over salary cuts","Budget schools, which make up the majority in the private school sector, are having a tough time making ends meet

As big corporations are announcing salary cuts, people employed by private schools are worried about job security, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown. What’s cause for concern is that school managements have been told not to collect fees for the next academic year, a fact they cite as reason for not having enough money to meet their recurring expenditure. Some school managements are contemplating paying only half of the next month's salary to their staff.

D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, pointed out that the government is yet to pay the RTE reimbursement to schools amounting to lakhs of rupees. “On the other hand, they're empowering parents of pupils not to pay fees. All we are saying is let parents at least pay last year's fees. Many had requested for time, which was granted. They would usually pay up the remaining amount before the exams. But now that the academic calendar has been thrown out of gear, we haven't even got the pending amount. How are we supposed to pay staff?”

He also said budget schools, which make up the majority in the private school sector, are suffering. ""We will not be able to maintain this in the long run. Of 1,700 students in our school, for example, 400 are yet to pay. We may have to pay only half the salaries for staff next month. And we may also have to see more staff being let go,"" he said.

Managements of a few schools in the city are being criticised for terminating the contracts of some of their staff, like bus drivers, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown . A school in central Bengaluru has allegedly terminated the services of bus drivers from the next academic year.

One of them spoke to The Hindu on condition of anonymity. ""I have been working here as a bus driver for three years. After completing two years, they said they'll make my service permanent. Now all of a sudden, the principal has called me and said they no longer require my services,"" he said, visibly distressed.

He said he has been told that there is ""excess staff"" in his department. ""We are 24 drivers and I heard one more driver has also got a similar call. The government has been reiterating that people should not be removed from their jobs, but it's still being done. How will I provide for my family now? How will I manage house rent?""

However, the principal of the school said these allegations were false. ""There are no lay-offs because of the impact of the lockdown. One regular exercise we do every year is to take stock of the performance of the probationary and ad hoc staff. That's all that's happening. There is no connection with the crisis. In fact, March salaries were given much in advance,"" said the principal.

396,2020/03/31,COVID-19: Head constable suspended,"He had issued emergency passes to businessman and his 24 associates

A head constable attached to Sarjapur police station was suspended for allegedly issuing travel permits meant for people in essential services to a businessman and 24 of his relatives so that they could travel to his home town in Rajasthan for a family function.

The incident came to light when the police stationed at the Tamil Nadu border caught two vehicles ferrying the businessman, Pookraj, and 24 others towards Rajasthan. “On checking his credentials, they found that he was using a travel permit for people in essential services, like doctors. This matter was brought to the notice of senior officers,” said a police officer.

An inquiry was initiated against PSI Harish V. and Head Constable Veerabhadrappa.

“A detailed inquiry conducted by SP Ravi D. Channannavar revealed that Veerabhadrappa had received a huge amount of money from Pookraj to issue passes. This amounts to sheer negligence and dereliction of duty,” the police officer added. The inquiry revealed negligence on the part of PSI Harish who has been issued a show-cause notice.

399,2020/03/31,The dilemma of a hospital administrator,"The Shakespearean dilemma, “To be or not to be”, holds good for most doctors and surgeons in the country right now. The extraordinary times we live in, with the pandemic looming large and around us, a much-needed 21-day lockdown enforced by the Prime Minister seems the last resort left to take the viral pandemic by its horns.

However, remember the viral illness isn’t the only illness and other non-communicable diseases still continue to be the major killer. This includes diseases related to diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular and neurological diseases. The most notable among these are cancers. Most diseases, with the exception of cancer, require a patient to comply with recommendations of a healthy lifestyle, monitoring and drug intake.

The compliance could potentially reduce the need to travel to a clinic/hospital, temporarily reducing footfall inside a healthcare facility, where less-immune people are prone to coming together. However, one needs to weigh the risks and benefits of visting/not visiting the doctor.

We doctors use our learning to decide the need for a planned procedure — the so-called elective procedures. Can we afford to sideline the “elective cases” during the pandemic? Why is it important to withhold elective/planned surgeries/procedures? Unlike any other profession, we doctors deal with humanity at its most vulnerable. It is not just science, but empathy and trust between the doctor and patient that forms the keystone of this scenario.

So why is it important to say no to a surgery/procedure to a patient who needs it, but who is not in immediate danger?The learning from the West and the East has been clear, with hospitals becoming the major source point of infection spread. The lockdown is the biggest social experiment we have undertaken since the partition of India. The current situation warrants a doctor to use his utmost clinical judgement to reschedule the procedure to break the chain, by reducing the contacts of the vulnerable ones. It is also important to reduce the occupancy of patients beds, ventilators and other resources, which will become necessary if a potential need arises.

Clear directions from the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) and PMO to postpone all elective procedures for a month, is a step taken to handle pandemic transmission. But the buck doesn’t stop there — the recent development of implementing a tele-health policy through the recently formed board of governors (replacing the MCI) is a disruption in itself. With high speed internet-enabled smartphones in most hands, tele-consultations for all non-emergency visits is just a click away. What was thought as a tool to reach the unreachable sectors of the society has taken a different avatar now, enabling us to reach everyone.

It is often quoted “chaos is the ladder of opportunity”. This pandemic brings forth a lot of fundamental thinking and action in all sectors of society. A society where public health takes precedence over economy, where family takes precedence over self indulgence, where priorities and culture of the organisation towards its employees matter more than the take-home packages or bonuses.

All it requires for us to do is to sit back and relax, as that’s the strongest weapon to fight the pandemic, and I am sure we will lead by example.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ywu0ji/article31222144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1b3459fd-0d71-47b0-b7b6-635aa3145b32,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/the-dilemma-of-a-hospital-administrator/article31222145.ece

As many as 457 persons had applied for passes, said a civic official.

A large number of people were found applying for the passes at Ripon Buildings on Tuesday. Most of the applications were rejected as officials were asked to prevent crowding on the highways. “As many as 457 persons applied for the passes. A total of 92 persons were permitted to move out of the city,” said an official of Chennai Corporation.

Meanwhile, Chennai Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash has delegated powers to zonal officials to prevent crowding in Ripon Buildings.

“All the requests for passes within Chennai city for vehicles and persons for already fixed marriages, funerals, medical needs shall be given by zonal officers. They will reject frivolous and ineligible cases. Only those which are genuine will be considered.”

For any movement outside Chennai and within Tamil Nadu, the Regional Deputy Commissioners are empowered, subject to proper checking of documents. Out of the State movement for the above instance shall only be handled by Corporation Commissioner. “And all such permissions should include conditions like safety protocols. The person should carry the permission letter,"" said Mr. Prakash.

“It is true that COVID-19 affected patients admitted in Madurai, Salem and Erode districts were related to Tablighi Jamaat. It is also true that they are all from the same religious community and that no other religious group was affected due to this. It was only after they were advised - including by me - that they should get themselves tested and isolate themselves that they have done so. Despite knowing about all this, the State Government has tried to smear a particular religious group and has tried to create fear and hate against them,” he charged in a statement.

He said that the people have been helping each other and getting together as one to fight the spread of COVID-19. “At such a time, it was condemnable that State Government has targetted a particular minority group.

403,2020/03/31,"Despite lockdown, WRD staff continue work at Red Hills","The team has been clearing floating materials from the lake to ensure free flow

The area around the Red Hills reservoir, bustling with activity, now looks deserted, following the countrywide lockdown. But a team of Water Resources Department (WRD) staff members have been clearing floating materials from the inlets of the lake to ensure the free flow of water.

Brimming with water, the reservoir is one of the four major drinking water sources and has been getting an inflow of 240 cusecs (cubic feet per second) from the Poondi reservoir, this summer. While most parts of the area are empty, it is business as usual for the group of five staff members, involved in the maintenance of the lake.

They have been clearing floating materials like plastic bags, thermocol and grass that flow into the lake through the link canal carrying water from the Poondi reservoir. “This is regular work for us. In the past, we have stayed back in the site office during rainy days. But what is challenging now is having to cross three check posts to identify ourselves as essential service workers and reaching the site,” said a WRD staff member.

They now don a blue jacket and a cap bearing the department’s name to work for easy identification and assist in the process of drinking water supply to the city. Instead of the usual 10-11 staff members, only five are at the site, and the rest are posted for monitoring the Cholavaram lake and the Tamaraipakkam anicut.

Their other works include measuring the lake level at 6 a.m., inspecting the link canal for a stretch of 4-5 km for obstruction, and monitoring the drawal and the main bund. People’s access is now restricted, as the gate to the main bund has been locked.

“We have posted staff members who live near the lake. We have also created awareness about personal sanitation and provided sanitisers and masks as a precautionary measure against COVID-19,” said an official.

About 200 mld is drawn from the lake and treated at facilities in Red Hills and Kilpauk for drinking water supply. The continuous supply of Krishna water from Andhra Pradesh has ensured better storage in Red Hills and Chembarambakkam lakes this summer. The Red Hills reservoir has a storage of 2,788 million cubic feet, against its capacity of 3,300 mcft.

“Our family is often concerned about COVID-19. But we continue our work with basic precautions and physical distancing,” said a staff member.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/d5n536/article31219659.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1THWRD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/despite-lockdown-wrd-staff-continue-work-at-red-hills/article31219660.ece
404,2020/03/31,A submariner recalls life inside a submarine,"Says Indians can win the war against COVID-19 by ‘staying indoors’ with discipline

Imagine being cooped up in a constrained space with around 70-100 people, having only a rationed quantity of food, very few showers are allowed, there is a very small bunk to sleep in, no communication can be had with relatives and friends, and hours and hours of silence pass without connecting with the people even within the limited space. Now contrast this with some people wantonly breaking curfew and others jumping quarantine as India enters the second week of the 21-day lockdown, the largest such effort in the world.

The constrained space is a submarine, where one cannot move freely, and personnel have to stay at one place for a long amount of time, hundreds of feet under water. As arguments abound about the lack of space in Indian households, the need to rush out to buy groceries, while some step out without reason just to check what is happening in these times, a former Indian submariner says every Indian needs to “fight this war against COVID-19 by staying indoors”.

‘Rather easily’

While the day-to-day lifestyle of a common citizen cannot be compared with that of a trained soldier, Captain Murthy, who had served in different classes of submarines of the Indian Navy for 25 years, believes that citizens can get through the curfew period rather easily.

Capt. Murthy said that while people are not used to this kind of a situation, it resembles a certain level of life in a submarine, though without benefits that the world above the deep, cold waters that submarines patrol, offers.

For example, Capt. Murthy said, “When a submarine enters an ultra-quiet stage, everyone on board is expected to maintain absolute silence and not talk to each other because when you talk, you generate more carbon-dioxide and carbon monoxide is formed, which is dangerous. Everybody has to keep quiet. Oxygen is less, because you are shut inside and you have to consume whatever oxygen there is for the next few days.”

Food, sunlight

On the kind of food available on board, Capt. Murthy said whatever fresh food is available would be used on the first few days of patrolling. Sometimes, patrols extend beyond a month, which means those on board would not even have had a glimpse of sunlight during this period.

Capt. Murthy believes Indians can get through the COVID-19 crisis by being disciplined. “These are difficult times for each and every one of us across the world. But at the same time, think of the people who are in submarines, who are patrolling the streets [the police]. Today, at our homes, we are having proper food. We are able to watch TV, entertain ourselves with music, able to communicate with friends, families and relatives, read books, learn new skills. We should feel lucky about this,” he said.

The former Navy officer also requested everyone to stay put at home and not move around arguing with police officers and doctors who are on the frontlines of this battle against the spread of the virus. “When such authorities are putting their lives on the line for you, why should we not do this little sacrifice of staying indoors?” he asked.

After all, “This is a war against a virus that has affected the world and this is fight each one of us must fight — by staying indoors. Ultimately, we are all helping each other in this war,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/says-indians-can-win-the-war-against-covid-19-by-staying-indoors-with-discipline/article31218049.ece
405,2020/03/31,"During lockdown, delivering milk comes with additional rules","A handkerchief covering her nose and mouth, this woman keeps herself busy delivering milk to 25 houses a day

Indirani Murugesan has kept herself busy delivering milk packets to as many as 25 houses every day. Her day begins at 4.30 a.m. daily. These past few days she has started sporting a handkerchief covering her nose and mouth. “I was told to use a handkerchief as protection as I am going out a lot,” she said.

Indirani thinks she must be 60 or 65 years old. “Those days they never had anything written down,” she says.

One of her sons works as a cab driver and another, in a company. They moved to their native village Kaveripattinam near Kancheepuram. “They wanted me to return but I refused as it is not like just for a few days that I could hand over the responsibility to someone else. People depend on me to deliver their milk packets,” she said.

Indirani and Murugesan came to Chennai around 30 years ago. Until seven years ago, she had a place to call home as he worked as a watchman in an apartment complex in T. Nagar. But after his death she had to move out.

With the State going under lockdown, Indirani had to find a roof over her head. An elderly couple in the apartment complex where her husband had been a watchman came to her rescue. They took her in as a resident domestic help. “They also take care of my food. I can go about my work without concern,” she said.

The monthly renewal of milk cards has become a cause for concern for her. “Usually I would ask people to pay after purchasing the cards. But this time I had to ask them to pay in advance. Now that we have to stand some distance apart from each other, the queue is bound to be very long. I will have to stand may be for several hours,” she said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/7cvfhu/article31215938.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31MARTH-Indranijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/during-lockdown-delivering-milk-comes-with-additional-rules/article31215939.ece

The quantity of municipal solid waste generated by the Chennai Corporation has reduced by 28% following the lockdown.

According to data compiled by the civic body, the amount of garbage generated every day has reduced from 5,100 tonnes to less than 3,700 tonnes. “We are collecting municipal solid waste in all the 200 wards on a daily basis. All conservancy workers are at work. But the garbage has reduced,” said an official of Chennai Corporation.

“Many of the residents have left the city for their native villages in other parts of the State. Many of the houses remain locked. So door to door collection in such houses has reduced. Many commercial establishments have also stopped dumping waste after the lockdown. The waste generated in commercial areas such as T. Nagar, Purasawalkam and George Town has reduced considerably,” said an official.

Many of the bins remain empty in residential neighbourhoods.

407,2020/03/31,Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board residents take precautions to keep COVID-19 at bay,"Residents welfare associations of the tenements have been putting in place measures for physical distancing and are also helping those in need with food supplies

From physical distancing to helping elderly residents, the residents welfare associations of the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) resettlement colony in Perumbakkam, have been taking every possible precaution to keep COVID-19 at bay.

There are close to 20,000 families living in more than 150 blocks in the resettlement colony here. Each block has eight floors and there are around 24 houses in each floor in the old tenements and 12 houses in the new ones. Most of the residents are daily wage earners. “This means, if one person gets infected, it won’t take much time for the remaining families to fall sick. Hence precautionary measures have to be taken,” says S. Dhanalakshmi, a resident of the tenement.

The residents welfare associations in the colony have themselves put up boards near elevators asking only two people to travel at a time. “Initially we switched off the elevator, but many living on the seventh floor were finding it hard. So we are now allowing only two persons,” said a resident of L Block.

Besides, the associations are also helping individuals, who do not have families living in their block, by providing them with food. “We also pour turmeric water to disinfect the corridor. Most of the residents are not stepping out,” said a resident of C Block.

D. Karthikeyan, managing director, TNSCB, said that they are disinfecting 1.5 lakh tenements in over 300 places across the State. The board has purchased 91 spraying machines for 18 divisions in Chennai and other towns.

“The corridors, staircase, lift, doors and insides of the blocks are sprayed with disinfectants using power sprayers. The exterior areas such as roads, platforms, shops and parks are disinfected with bleaching powder solution using jet-rodding machines on alternate days,” he said.

Senior TNSCB officials are inspecting the colonies frequently. “We also have a jeep in the colonies to rush the residents who show symptoms to hospital. As on date, none of them have had symptoms,” said a TNSCB official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/eaupzm/article31215315.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31MARTH-TNSCBjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tamil-nadu-slum-clearance-board-residents-take-precautions-to-keep-covid-19-at-bay/article31215316.ece
408,2020/03/31,"To stop residents from violating lockdown, Chennai Police resort to novel methods","Police are making violators perform half-squats, sit-ups and asking them to hold up placards stating that they will not violate the prohibitory orders

As people continue to loiter on the roads without a valid reason despite lockdown orders, police officers in the city have resorted to novel methods to make people adhere to the law and realise the importance of staying indoors.

At 1.30 p.m on Monday, the scene at Puzhal Camp road was like that of a gym. More than 15 people formed a line under the scorching sun. A woman sub-inspector was in command. Standing before them she gave a demonstration on how to do half- squats. In the next 20 minutes, she took them to task by commanding them to repeat the half-squats.

Jayanthi, a sub-inspector of police, said, “These people don’t understand the seriousness of a lockdown. They just saunter out without any purpose. Some of they say they came out from their houses to visit their friends or other such weak excuses. We have to effectively implement law and order by adopting these kinds of methods.”

In Ennore Wimco Nagar, police caught people who were on the roads. They were made to do sit ups. While doing the squats, they repeated, “Hereafter, we will not roam anywhere. We will obey the orders of the government.”

Another group in Maduvoyal police station were taken to task by police personnel. Here they repeated, “We will cooperate with the police and government authorities. We will wear masks,” while repeating the squats.

Red Hills Inspector P. Jawahar has adopted yet another innovative way to make people follow the law. People were gathered together on roadside, they were asked to form three lines and were given the task of holding placards stating that they will obey prohibitory orders.

Police personnel said to the violators, “You are all well-educated and should realise your mistake hereafter. You should go and tell people in the neighbourhood that people should not step out unnecessarily when a lockdown is in place and the disease may spread faster if people saunter out.”

One man among the crowd recently returned from a foreign country and he was asked stay at home in quarantine. Police personnel warned him for coming out despite being in quarantine. One police personnel asked him, “Why you are coming out sir? You have been to foreign countries where you obeyed the law. But here, you don’t?. Sir you are educated and why did you come out, that too without any mask?” He was whisked away to the police station and a case was booked against him for violating the law.

Assistant Commissioner, Flower Bazaar, Lakshmanan has another method to handle violators. He made them read out an undertaking under the scorching sun, stating that they would not come out unnecessarily hereafter during the lockdown period.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pup5t9/article31215038.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31MARTH-HalfSquatjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/to-stop-residents-from-violating-lockdown-chennai-police-resort-to-novel-methods/article31215039.ece
409,2020/03/31,Karnataka CM writes on how the State is fighting the pandemic,"Karnataka’s approach to fighting the coronavirus pandemic is on a war-footing

When the World Health Organization (WHO) Executive Director, WHO Health Emergencies Programme, Dr. Michael Ryan, said, “India has a tremendous capacity to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic”, we must prove the assessment right before the international community at all cost. Dr. Ryan also said, “There are no easy answers. It is exceptionally important that countries like India show the way to the world as they have done before.”

As India enters the seventh day of a lockdown, 37 deaths and 1,284 COVID-19 positive cases have been reported in India; there are 88 cases in Karnataka (as on March 30, 9.45 pm).

Currently, we have two main challenges at hand. First of all, to curb the spread of the COVID-19 virus and second, to care for people’s lives during the 21-day lockdown. I can say, confidently, that we are addressing both the challenges effectively. The Central Government, under the leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is overseeing every step. We extend unflinching support to the Prime Minister.

Friends, we must strictly quarantine ourselves for 21 days until April 14 to contain the spread of the coronavirus. The lockdown, unprecedented in our lifetime, may cause inconvenience to our social life, but the decision is a bold move. We must realise that the lockdown is for our well-being, for our safety.

My government has devised a multi-pronged strategy to win the battle against the scourge of the coronavirus. Technical strategy, humanitarian approach, economic/financial assistance and medical support are in place to handle the crisis.

Technical strategy

We have, in the first of its kind in India, high-tech war rooms to monitor, exchange information, and to keep a tab on the spread of the coronavirus. Officials are engaged in the management of the crisis at Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), Labour Department and Information Department war rooms.

BBMP war room: The BBMP has surveillance data of people in an eight-kilometre radius around a confirmed patient, where he was first found to reside. The BBMP tracks the mobile phones of quarantined people through their GPS location.

If they are going beyond the containment zone, we will call them and ask them to go back home. The police will send the BBMP their names and tracking details. The general control room numbers and WhatsApp numbers are working for COVID-19 too. Also, Karnataka has developed ‘Corona Watch App’ mobile applications for monitoring people under quarantine and informing their contacts about the same to check the spread of the coronavirus.

Information Department: Friends, being anxious is not a solution to the problem. To clarify your doubts, please join the largest Telegram group in India on the coronavirus – ‘COVID-19 Karnataka: Sahaya Group’, a team of doctors from the ESI Directorate are working 24x7 in responding to queries from citizens. In a week, about 21,000 people have joined and got answers for every query on COVID-19.

After the coronavirus outbreak, the Janasnehi team of the Department of Information and Public Relations (DIPR) began getting a huge number of queries from the public on the disease. There was panic, rumours and fake news spreading rapidly. The DIPR realised we needed to kill the fake news and give out the right information so that people will not panic.

The DIPR Janasnehi team started operating like a COVID Awareness and Response centre for the general public giving the right information and spreading awareness to people apart from debunking fake news through its Twitter handle. A team of 3,000 volunteers has been set up, with four volunteers in each taluk on field, monitored by the DIPR and the Red Cross, to stop fake news from the field.

I am in touch with District Collectors through a video conferencing facility, and the highlights of the meetings are updated on my Twitter account @CMofKarnataka for your convenience.

Labour Department: The Labour Department is already running a 24x7 helpline, called the ‘Dasoha line’ (155214) and a war room, in association with the DIPR which receives the demand for food (both dry ration and cooked food) from all over the State and then channelises that into the other departments, BBMP, etc in real time.

The helpline receives about 3,000 calls per day and is increasing. The calls are attended and the citizens are either directed to the nearest food centre or ration/cooked food is being arranged to reach near them.

Eager to stall migration, Karnataka has launched the hunger helpline. A coordinated ‘Dasoha’ scheme will ensure that everybody is covered under the scheme and nobody in Karnataka goes to bed without food. Also, the government has directed Deputy Commissioners to take over one convention centre or wedding hall in every ward within municipal corporation limits to house construction labourers and migrant workers.

On Instagram: Of late, the Department of Medical Education and the Government of Karnataka are active on Instagram — ‘Karnataka Kills Corona’ —to spread awareness on the coronavirus.

Medical support

The State Health Minister B. Sriramulu, Medical Education Minister Dr. K. Sudhakar, and Information Department of the State government are working with exceptional co-ordination throughout the State to fight the menace.

I appeal to you all to cooperate in following the measures announced by the Centre and State governments.

In Bengaluru, several hospitals have been listed as ‘designated first response hospitals’ for COVID-19. For instance, in Victoria Hospital alone, around 1,700 beds have been set up.

I sincerely request you all to please not to pay heed to fake news doing the rounds on social media platforms. The government will be updating the relevant numbers, measures, and instructions every day about the issue.

Also, new COVID-19 helpline numbers (080-46848600 and 080-66692000) are now functional apart from the existing helpline number 104. In both these helpline numbers, a senior doctor and two post-graduate medical students are available throughout the day to assist volunteers in answering the queries of citizens more knowledgeably. I have appealed to people not to rush to hospitals; call the helpline if symptoms aggravate. The best medical care and isolation facilities are just one call away.

It is at this moment that only sick and patients requiring emergency care might visit hospitals for treatment at medical college hospitals/district hospitals/super-speciality hospitals and autonomous institutions. To avoid overcrowding and halt the spread of COVID-19, private hospitals have been instructed to take similar steps.

Economic assistance

During the crisis, it is the utmost duty of the government to take care of the vulnerable sections of society. In this direction, the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, have made a timely intervention to address the problems of the livelihood of labourers. The rolling out of the Garib Kalyan Yojana scheme, of ₹1.7-lakh crore, when the country is struggling hard to fight the coronavirus menace has brought relief in this hour of crisis. The most striking feature of the Garib Kalyan Yojana is a supply of five kilogram rice or wheat and one kilogram pulses to 80 crore people. People living below the poverty line will not be hungry when they remain indoors during the lockdown period.

Likewise, the Karnataka government will release social security pension of two months in advance for the poor, additional working days amount will be released in advance under the Mahatma Gandhi Employment Guarantee Act scheme and two months ration will be supplied immediately. Also, 21 lakh construction workers will be paid ₹1,000 per person. Under the Badavara Bandhu (interest-free loan to roadside vendors) scheme, we have decided to waive ₹13.20 crore loans. This includes ₹9.10 crore in 2018-19 benefiting 15,120 people, and ₹5.16 crore in 2019-20, benefiting 6,500 people. Also, my Cabinet has already earmarked a corpus fund of ₹200 crore as “immediate expenses” to fight the outbreak.

Humanitarian approach

As a part of the humane approach, the State-run Indira Canteens will provide food packets free of cost to the poor and needy in the wake of the lockdown. The canteens will operate in three schedules: from 7.30 a.m. to 10 a.m., 12.30 p.m. to 3 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. to 9 p.m. Streetside vendors, labourers and poor will get food free of cost.

I have directed officials to popularise “vicinity marketing” and make the people purchase essential items from shops, vendors and hawkers in their area and surroundings.

I hope you are convinced that our approach to fighting the coronavirus pandemic is on a war-footing. I request the ever generous people of the State to contribute to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund Covid-19. Or you can send your cheque or DD to Chief Minister’s Relief Fund, Vidhana Soudha.

Leaders across the political spectrum are with the people of Karnataka in these testing times. I acknowledge and appreciate the relentless service of the ‘health warriors’ who are attending the call of duty round the clock. I am overwhelmed by your messages on social media expressing gratitude to our health warriors. Similarly, please do cooperate with police personnel in your area. Our ‘Khaki warriors’ are discharging their duty in every corner of the State to ensure a stringent lockdown.

Friends, your patience and cooperation are crucial to fight the COVID-19 menace. With concerted efforts, we will overcome the challenge.

In a midst of news that the pandemic is wreaking havoc, it is gratifying that some industrial houses and startups are looking for ways to mitigate shortages of much-needed personal protective equipment. However, what is praiseworthy is that some women fashion designers, small-time tailors and students of Jammu and Kashmir are pitching in (Page 1, “Women warriors join battle against virus”, March 30). What brings cheer is the fact that besides demonstrating keen business acumen, they are tapping their immense potential to the fullest by innovating on design and preparing PPEs that are different from the routine supply.

The mass exodus of migrant workers from their work spots to their home States has added a tragic dimension to the COVID-19 related lockout. The dread of starvation and the urge to seek refuge in the safety of home in the face of an existential threat has overwhelmed their fear of catching the infection in the midst of their desperate journey. The question is, would they have embarked upon this arduous journey had the host States taken care of them when they had no income to meet their basic needs? Kerala, even while battling the spread of the epidemic, treated them as the State’s guests and took steps to ensure their welfare so that most of them preferred to stay back in their respective camps and lodgings. True, the central government could not foreclose every exigency when it suddenly imposed the lockout, but once it crossed the Rubicon to shut down the informal economy, it should have considered the lockdown’s impact on a huge wageless migrant workforce and collaborated with the States to halt a distress home-bound exodus (Page 1, “As inter-State buses dwindle, migrants are stuck with nowhere to go”, March 30).

V.N. Mukundarajan,

A number of opinion writers have started a new line of attacking the government. Can we just stop inculpating the government for its policies against the deadly virus to save humanity? The government has not been trained to deal with such large-scale, unprecedented situations and it is a trial and error learning process, for even the best practices elsewhere could not necessarily apply to the Indian scenario. Nobody could have ever imagined the world being stuck by such a nightmare. All that we could do now is to stay strong, give up despondency and support the government.

Until last month the world was boastful about its breakthroughs in terms of technology. Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, Big Data science, analytics, and automation, which promised answers to most of the human problems, are today ducking behind the screens. The problem is not the technology, or its capabilities. The problem is the business objectives of technology companies that are operating for their own capital gain. The problem is also specialised skill owners operating in a silo. Like CSR, business enterprises should take it upon themselves to solve social problems using the core competencies that they often boast. AI, Machine Learning, GIS and Big Data have the power to help us manage any crisis. But companies that are proclaiming to be leaders in this niche have contributed very little during this pandemic. Of what use are company strengths if they cannot provide solutions to societal problems? .

411,2020/03/31,Dalgona coffee: how hard can it be?,"We try our hand at the latest coffee trend to have taken over Instagram

You are probably short on ingredients by now. On the other hand, there is suddenly plenty of time. With India entering its second week of lockdown, to tackle COVID-19, there is an unexpected surge of interest in a flamboyant, South Korea-inspired coffee that requires little more than pantry staples and patience to create.

Dalgona coffee, more poetically known as cloud coffee, currently features in more than 91,000 posts on Instagram alone. Inspired by a retro South Korean candy by the same name, this is proving to be an ideal quarantine project, as it demands more optimism than skill.

And cheery determination — which, let’s admit, is also in short supply these days.

Nevertheless, I try. After quickly skimming through half a dozen recipes, I put instant coffee, sugar and hot water in a bowl, then begin to whip it all together with my hand blender. The result is dark, steamy and depressingly viscous, reminiscent of Twitter on a particularly angry day. Despite impatiently continuing for about eight minutes, the mixture does not mellow into the sweet, fluffy cloud it is supposed to — instead it spits foam at me angrily. Discouraged, I abandon it.

Realising that I had put too little sugar, and a touch too much hot water, I try again. But this time I follow instructions more precisely. I also decide to keep at it, till I get results. I add two tablespoons of instant coffee, two tablespoons of sugar and two tablespoons of hot water, and then begin to whisk again. It takes a few minutes, but then begins to change colour, getting light and foamy with gentle peaks.

The rest of the recipe is absurdly easy. Put ice cubes into a glass, add cold milk and then spoon this fluffy mixture on top with one hand, while you video the process for Instagram with the other. The result is rich and creamy, almost like eating meringue, with a pleasingly bitter echo of espresso.

Although this recipe has been floating around for a while, according to Google trends, interest started peaking by the end of December. Interestingly, in India, the main peak of interest has been over the past week, coinciding with the current lockdown. In a storm of anxiety, clearly it helps to focus on simple pleasures.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/dt9e4m/article31218025.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31MPDalgona,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/dalgona-coffee-is-trending-on-instagram-so-we-tried-a-recipe/article31218026.ece
412,2020/03/31,SHARAN offers free online classes for building immunity using plant-based food,"Make the best use of the lockdown period to focus on healthier food and boost your immunity, says homeopath Nandita Shah

Humans are the only species in the world to spray poison on our food so that other animals would not eat it. And it is only humans that drink the milk of other animals, says Nandita Shah, a trained homeopath and founder of SHARAN, which aims to help people connect to animals and Nature in order to heal themselves and the planet.

Shah, who now lives in Auroville, Puducherry, received the Nari Shakti Puraskar in 2016, the highest award for women in India, for her pioneering work in the field of health and nutrition, from the President of India. She is also the author of the book, Reversing Diabetes in 21 Days.

Shah first became vegan because of ethical issues. She says, “I became a doctor to reduce suffering and when I became aware of the tremendous suffering that we inflict on fellow creatures for food, I had to make the connection.”

With the COVID-19 crisis, as we start looking for immunity-building foods, SHARAN is offering workshops on mindful cooking and safe food. “Coinciding with the World Health Day which falls on April 7, we at SHARAN are offering live and free video sessions online for one week,” says Rosa Noronha, coordinator, SHARAN, Mumbai.

“It is proven that the impact of COVID-19 is harsh on those with pre-existing lifestyle diseases, and we take this lockdown period to make the population understand that such lifestyle diseases can be reversed,” says Shah, adding, “During the lockdown period, we must take all necessary precautions. These must not be temporary, but something which we continue even after the crisis settles down. We must learn to restrict processed food such as sugar, rice and oils and embrace plant-based food for our well-being.”

At SHARAN, they had planned their annual event for World Health Day at a public space in Andheri, Mumbai, but once the lockdown was announced, they decided to go online and make it free so that many families would benefit.

“Adapting to a plant-based diet is easy if you make an attempt. Dairy can be completely replaced with milk derived from cashew and almond, peanut and rice, oats and coconut. Making oat milk is easy and can be used for coffee and tea,” says Shah. This summer, you can even try making buttermilk with tender coconut. Just take medium tender coconut slices, add a little juice of lemon, fresh mint-coriander leaves, slices of ginger, salt and water, and blend well in a mixer-grinder.

413,2020/03/31,Coronavirus lockdown: Stay home and stir the ‘dalgona’ coffee,"ASMR-style preparations of the frothy coffee are going viral on YouTube and Tiktok

Thanks to social media, we are capable of amusing ourselves even during a global crisis. Previously, pandemics were, almost always, entirely grim. But as we see every passing day with the COVID-19 outbreak, at least a section of the world’s population are enjoying themselves with Netflix parties, Instagram concerts, Twitter workout sessions and other high-spirited activities. And, one of the recent fads involves coffee.

Google Trends shows an ascent in Dalgona coffee’s popularity over the last month. Unlike fancy dishes that probably requires ingredients that you have not heard of before and hence are difficult to make, dalgona coffee is easy to prepare. Coffee powder, sugar, milk (or other substitutes) and water are all you need.

The first step is to mix (preferably with a whisk) the coffee, sugar and hot water — two tablespoons each, until it becomes a creamy paste. The second is to place this thick, frothy mix on top of the hot or cold milk (about 500 ml). That is it.

So, why is this fairly simple-to-make coffee becoming super-popular all of a sudden? As with most things that go viral, there isn’t a definite reason. But it gained traction when a Korean YouTuber posted an ASMR-style preparation of the coffee on YouTube (which, as of March 31, has close to four million views). Then, it started trending on TikTok, too.

Dalgona, however, isn’t a thing in India… yet.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/hjsh3c/article31217035.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Coffee-Representational-image,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/a-frothy-drink-you-can-make-for-yourself-at-home/article31217036.ece
414,2020/03/31,Mumbai duo apologises on camera for flouting lockdown rules,"The police’s trend of making people apologise for flouting lockdown rules continues, with one more video going viral on Tuesday.

According to the Shivaji Nagar police, Fazal Sheikh (22) and Sarfaraz Shaikh (20) had posted a video of themselves zooming around at high speeds on a motorbike through the deserted streets of Govandi on Monday.

The location was identified as the Tilak Nagar stretch of the Santacruz-Chembur Link Road bridge. With the help of informants, the police brought them to the station, where they were made to record another video. “We made a grave mistake by going out unnecessarily at a time when the police and the government are telling us to stay at home for our own safety. What the government is doing is for our well-being, and we will not do anything wrong from now on,” the duo were seen saying.

Police officers said the duo were arrested and booked for disobeying an order promulgated by a public servant and rash and negligent driving under the Indian Penal Code, the Motor Vehicles Act, and the Disaster Management Act. They were subsequently released on bail.

This is the third instance where offenders have gone on camera both before and after violating rules of the lockdown that has been put in place in light of the novel coronavirus crisis.

Earlier this month, a woman was seen talking on camera about how she would be travelling as she only feared god and no human. Ayatullah Koolarzade, owner of Koolar Cafe in Matunga, was also seen driving through his area with a siren blaring from his vehicle.

In both instances, the offenders were made to apologise for their actions on camera, apart from being booked for violating the lockdown.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-duo-apologises-on-camera-for-flouting-lockdown-rules/article31221288.ece
415,2020/03/31,Bombay HC extends stay on bail for Areeb Majeed till April 20,"The Bombay High Court on Tuesday extended till April 20 the stay on the bail granted to ISIS recruit Areeb Majeed, a Kalyan resident who was arrested in November 2014 for having travelled to Iraq and then Syria to join the global terrorist outfit. The court order came after NIA moved the high court seeking a month’s extension on the stay in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic.

NIA told the court that the agency had sought an urgent hearing before Bomaby High Court on March 26 as they had filed an appeal against the lower court’s order to grant bail to Mr. Majeed, and said the petition was before the registry for verification.

Justice S.S. Shinde extended the stay till April 20. In the meantime, the court has asked the registry to register the appeal filed by NIA and complete the process expeditiously so that it can be taken up for hearing.

A special NIA court had granted bail to Mr. Majeed on March 17 but had stayed its own order till March 27 after NIA moved a plea stating that it wanted to challenge the bail granted to Mr. Majeed before the Bombay High Court. Mr. Majeed is the only ISIS recruit to have returned to India.

Mr. Majeed, along with three other persons from Kalyan identified as Fahad Shaikh, Shaheem Tanki and Aman Tandel, had left India for Iraq under the guise of pilgrimage in May 2014, and had then joined the ISIS, and later went to Syria. While the three are believed to be killed in Syria, Mr. Majeed came back to India via Turkey in November 2014.

Earlier, Mr. Majeed had moved a bail plea before the Bombay High court after the same was rejected by the special NIA court. He had pleaded that he has been in custody since more than five years. The high court had then directed him to approach the NIA court again, and the court was asked to consider the plea afresh.

NIA in its chargesheet claimed that he had participated in several attacks perpetrated by ISIS, and that Mr. Majeed had sustained bullet injuries on two occasions, and was seriously injured in a bombing following which he had decided to return to India.

The agency claimed that Mr. Majeed wanted to sneak back into the country and had approached the Indian embassy in Turkey on November 24 claiming he had lost his passport and wanted to go back to India. NIA also claimed that Mr. Majeed was influenced by the terrorist group and its activities in the later half of 2013, and came in touch with Fahad Shaikh who operated a twitter handle by the name @magnetgas which he used to propagate the ISIS ideology. Mr. Majeed then came in touch with Shaheem Tanki and Aman Tandel and they planned to join ISIS and went to Iraq by booking a pilgrimage package for ₹2,37,500.

NIA claimed that the accused had got in touch with Rehman Daulati, an Afghan national, who had introduced them to an Iraqi national named Abu Fatima who helped Mr. Majeed and others join ISIS. Mr. Majeed was taken to an ISIS camp at Jhazira, and was given a new name and was known as Abu Ali Al Hindi.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bombay-hc-extends-stay-on-bail-for-areeb-majeed-till-april-20/article31220610.ece
416,2020/03/31,"COVID-19: Exempting certain category of prisoners not fair, say lawyers","As many as 130 lawyers have written to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court Pradeep Nandrajog pointing out that the high powered committees’s decision to exclude those charged under Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors Act (MPID), Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS), Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), foreign nationals and people from other States from being considered for parole or interim bail in light of the novel coronavirus pandemic is “shocking and unfair”.

The letter has been written by senior advocates Indira Jaisingh, Mihir Desai, Gayatri Singh, BA Desai, Sanjay Singhvi, advocate and activists Maharukh Adenwala and Susan Abraham, and others.

It mentions that on March 23, the Supreme Court took suo motu cognizance of the critical risk of COVID 19 infection spreading in overcrowded prisons across the country and gave certain directions. The court said, “each State and Union Territory should constitute a High Powered Committee comprising to determine which class of prisoners can be released on parole or an interim bail for such period as may be thought appropriate. For instance, the State/Union Territory could consider the release of prisoners who have been convicted or are undertrial for offences for which prescribed punishment is up to 7 years or less, with or without fine and the prisoner has been convicted for a lesser number of years than the maximum.”

The letter written on March 29 has also been sent to the senior-most judge of the high court, Justice A.A. Sayed, State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, additional chief secretary Shree Kant Singh, member of Maharashtra Legal Aid Services Shrikant Kulkarni, Director General of Police (Prisons) S.N. Pandey, and Additional Director General of Police (Prisons) Sunil Ramanand.

The letter welcomes Mr. Deshmukh’s decision to release 11,000 inmates but adds, “the high power committee’s decision to exclude people charged under MCOCA, PMLA, MPID, NDPS, UAPA, foreign nationals and people from other States is shocking and unfair.”

The lawyers suggest some categories that should be considered for release, “Prisoners and/or detained in other settings above 50 years of age, children in conflict with law detained at different settings, prisoners and/or detained in other settings with pre-existing health conditions, prisoners and/or detained in other settings with disability and mental illness, pregnant women and/or with children in prisons and/or detained in other settings, women prisoners and/or detained in other settings, category of convicts scheduled for early release.”

They have also suggested guidelines for released prisoners/detainees, “consent of prisoners, provision for safe transit, post release subsistence, medical assistance” and suggested guidelines for future arrests.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/covid-19-exempting-certain-category-of-prisoners-not-fair-say-lawyers/article31220474.ece
417,2020/03/31,Coronavirus | Maharashtra to pay salaries in two instalments,"No reduction in amount, assures Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray

As Maharashtra stares at a major economic crisis as a result of lockdown due to COVID-19, the State government has begun taking steps to cut down on the expenditure. In its first step, the government will be releasing salaries of March in two instalments.

Deputy Chief Minister and State Finance Minister Ajit Pawar said the decision was taken considering the grim financial condition of the State as well as to give moral and financial support to the fight against coronavirus. “The State was to receive its due amount of ₹16,654 crore from the Central government by March 31. But it did not receive the amount even on the last day and as a result, the State government was forced to take the decision to disburse the salaries in two instalments,” he said.

Mr. Pawar added that every employee would get the salary due, but in two instalments.

This was a change from an earlier statement where he had said that there will be a salary cut of up to 60% due to the financial impact of coronavirus and lockdown. The earlier statement had said that salaries of all elected representatives, including the Chief Minister, the Deputy Chief Minister and all Ministers, would be cut. For the month of March, only 40% of the total salary, including to the representatives in local civic bodies, will be given, the statement had said.

The earlier statement said that State government employees belonging to grade A and B will receive 50% salary, while Class C employees will get 75% of their remuneration. There will be no pay cut for Class D employees and no cuts in pension amount have been announced. This is applicable for the salaries of March and April 2020. However, a Government Resolution (GR) issued later said that the salaries would be given in two instalments and that there would be no cuts.

According to sources in the Finance Department, the Maharashtra government spends around ₹12,000 crore per month on salaries of its employees. Mr. Pawar on Monday written to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman demanding a special package worth ₹25,000 crore for Maharashtra. He had also demanded ₹16,654 crore dues from the Centre.

It’s a crisis: Uddhav

Issuing a clarification on the subject, in a social media address, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray too said there will be no salary cut of government employees.

“After this war against corona is over, we will be facing a financial crisis. We have to take actions and be prepared for it from now itself. For that, we have taken some measures. We will be giving salaries of government employees in instalments. No salary cut has been announced,” said Mr. Thackeray, appealing to citizens to not trust rumours.

The workers will be paid a subsistence allowance during the lockdown period by their contractors, which will then be reimbursed by the Authority. Joint metropolitan commissioner B.G. Pawar said the quantum of the allowance will be worked out by a committee.

MMRDA said that nearly 5,400 labourers were employed on various Metro projects, while 5,042 workers were on the trans harbour link, and 576 were engaged in other projects. MMRDA will also be contributing roughly ₹17 lakh to the CM’s Relief Fund by deducting a day’s salary from every employee.

420,2020/03/31,BMC to create GIS map of affected areas,"The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to carry out geographic information system (GIS) plotting of areas of Mumbai that have seen COVID-19 cases in order to allow residents to be more alert. It will also bring in final-year medical and nursing college students from municipal colleges to work in hospitals if the need arises.

The decisions were taken in a review meeting on Monday where Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi connected with the BMC top brass and the Health Department through video conferencing. IAS officer Ashwini Bhide, who will now be looking after the COVID-19 control room in Mumbai, too attended the meeting.

It was decided that the BMC would release the GIS maps online in order to make residents of that area more aware. It expects the residents to take social distancing even more seriously.

Another decision taken at the meeting was to requisition final-year medical students and second year, third year nursing students considering future demand in municipal hospitals. These students will be given training and deployed at outpatient departments or given similar responsibilities in municipal hospitals.

421,2020/03/31,People from Northeast face racist slurs amidst coronavirus lockdown,"Several employed in service sectors like spas, beauty parlours and salons are unable to make ends meet

It’s not uncommon for 35-year-old Chongpi Kipgen to be called ‘coronavirus’ when she steps out for groceries in her neighbourhood in Ulwe, Navi Mumbai. Hailing from Manipur, she has noticed a rise in racist attacks and discrimination against people from the Northeast living in Mumbai, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Before the lockdown, they used to call us Nepali, chinki, momo or chowmein, but now they look at me and say, ‘Go corona’ or blame me for eating animals that caused the spread of the virus,” says Ms. Kipgen. During the lockdown, discrimination is widely encountered while grocery shopping, where people distance themselves from Ms. Kipgen or ask her to go to the end of the queue. “They make faces or shopkeepers tell me sarcastically to go home and that they will deliver the food to us,” she says.

Zohmangaihzuali Kuri, a 38-year-old model coordinator from Mizoram, who has been living in Mumbai for close to two decades, says that people from the Northeast are often confused with the Chinese and have to prove their Indian identity. “Even though Mumbai is a very safe city, people are treating us very differently,” says Leo Tharmi Raikhan, a 34-year-old resident of Kalina, Santacruz, who hails from Manipur.

Apart from racial discrimination, several people from the Northeast, especially from Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland, work in the unorganised or service sectors like spas, salons, beauty parlours, restaurants or hotels, and are struggling to make ends meet. Ms. Kipgen, who works in a salon in Vashi, is dependent on the tips she gets from her customers, in addition to her salary. “In the salon or spa industry, we don’t make much money and now with no salary, we don’t know how to pay the rent or buy groceries,” she says. Ms. Kipgen has struck a deal with her landlord to cut the rent from her deposit money but has to pay the deficit in May.

Jangchon Lhouvum, chairman of Kuki Worship Service Mumbai, who moved to the city from Manipur, along with other community members like Mr. Raikhan are seeking help from the State government for people from the Northeast with basic grocery supplies and with a means to defer paying their rents.

“Before the lockdown, many of us managed to go back home, but now that’s not possible,” says Mr. Raikhan who downed shutters on his salon and spa in Kalina after the lockdown. He has been living in Mumbai for nearly two decades, and according to him, in Kalina alone there are close to 350 families from Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland, and most stay in rental homes in Juhu, Vakola and Khar Danda. A member of the Tangkul Welfare Society, Mr. Raikhan is advocating for funds for the community.

“If we can’t be helped with groceries, I hope the government can arrange a way for us to go back home,” says Ms. Kipgen. Unable to send any money home, the challenge for her is not only to survive the lockdown financially but also endure the growing discrimination because of her appearance.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hivvbo/article31212977.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31bm-Chongpi-Kipgen,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/people-from-northeast-face-racist-slurs-coronavirus-lockdown/article31212978.ece
422,2020/03/31,"Centre may open up Port Trust, mill land to tackle emergency","BJP delegation presents demands to Union ministers

The Centre is considering a request to open up its land parcels to set up emergency COVID-19-related infrastructure in the financial capital.

Union Shipping Minister Mansukh Lal Mandaviya and Textile Minister Smriti Irani have both agreed to open up land belonging to the Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) and mill land owned by the National Textile Corporation (NTC) for emergency measures to combat the evolving pandemic in Mumbai.

A delegation of senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders on Monday met Central ministers in New Delhi to present a charter of demands including opening up Central land parcels for the construction of quarantine, isolation and treatment facilities. The delegation, led by former cabinet minister Ashish Shelar and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis among others, said they have forwarded the in-principle approval notes from the two minsters to the State government, expecting a directive soon.

“The Shipping Ministry has agreed to process all such demands (open their land) once they formally receive them from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and State. The textile minister has also immediately agreed to take up any such request for making available suitable NTC mill land for creation of quarantine, isolation and treatment facilities,” said Mr. Shelar.

Last week, the Maharashtra government met Indian Army and local administration officials to identify open spaces and grounds that could be taken over for constructing quarantine facilities. Sources in the government said two locations are in the suburbs while one is in the island city.

“We are prepared to tackle the coronavirus. But if the number of positive patients goes up and an emergency situation arrives, we have identified three places in Mumbai where we can start isolation wards immediately for patients: Bombay Exhibition Centre, Goregaon, another Ground at Worli, and the Convention Centre at the Bandra Kurla Complex,” Cabinet Minister and Mumbai Guardian Minister Aslam Sheikh had said after the meeting.

423,2020/03/31,Man held for rumour-mongering on WhatsApp,"35-year-old claimed Mumbai was going to be put under “military rule”

The JJ Marg police on Sunday arrested a 35-year-old man for allegedly spreading a rumour on WhatsApp about the armed forces being called into certain areas populated by minority communities to bring the residents “under control.”

According to the police, the message was first posted on a WhatsApp group called Mumbai Ekta and listed out several localities in south and suburban Mumbai, which are predominantly inhabited by a specific minority community.

The message was on to say that the people from these areas were blatantly flouting the lockdown and had become “bekaabu (out of control)”, due to which military forces had been called in to rein in the situation.

The message was circulated to several other groups and within the hour, strong rumours of Mumbai being put under “military rule” started doing the rounds, sparking off panic in the areas named in the message. The concerned police station and control room personnel found themselves besieged with calls from citizens asking about the situation.

A special police team, with the help of local informants and technical investigation methods, set about tracing the origins of the message and ultimately traced it to the WhatsApp group where it was first posted. From there, the police identified the accused as Sohail Punjabi and he was arrested.

Senior police inspector Sanjeev Bhole, JJ Marg police station, said, “We have booked the accused for rumour-mongering and disobeying an order promulgated by a public servant under the Indian Penal Code along with relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act. The accused was later granted bail.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/man-held-for-rumour-mongering-on-whatsapp/article31212937.ece
424,2020/03/31,Technical education teachers to cover portions online,"Will use social media platforms and source materials online ; professors to seek feedback

The Maharashtra government has decided to go online to cover the remaining syllabus in technical education institutes during the lockdown period.

The Directorate of Technical Education will provide videos, and information related to the syllabus to students through social media platforms besides online source materials such as SWAYAM, NEAT, COURSERA, and edX.

Dr. Abhay Wagh, director, Technical Education Department, will be in charge of this.

“All professors and teaching staff have been given directions to work from home as a result of the lockdown. This may result in an educational loss for students and we want to avoid it,” said Higher and Technical Education Minister Uday Samant.

Apart from using online teaching tools, professors will also use video editing techniques such as screen-o-matic to create video clips, give out assignments on WhatsApp groups, solve students’ queries online, prepare and present the planning of the next educational term online, and set up question banks.

The directorate is also considering the option of online feedback. All institutes and professors will be sent Google forms to check which of the techniques they used, their outcome, and benefit to students.

“All divisional directors of technical education and principals of respective institutes will be responsibile for this,” said the minister.

To make it more effective, the directorate has said the 360-degree concept (a performance review in which subordinates, co-workers and managers anonymously rate the employee) to be implemented before applying the Seventh Pay Commission will include the feedback of professors’ work using these online teaching techniques.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/technical-education-teachers-to-cover-portions-online/article31212924.ece

426,2020/03/31,"Days later, traders at APMC breathe a sigh of relief","After mismanagement led to crowds, market opened in a systematic manner on Monday

After days of crowding and mismanagement, the APMC vegetable market started functioning in a systematic manner, maintaining social distancing with the help of police bandobast and bamboo barricades, on Monday.

A team headed by an Assistant Commissioner of Police, including around 100 Home Guards along with 150 personnel of the Navi Mumbai Police, 18 assistant and sub-inspectors and one police inspector, enforced the bandobast at the vegetable market.

“We made sure that social distancing was maintained and people stood on the marked area only. No vehicles that did not have permission were allowed inside the market. Only a limited number of people were being allowed inside the market, depending upon the number of people exiting,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone I) Pankaj Dahane said.

On Friday and Saturday, the unmanageable crowds at the market had scared the traders and they did not want to work at the market. With changes in the working pattern and strict restriction on the number of vehicles (not more than 300), the vegetable market had more breathing space, traders said. Of the 1,200 vehicles that brought the stock on Saturday, most were remaining, hence, the process began on Monday.

“The vegetables from Saturday are still pending and there were quite a few trucks that came in on Monday due to which the rates also went down,” Ramdas Pavle, a vegetable seller, from APMC market said. Meanwhile, the APMC board has started making a temporary arrangement at a ground in Sector 35, Kharghar, near Central Park. “The arrangement will be used only if necessary. There no plans to shift completely, if ever the need arises and if we feel that the crowd can’t be managed, we will shift a few traders there. As of now we are not letting retailers who buy small quantities in the market to avoid crowding,” Anil Chavan, secretary, APMC board, said.

On Monday, only one truck and 52 tempos had arrived with the stock in the vegetable market. Meanwhile, at the onion-potato market, 133 trucks and 81 tempos had arrived. The fruit market received four trucks and 153 tempos, and 10 trucks and three tempos came to the grain market.

427,2020/03/31,17 new cases in State; tally now 220,"Nashik records first positive case; BMC reports 47 fresh cases

The State recorded 17 new COVID-19 positive cases on Monday, taking its tally to 220. Nashik’s Niphad tehsil reported its first positive case, while fresh cases were reported from Mumbai (8), Pune (5), Nagpur (2), and Kolhapur (1).

Meanwhile, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) reported 47 new cases on Monday. Civic officials said the number rose after adding the data collected from private laboratories between March 24 and 28.

A BMC official said,“Eighteen patients have tested positive in private laboratories and the number has been updated now.”

State health officials said since they are yet to receive the overall data from the BMC, the figure has not been updated in the final tally.

Nashik District Collector Suraj Mandhare said, “A youth in his early 30s has tested positive. He is from Lasalgaon in Niphad teshsil. While we had sent 73 samples from the district for testing at Pune’s National Institute of Virology, 72 had returned negative. His was the only one to test positive. So, I again urge all citizens to remain indoors to prevent any community spread.”

No travel history

According to sources, the Niphad youth did not have any history of foreign travel. With five fresh cases being reported from Pune, the number of cases in the district has risen to 43. So far, 39 people across the State have been discharged from isolation facilities after recovering from the virus.

However, authorities in Sangli district have expressed fears of a rise in cases with four members of a family in Islampur tehsil, who had returned from Saudi Arabia, infecting several people, making it possibly the biggest case of cluster infection in the State. Till date, 25 people, of whom 24 are members of the Islampur family, have tested positive.

Since Sunday, a lockdown has been imposed in the tehsil and areas sealed in a 3.5 km radius from the residence of the patients. Authorities said 337 people who had come into contact with the Islampur family have been placed under quarantine. Supply of essential services will be strictly regulated during the three-day lockdown.

428,2020/03/31,"‘In eight days, all slum pockets in Mumbai will be disinfected’","Collecting samples at home will help contain the spread, it is necessary to use PPE kits judiciously, says additional municipal commissioner

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has pulled all its machinery to fight the novel coronavirus outbreak in the city. From screening travellers to manning the newly designated quarantine facilities and contact tracing to sanitisation activities, civic officials have been on the front line of the battle. In a conversation with The Hindu, additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani says every citizen should take responsibility to fight COVID-19. Excerpts:

The positive cases and deaths in Mumbai are rapidly increasing. Is the city’s health system equipped to take more load?

An analysis of all the deaths shows that these patients were immunocompromised. Each one of them had an underlying ailment which made it difficult for them to come out of the infection. Many of the positive patients were taken to Kasturba Hospital where we have seven jumbo oxygen cylinders, eight ventilators (invasive and non-invasive), and a battery of senior doctors. We have doctors from Nair Hospital coming to Kasturba as well as honorary specialists who offer guidance in treatment. Now, Kasturba is not the only hospital admitting patients. A 35-bed isolation ward has already started at Seven Hills Hospital and efforts are on to increase its strength to 100 beds. Ten private hospitals have also started isolations facilities. Besides, civic-run HBT Trauma Care, Kurla Bhabha, and Rajawadi hospitals have started functioning as isolation facilities.

Has the lockdown and fear of stigmatisation become a hindrance to the home-testing initiative of the BMC?

Instead of a patient, who fears exposure to the novel coronavirus, walking into a laboratory or hospital, collecting samples at home will help contain the spread of infection. There have been accounts that people are worried to allow technicians wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) to their homes due to the fear of being stigmatised. We have intensified our awareness drive so that people become more open to these options. There are also provisions now of a special vehicle going near the person’s residence. The person has to come to the vehicle to give the samples. The private laboratories have collected more than 1,000 samples from homes. The civic helpline is receiving 2,000-2,500 calls daily, and we answer all queries of the citizens and bust their myths, if any.

Is there a shortage of PPE for the civic healthcare staff?

At present, we have 8,700 PPE kits available. We have already placed an order for 30,000 more kits so that we have enough for the coming month. Having said that, it is also necessary for us to use the PPE kits judiciously because we may need more in the long run.

How many civic teams are on the ground to carry out sanitisation and contact tracing?

For disinfection, we have five teams who cover the areas where positive cases are reported from. These teams are now concentrated on the slum pockets and in about eight days, all slums will be covered. Our next target for disinfection is thickly populated areas like Kalbadevi and Bhendi Bazaar. We are positive that these disinfection activities will give a good result. For contact tracing, we have 24 teams on the ground, each consisting of three people. They are carrying out the tedious investigative job of extracting maximum information about the patient’s movement and contacts. The exercise starts in the hospital when a patient tests positive. Healthcare staff collect as many details as possible from the patient and his or her attendant and then pass on all details to the field teams. The field teams then get into action to trace all the contacts, send them for testing or quarantine them depending on the exposure. At times, multiple teams have to carry out contact-tracing for a single patient. We are also involving the police to help us.

The recent death of a south Mumbai doctor has raised questions about awareness among the affluent class. What exactly went wrong?

The case is extremely disturbing as we are talking about a family of doctors here. After one person, who returned from the U.K., developed slight symptoms, the family should have taken enough precaution as there was a senior citizen in the house. Secondly, the deceased’s son, also a doctor, conducted many procedures which was extremely irresponsible on his part. He should have avoided that. We are trying hard to stop the chain of infection but if well-aware educated people become ignorant, we cannot fight it. I urge every citizen to be self-disciplined, use the freedom judiciously during the lockdown, and be aware. Citizens should ensure that they eat good food, sleep well, and see a doctor if they have any symptoms. And in all circumstances, maintain a distance from each other as much as possible.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/i2dt19/article31212905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31BMSURESHKAKANI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/in-eight-days-all-slum-pockets-in-mumbai-will-be-disinfected/article31212855.ece

The State government on Monday directed all housing societies to not spray disinfectants on their premises as the local civic bodies have been entrusted with the task. The matter was taken up on Monday at a meeting of the high-power committee set up to monitor the spread of novel coronavirus and take measures to contain the disease.

After the meeting, an official said, “It has been decided that all spraying activities will be done only by local authorities. It is advised that no one should undertake this activity. The local authorities will analyse the situation and take appropriate decision about the location and type of spraying.”

The official said ever since the coronavirus outbreak, several housing societies have voluntarily disinfected their premises. “However, uncontrolled spraying of disinfectants may lead to new health complications. As a result, it is important that the activity is conducted in a controlled manner and only when absolutely necessary,” the official said.

430,2020/03/31,MERC cuts power tariff for discoms,"New rates to be applicable from April 1

Power consumers have something to cheer about during the lockdown with the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) ordering cuts in tariff for all power distribution companies to boost the State’s economy. The new rates will be applicable from April 1.

MERC chairman Anand Kulkarni said the rates were being slashed for the first time in 10 or 15 years. MERC has also imposed a moratorium on payment of fixed charges of electricity bills under the ‘Industrial’ and ‘Commercial’ categories for the next three billing cycles from March 25, when the 21-day nationwide lockdown took effect.

‘No burden on State’

Mr. Kulkarni said the government will not have to bear any financial burden and power distribution companies will be able to supply to consumers at a lower rate by operating in a more commercial manner.

The rates have been reduced for all consumers of the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited, the State’s largest power distribution company, which caters to nearly 2.6 crore consumers, barring Mumbai.

For domestic consumers, the tariff has been reduced by 5-7%, while industrial and commercial consumers stand to benefit by 10-12%. However, rates of agriculture consumers have been reduced by only 1%.

Tariff for Mumbai

In Mumbai, rates have been slashed for all three power distribution companies: Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) Undertaking, Tata Power Company (TPC) and Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (AEML).

For domestic consumers, BEST’s tariff has been reduced by 1-2%, while AEML and TPC will reduce rates by around 12% and 10% respectively.

For BEST’s industrial consumers, MERC has reduced the tariff by 7-8% . For commercial users, it has reduced rates by 8-9%.

For AEML and TPC’s industrial users, the rates have been reduced by 18-20% and for commercial users, the rates have been cut by 19-20%.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/merc-cuts-power-tariff-for-discoms/article31212843.ece
431,2020/03/31,4 more test positive in Worli Koliwada,"Fisherfolk colony locked down, disinfected; people screened

After four residents of Worli Koliwada tested positive for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on Sunday, four more positive cases have been reported from the area, including Adarsh Nagar and Janata Colony. The immediate family members of the patients have reportedly tested negative.

On Monday, the fisherfolk colony was locked down and disinfected using sodium hypochlorite to prevent further spread of the virus. A large number of residents were also screened for symptoms of the virus. The confirmed cases include a doctor from Worli who runs a clinic nearby.

Sachin Ahir, former Worli MLA and Shiv Sena leader, said, “There are eight confirmed cases now, but we cannot call this community spread. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is tracing the contacts of the first patient. The lockdown was enforced to stall further spread. We will ease restrictions from Tuesday so that people can go out to buy essentials.”

BMC workers are now conducting door-to-door visits to check if anyone is showing symptoms of COVID-19. The colony’s population of around 8,000, including a large number of migrants, live in ground-plus-one or two-storey houses. Most residents use public toilets, posing a major challenge to maintaining social distancing. Vegetable vendors in the colony have been moved to a different location to ensure social distancing.

433,2020/03/31,I-T official uses lockdown to stitch masks,"Sarika Jain stitches 10 every hour, distributes them to sanitation workers, drivers

Sarika Jain, Deputy Income Tax Commissioner, Mumbai, decided it was not enough to sit at home idle and watch the ‘disturbing’ COVID-19 situation unfold on her television screen. The differently-abled Indian Revenue Service officer, who secured an All India Rank of 527 in her civil services examination in 2013, has always taken up challenges in the face of adversity.

Observing the vulnerability of sanitation workers, drivers, security guards outside her home at Bandra, she decided to stitch face masks for those who did not have any protective gear.

“By the time lockdown was announced, these people on the streets were left most vulnerable to the virus,” she said. The masks would be basic in nature, “but I could not have made clinical masks, nor was I going to sit and do nothing about it.”

On a recent evening, as she was going home from work at the Income Tax Department, Bandra, she had a feeling the country was ‘soon going to face something unprecedented.’ “The buses and roads were getting emptier, with fewer people stepping out. I just did not want to sit at home doing nothing about it,” said Ms. Jain, who hails from Kantabanji town in Odisha’s Bolangir district, but has been posted in the financial capital for some years.

The day Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged citizens to stand on their balconies to clap and bang plates to appreciate the work of those at the forefront of the COVID-19 battle, Ms. Jain got to work: she bought herself a sewing machine and cloth worth ₹10,000.

What helped her devote time to the effort was the Central government’s decision to extend the date for time-barring cases under the Income Tax Act, allowing people in the department like her to come up with ways to help the disadvantaged during the COVID-19 lockdown.

Ms. Jain started putting in five hours a day, stitching 50 masks or 10 every hour. Some days she would even do 100 with a little help from her mother-in-law.

Once complete, a family member goes around in the locality distributing the masks, which has helped hundreds so far with basic protection against the virus. “It is a lot of labour for her to put the masks together since stitching each takes a lot of time. But she has always been a fighter,” said her husband Virag Shah, an accountant.

Ms. Jain said she has so far distributed nearly 500 masks and hopes to continue till the raw material lasts. “I know what I am doing is not enough in the larger scheme of things, but I am not one of those persons who would sit at home and do nothing. This is my message to citizens: they should each contribute in their own way without breaking the lockdown protocols.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/arwxji/article31212778.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BM-Sarika-jain,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/i-t-official-uses-lockdown-to-stitch-masks/article31212774.ece
434,2020/03/31,Police tighten vigil to check smuggling,"Vehicles transporting daily-wage labourers intercepted at four locations on Sunday

Following four attempts at smuggling people to their home towns, despite the lockdown, being busted on Sunday, the Mumbai Police have stepped up vigilance across the city.

The smuggling bids, where daily-wage labourers from various parts of the city were found crammed into trucks or tempos, had come to light during routine nakabandis. The police counselled the labourers, and arrested and booked the owners and drivers of the vehicles.

Police officers said while there had been sporadic attempts over the past week, Sunday’s incidents was an indicator of the rising panic.

“We have stepped up nakabandis and bandobast. We are also visiting areas where daily-wage labourers from other States stay in large numbers and are holding counselling sessions to assure them that solutions to their problems are being worked upon,” Mumbai Police spokesperson DCP Pranaya Ashok said.

Mr. Ashok said the main concern for the labourers is to get two square meals a day, as their subsistence depends on the money they earn on a day-to-day basis. “We are in touch with various agencies like the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and local NGOs so that relief can be arranged for them at least on a temporary basis.”

Police personnel said local informants are being tapped for tip-off on any such attempts.

“Such rackets rely only on word-of mouth publicity and we are tapping all our informants in the labourer circuit and related fields so that we can foil any such bids,” an inspector-rank officer at a suburban police station said.

The first racket was busted by the Saki Naka police in the early hours of Sunday, where 64 labourers were found in a truck bound for Uttar Pradesh. The next incident was at Sewri in the evening, where two tempos carrying 59 people were intercepted. The Andheri and Charkop police rescued 17 and 75 labourers from tempos at night.

In all the cases, the drivers and owners were booked for disobedience of an order promulgated by a public servant and negligence likely to spread infection of a disease under the Indian Penal Code along with sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/rdmkks/article31212765.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31BMLABOURERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/police-tighten-vigil-to-check-smuggling/article31212754.ece
435,2020/03/31,Three nurses with 2 south Mumbai hospitals positive,"Three nurses attached to hospitals in south Mumbai have tested positive after they were likely exposed to two patients without any international travel history or COVID-19-like symptoms. While one patient was brought to the hospital with a heart attack, another patient was undergoing dialysis.

In the first case, a 70-year-old man was brought to the emergency department of Wockhardt Hospital, and he was immediately taken in for an angioplasty. During his recovery, he developed respiratory distress and fever on the fourth day of admission and was immediately moved to the isolation facility.

“During the course of his cardiac treatment, the patient was exposed to doctors and other staff due to which we immediately took precautionary measures and quarantined them. One nurse had developed mild symptoms the same day as the patient, and both their samples were sent for testing,” said Dr. Parag Rindani, centre head of Wockhardt Hospital, adding the samples came positive on March 28.

“The second nurse tested positive on Monday,” he said, adding both the nurses — a female and a male — were stable and were admitted to the hospital’s isolation facility, which started a week ago. The nine-bed facility has a separate entry and exit, and is a paper-less department to ensure there are no chances of infection spread.

In the second case, a patient was brought to Jaslok Hospital for another ailment and required dialysis. The patient later developed respiratory discomfort and was suspected for COVID-19. But during the treatment of his other ailment, he was exposed to medical and non-medical staff, who were screened and quarantined.

Sources said one nurse, who was posted in the dialysis unit, came positive. The nurse has been admitted to the isolation facility of the hospital and is stable. Sources also said at least 11 other people in the hospital were in quarantine.

436,2020/03/31,BMC withdraws circular on burial of infected bodies,"Within hours of issuing it, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Monday withdrew a controversial circular that called for the cremation of bodies of those who succumbed to COVID-19, and that if such a body were to be buried, to move it out of the city.

In the revised circular, the BMC has allowed burial within Mumbai provided the burial ground is large enough to ensure there is no threat of transmission to the area’s residents.

There have been incidents in Mumbai where the bodies of coronavirus patients were disposed of in haste, without following due process or guidelines. Globally, there have been incidents where people who attended the funeral of such a patient contracted the virus later.

On Monday, Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi issued a circular that read, “All the bodies of COVID-19 patients should be cremated at the nearest crematorium irrespective of religion. Rituals involving touching the body should be avoided…” The circular also said packaging the body in plastic and burying it prevents early decomposition and risks spread of the virus. Hence, all COVID-19 bodies should be cremated to avoid chances of transmission in the community, and burial should not be allowed, it said. “However, if someone insists on burying the body, he will be permitted only if the body is taken out of Mumbai… The funeral should not involve more than five people.”

The circular was the result of information that burial grounds located in densely populated localities could lead to transmission. But it led to an uproar as it was seen to be unfair towards Muslims and Christians, given that they would have to take the body out of Mumbai if it were to be buried.

Cabinet Minister Nawab Malik and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Kirit Somaiya raised the issue, following which the BMC revised the circular.

The new circular has allowed burial within the city provided, “the burial grounds are large enough so as not to create possibility of spread of virus in the neighbouring area and other arrangements are made by all concerned on their own following guidelines and precautions…” The rest of the circular remains the same.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bmc-withdraws-circular-on-burial-of-infected-bodies/article31212732.ece

438,2020/03/31,Volkswagen Tiguan AllSpace review: An SUV that’s hard to gloss over,"The depth of engineering, the tough build, and the borderline exciting engine are qualities that will appeal to discerning buyers

The Tiguan was always a very likeable premium SUV, with its Germanic looks, high-quality interior and pleasant driving experience. Now, it has been replaced by the Tiguan Allspace you see here. You can think of the Allspace as an XL-sized Tiguan; it’s 110mm longer in its wheelbase and 215mm longer overall and sees the all-important addition of a third row of seats as well.

However, there is a catch. Where the Tiguan ran on diesel, which is the fuel of choice for Indian SUV buyers, the Allspace is a petrol-only model. So, how does the package come together?

At first glance, the Allspace isn’t too different from the standard Tiguan. The front end is unchanged, with the only real point of difference being the absence of cladding lower down. It’s in profile that the Allspace looks like the stretched-out Tiguan. The larger cabin section and longer rear overhang mean the proportions aren’t quite as appealing as the taut Tiguan, but the design is still neat and clean. The tail end is also similar to what we’ve seen before, with the addition of chrome surrounds for the faux exhausts.

The cabin too is quite familiar, and the first thing you note, as before, is the level of quality. All control surfaces feel long-lasting, the doors shut with a reassuring thunk and there is generous use of soft-touch materials around the cabin too. The dashboard doesn’t look cutting-edge today, but it is thoughtfully designed and puts all controls within easy reach. An important upgrade on the Allspace is the Audi-like digital instrument cluster. The readout is crisp and clear, and gives the option to toggle between layouts. You are not sat all that high up (as SUVs go) but the large windscreen and big glasshouse still offer a great view out. The front seats are pretty firm, but they are nicely sculpted and hold you tightly in place, offering fantastic all-round support.

The middle-row seats, too, are supportive, with generous bolstering to hold you snugly in place. There’s loads of legroom (with the 60:40 seats slid back, that is), and you even have the option to adjust the backrest angle, albeit via flimsy tags. There’s enough room for a middle passenger too, though the seat is best for two. Fold-out trays and a 12V charging socket at the back are handy inclusions, though sunscreens for the large rear windows would have been nice.

Moving to the third row, access via the rear doors requires some twisting and turning, and once inside, you’ll find that space is strictly limited. You’ll need to work out a knee-room compromise with the middle-row passengers, and headroom is also tight for anyone above average height. The space is fine for children, and perhaps adults on the occasional intra-city jaunt. The third row is best left folded down, and doing so increases the Allspace’s reasonable 230-litre luggage space (with all seats up) to 700 litres. You can also fold the middle-row seats to free up cargo van levels of room.

There is plenty of kit on offer too. Features of interest include the aforementioned digital dials, a full-length panoramic sunroof, three-zone climate control, powered driver seat with memory, a powered tailgate, a slick 8.0-inch touchscreen and hands-free parking. The safety kit includes seven airbags, ESC and ASR (anti-slip regulation), while front and rear parking sensors and LED headlights with dynamic cornering function are also standard fit.

The Tiguan Allspace is powered by a 2.0-litre, turbocharged, direct-injection TSI petrol engine that delivers 190hp at 4,200rpm and max torque of 320Nm from 1,500-4,100rpm. Power is channelled to all four wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission.

Drivers might miss that ready low-end pulling power of a diesel engine, but, nonetheless, progress is brisk with the engine coming into its element post 2,000rpm. Like all TSI engines, the unit feels its best in the mid-range, with a thick swathe of torque at your disposal. Power comes in strong, making overtaking a non-event. Of course, the quick-shifting gearbox chips in by keeping the engine in the meat of the powerband. Press on, and it’s a lot of fun extending the engine to 6,000rpm. Drive modes help alter the experience, but you get the most out of the powertrain in its ‘Sport’ setting. Paddleshifters and manual shifts via the gear lever also add a nice degree of driver involvement.

The Allspace is quick, too, and posts a 0-100kph time of 8.8sec. For reference, the old Tiguan diesel with 143hp and 340Nm did the 0-100kph sprint in 10.55sec. Similarly, acceleration in kick-down is also faster than the outgoing diesel. Of the other things, the petrol engine is smooth but gets a bit vocal at middle revs, which some might find sporty.

Handling is neutral and with good grip at all times, but the Allspace is not as agile as the smaller Tiguan. The steering also feels too inert to really involve you, and while you can add weight to it via the settings on the touchscreen, a more connected feel would be welcome.

The Allspace rides like a typical European car. That is a polite way to say that the suspension can’t filter out the worst of our roads, with a firm edge at low speeds. On the plus side, high-speed stability is really good, making the Tiguan Allspace a competent highway cruiser. In fact, for long-distance trips, the swift, spacious and surefooted Tiguan Allspace is a great companion.

Like the standard Tiguan, the Allspace also gets off-road modes, selectable via a dial, that controls engine, steering, AWD and electronics settings. Hill-descent control is also included.

Priced at ₹ 33.12 lakh (ex-showroom, India), the Tiguan Allspace costs about ₹ 2 lakh more than the outgoing Tiguan TDI Highline. Like the Tiguan, the Allspace is not an SUV for everyone. It’s not the largest of SUVs for the money, nor is it the best 7-seater around. The absence of a diesel engine option is also sure to be a red flag for many.

Yet, the Allspace is an SUV that’s hard to gloss over. The depth of engineering, the tough build, and the borderline exciting engine are qualities that will appeal to discerning buyers. If you are one, act fast because the Tiguan Allspace is being brought to India as a limited-run import.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/xquntn/article31216844.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1MP-Volkswagen-1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/allspace-the-stretched-out-volkswagen-tiguan/article31216855.ece
439,2020/03/31,TVS Apache RR310 gets a BS-VI update,"The two seemingly obvious changes come in the form of the switch to BS-VI and a new 5.0-inch TFT display

It is quite easy to dismiss, but over the years I have discovered that a small number of seemingly unassuming changes in a motorcycle can result in a world of difference in the way it rides. For example, there is almost no difference between the Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 and the Continental GT 650, aside from the ergonomics, but you’d be surprised at how different the two bikes feel when ridden. It’s a similar story with the 2020 TVS Apache RR310, and we flew into Chennai expecting to try out a few small changes, but came away experiencing a noticeably finer riding experience.

With that in mind, it’s unfortunate that TVS didn’t change much in terms of the design because that would have made it clearer to the customer just how much work the company has put in. Visually, the only differences are the ‘Titanium Black’ colour scheme you see here (the trademark red scheme continues), and a new detachable windscreen designed to make it easier for you to clean those hard-to-reach spaces. Beyond this, the two seemingly obvious changes come in the form of the switch to BS-VI and a new 5.0-inch TFT display.

The new display continues with the old LCD’s unusual vertical orientation, but this one is far nicer to look at and is a lot more informative to boot. It’s controlled via fresh switchgear on the left handlebar that looks premium and is intuitive to use. TVS has also thrown in the latest version of its Bluetooth smartphone app, which unlocks a whole host of features, including ride statistics, motorcycle status data, navigation assists, and the ability to make and receive phone calls as well. If you like your toys, you’ll love the design and functionality this new screen brings.

All this hardly affects the riding experience, and that’s where we come to one of the biggest changes for this year — the introduction of a new ride-by-wire throttle system. This not only feels different to the rider’s right hand, but it also brings in a whole new level of adjustability for the bike. The RR now comes with four riding modes — Rain, Urban, Sport and Track. These modes offer different set-ups based on the engine power/response and ABS.

In Rain and Urban modes, you get a gentle throttle response and a significant drop in power to 25.8hp, while torque takes a small drop, down to 25Nm. In Sport and Track modes, though, you get the full 34hp and 27.3Nm of torque. The throttle response in the top two modes is also sharper than it used to be, and there were a few moments where I thought it was a bit too sharp. I’m keen to see what this is like in city traffic because if you want a mellower throttle, you’re going to have to settle for one of the lower power modes which will definitely feel much slower.

The dual-channel ABS set-up is improved as well, and it now has three different levels of intervention, with maximum sensitivity in Rain mode, normal sensitivity in Urban and Sport modes, and a more lenient oversight in Track mode. Each riding mode gets its own theme on the TFT display; you can even customise this by selecting the data widgets you’d like to see. You can’t turn it off though, or disable the rear-wheel ABS. Most customers, however, will spend their time on the street, and TVS has tried to make their lives easier too.

The RR gets the company’s new Glide Through Plus technology. This system manipulates the fuelling to let the bike move forward smoothly at a low speed in each gear, without letting the revs drop too low. It worked quite well while pulling into the pitlane, and the system deactivates the moment you either touch the brakes or pull in the clutch. It’ll be interesting to see how it feels in day-to-day traffic.

As for the engine, this is one of the best BS-VI upgrades I’ve experienced so far. TVS claims the same 2.93sec 0-60kph acceleration time and 160kph top speed, but when you’re in Sport and Track mode, it feels like the engine actually revs a little faster and freer than the one it replaces. Perhaps the best of all is that there has been a significant improvement in refinement. The engine sounds tighter and, for the first time, I rode the RR around the track without a single thought of vibrations popping into my head. There is still a mild buzz in the seat area at lower rpms — which we’re going to have to evaluate on the street — but when you’re riding flat-out on the track, you simply don’t notice anything, and that’s a big deal for the RR310.

Another massive contributor to the RR’s heightened sense of dynamics is the new Michelin Road 5 tyres. These are a huge improvement over the very average Pilot Street tyres on the previous RR. Grip levels are much higher, and they’re also reputed to be excellent in wet-weather conditions. But what I really liked is how they’ve turned the RR into an even sharper cornering machine. The bike leans in noticeably faster now and with less effort; so much so, that many of us found that the foot pegs were scraping much more than before, even with the feeler bolts removed. On these tyres, and with the less-intrusive ABS in Track mode, there’s no doubt that the new RR will set a faster lap time, despite the 4.5kg increase in kerb weight.

The 2020 RR310, then, is a better-equipped motorcycle, and one that’s even more rewarding to ride. TVS has hiked the price by ₹ 12,000, which seems reasonable for what you’re getting. At ₹ 2.4 lakh (ex-showroom), the RR310 is now just ₹ 8,000 less than the considerably more powerful RC390 — and that’s hard to ignore if you’re after outright speed and lap times. However, the RR continues to differentiate itself as it did before — in fact, even better so with this update — and it completely outdoes its rival in terms of electronics. If you want a faired motorcycle that’s easy to live with on the road, yet entertaining on the racetrack, the RR310 is still the sweetest bike at this price.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/ed3ab5/article31216593.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1MP-TVS-2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/tvs-apache-rr310-gets-a-bs-vi-update/article31216604.ece
440,2020/03/31,How Australia was the start of something special for India — and one Indian,"It is not just television that is connecting us with past experiences; our minds are doing that too

How did it all begin, we ask ourselves in these unsettling times. Not the pandemic — we know the answer to that one — but our personal passions. It is not just television that is replaying old matches and connecting us with past experiences; our minds are doing that too.

In the winter of 1967, I fell in love with cricket. Completely, irrevocably, conclusively. First, in the pages of Sport and Pastime, and then on radio where I followed my first series as India played in Australia. The magazine was serialising Ralph Barker’s two books, Ten Great Innings and Ten Great Bowlers. My early heroes, thus, were Spofforth and Grace, Ranji and McLaren, Spooner and Lohmann.

“This thing,” Spofforth was quoted as saying, “can be done.” I marvelled at the certainty of a bowler who could personally guarantee England would not score 85 runs to win. Today, it isn’t the words I remember so much as the emotions: my madeleine, unlocking memory in the Proustian manner.

I remember my mother, ear fixed to the radio, keeping scores as Farokh Engineer and Chandu Borde put on a partnership. Mother kept scores and updated friends. She taught me the joy of listening to cricket. The sport was an audio treat before it became a visual one. When dad came home from work, they would discuss the day’s play. Dad and Mom fired a boy’s imagination, helped by an uncle who had played the game.

Heroes began to emerge to replace those distant ones in books: Erapalli Prasanna, who claimed 25 wickets in that series and brought India back into the match many times. M.L. Jaisimha, who arrived in Brisbane one afternoon and scored a Test century the next day. Engineer, Ajit Wadekar, Bishan Bedi, and above all the captain, the Nawab of Pataudi, who missed the first Test, and finished with scores of 75 and 85, 74 and 48, 51 and 6 — I haven’t had to look these up! That 74 was in Brisbane where he shared the top score with Jaisimha; the 48 was a let-down. A few more, and India might have won the Test they lost by just 39 runs. Jack Fingleton wrote that India could have won two Tests.

Pataudi said later that the Australians were not as good as the 4-0 scoreline suggested, and that if the series had begun with the Brisbane Test, the result might have been different. He was probably right, since India followed that with a 3-1 victory in New Zealand, their first series victory abroad (the West Indies under Garry Sobers who toured next could only draw 1-1).

That tour was important, and not just for firing the imagination of a little boy far away. It was the first step India took to coming together as a team and demanding a place at the high table, something that would be conceded with series wins in the West Indies and England three years later.

World class spin combination

A world class spin combination came together. The spearhead, Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, had to return home after breaking down in the first Test. That brought the focus on off spinner Prasanna, who finished with 49 wickets in the twin series. India’s strengths and weaknesses were both on public display — the reliance on spin, and the woeful catching. Bob Cowper and Ian Chappell made big centuries aided by dropped catches.

On one horrendous occasion, two fielders running for a catch — Rusi Surti and V. Subramanyam — clashed, and the latter broke his nose. That was another memory of that period. For, when Subramanyam returned to Bengaluru, he was admitted to the same hospital where an aunt was having surgery too.

“Do you want to meet a cricketer?” my father asked. He had checked with Subramanyam, who had kindly agreed. I can recall the feel of dad’s hand as I slipped mine into it. Subramanyam, nose bandaged, speaking strangely, greeted me warmly. His was the first Test star’s hands I shook, a story I lived off for a while. Decades later at a function in Bengaluru, I narrated this story to Subbu (familiarity breeds contraction), and his spontaneous response was, “Of course I remember that handshake.” Lovely man.

Over the years, members of the squad became good friends. Tiger Pataudi himself, a conversation-stopper whenever he entered a room. Bedi, whose biography I wrote. The late Jaisimha, in whose company I watched junior matches. Prasanna, who told me when I first began reporting, “I shall be keeping an eye on you.” Wadekar, whose room on tours when he was manager, was “liberty hall”, open to friend and foe alike. Chandrasekhar, whose self-deprecating humour remains unmatched.

1967 was also the year I determined to play for India. I calculated that some of the players on that Australian tour would be colleagues when I made my debut (in my mind I was a child prodigy). Sadly, I went from being a promising youngster to a has-been without a significant career in between. These things happen.

441,2020/03/31,How people of Arunachal Pradesh’s Vijaynagar have lived in lockdown for 60 years,"Surrounded by Myanmar on three sides Vijaynagar does not even have a road connecting it to the rest of the world

After half-an-hour of it-is-making-me-nervous flying, the Mi-17 slowly descends. Most of the flight has been over densely forested mountain ranges, interspersed with the continuous white curl of the Dihing River winding its way across the landscape like a giant snake. Our luggage is piled in the centre of the chopper; benches along both sides have passengers strapped to their seats. Most of them are soldiers from the Assam Rifles, India’s oldest paramilitary force, returning to their post.

Peering out of the window, the wind whipping my hair into a bird nest, I find specks of green turning into soldiers standing with their backs towards the helipad, the wind from the chopper’s blades making their trousers flap like fans unfurling from their socks. On a raised hillock sit crouched men, women and children — also with their backs to the helipad, shielding themselves from the wind blast.

A cluster of small huts stands bravely in the desolate landscape. Villagers crowd around the chopper, some waiting to be ferried back, others just curious to see who has come. I have been told to carry packets of salt as gifts for the old soldiers, but the obvious joy with which they accept it tells me how precious it is.

A quiet place

Surrounded by Myanmar on three sides, Vijaynagar is the remote end of Changlang district in Arunachal Pradesh. An impregnable protected forest called the Namdapha National Park, inhabited by wild animals, surrounds it. The story goes that in the early 1960s, India received alarming reports of Chinese ingression into Arunachal. It was decided that soldiers from the Assam Rifles should be encouraged to settle down here to discourage foreign ingression. Two expeditions were taken. Soldiers from the second one, led by Major General AS Guraiya, Inspector-General, Assam Rifles, ferried material and constructed an airfield there at a height of nearly 5,000 feet.

The airstrip was named Vijaynagar after Guraiya’s son, Vijay. Soon after, a Kalinga aircraft landed there, bringing 100 Assam Rifles soldiers who established a company post and started border-guarding duties. Slowly, old retired soldiers and families started joining them with the number rising to 240.

Smiling old Savitri Damai tells me that she was just 27 when her husband Rifleman Sanman Damai accepted the Government’s offer in 1971. The couple, along with their three children, got on the plane from Mohanbari airfield. It was the first time she was getting into a “hawai jahaj” and she was very scared, she says. She carried in her arms her youngest son who was just two months old and firmly held by the hand her six-year-old daughter. Her husband held their second son while also balancing a carton with holes cut into it that held the family’s most precious possession — a fat and confused hen, clucking in annoyance. When the aircraft landed in Vijaynagar, Savitri’s heart sank. The airfield was in the middle of a dense forest. But her husband and the other soldiers pulled out their khukris and set about clearing the forest to make huts. She soon discovered that while the land was fertile and could grow the best of tomatoes, lai patta (a kind of mustard), rice and corn, there was no one there to sell them salt, sugar, spices or oil. It was only when her husband went on leave that he would get these commodities, that she would carefully ration, trying her best to make them last as long as she could.

Echoes from a forgotten past

Savitri’s son Rifleman Sunil Damai was born in Vijaynagar in a home delivery assisted by older women. “There would hardly be any studies at our school, since teachers wouldn’t come to Vijaynagar. Mostly, we managed on our own and helped with farming. Sometimes we would light a lantern, but since kerosene was precious, my mother would cook on a log fire. We would eat in its light and go to sleep when it got dark. We would see the helicopter coming every week and that was entertainment,” says Sunil, adding, “I had never seen a car or cinema hall or even light bulbs till I walked 150 kilometres to Miao, to give my Class X exams. It was a seven-day walk. We returned with our backpacks stuffed with grocery.”

I meet Naik Zachhinga Ralte, an 80-year-old retired soldier of 1 Assam Rifles, who was flown to Vijaynagar in March 1969. Old and bent, he is still remarkably fit. “I was posted in Aizawl, when at our daily roll call, an announcement was made that the Government was looking for volunteers to settle down in Vijaynagar. Those who volunteered would get all facilities and a piece of land. Six of us volunteered and a Dakota brought us here,” Ralte remembers.

I also meet Dr Gumlat Maio, 32, a Government doctor who was posted to Vijaynagar in June 2017. The place hadn’t had a doctor for 10 years. “I was shocked to see that the place had no roads or electricity, or medicines in the hospital,” he says.

Rifleman Jagan Singh Thapa also came to Vijaynagar in 1969. “I was 30 then,” he says, “Here, I met 18-year-old Lakshmi, whose father was a retired soldier. We married, have three sons, two of whom are serving in the Assam Rifles.”

There is a twinkle in his old faded eyes. I would have liked to talk to him more, but the chackk-chak-chak of the chopper tells me it is time to leave. A few shops have opened in Vijaynagar over the years, but the prices of goods are exorbitant since grocery has to be carried as head load from Miao. Salt sells at ₹150 a kilogram and sugar at ₹250 a kilogram.

Other than the weekly visits from the Mi-17s, aircraft no longer land in Vijaynagar. The airfield where Savitri and her family had landed broke down long back. For a short while, a mud track existed from Miao to Vijaynagar. However, soon the jungle swallowed that too.

In February 2013, the foundation of a 157-kilometre road, that was to connect Miao to Vijaynagar under the Prime Minister’s Gram Sadak Yojana, was laid. Just 15 kilometres of the road was constructed and then that too fell into disrepair.

442,2020/03/31,COVID-19: Social media overrun by DIY standing desks during lockdown,"With people around the world working from home during the ongoing lockdown, ergonomics is still taken seriously as they try fashion their own standing desks

Let’s face it, productivity is the name of the game when one works from home owing to the Coronavirus lockdown. Social media is ablaze with posts about how to DIY a standing desk or sit-stand desk. This means home improvement on a very resourceful level. After all, stepping outside for a quick run around the block is restricted at this time.

In one of the many circulating tweets, founder of Delhi-based Red Carpet Up, Sandeep Srinavasa shared a photo of his standing desk, “WFH productivity hack: Get a standing desk (even if it is books on a table) 1. You exercise your back muscles, 2. Standing forces you to take a break away from the computer which increases productivity when you come back to it.” He cheekily adds, “Standing desks are the Shaolin Kung Fu of WFH warriors.”

A typical standing desk is a mechanical desk of which the table-top can be raised or brought lower at the press of a button. This action does not require the repositioning of the desk nor does it require too much adjustment of cables for the user’s electronics. The offices of most multinational companies and new startups feature standing desks which have become a necessity rather than just an extra accessory or perk. For many, these smart-furnishings help them tackle productivity while not wasting away in a chair for several hours at a stretch.

Quirky yet functional

So back to the work-from-home social media trend. If you want to be as productive as you are at work, why not mimic the settings as much as possible? The most common and acceptable method seen on Twitter and Instagram is where one just piles large books into a waist-high stack, upon which the laptop is set.

Some more creative examples include: former politico @EricHorvath using the handlebars of his baby’s stroller as a standing desk. Another from @adequateaaron showed a laptop resting on the near-top shelf of their wardrobe. Biologist @jw_tsang shared her laptop on top of an ironing table. Podcast host @enjus ventured into risky territory by setting up his workstation on his switched-off induction stove, which we would not recommend.

There is a lot of credible research available online about the science behind a standing desk. A 2019 study ‘The ups and downs of sit-stand desks’ by Dr April Chambers for University of Pennsylvania explains, “[Study participants’] work showed that use of a [sit-stand desk or SSD] effectively got participants to sit less and stand more and that the device made users more comfortable at work.” But there is a disclaimer, “However, many frustrations with SSDs stem from the physiological outcomes. Early adopters were fed the idea that these desks would be the miracle cure for obesity, but users were not achieving the results they expected.” The study adds that while participants experienced small decrease in blood pressure or low back pain relief, weight loss or calorie burning could not yet be established.

Probably one of the best aspects of making your own standing desk is that you can use literally anything practical around the house and, often, you will find yourself using that old organic chemistry textbook gathering dust on the bookshelf. Another welcome fact is that there is no embarrassment factor here; if you did this at your office, you might receive a few odd glances. But at home, the freedom is uninhibited.

Rather than run-of-the-mill memes or inspirational quotes of the day, the Internet over the past few weeks has also become a place for strangers or familiars to share snippets into their lives as work-from-home warriors... and with most of the world in the same boat, the scale of this is clearly global.",homes and gardens,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/7eqn5m/article31216671.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/shelly-tan,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/social-media-overrun-by-diy-standing-desks-during-covid-19-lockdown/article31216672.ece

445,2020/03/31,"Three wards in Villupuram municipality cordoned off, declared containment zone","The move follows three persons from Villupuram town testing positive for COVID-19, Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam said

Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam on Tuesday said that following the confirmation of three persons from Villupuram town testing positive for COVID-19, the administration had declared three municipal wards that fall under the patients’ locations, a containment zone. The three wards have been cordoned off with the authorities and police enforcing it.

Addressing a press conference here, he said that as many as 17 persons from Villupuram had attended the conference in Nizamuddin, Delhi. Of the seven samples tested among the group that returned to Villupuram, three had tested positive and were under isolation in the Villupuram Government Medical College and Hospital (VGMCH) while the results of four others are awaited. The immediate family members of the patients have also been placed under home quarantine.

The municipal wards of 6,7 and 8 have been locked down and all the 43 streets in these wards have been disinfected to prevent further spread of the virus. Over 100 teams comprising of health workers are now conducting door-to-door visits in the three wards to check if anyone is showing symptoms of COVID-19.

Mr. Shanmugam said that the district administration had sealed the entire geographical area of the wards, restricting entry and exit of people in and out of the zone. Vehicular movement is also banned and officials from the police, health and municipal departments will be monitoring the zone through CCTVs to curtail the movement of people and vehicles.

He said that all essential commodities including groceries and ₹1,000 cash assistance announced to all cardholders by the government would be delivered at home to the 1,678 families in the three wards.

The Minister also called upon the people to follow physical distancing as that was the only option to contain the spread of COVID-19.

446,2020/03/31,"People throng temporary markets in Puducherry, do not follow physical distancing","The crowd swelled after 9 a.m. at the market at the new bus stand, and police had a difficult time controlling the large number of people

Physical distancing went for a toss with hundreds of people thronging the temporary markets, which opened at nine centres across the city on Tuesday. In spite of repeated appeals by the Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy to the people to adhere to physical distancing in the current context of the lockdown, people were seen gathering around the new markets.

Initially, the flow of shoppers was minimal and there was discipline on their part to adhere to physical distancing. However, the situation became awry after 9 a.m. after the crowd swelled presumably due to panic buying.

At the new bus stand, one of the venues for the vegetable market, people thronged the vegetable stalls. While officials were seen advising the people to wear masks and maintain physical distancing, local residents were in no mood to listen. Most of the vendors and the people were seen wandering around the stalls without wearing masks. The police personnel had a tough time in controlling the huge crowd that had gathered at all the stalls.

With the officials relaxing the lockdown period from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. to enable the public to purchase essential commodities, vehicular traffic was back on the roads. Though the police had put barricades on the Maraimalai Adigal Salai and other arterial roads, motorists sneaked through the spaces between the barricades.

An official said that there were no restrictions on transport of grocery items and vegetables and the administration had ensured supply of vegetables during the lockdown.

“But people have failed to understand the significance of the 21-day lockdown and also to impose self-restriction upon themselves. Despite restrictions, people have been wandering about unnecessarily and congregating at various places defeating the very purpose of the lockdown. If this continues, Puducherry would face a serious threat,” he said.

At the Uzhavar Sandhai in Odiansalai, police resorted to pressuring the vendors to wind up the business for the day finding a large number of people swarming around vegetable outlets.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/wbsr0v/article31215209.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31MARTH--MARKET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/people-throng-temporary-markets-in-puducherry-do-not-follow-physical-distancing/article31215211.ece
447,2020/03/31,GetLitt! offers free access to its digital library during the lockdown,"A variety of e-books for children and storytelling videos is now available online

“I usually enjoy reading out to my kids,” says an exhausted parent, “but now it just seems way too much work.” The lockdown is causing parents to wonder how to keep their kids occupied, especially the younger ones. To help them through this time, GetLitt! is giving free access to its gamified digital reading library until April 21.

Interesting challenges and rewards keep the kids hooked | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

GetLitt! is a reading app for children between seven and 12 that has a collection of e-books across genres like fairy tales, fantasy, mystery and adventure, humour, STEM, and non-fiction. Founded by Richa Sethi and Priya S Rajive, the idea behind the app was “to make books accessible to kids but also to make the process of reading fun,” says Richa. There are different kinds of challenges – with funky badges like Steady Slug, Persistent Pupa, Book Versed, Book Boss and many more. “The children earn points for every bit of reading that they do, the fun book dares that they attempt, and the book reviews that they write. They can climb up the reading leaderboard and earn badges for the various milestones that they cross.” The badges, says Richa, help children to stay motivated. There are also a variety of activities. Book Dare, for example, has fun trivia questions on each book. If you manage 10 successfully you become an Ace Reader. A child who completes 20 book reviews is a Book Viking.

The initial challenge for Priya and Richa was “to get publishers to believe in a digital reading platform for kids. Many were reluctant but a few immediately got on board. Parents were also worried about digital screen time but we have been able to guide them towards positive digital time for the purpose of reading. We suggest a daily reading of 15-20 minutes on GetLitt! to get kids hooked to reading. We have also launched initiatives like a Reading Olympiad for kids. This helps us stay relevant,” explains Richa.

Storytelling through videos We picked up books from across publishers. The list has picture books, chapter books and even comics. We have brought scary stories, biographies of famous personalities like Kalpana Chawla, Mangal Pande, Gandhi and Ambedkar, and stories about invisible friends, school, and grandparents alive through the videos.

It was an experiment to see how best to bring the books from different formats on the screen successfully. We had wonderful storytellers from Secret Passages who came on board to work with us. With its success, we would like to continue with many more storytellers and publishers.

The first thing to do to encourage children to read, emphasises Richa, is to give them “the choice to pick up a book that they wish to read.” She also suggests “discussions on a variety of topics with your child. Do joint readings so that you can discuss characters, plot, what ifs – each book is a treasure trove of so many things to talk about. Use the joint readings as a bonding time to talk about life in general instead of making every book reading an educational process.” She even has a few examples, “Salim Mamoo and Me is about a little girl trying to fit into her bird loving family, whereas Ammachi’s Amazing machines is all about simple machines, and there’s Icky Yucky Mucky that talks about table manners in the craziest way.”

How it began

Priya and I are ardent book lovers. So we decided to get people like us together through a book club called Writer’s Bug nine years ago. We met on Thursdays once a fortnight. Having achieved success there, as mothers, we wanted our kids also to discover new books and stories so we launched a literature festival exclusively for children in Mumbai. Here, we met many parents like us who had no clue about the wide range of children’s books that were being published.

With the belief that every child has a right to get access to stories, we decided to go digital. That was the only way to reach out to more than 300 million kids in India and make children’s books accessible widely. As a start-up we are constantly going through a cycle of highs and low,s sometimes on a daily basis. We are constantly trying new initiatives like the Reading Olympiad, which received an overwhelming response from schools and parents.

The current lockdown on account of Coronavirus is a new low but also presents us with an opportunity to help children find hope and cheer through books.

GetLitt! can be accessed on www.getlitt.co or downloaded on iPad or Android tablets.

448,2020/03/31,Fee collection by CBSE schools during lockdown period annoys parents,"In the backdrop of the Ministry of Human Resource Development directing Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and other autonomous bodies to tweak the academic calendar to tide over the COVID 19 crisis, online collection of fee by some CBSE schools in the city even before the commencement of the academic year has caused consternation among parents.

The HRD Ministry had, last week, sent a circular to all States and autonomous bodies such as the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT), the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) to work on an alternate academic calendar.

But, that has not deterred the CBSE schools from fixing stiff deadlines for parents to pay the fees online.

Parents lament that the schools feel emboldened as the Tamil Nadu government has not made its position clear on the issue. While warning schools last year against conducting the admission process during the vacation, the Education department did not make any specific mention about school fee collection. Also, the government follows a hands-off policy when it comes to CBSE schools.

On the other hand, a number of other State Governments including those in Karnataka, Chattisgarh and Himachal Pradesh have issued clear warnings to the schools, irrespective of board affiliations, that their recognition will be withdrawn if they flout the order not to collect fee at the time of nationwide lockdown.

A CBSE school in the city had issued a circular to parents on March 28 instructing them to make the fee payments before April 7. Another CBSE school has fixed April 14 as the deadline. Most of the private schools are now in the process of collecting the fee, a former member of State Consumer Protection Council, Government of Tamil Nadu, said.

An official of the School Education Department said it was normal for CBSE schools to start the classes during April. ""There has been no specific instruction from the government so far for postponement of the last date for fee payment in CBSE schools in view of the nationwide lockdown,"" the official said.

According to a representative of a private school management, there was a necessity for CBSE schools to start the academic year in April since the syllabus cannot be completed. The mid-term exams in September warrant timely completion of portions which will not be possible if the classes begin in June.

It was a common practice for CBSE schools to collect the fee before commencement of the academic year, which, had to be postponed this time around due to unforeseen circumstances.

But, the schools will have to fall in line and defer collection of fee at this juncture if the government issues an order to that effect, he said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/fee-collection-by-cbse-schools-during-lockdown-irks-parents/article31221246.ece
449,2020/03/31,Social distancing goes for a toss as people come out,"Medical professionals stress on the need for people to remain indoors

Despite various measures implemented by the Revenue and police authorities to enforce the prohibitory orders imposed in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, heavy movement of people on the roads, large gatherings at markets, grocery shops and pharmacies have caused a sense of unease for administrators and medical professionals.

On Tuesday, a large number of people thronged the temporary markets along the Cauvery Bridge and the Anna Stadium and personal distancing went for a toss as many crowded in front of shops in their anxiety to purchase their requirements.

In many places, policemen were helpless. Many also were seen crowding at the places designated for parking vehicles. Medical professionals say it is very important for people to remain indoors and maintain personal distancing if at all they need to venture out in emergency situations.

“There is no need for panic. But at the same time, people should avoid going out unless absolutely essential - say in an emergency situation. If they go out, people must maintain personal distance of at least two metres or six feet and practice hand hygiene,” said Senthilkumar Nallusamy, senior cardiologist in the city, pointing out that a large number of patients would be asymptomatic and when venturing out they may be interacting with several immuno-suppressed people.

The government, he pointed out, had announced the 21-day lockdown taking into account the 14-day incubation period of the virus and allowing another week to be on the safe side. People should remain indoors and self protect through this entire period, Dr. Senthilkumar said.

Officials in Thanjavur too bemoan the lack of awareness among the people.

“The decentralising of vegetable sale by setting up temporary mini-markets at bus stands, school and other open grounds and formation of special teams at the public distribution shop-level to assist people in procuring essentials were conceived and implemented to ensure that people remained indoors and prevent the spread of COVID-19 pandemic,” Thanjavur Collector, M. Govinda Rao, pointed out.

However, people coming out in search of their needs continued. In some places in Thanjavur, people claimed that they were not aware of the constitution of special teams. “I would not have stepped out of my house if I had come to know about such facility”, said a staff of judiciary, Murugan, of Kumbakonam.

Meanwhile, Kumbakonam Municipality has stepped up publicity exercise by pressing into service public address fitted vehicles to convey the message to the public about the formation of special teams and decentralisation of the Palakarai market.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/tgo41j/article31221224.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY01MOTORISTTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/social-distancing-goes-for-a-toss-as-people-come-out/article31221229.ece

Urging the people ‘not to create undue panic or fear’, District Collector Arjun Sharma said the ship was under surveillance of the police and other authorities.

In its order issued earlier this month on dealing with COVID 19, the Directorate General of Shipping, Mumbai, said that shipping services were required to be operational for delivery of vital goods and essential commodities like fuel, medical supplies, and foodgrains, and to ensure that the economic activity of the nation is not disrupted.

“It is, therefore, important that the movement of goods by sea should not be needlessly disrupted without compromising the safety of life and protection of the environment,” the order said.

In compliance with the safety protocol, the district administration has not permitted any contact with the crew, the Collector said.

For vessels arriving from ports of infected countries, additional measures have been specified.

They include grant of prior permission for berthing as per necessary health protocols; sanitising mooring ropes and pilot ladders of such vessels; providing the pilot with full body protection suit; providing the mooring gang with adequate personal protection equipment; keeping gangway in raised condition in all times; and sanitising and disinfecting the vessel after the completion of cargo operations.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/shed-fear-over-presence-of-iranian-vessel-at-port-says-karaikal-administration/article31220778.ece

In Musiri, the farmers’ market has come up at the Government Boys Higher Secondary School. Similarly, the playground at the Zamindar Higher Secondary School in Thuraiyur has been made as a temporary market for selling vegetables.

Collector S. Sivarasu said that the temporary markets at Musiri, Thuraiyur and Lalgudi had already started functioning. The officials have been asked to find out school premises in other leading towns, including Thottiam, Manapparai, Thuvarankurichi and others for allowing the traders to sell vegetables and fruits. The school premises have turned out to be ideal locations for forming temporary markets as they would invariably have sufficient space. It would allow the people to maintain at least one metre distance while standing in queues for buying vegetables.

Besides revenue officials, Mr. Sivarasu said that the police personnel would man the temporary markets in order to regulate the buyers.

He said that 260 persons, who were working in pharmaceuticals, petrol bunks and other services, have been issued with identity cards in the district. Steps were being taken to start door-to-door delivery of essential commodities, particularly groceries, by roping in grocers. It had been decided to shut the vegetable market at Kamaraj Nagar in order to avoid gathering of large crowds. However, alternative steps have been taken for selling vegetables to residents, he said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/v9xrhp/article31218547.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31MARTH-Karurjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/covid-19-29-who-attended-delhi-conference-admitted-to-isolation-ward-in-karur/article31218548.ece
459,2020/03/31,He is just a call away for stranded truck drivers,"A social worker in Thuraiyur has taken it upon himself to help truck drivers and their attenders stranded on the highways near his town due to the lockdown enforced to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.

S. Sureshkumar, 53, a real estate dealer and contractor, has spent over ₹1 lakh to fund a series of relief efforts in his vicinity after the nationwide lockdown was announced last week.

“I was moved by the plight of the inter-State truck drivers who were unable to cross borders once the closure was announced. With all the roadside eateries downing shutters, many of these transporters were left without any means to feed themselves,” Mr. Sureshkumar told The Hindu over telephone. “So I sent out a WhatsApp message asking stranded lorry teams to contact me from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., to receive basic provisions, which they could cook on their portable stoves. Seven teams (of a driver and attender each) have been helped so far. I am looking at petrol bunk employees and auto rickshaw drivers next,” he added.

Mr. Sureshkumar has also been working with local authorities to spread awareness about Coronavirus, and hygiene measures. He has purchased over 5,000 masks to be given away to the public. “The pandemic has created a fear among people, but it is sad to see the safety norms being violated in many places. I hope the mask will remind the recipients to maintain appropriate personal distancing and cleanliness while interacting with others,” he said.

In addition to this, Mr. Sureshkumar has offered the use of two cars within 10 kilometres of Thuraiyur town, for those who require emergency medical care during the lockdown.

Keen on maintaining a low profile, Mr. Sureshkumar, who declined to be photographed, says more privileged people should come forward to share their wealth with their fellow citizens, especially in time of crisis. “Your money should make a difference to someone in need.”

460,2020/03/31,Overseas air cargo movements exceeds target ahead of lockdown,"The Tiruchi international airport, one of non metro airports in the country, has surpassed the target set for overseas cargo handling during the 2019-20 financial year even before the nation-wide lockdown and cancellation of international flights in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The international air cargo terminal at Tiruchi handled over 7,900 metric tonnes of overseas freight by February itself thereby exceeding the target of 7,500 metric tonnes set for 2019-20 financial year, a senior Airports Authority of India official said.

However, stakeholders feel that the current lockdown and the cancellation of all international flights since March last week in the wake of spread of COVID-19 pandemic would have an impact in respect of overseas cargo movement from Tiruchi airport in the early period of the 2020-21 financial year due to the crisis at the global-level. All international flights have been cancelled up to April 14 as per the Centre’s directive.

On an average, the Tiruchi international air cargo terminal used to handle more than 550 metric tonnes overseas cargo every month during the 2019-20 fiscal. There have been occasions when the figure exceeded 700 and 800 metric tonnes in certain months during 2019-20, according to Airports Authority of India statistics.

Perishables such as vegetables, fruits and flowers continue to account for ninety-nine per cent of the consignments lifted from Tiruchi airport which is surrounded by agrarian districts.

In the absence of any freight service, cargo is being booked in international passenger flights that were being operated to select foreign destinations in South Asia, South East Asia and West Asia from here. Singapore is a big market for the exporters from here as bulk of vegetables used to be shipped to that country, say export circles here.

Amid uncertainty looming over resumption of international flights due to the current COVID-19 spread, exporters here say even if overseas flights were to resume from mid –April onwards it would still take a couple of months to get back to normal situation.

Predictions could not be made about air cargo exports given the current crisis situation across the globe in the wake of the spread of the viral disease world-wide. “There is a greater possibility of

reduction in the movement of international cargo movement at least in the first quarter of the 2020-21. As things stands now, it would take time up to August for air cargo export business to get

back to the pre-lockdown period, says S.A.

461,2020/03/31,Colleges unsure about completing 90 working days for this semester,"Arts and science colleges are apparently in a fix as they are not sure if the requirement of the University Grants Commission (UGC) to complete 90 working days per semester could be complied with for this semester.

The colleges had, more or less, completed a little more than 80 working days before the nationwide lockdown was enforced for containment of novel coronavirus.

Seven to eight more working days are required for rushing through the last one or two units before proceeding with the model exam followed by the semester exam, college heads say.

The academic schedule may not get unduly affected if the lockdown gets to a close on April 14, as already planned. In the event of the lockdown period getting extended, the schedule of exams, valuation and results could have an impact on the duration of the odd semester in the next academic year, they say.

“There is indeed uncertainty about completion of the term days. There has been no precedent for the current situation. But, most of the working days for the term have been completed, finishing off the portions should not be a problem,” Rev. Fr. M. Arockiasamy Xavier, Principal, St. Joseph's College, said

There are indications that some of the teachers are already making proper use of the lockdown period by engaging the students online for completing the remaining units, he said.

A sense of hope also prevails that even if the exams are conducted late, the universities could make up for the lost time by expediting the valuation process.

“It is possible to tweak the system a little bit to complete the valuation process in time. Scope exists for increasing the number of valuation centres and engaging more number of teachers for valuation duty by relaxing the eligibility criteria. For instance, instead of insisting on three years of experience, the universities could as well engage more number of teachers by permitting those with two years of work experience to take up the valuation duty”, S. Sekar, Principal, Meenakshi Ramaswami Arts and Science College, Ariyalur.

The college heads are, nevertheless, very particular on resumption of working days only after the COVID 19 scare evaporates entirely.

“It is very difficult to follow the personal distancing for one metre in colleges, be it in classrooms, exam halls or hostels. Even if there is further extension of the lockdown period, the situation the country is going through is quite understandable. As for institutions, the safety and well-being of students and teachers is of paramount importance,” Prof. Sekar said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/colleges-unsure-about-completing-90-working-days-for-this-semester/article31218357.ece

GVMC Contract Workers’ Union (CITU) has written to Municipal Administration Minister Botcha Satyanarayana, seeking provision of safety gear and other amenities for sanitation workers.

AP Municipal Federation president G. Subba Rao, State honorary president P. Venkata Reddy and working president T. Nookaraju, in a letter to the Minister, noted that the workers had been toiling hard to ensure sanitation amid the pandemic. “Yet, the workers are not being provided with safety gear, identity cards and transportation facilities. They are being stopped by the police due to the lack of identity cards,” they said.

They recalled that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, during his first Cabinet meeting, had announced that health allowance would be sanctioned to sanitary workers from August 2019, but it was not implemented till date. The CITU was extending support to the Central and State governments in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Sanitation, malaria and UGD workers are doing their bit to prevent the spread of the virus by cleaning and spraying of disinfectants. The non-provision of safety gear such as masks and gloves are making them vulnerable for infection,” said Mr. Subba Rao and sought safety gear, identity cards and transportation facilities for the workers. apart from the implementation of new wages and payment of wages to outsourcing workers by 5th of every month.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/safety-gear-sought-for-sanitation-workers-in-vizag/article31222359.ece

467,2020/03/31,VPT agrees to waive penal charges for port users,"Stakeholders wants the authorities to declare ‘force majeure’

The Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT) has agreed to waive off penal charges for underperformance by the cargo handling agents and other users during the lockdown.

VPT Deputy Chairman P. L. Haranadh told The Hindu on Tuesday that they would consider failure of contractual obligations by the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) operators on a case-to-case basis as per the concession agreement signed with them.

What is ‘force meajure’

Vizagapatam Chamber of Commerce and Industry, meanwhile, said that in view of the unusual crisis arising out of the coronavirus outbreak and subsequent nationwide lockdown, they were declaring ‘force majeure’, a notification exempting the port handling agents, stevedores and other stakeholders from payment of penalty for failure to complete their contractual commitments within a specified time. Based on a circular issued by the Ministry of Shipping on March 24 following declaration of the lockdown, several ports including those at Mudhra, Krishnapatnam, Gangavaram and Gopalpur have declared ‘force majeure’.

“We want the major port in Visakhapatnam to take a decision on ‘force majeure’ with retrospective effect, as was implemented in the aftermath of Cyclone Hudhud in October 2014,” said G. Sambasiva Rao, managing director of Sravan Shipping Services.

“There is no doubt that COVID-19 is a disaster of unprecedented proportions, and yet, the port community is doing whatever it can. We also expect the government to take suitable measures to help us,” Vizagapatam Chamber of Commerce and Industry honorary secretary G. Veeramohan said.

“The Union Government must stem the decline of the shipping industry by urgently taking proactive measures, one of which is declaration of ‘force majeure’ in government-owned ports like VPT,” he said.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/tsmjhb/article31222254.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31VIJ4VPT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/vpt-agrees-to-waive-penal-charges-for-port-users/article31222256.ece

469,2020/03/31,COVID-19 | Plans afoot to draft staff from other depts. for emergency duty,"Move will reduce workload of frontline officials, says Police Commissioner

The fight against COVID-19 becoming a challenging task for the departments in the frontline such as police, GVMC, district administration and health every passing day. Considering the limited manpower resource, it has been proposed to draft staff from various other departments into the exercise.

The city police wing with limited manpower of about 3,000 men is finding it extremely difficult to keep its men agile, fit and motivated for a 24/7 operation.

“Keeping this in mind, we have proposed to Collector V. Vinay Chand to draft men from other departments such as teaching, forest, excise, agriculture and others to assist us in our daily duty, said Commissioner of Police Rajeev Kumar Meena.

Change in shift timings

“One or two of our men will form a team with men from other departments and take up various tasks, this will bring down the load on each of the departments in the frontline, as the work force will increase by at least 1,000 to 1,500 men,” said Mr. Meena.

As of now, each policeman is working on a 12-hour shift. But from now they will work for 8 hours a shift and on rotation basis, so that each of them gets at least 16 hours of rest and quality time with family, said Mr. Meena.

Moreover, according to the Police Commissioner, all men and women above 55 years and suffering from chronic ailments such as diabetes or hypertension have been withdrawn from frontline force and deputed to back-end operations such as manning the control room or command control centre.

According to him, the police department has already received about 20,000 masks but there is shortage of gloves and sanitisers.

He also informed The Hindu that the police force have been given strict instructions to allow free movement of all vehicles carrying essential commodities, including petroleum products.

Dhabas opened

“Moreover, we have opened five dhabas along the 72-km stretch of NH-16 from Anandapuram to Anakapalle, to facilitate the inter-State and inter-district transporters to have food. All dhabas will operate on takeaway model and we have asked them to keep soap, and sanitisers,” he said.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/9flrxp/article31222010.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31-VZ-POLICEPERSONNEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/plans-afoot-to-draft-staff-from-other-depts-for-emergency-duty/article31222011.ece

473,2020/03/31,Air pollution linked to increased dementia risk,"Almost 3000 adults were studied for 11 years for the study that was published in the JAMA Neurology journal

People continuously exposed to air pollution are at increased risk of dementia, especially if they also suffer from cardiovascular diseases, warn researchers.

According to the study, published in the journal JAMA Neurology, patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) who live in polluted environments may require additional support from care providers to prevent dementia. “Interestingly, we were able to establish harmful effects on human health at levels below current air pollution standards,” said study first author Giulia Grande from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden. “The findings suggest air pollution does play a role in the development of dementia, and mainly through the intermediate step of cardiovascular disease and especially stroke,” Grande added.

According to the study, the number of people living with dementia is projected to triple in the next 30 years globally. No curative treatment has been identified and the search for modifiable risk and protective factors remains a public health priority.

Recent studies have linked both cardiovascular disease and air pollution to the development of dementia, but findings on the air pollution—link have been scarce and inconsistent.To reach the conclusion, the researchers examined the link between long—term exposure to air pollution and dementia and what role cardiovascular diseases play in that association.

Almost 3,000 adults with an average age of 74 and living in the Kungsholmen district in central Stockholm were followed for up to 11 years. Of those, 364 people developed dementia.The annual average level of particulate matter 2.5 microns or less in width (PM2.5) are considered low compared to international standards. For the last five years of exposure, the risk of dementia increased by more than 50 per cent per interquartile range (IQR) difference in mean PM2.5 levels and by 14 per cent per IQR in nitrogen oxide, the researchers said.

Earlier exposures seemed less important. Heart failure and ischemic heart disease both enhanced the dementia risk and stroke explained almost 50 per cent of air pollution—related dementia cases.

Air pollution is an established risk factor for cardiovascular health and because CVD accelerates cognitive decline.“We believe exposure to air pollution might negatively affect cognition indirectly,” said Grande. “In the study, virtually all of the association of air pollution with dementia seemed to be through the presence or the development of CVD, adding more reason to reduce emissions and optimize treatment of concurrent CVD and related risk factors, particularly for people living in the most polluted areas of our cities,” she added.

474,2020/03/31,Coronavirus | Coimbatore-based companies manufacture 3D-printed face shields,"The design is open sourced and anyone can now use it free of cost to manufacture the shields, say the manufacturers

It was the morning of the Janata Curfew. Ebin Ephrem Elavathingal, senior manager of AIC RAISE (an incubator backed by Government of India under the NITI Aayog Programme); Hari Vigneshwaran, founder of Augment 3Di; and Vigneshwaran S, founder of Virtual Frontier Robotics were watching news on the television. “We understood the gravity of the situation. All of us are engineers and wanted to do something to help. It was then that Vigneshwaran told us about face shields being 3D printed in a lab in Italy,” says Ebin. Over the next three hours, the team researched face shields and searched for designs. “We could not find any open source design and so we decided to develop one ourselves. Vigneshwaran and Hari have 3D printers and we used them for our work. We did the entire discussion and designing over video calls,” he adds,

Their first shield was ready on the same day, but the process took four hours. “So we reworked the design into a simpler one till each mask took an hour to make. In the last few days, we developed 350 masks and donated them to sanitation workers in Coimbatore. It covers the entire face and can be reused after cleaning with soap,” Ebin says. Of the 350 shields, 250 were directly given to Coimbatore Medical College Hospital and ESI Hospital. “The rest was donated to Coimbatore Corporation-South Zone in association with Rathinam Group of Institutions,” he says.

The group posted photographs of the product on their social media pages and soon got requests for the shield from across the country. “Our production capacity was limited and we could not meet the demand. This is when we decided to open-source our design. Now anyone can use our design free of cost to make these shields. All one has to do is feed the memory card with the design into the 3D printing press,” Ebin explains.

Vimala B, Assistant Town Planning Officer, Coimbatore Corporation-South Zone, says that the 100 shields that they received are of great help to the sanitation workers and officers. “This helps them keep their hands off their faces. We have now requested for 50 more,” she says. The team now plans to move into mass production following the surge in demand. “We have made moulds and will follow the traditional manufacturing method. We hope to make 1000 masks a day. We are looking for donors who can support us in this venture. Each mask costs ₹90 to make.” They are now working on a design to 3D print ventilators. “It is a complex design. We have designed 60% of it. We should be done in the next few days. We hope to get a working model soon,” he says.

475,2020/03/31,"Lockdown: Don’t use tobacco, alcohol to cope with boredom, these affect immunity, says Health Ministry","People who have the problem of substance use must go for professional help, especially when they feel stressed.

Using tobacco and drinking alcohol to cope with boredom during the COVID-19 lockdown can affect immunity as well as mental health, the Union Health Ministry said on Tuesday, amid rising cases of the novel coronavirus. It also urged people not to shun or judge those who are suffering from the infection, which has claimed 32 lives and affected 1,251 people in the country.

“If you know someone who might have the infection, tell them about precautions, and how to get medical assistance, if required,” the Ministry said in its document ‘Minding our minds during the COVID-19 pandemic’, which was released on Tuesday.

People who have the problem of substance use must go for professional help, especially when they feel stressed, the Ministry said.

Underlining the importance of the lockdown, it said the lockdown is meant to prevent the spread of the infection from one person to another, and to protect ourselves and others.

This means, not stepping out of the house except for buying necessities, reducing the number of trips outside, and ideally only a single, healthy family member making trips when absolutely necessary, the Ministry said.

If there is anyone in the house who is very sick and may need to get medical help, “you must be aware of the health facility nearest to you”, it said.

“These can be difficult times for all of us as we hear about spread of COVID-19 from all over the world, through television, social media, newspapers, family and friends and other sources. The most common emotion faced by all is fear. It makes us anxious, panicky and can even possibly make us think, say or do things that we might not consider appropriate under normal circumstances,” the document stated.

It urged people not to panic if they get infected with the novel coronavirus, stating most people get better and advised practicing self-isolation and taking medications that are advised.

Giving tips on handling social isolation, the ministry said staying at home can be quite nice for some time, but can also be boring and restricting and advised people to stay busy and distract themselves from negative emotions by listening to music, reading, watching an entertaining programme on television, pursuing hobbies and doing simple indoor exercises.

“Understand if someone around you needs advice, food or other essentials, be willing to share. Elderly people may feel confused, lost and need help. Offer them help by getting them what they need, their medicines, daily needs etc,” the Ministry said.

It urged people to focus on facts and reject rumours. The Ministry asked people to access and believe only the most reliable sources of information for self-protection.

It also advised them against spreading or sharing any unverified news or information further.

“Knowledge is power; the more you know about a certain issue, the less fearful you may feel. Do not follow sensational news or social media posts which may impact your mental state.

“Do not keep discussing all the time about who got sick and how. Instead learn about who got well and recovered. Stick to the known advice- hand hygiene and keeping a physical distance from others. It is being careful about yourself, and also about care of others,” it said adding common cold is not coronavirus infection.

The Ministry called for following etiquette of sneezing, coughing, avoiding spitting in public places among others.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/74v3fk/article30347106.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THCIGARETTESLOWNICOTINE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/lockdown-dont-use-tobacco-alcohol-to-cope-with-boredom-these-affect-immunity-says-health-ministry/article31215501.ece
476,2020/03/31,70 Years of Diplomatic Relations between China and India [1950-2020],"Ambassador's Message

On April 1, 2020, China and India usher in the important moment of the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. Looking around the world, China and India, as the only two emerging countries with a population of more than 1 billion, shoulder the historical mission of national rejuvenation, play a key role in the process of the collective rise of developing countries, and inject strong momentum into the profound changes unseen in a century. At this moment, it is particularly important to revisit the original aspiration of establishing diplomatic relations 70 years ago and carry forward the spirit of good neighborliness and friendship, unity and cooperation.

Looking back at the past 70 years, China-India relations have moved ahead despite wind and rain and gone through an extraordinary development path. In the 1950s, the leaders of the older generation of the two countries made the historical decision to establish diplomatic relations between China and India, and jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. ""Hindi Chini Bhai Bhai"" (Indians and Chinese are brothers) resounded throughout our two countries. From the 1980s, the two sides agreed to solve the boundary question through peaceful and friendly consultation, established strategic and cooperative partnership for peace and prosperity, and achieved all-round development of bilateral relations. After 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi initiated the ""hometown diplomacy"", held two informal summits in Wuhan and Chennai respectively, carried out strategic communication on overarching, long-term and strategic issues of global and regional importance, and agreed to strengthen the closer partnership for development between the two countries.

Today's achievements of China-India relations embodied the great efforts of several generations of our two peoples. We can draw some inspirations and experiences from the past. First, adhere to the strategic guidance of the leaders. Second, grasp the general trend of friendly cooperation. Third, expand the momentum of mutually beneficial cooperation. Fourth, enhance the coordination on international and regional affairs. Fifth, properly manage differences.

At present, China-India relations stand at a new starting point and usher in new opportunities. We should draw wisdom from our thousands of years of civilizations and explore a way for neighboring and emerging major countries to get along with each other in accordance with ""enhancing mutual trust, focusing on cooperation, managing differences and seeking common development"". We also need to master the four keys of ""leading, transmitting, shaping and integrating"". ""Leading"" means to reach consensus and guide the direction of the development of bilateral relations under the guidance of our two leaders. ""Transmitting"" means to transmit the leaders’ consensus to all levels and translate it into tangible cooperation and outcomes. ""Shaping"" means to go beyond the mode of managing differences, shape bilateral relations actively and accumulate positive momentum. ""Integrating"" means to strengthen exchanges and cooperation, promote convergence of interests and achieve common development.

Indian President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have both said that the whole world is a family, which strike a chord with Chinese philosophy concept of ""universal peace"" and ""universal love"". The ancient oriental wisdom is still full of vitality today. I believe that China and India have enough foresight and ability to join hands to realize ""Dragon-Elephant Tango"", create brilliant future in the next 70 years and write together a new chapter in building a community with a shared future for mankind!
