0,2020/03/19,How to track down ‘rogue’ drones? IIT-Madras researchers may have a solution,"IIT-Madras researchers have developed an electronic warfare model that could help the Armed Forces track down unregulated drones and secure air space

It is a matter of national security.

There has been a detection of unauthorised UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicle) hovering around the Indian airspace. Upon closer examination, it has been confirmed that these are rogue drones that have the capacity to set off a lethal airstrike. In such a scenario, what would be the most effective retaliatory measure that would not warrant bloodshed?

To commission anti-UAVs equipped with an AI-powered software that would hack into the GPS navigation system of the enemy drone, changing its coordinates and neutralising operations — does it not sound like a subject that would interest Hollywood veteran Steven Spielberg?

This, however, is a year-long pet project designed by IIT-M researchers Vasu Gupta, final year student, Department of Aerospace Engineering, and his friend Rishabh Vashistha, a project associate. They were mentored by Ranjith Mohan, Assistant Professor, Department of Aerospace Engineering.

Aeromodelling is Vasu’s area of interest, as is Rishabh’s. Their design sensibilities matched, further cementing their fascination for aircraft. Their ultimate goal was to create a modular drone, whose components can be attached or detached and the flight controller, too, can be programmable as per requirement — akin to a Lego toy.

They began brainstorming plausible solutions to real-time issues, before getting started on the hardware part. “I’m an aircraft designer, but I had to rely on Singapore and China for fabrication, which is a bad dependency. We had to import certain parts from China for this drone model,” says Vasu, adding that they had to build everything from scratch.

How does it work?

Ideally, law enforcement drones are used by Defence Forces and Intelligence Agencies for surveillance and rescue operations among other things. Theirs, Vasu says, is an electronic warfare model that could help the Armed Forces secure air spaces and track down unregulated drones.

It ‘hacks’ into rogue drones and sends false GPS signals for communication. The target drone’s GPS sensor would lock onto their fake radio station, which transmits signals at a much higher rate than the available one. In doing so, the drone generates fake GPS packets that are received by the enemy, thereby calibrating the rogue drones’ latitude and longitude positions, when it enters the airspace.

“Basically, ours will act as a GPS satellite. The rogue drone would think ours is a legit source and would begin to communicate from our radio station,” explains Vasu, “By this operation, you can change its latitude, longitude and altitude, and force them to land safely.”

In addition to this, visual sensors and cameras help to monitor the behaviour of civilians — whether he is armed or not. “Let’s assume that your posture defines your intentions. If there’s any suspicious activity involved, our drone would notify the operator waiting for his command. Once it gets approval, it can track you down,” he says.

They had three attributes to factor in, in the larger framework of law enforcement drones: endurance, aero capacity and utility features.

For example, the length and breath of the propellers and router configuration would determine whether the drone can fly for 30 minutes or whether it can withstand a maximum wind speed of 65 km/hr. They referred to drone models employed by other countries, particularly Israel. “There are a range of drones out there; micro, mini and nano. But what we are talking about is a quadcopter. Israel has its own combat vehicle,” says Rishabh, adding, “Buying is a relatively easier option, but we wanted to design a completely indigenous model.” What motivated Rishabh, having failed at several attempts at joining the Defence Forces, was his passion to “serve the country”.

No man’s land

The biggest advantage of their prototype lies in its ability to operate beyond the line of sight control — the upper limit being 400 feet altitude for drone operations. It can also intercept phone calls at 250 feet above ground level. “You can set it up in Delhi and fly in Hyderabad. This is not an issue, communication is controlled over the Internet,” says Rishabh, adding that it has a battery that can last up to 50 minutes, while the industry standard is over 40-45 minutes.

What’s inside? The individual components are: motors, propellers, lithium battery, radio elementary antenna, flight controller, camera and sensors.

With payload, it can last up to 25-30 minutes of flight capacity. The drone model weighs about 4 kg and can carry a fully-loaded rifle.

The software is completely modular and has been coded in C++ and Python.

It took a year-and-a-half to build their drone model, costing over ₹9 lakh.

Their drone is also equipped with swarming technology — a technique that deploys drones in squadrons. They, in fact, tested with 25 drones at disposal, “You take complete control of a region by swarming. Ten drones can secure an airspace of 20 kilometres. You can also employ tracking and shooting,” he adds.

Vasu and Rishabh flirted with the idea of attaching firearms in their drone model, but have not got permission to carry out tests for obvious reasons. “It has provision to carry a fully-loaded rifle [like an AK 47]. It may drift about 8-10 cm, but can withstand its recoil. This is something we actively worked on and look forward to testing in real-time,” says Vasu.

A 2019 report states that India reported over six lakh rogue drones of varying size and capacity — of which most of them were termed “potential threat”. Currently, measures are being taken to develop and deploy counter-drones. Vasu and Rishabh presented their model at the Defence Expo 2020 held recently in Lucknow. Talks have been initiated with the Tamil Nadu Commando Force and Madhya Pradesh Government, but nothing has been finalised yet. “It’s a long process that takes about five to six months just to foster a meeting. It’s a back-and-forth process,” adds Rishabh.

The duo will demonstrate its model to Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant on April 14.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/66rr6k/article31109032.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG20200306134119jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/iitm-researchers-develop-law-enforcement-drones/article31109034.ece
1,2020/03/19,‘Doom with a view’ : Doom Eternal gets your adrenalin pumping,"The much-awaited follow-up to the successful Doom reboot, Doom Eternal, is finally here. Does the experience live up to the hype?

As a veteran gamer and connoisseur on the art of video gaming, I thought I had come to a point in my life where I had seen everything in that there were no more surprises in terms of level design. Then I saw level 2 of Doom Eternal which felt like a punch to the sternum.

I rexperienced the sense of wonder from when I first booted up DOOM way back in 1993. Demon and machinery come together in Eternal, expanding on the mythology they set in the 2016 Doom reboot.

Wolfenstein 3D and Doom were both the founding fathers of the first person shooter. Launching in 1993, Doom had a popular online distribution system called Shareware. Doom also was the first game to introduce network multi-player making it a best-seller of its time. While it did have its share of controversies — especially with all the satanic stuff — it put PC gaming on the map, in a world largely dominated by consoles.

Doom Eternal brims with bass, energy and aggressiveness right from its menus to the speed and the feel of the controls as you guide the Doomslayer (aka Doomguy) through the fetid ruins of Earth after underworld is invaded. Just as you are grasping the story, you are shoved through something about Hell Priests, a blur of exposition and then into a burning city. Pausing only for the occasional tutorial, Doom Eternal hurls into battle after battle.

‘An elaborate and bloody puzzle’

That is part of Eternal's aggressive design. Battles play out in sandbox-style levels, where you have to apply pressure while constantly starved of ammo or health. . In a way, the action plays out like an elaborate and bloody puzzle, complete with violent glory kills. You need to use certain attacks against the powerful demons to give you an edge. Thankfully, the weapons are fantastic, with some fun alternate firing modes that you can swap out at any time.

When you are not massacring enemies, you turn into Doomguy Mario. Apart from stomping on goombas, many of the obstacles feel like they're twisted versions of Super Mario obstacles — much like platforms that fall down into lavaor a large tentacled plant monster that appears out of a hole in the ground. Platforming is the only time you are going to get to let your heart rate rest in time for the next battle.

The game controls great, and considering it confronts you with enemies, Doomguy moves fast. The AI always tries to corner you and the only way to beat it is to play aggressive and forward at all times.In one particular level, firing at a glowing button had these wicked blades just slice through demons leaving nothing but gristle.

The verdict...

Doom Eternal is not for the faint-hearted or weak-stomached. There are a lot of demonic entrails, some as big as buildings as parts of levels are just set in demonic innards. This is a gory game with stunning vast set pieces. Using clever world-building and environmental storytelling, the developers communicate more about this biblical-end-of-the-world mythology than the actual story. The id Tech 7 graphics engine pumps out amazing graphics, even on consoles and lower spec machines.

If you loved Doom and want more, do not miss out on Eternal. Just make sure you stay off the caffeine.

4,2020/03/19,Coronavirus | Italy passes China's virus deaths and braces for long lockdown,"China has officially registered 3,245 deaths since reporting its first infections.

Italy on Thursday overtook China's coronavirus death total and braced for an extended lockdown that could see the economy suffer its biggest shock since World War II.

The Mediterranean country's toll reached 3,405 after it recorded 427 new deaths on Wednesday.

China has officially registered 3,245 deaths since reporting its first infections to the World Health Organization at the end of December.

All of Italy's fatalities came over a chaotic four-week span that began with only a smattering of cases around Milan and eventually led to the entire nation living through its deadliest disaster in generations.

Its new COVID-19 cases are yet to plateau despite the Italian government's best efforts.

Army trucks delivered new freshly-made coffins Thursday to a cemetery in the northern Italian city of Bergamo that suddenly finds itself at the global heart of the pandemic.

Burials were being spaced 30 minutes apart to avoid contagion through crowds.

Masked undertakers wrapped from head to toe in white suits carted the coffins on gurneys to speed up the process.

Italy's ANSA news agency said the deaths of two more doctors in the nearby town of Como west of Bergamo brought the total number of medics killed by the new disease to 13.

“Use your common sense and act with utmost caution,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told Italians.

“We are not underestimating anything and always acting based on the worst-case scenario.”

Overwhelming support

Mr. Conte enjoys overwhelming support from Italians for a lockdown that -- while not as draconian as China's quarantine of Wuhan's Hubei province -- seemed unimaginable for a Western democracy until this month.

A poll published in the daily La Repubblica found that 47% viewed the closure of most businesses and all schools and public institutions “positively”.

Another 47% viewed them “very positively” and just four percent said they were opposed.

Some of Mr. Conte's strictest measures -- such as the closure of all shops except for grocery stores and pharmacies -- had been due to expire next Wednesday.

The Italian leader was adamant that an extension of all these precautions was inevitable.

“All the measures we have taken, both the ones that closed a lot of the country's businesses and the ones that restricted people's movement, can only be extended,” Conte said.

Schools are thus unlikely to reopen on April 3 and parents will have to find ways to look after their children while working from home for many more weeks or months.

“At the moment, there are no other far-reaching restrictive measures being considered,” said Conte.

“But if our prohibitions are not respected, we will have to act.”

Economic shock

Italy is imposing 206 euro ($222) fines for anyone found wandering the streets without a valid excuse such as grocery shopping or getting to and from work.

Police in Rome read periodic instructions out of megaphones for everyone to “stay home and maintain distance” from each other.

Some stores are ordering shoppers to put on disposable plastic gloves.

The northern region of Emilia-Romagna took the extra step of banning jogging and walks -- exercise that the national government in Rome had encouraged for health reasons.

Mr. Conte's most tangible response to the crisis has involved putting together a 25-billion-euro ($28 billion) economic rescue package designed to help the worst affected industries.

The tourism operators' union said Thursday it expected the number of visitors to drop to levels last seen in the mid-1960s.

But Mr. Conte looked for the silver lining in the crisis.

7,2020/03/19,Britain latest to announce lockdown,"Government to shut schools and underground train stations; Germany brings in troops to tackle virus spread

The world’s wealthiest nations poured unprecedented aid into the traumatised global economy on Thursday as COVID-19 cases ballooned in the current epicentre Europe even as they waned at the pandemic’s point of origin, China.

With almost 2,19,000 infections and more than 8,900 deaths so far, the epidemic has stunned the world and drawn comparisons with painful periods such as Second World War, the 2008 financial crisis and the 1918 Spanish flu. “This is like an Egyptian plague,” said Argentinian hotelier Patricia Duran, who has seen bookings dry up for her two establishments.

“The hotels are empty — tourist activity has died.”

Tourism and airlines have been particularly battered, as the world’s citizens hunker down to minimise contact and curb the spread of the COVID-19. But few sectors have been spared by a crisis threatening lengthy global recession.

Liquidity taps opened

Policymakers in the U.S., Europe and Asia have slashed interest rates and opened liquidity taps to stabilise economies hit by quarantined consumers, broken supply chains, disrupted transport and paralysed businesses.

The virus has jumped to 172 other nations and territories with more than 20,000 new cases reported in the past 24 hours — a new daily record. Cases in Germany, Iran and Spain rose to over 12,000 each.

Britain, which had sought to take a more gradual approach to containment, was bracing for the virtual shutdown of London as underground train stations closed and schools prepared to shut their doors on Friday.

Some 20,000 military personnel were on standby to help and Queen Elizabeth was due to leave Buckingham Palace in the capital for her ancient castle at Windsor. Britain has reported 104 deaths and 2,626 cases, but scientific advisers say the real number of infections may be more than 50,000.

Italian soldiers transported corpses overnight from an overwhelmed cemetery in Europe’s worst-hit nation where nearly 3,000 people have died. Germany’s military was also readying to help despite national sensitivities over its deployment dating back to the Nazi era.

Supermarkets in many countries were besieged with shoppers stocking up on food staples and hygiene products. Some rationed sales and fixed special hours for the elderly.

Russia reported its first death on Thursday. Amid the gloom, China provided a ray of hope, as it reported zero new local transmissions.

The U.S., where President Donald Trump had initially played down the threat, saw infections close in on 8,000 and deaths reach at least 151.

Sri Lanka’s general elections, which was scheduled to be held on April 25, have been postponed in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.

It was not possible to hold polls amid the coronavirus crisis, Chairman of the Election Commission of Sri Lanka told media persons on Thursday, when the number of positive COVID-19 cases in the island rose to 59.

A new date for the polls will be announced in the coming weeks, officials said.

9,2020/03/19,Vladimir Putin says he’s not a ‘Tsar’ after 20 years in power,"I don’t reign, I work every day, says Russian President.

Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed comparisons to a Tsar on Thursday, arguing he “works every day” and listens to what people want.

“Well, this is not true,” Mr. Putin said when asked about being described as a Russian imperial-era ruler.

“Maybe someone else can be called a Tsar. But in my case, I don’t reign, I work every day,” he told the state-run TASS news agency.

The interview aired on Thursday as part of a series rolled out by TASS this month to mark 20 years since the 67-year-old President, took the helm of Russian politics.

It was not clear when the segments were recorded, but the series began airing before Mr. Putin said this month that he wants an opportunity to run for president again, as part of his constitutional reforms.

The reforms proposed in January include granting more power to Parliament and strengthening the role of the State Council.

An amendment approved last week would allow Mr. Putin to run for another six years in the Kremlin in 2024 and again in 2030. The reforms will be subject to a public vote.

When asked what he foresees past 2024, Mr. Putin deferred to the perspective of “people’s sentiments... what they want.”

“The primary source of power is the people,” he said. “It’s very important for me to feel and understand what people want.”

“A Tsar is one who just sits there, looks down from above and says: ‘They will do as I order,’ while he just tries on a cap and looks at himself in the mirror,” Mr. Putin said.

“On the contrary, I work every day.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/k9equs/article31111222.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Putin,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/vladimir-putin-says-hes-not-a-tsar-after-20-years-in-power/article31111223.ece

11,2020/03/19,"Coronavirus | Indonesia halts Islamic assembly, quarantining 9,000 people","Indonesia, with a population of more than 267 million, has so far reported 227 cases with 19 deaths.

Indonesia halted a mass congregation of nearly 9,000 Muslim pilgrims and began quarantining and checking their health on Thursday to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.

The four-day gathering that was to open later Thursday at a boarding school in a rural area in south Sulawesi island wasn’t approved by authorities and drew fears it could widely spread the virus in the world’s fourth most populous nation.

It was organised by Jamaat Tabligh, a Muslim missionary movement that held a similar mass event in Malaysia just three weeks ago that has been linked to nearly two-thirds of that country’s 790 infections as well as dozens of cases in several other nations.

South Sulawesi Governor Nurdin Abdullah said medical teams screening more than 8,600 participants found a local man with fever who was taken to a hospital.

“We’ve worked hard in dealing with this issue, involving religious leaders and security forces. We have told the pilgrims that we are in an emergency state of coronavirus and only common discipline can break the COVID-19 widespread,” Mr. Abdullah said.

Indonesia, with a population of more than 267 million, has so far reported 227 cases with 19 deaths, the most fatalities in Southeast Asia.

Pictures and videos posted by some participants on social media showed multiple long rows of blue makeshift tents at a field on the school ground. Devotees in long white robes and skullcaps sat close to each other or slept on mats laid on the ground.

Sentot Abu Thoriq, a member of the organising committee, said he regretted the government’s decision to nix the event that has been planned more than a year ago. He said those who are ill have been told to stay away, and noted that those who arrived would have passed stringent health checks at the country’s airports and sea ports.

“The decision and the treatment is clearly against our faith and hurt us,” Mr. Thoriq said. “Health, illness or death is God’s destiny, we believe that God will bless and protect those who are devout.”

Mr. Abdullah said 411 foreigners from nine countries including Malaysia, Singapore and Saudi Arabia will be isolated at a hotel while pilgrims from other regions of Indonesia will be quarantined at a government dormitory. He said they will be allowed to leave later based on their ticket dates.

Local participants from Sulawesi will be escorted back to their villages. Mr. Abdullah said all Indonesians will have to face compulsory quarantine for 14 days once they reach home.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/44m6hj/article31106696.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRUSOUTBREAKINDONESIA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/indonesia-halts-islamic-assembly-quarantining-9000-people/article31106697.ece

For the first time after the deadly coronavirus broke out about three months ago in Wuhan, China on Thursday said that no new domestic cases of the COVID-19 were confirmed, including in the virus’ epicentre, even as eight more fatalities have been reported, taking the death toll in the country to 3,245.

China’s National Health Commission (NHC) in its daily report said that no new domestically transmitted cases of the novel coronavirus disease were reported on the Chinese mainland on Wednesday.

However, a total of 34 new COVID-19 cases were reported on the Chinese mainland on Wednesday, all of which were from those arriving from abroad, marking a sharp increase, it said.

Of the 34 newly imported cases, 21 were reported in Beijing, nine in Guangdong Province, two in Shanghai, one in Heilongjiang Province and one in Zhejiang Province, the NHC said.

Capital of the central Hubei Province Wuhan, which bore the brunt of the coronavirus since the outbreak originated in December last year, also reported zero cases on Wednesday, marking a notable first in the city’s months-long battle with the deadly virus.

The Health Commission of Hubei Province said the total confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease in Wuhan and Hubei remained at 50,005 and 67,800 respectively on Wednesday with no confirmed cases.

13,2020/03/19,"Utah hit by strongest quake in decades, airport shut","The 5.7-magnitude, early morning tremor centered in north-central Utah was the strongest the state has experienced since 1992

The most powerful earthquake to hit Utah in 28 years shut down Salt Lake City's airport for much of the day, knocked out a coronavirus hotline and forced the evacuation of an oil refinery on Wednesday, officials said.

There were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries.

The 5.7-magnitude, early morning tremor centered in north-central Utah was the strongest the state has experienced since 1992, when a 5.9-magnitude quake rattled the St. George area, according to Utah Emergency Management.

Wednesday's quake damaged the Angel Moroni statue atop Salt Lake Temple, the Mormon Church's largest, knocking a trumpet from the angel's hand. A church spokesperson also said some of the temple's smaller spire stones were displaced, according to the Deseret News.

Utah has a large Mormon population and holds a special place in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

Governor Gary Herbert said the state's poison control center at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City was evacuated while officials assessed the damage, and he said the coronavirus hotline was down.

“Please stay away from the downtown area while crews assess damage. Unless you work in public safety, or are an essential employee, remain at home or telework,” the governor wrote on Twitter.

The Utah Department of Health said it set up a temporary hotline for information about the coronavirus.

The quake struck at 7:09 a.m. MDT (1309 GMT) some 6 km from Magna, Utah just west of Salt Lake City, the U.S. Geological Survey reported, and was followed by a series of smaller aftershocks.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said earlier on Wednesday it had evacuated the air traffic control tower at Salt Lake City International Airport and halted flights, diverting inbound aircraft to other airports. More than 200 flights were cancelled.

The airport said by Wednesday afternoon it had repaired a water line that had flooded a concourse and said “remaining facilities have been found to be structurally safe.” It said cargo and general aviation flights were beginning to arrive and depart.

The FAA said it would conduct a thorough assessment of the air traffic control tower to determine if it is safe to resume use. Air traffic controllers are working with limited capability from an airport ramp tower, while a mobile tower is scheduled to arrive Wednesday evening.

Salt Lake City is the 23rd busiest U.S. airport and a hub for Delta Air Lines.

In Herriman, just south of Salt Lake City, bricks from the facade of an elementary school fell in front of the main entrance.

Cracks appeared in the brick facade of a Salt Lake City bank building, and rubble appeared on the sidewalk in front of an unoccupied building under construction, social media images showed.

Marathon Petroleum Corp said its 61,000 barrel-per-day Salt Lake City refinery in Utah was evacuated after the quake.

“All employees and contractors are accounted for, and the earthquake had no impact on operations,” the company said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dekbdu/article31105098.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EARTHQUAKEUTAHTHNAK1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/utah-hit-by-strongest-quake-in-decades-airport-shut/article31105099.ece

U.S. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart said on March 18 he has tested positive for COVID-19, becoming the first member of Congress known to have contracted the virus.

Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican, said in a statement he has been self-quarantining in Washington since Friday and had not returned home to South Florida because his wife's pre-existing conditions put her at exceptionally high risk.

15,2020/03/19,Coronavirus: Chile declares 90-day state of catastrophe,"Pinera said there were 238 confirmed cases but no deaths

Chilean President Sebastian Pinera on Wednesday declared a 90-day state of catastrophe as cases of COVID-19 mounted in the nation, giving the government extraordinary powers to restrict freedom of movement and assure food supply and basic services.

A military official will oversee the 90-day measure, which is set to take effect Thursday morning. More restrictive actions would be implemented progressively, as dictated by the advance of the virus.

“This state (of catastrophe) is aimed at...preparing ourselves to confront what lies ahead,” Pinera said in a speech from the La Moneda presidential palace.

Pinera said there were 238 cases of coronavirus confirmed in Chile but no deaths. The country has closed schools, shut down its borders and limited public gatherings as the number of cases has multiplied.

Pinera said the order would also assure more security for hospitals, protect supply chains for medicines and allow the government to enforce quarantines and isolation measures.

The move is likely to stamp out any remaining protests over inequality after they were reignited in early March following several turbulent months of demonstrations and riots in late 2019. Chilean politicians earlier this week began discussions to postpone a referendum on a new constitution scheduled for April 26. A new magna carta was a central demand of widespread social protests, but those have faded with the pandemic.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-chile-declares-90-day-state-of-catastrophe/article31105047.ece

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday his administration will use a health-focused statute to swiftly remove migrants or asylum seekers who cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally as part of efforts to stem the spread of the coronavirus.

During a White House news conference, Mr. Trump confirmed he would invoke a statute allowing the surgeon general, the United States’ top public health official, to block people or goods from certain countries or places to prevent the spread of communicable diseases.

Mr. Trump said the move could happen as soon as March 18, but that his administration did not plan to fully close the border with Mexico.

“We're not going to close it, but we are invoking a certain provision that will allow us great latitude as to what we do,” he said.

Reuters reported on March 17 that Trump administration officials were considering a plan to immediately return all migrants caught at the southwestern border with Mexico, but such a move could provoke court challenges and may require cooperation from the Mexican government.

Mr. Trump did not provide details regarding the plan. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration has sought to escalate its response to the coronavirus in recent weeks as the disease has spread across the United States. Mr. Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on March 18 that their countries would close their border to “non-essential traffic.”

The Mexican foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. Border Patrol said it arrested approximately 30,000 migrants attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border in February, a slight uptick from the previous month.

Experts grappled with how the Trump administration might use the health-related statute to push migrants crossing illegally and asylum seekers back to Mexico.

The statute cited by Mr. Trump states that people can be denied entry to the United States for public health reasons, but doesn't differentiate between legal and illegal immigration.

U.S. President Donald Trump on March 18 announced the deployment of two Navy Hospital Ships to fast track the treatment of rapidly surging number of patients infected by the new coronavirus that has so far claimed the lives of 110 Americans.

Mr. Trump said he has ordered for deployment of Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort to New York, and USNS Mercy, to the West Coast.

“We are sending upon request the two hospital ships they are being prepared right now; they are massive ships. They are the big white ships with the Red Cross on the sides. One is called the Mercy, and the other is called the Comfort, and they are in tip-top shape they soon will be, they are getting ready to come up to New York,” Mr. Trump told reporters at a press conference.

The Comfort, he said, is currently stationed in San Diego, and the administration will be picking the destination fairly shortly.

“So those two ships are being prepared to go, and they can be launched over the next week or so depending on need,” he said.

Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who was also present at the press conference, said he has directed that the two hospital ships be prepared to deploy to increase the nation’s medical capacity.

“We have also alerted a variety of field and expeditionary hospitals to be prepared to deploy as well as needed based on direction from the commander-in-chief,” he said.

The Army Corps of Engineers leadership was in New York having meeting with the Governor Andrew Cuomo and his team to address their needs, he said.

18,2020/03/19,Vir Das: Stand-up has a larger audience in rural India,"The 40-year-old actor-comedian talks about his postponed ‘The Loved Tour’, his audience range and his writing process among other things

Vir Das is, perhaps, in the hottest streaks of his life. Over the last two years, he has performed to full houses at home and abroad.

He has opened for Conan on TBS and has been on Netflix and Amazon Prime. He will soon return to movies this year (the sequel of Go Goa Gone is being readied).

One could argue that it is tougher for a comedian to prolong his success than it is for other artistes, say a musician. A tune, like wine, can get better with time. But jokes, usually, go stale soon. To remain relevant, Vir attempts to veer away from the usual.

Take his latest Netflix show, For India, for instance. It was neither a political satire nor a collection of exaggerated personal stories — the two themes that is oft-repeated in the Indian stand-up scene.

With For India he chose to speak, sitting in front of a door on stage, to an audience segregated into Indians, foreigners and expats. He was talking about what he thought made India to those who knew about the country and those who wanted to know.

Vir’s The Loved Tour, which was supposed tour 49 cities across India, including non-metro ones like Patna, Meerut and Shillong has been indefinitely postponed. He took to his Instagram on March 9 to make the announcement.

“This new show is going to be about love. How one man questions all kinds of love — love for your family, your spouse, nation, God,” he says.

Vir who performed at Forum Shantiniketan Mall on March 7 for the Bengaluru leg of the show speaks about For India, his process of writing comedy and more.

Excerpts:

You said in an interview that For India was born out of this question: ‘If I could tell you four things about my country, what would they be?’ There have been a few major developments in our country, like CAA, since the show. Today, if you were to tell four things about India, what would they be?

It will be the same. In the show, I tried to talk about an India that can endure whatever is going on now. Leaders of today will be gone tomorrow. The tragedies of today will be gone tomorrow. But things like Old Monk, respecting your elders and Taj Mahal will live on.

For India's audience had an interesting seating arrangement, wherein a segment of expats and foreigners were seated separately. What was the idea behind that?

The idea was simple. You have a group of people, who are not from the country. And, when you are talking about something that is relevant to you; you try to be inclusive and make it relevant for them as well.

The reason why I seated them separately is because I take some time to explain certain things exclusively for them.

So, it is easy to highlight them with the lighting [when they are seated separately]. And, visually, it is interesting as well.

Was it especially challenging to write for this show considering there were two sets of audience?

The idea of this show was to challenge myself. A Netflix [comedy] special is usually 10 stories about your life.

In this case, it wasn’t about me at all. It was 10 categories and five things per category. So, you are writing about 50 to 55 things as opposed to 10 things.

It was definitely challenging. But I kind of enjoyed that.

With ‘Jestination Unknown’, you took standup comedy to places such as Patiala, Kumarakom, etc. Do you think standup comedy would find a substantial audience in rural parts of India as well?

I think standup comedy has a larger audience in rural parts of India than in a metro. You find Hindi standup comedy videos getting 25 million views and English getting one or two million views.

So, the larger audience is the regional segment. [With Jestination Unknown], the idea was to take live English comedy to these places. Hopefully, there will be an audience for that as well.

You speak about looking at standup comedy as art. And, it is increasingly becoming popular in India. Do you think it can be formally taught in educational institutions?

I don’t think so. It can be learnt by watching. Of course, you have workshops about joke-writing. But you have to be a fan of the art form.

Could you talk about the difficulty in writing comedy. One would assume experience makes it easier. However, there might also be the challenge to differ from your previous work.

For me it is getting harder. Because I make it that way. I like to have a healthy fear of failure on every subsequent project.

You are never really in a comfort zone. You try and write something different each time.

Do you talk to your audience after every show?

No. But the audience talk to you during the show. And, I am not talking about comments, but about laughter.

The kind of laughter is more informative than the comments. So, I record every show and listen to it later.

Comedians usually exaggerate something to make it sound funny. But if you do too much, then, it becomes forced. Where do you draw the line?

I don’t draw the line. The audience does. I figured that out a while ago. I am not in charge of the line, they are.

I just have to keep writing and they will let me know where the line is. But if you are worried about drawing the line yourself, you are not going to write anything great.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/m1hrgd/article31111429.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VirDas1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/vir-das-interview-postponed-the-loved-tour-and-his-audience-range-and-future-plans/article31111430.ece
19,2020/03/19,"'Koothu', a stand-up comedy web reality show in Malayalam, gets set to tickle your ribs","Produced by YouTube channel Cineprise Entertainments, it will be hosted by Kochi-based stand-up comic Vinay Menon

Laughter is the best medicine, they say. So, if you think you have it in you to tickle the funny bones, here’s your chance to have a crack at stand-up comedy. YouTube channel Cineprise Entertainments has invited entries for its stand-up comedy web reality show called Koothu, perhaps a first of its kind in South India. Hosted by Kochi-based stand-up artiste Vinay Menon, Koothu will bring together a final selection of 10 contestants for the show, to be shot in select venues across the State.

“Aspiring stand-up comedians who wish to participate can send us a two-minute performance video on any topic, shot in portrait mode. The focus is on bringing out and providing a platform for amateur stand-up comics,” says Vinay, who will be mentoring the 10 contestants during the show.

He points out that the show intends to rope in comic artistes “who are not just funny but are good in writing comedy and also have a noticeable presence in social media”, thus looking at their “overall” profile. “They can perform in Malayalam, English or ‘Manglish’ depending on the participant’s comfort level,” says Vinay, adding that there’s no age restriction for entries.

With digital content gaining wider traction and a large chunk of feedback pouring in from “social media”, the show’s makers aim to keep the “voting” process primarily online. “As the show progresses, audience votes will be mainly online-based as it is ostensibly more convenient. Also, instead of merely just blindly voting, audience can have the advantage of going back and checking the content again to make a better judgement,” explains Vinay, who spearheads the collective Comedy Lounge.

He says the show also wants to steer clear of the “customary drama” associated with judges and the assessment methods that are often part of reality shows. “The idea is to help contestants perform in front of a crowd and that performance is the content. The analysis and adjudication will be carried out behind-the-scenes. The episodes will be in such a format wherein all 10 contestants will be performing for every episode in the initial rounds,” says Vinay. Amal Krishna, executive producer of Cineprise Entertainments, says the show will follow a points-based system revolving around voting and elimination.

Describing humour as “democratic,” Vinay says one advantage of bringing out such a show as a web series is the “greater creative independence” it lends, unperturbed by censorship concerns. The show was originally scheduled to launch in April but the premier has been indefinitely pushed back owing to the ongoing Coronavirus scenario.

Vinay says the show’s title, Koothu, is a nod to the performance art form Chakyarkoothu for the parallels he finds between it and stand-up comedy. “Both thrive on elements of satire and possess the ability to take potshots at society, often through an engaging story people can relate to. Both forms are down-to-earth and can be hard-hitting when delivered well,” he says, adding that the challenge is to entertain “different types of audience” as the jokes come with a lot of modern-day references.

20,2020/03/19,Relief fund to be set up for those hit in Kannada entertainment industry,"The Karnataka Film Workers, Artists and Technicians’ Federation is set to establish a relief fund for daily wage earners

The Karnataka Film Workers, Artists and Technicians’ Federation is set to establish a relief fund for daily wage earners in the Kannada entertainment industry where, for the most part, productions have come to a halt.

While television productions are still happening, the film industry has stopped shooting. The decision to establish a fund for workers who will be impacted comes a day after a similar relief measure was announced by the Producers’ Guild of India on Tuesday.

“We have decided to request the Chief Minister and our film stars to contribute to the fund so that we can at least ensure supply of groceries, medicines and give out small loans to daily wage earners who have lost their livelihoods due to the shutdown,” said Ashok, president, Karnataka Film Workers, Artists and Technicians’ Federation.

“We have had a similar experience when Dr. Rajkumar was kidnapped in 2000, when the industry shut down for a long duration in protest,” he said. D.R. Jayaraj, chairman, Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce, said film shoots are unlikely to restart until the government decides to ease restrictions on gatherings and large crowds.

“It’s not only daily wage workers. Everyone is suffering, including exhibitors and producers. Most film productions run on borrowed money from the market and the interest is only growing. Exhibitors are suffering huge losses as all theatres are closed,” said Mr Jayaraj.

“Unlike films whose releases can be rescheduled, television shows are critical to fill airtime. We are in touch with all channels and if the situation further worsens, we will also cease productions for a week,” said S.V. Shivakumar, president, Kannada Television Association.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/42yde0/article31105270.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGCOVIDENTERTAINMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/relief-fund-to-be-set-up-for-those-hit-in-entertainment-industry/article31105271.ece
21,2020/03/19,This ghost walk tour lets you enjoy spooky tales from your couch,"Historian Anthony Khatchaturian is all set to venture out on another ghost walk trail in Kolkata. You can join in virtually, from the comfort of your home

When historian Anthony Khatchaturian starts a narrative with “What lies beneath...” you know you’ll be biting your nails by the time that sentence is completed. Known to lead midnight ghost and history trails in Kolkata, he is now starting off with virtual ghost tours.

“I had to adapt or die,” says Anthony, adding, “The economy hasn’t been great recently so I had a bad season, then Covid came along with a eulogy for the tourism and allied industries. I was brainstorming with Prof Souvik Mukherjee, Head of English at Presidency College in Kolkata, and he suggested I go virtual.”

Anthony’s first virtual walk will take place this Saturday — way after sunset — when the rest of the city is tucked into their beds and the roads are barren and eerily quiet. That is when he will boldly step into the scene, exploring buildings and spaces whose mysterious pasts still make their presence felt. And will Anthony be all by himself? “I hope not,” he laughs.

The plan is to bring along academics and historians, both amateur and professional, who can conduct a live question and answer session at every location and share their knowledge about those locations too.

People — no matter which city they are in — can join whichever tour they want on Anthony’s Virtual Tours page on Facebook and he will then add them to a Skype group call. “I will start the conference video call from my starting point — the camera will face me when I explain the history and it will pan towards the buildings as I talk about them and their particular features,” he explains.

He is also hoping he can hold at least 11 people on a video conference call and he is currently harassing his friends conducting trial runs to iron out the creases. If this works well, he plans to make all the tours virtual, including the Colonial Cemeteries, Dalhousie and Brabourne Road areas.

And what can viewers expect? Spooky tales and nuggets of information such as this: The busy T-junction in front of Writer’s Buildings in Kolkata is famous for traffic jams but only few know of the horrors that lie below.

“It was in this spot that the dead from the infamous ‘Black Hole of Calcutta’ incident were brought out and buried in a makeshift mass grave in what was then the compound of St Anne’s Church, which was damaged in the Battle of Lal Dighi — the fight for Calcutta between Siraj ud Daula and the East India Company. The church was demolished, the site of the grave had a monument with the names of the deceased — which has since been moved to St John’s Church just over a kilometre down the road and Writer’s Buildings has come up, but the dead still lay six feet below a busy crossing!”

Is Anthony confident of virtual tours working out in India, given that a lot of us like to experience all aspects of a product, particularly touch and feel?

Anthony says, “We certainly are touchy/feely, but this not only gives those locked up at home due to COVID-19 a chance to do something other than watch streaming services, but I am hoping it makes tourism accessible and cheap for those sitting in different parts of the world.”

The duration of the walk is two hours and is priced at ₹500. It starts at 11.30 pm on March 21.

On the other side, inside a glass enclosure, eight women sit around a table tying thread around fabric for shibori; while at the far end 12 metres of indigo dyed fabric suspended by a winch hang over a steel drum. “The drum holds 2500 litres of indigo dye,” guide and floor supervisor, the ever smiling Bhanumathi K says.

Each of the 37 people working here has been affected by a physical disability — hearing and/or speech impairment or other challenges. Together, they create Aranya fabric, which travels across the country and the world from Sri Lanka to Los Angeles and California.

Aranya, which just turned 25, is one of Munnar-based Srishti Trust’s projects. Srishti, backed by Tata Tea Limited (now Tata Consumer Products Limited), has been working with the differently-abled children of estate workers since 1991 and Aranya was formed in 1994. It grew out of an idea that Srishti Managing Trustee Ratna Krishna Kumar had after attending a dyeing workshop. (Ratna’s husband RK Krishna Kumar was the Managing Director of Tata Tea Limited, when it launched.) Right from get go Ratna says she was clear that the project would be for the differently-abled children of estate workers and their rehabilitation.

One of the team’s first clients was Polo (Ralph Lauren) for whom they dyed georgette, silk and chiffon (for dresses). Today, ‘Amari’, the boutique attached to Aranya proudly showcases shawls, stoles, yardage and garments fashioned out of tie-dye, in varied patterns of shibori and itagimi. It is set in a large campus, surrounded by gardens, which the team moved into in 1996. However, the project began in an abandoned shed in Tata Tea’s Nettimudi estate, when the team, turned the space into a lab, using mud pots and a wood-fired stove. These experiments grew into Aranya Natural.

How it began and sustained for a quarter century is an interweaving of lives and stories. If the genesis lay in Ratna’s idea, it was carried forth, with her and Tata Tea’s support, by people such as Victoria Vijayakumar who co-ordinated activities over the years and the differently-abled, like Bhanumathi, who has been with the team for 25 years.

Bhanumathi says she came to Aranya as an 18 year-old, “a Class 10 pass”, in her own words, “with two club feet and nothing much to look forward to.” She tears up speaking of how her life changed because of her work: she is married and has a son, a Class 10 student of the High Range School in Munnar. Most importantly, she is able to support her aged parents. Bhanumathi was among Aranya’s first four employees and the only woman then.

The cheerful co-ordinator Victoria Vijayakumar, Vicky Ma’am to the ‘children’, became part of Aranya serendipitously. She was the translator for the introductory dyeing workshop by Darshan Shah.

“I was translating from English to Tamil for the workshop. I had to focus completely on what was being said, because if I didn’t I would mislead the children,” she says. At night she would pore over the dictionary to check if she got the terms right. “By the end I knew enough about dyeing to become part of Aranya.” She remembers the initial days of trial and error, when along with Ratna she and new recruits would experiment, “the water here has many minerals which makes it ideal for this activity,” she says.

The fledgling venture experimented for two years before they started getting their first orders. “By then we felt confident enough. One of the first orders, if I remember correctly, was for saris. Initially it was a nightmare, but we got it right,” says Victoria. Most of the fabric is made to order, therefore the quantity produced varies. Some of the labels they work include Barefoot (Sri Lanka) and Eileen Fischer (New York). They also work with designers, including Kochi-based Sreejith Jeevan, Mumbai-based Riddhi Jain and Sunitha Shankar from Pune.

Raw material, for most of the dyes, is natural and local. Tea waste, eucalyptus grandis, eupatorium (Nilgiri kozha) and ageratum are some of the plants from which the dyes are made. A lot of these come from the forest floor. “We use things that will not be of any other use like barks of trees,” says Victoria Vijayakumar. Fittingly, they also use tea waste since Munnar is tea country. The tea that spills over in the factory during the processes, which would otherwise be discarded, is collected, boiled and made into beige coloured dye.

There is constant focus on training. Victoria has travelled with some of the workers to seminars and workshops across the country, as well as to the United States, the United Kingdom, Malaysia, France, Italy and Japan.

P Arumugham smiles shyly as Bhanumathi introduces him. She holds up a sample of ‘Aru shibori’, his innovative take on traditional Arashi shibori: although patterns are set the team is encouraged to experiment. Japanese dyeing expert Yoshiko Wada, who works with Aranya Naturals, impressed by Arumugham’s creation, named it ‘Aru shibori’.

The pay-off for Ratna, Victoria and everybody else involved is the transformation on the faces of Bhanumathi, Arumugham and others. That look on Arumugham’s face when he explains how Aru shibori is done.

Aranya Natural is at Nallathanni (Munnar) ahead of the KDHP Tea Museum alongside Athulya (hand-made paper unit) and Nisarga (strawberry/fruit preserve unit), which are among Srishti’s other projects.

23,2020/03/19,A selfie with Corona,"Twenty-three-year-old Corona Textiles and Readymades at Muvattupuzha has become a popular selfie point

What’s in a name? Plenty, according to KE Pareeth. When searching for a name for his line of executive shirts, he stumbled upon Corona, which means crown in Latin. Pareeth, who felt that the word had a nice ring to it, decided to brand his shirts, Corona. And while the line is now defunct, Corona Textiles and Readymades, a small clothing store at Beevipaddi, Muvattupuzha in Ernakulam is currently a centre of attention for passers-by. “Many stop by to click selfies and photos with either the name board or with me in front of it,” says Pareeth with a chuckle, over the phone.

A class seven drop-out, Pareeth, who opened the store, learnt tailoring from his brother Makkar before deciding to branch out on his own. And so with just a single sewing machine, he started Mini Tailors in 1978 at Pezhakkappilly, Muvattupuzha. “I then opened Pant House, a tailoring shop with several employees working under me at Pezhakkappilly,” he says.

As their stitching centre became known for their well-stitched shirts, Pareeth decided to launch two shirt brands in 1993 — Yaka shirt (stitched from a thick variety of cotton) and Corona. “I, however, had to fold the unit as we faced stiff competition and lacked the marketing know-how to promote our lines,” he explains. He then started Corona Textiles and Readymades at Pezhakkappilly in 1997 before shifting the store to the current location two years ago. “And no, we no longer have a tailoring unit.”

Pareeth, better known in and around his locality as ‘Corona Pareeth’, says, “When I started the store, it was just another clothing outlet with an unusual name. Now, it’s the cynosure of all eyes because of the Coronavirus,” says the 60-year-old. He adds that it was a journalist-friend who first featured his shop in Pezhakkappilly’s local cable channel.

“Since then, I have been flooded with phone calls and visits from news channels and publications,” says Pareeth, who is assisted by his wife, Subaida, at the store. Many now stop by to ask him about his choice of name for the store. “Some of them even pick up an outfit or two.”

Pareeth, who now has hand sanitisers for customers at the store, says he does not intend to change the name of the store. “The name has stood me in good stead over the years and so I intend to continue with it,” he avers.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/65gbnb/article31107596.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21tvmCorona1,https://www.thehindu.com/society/corona-textiles-and-readymades-at-muvattupuzha-has-become-a-selfie-point/article31107599.ece
24,2020/03/19,Listen to your body,"A lifestyle that goes against biorhythms is a recipe for ill health

We call ourselves humans. When we tell someone, “You’re behaving like an animal,” we mean that as criticism. For good decision-making, it is important to use our higher faculties as a human being. But physiologically, we should not forget that we are also animals. Our higher faculties or mental functions cannot function independent of our body. We have cycles of hunger, thirst, digestion, sleep, energy levels, etc., like all animals do. These cycles reflect the biological ebb and flow of functions in our tissues. We are prone to disrupting these functions in modern life because we subjugate our lifestyle to external needs, to long-term plans and short-term stress. This habit of disrupting the body rhythms is often internalised to the point where people do not even realise they are doing it.

The internal body clock is evolutionarily ancient. Disrupting the sleep and wakefulness cycle has a profound impact on our health. For instance, some countries follow daylight saving time by shifting their clock forward by one hour in spring and back one hour in autumn. Research shows that there is an increased risk of dying immediately afterwards in the elderly and unwell. The small change of even one hour in the sleep rhythm stresses the body and this shows up as increased cardiovascular problems, especially heart attacks.

A lifestyle that goes against these biorhythms is a recipe for ill health. There are surprising findings about the impact of the body rhythm on surgical recovery for instance. A 2017 study in the prestigious medical journal, Lancet, showed that patients undergoing open heart surgery in the afternoon had half the rate of heart damage when compared to patients undergoing the surgery in the morning. The researchers explained that this was most likely due to the internal rhythm of the body — your heart is naturally more susceptible to damage in the morning than the afternoon! Our hormones too have a daily cycle. The stress hormone, cortisol, rises and falls through the day and night.

For good health

To maintain good health, Ayurveda gives us wonderfully insightful advice: do not suppress or instigate the innate functions of the body like hunger, thirst, and sleep. Listen to these urges and let them happen naturally. When we practise asana and pranayama in yoga, we have a golden opportunity to listen to our body sensations and adapt to them. For example, maintaining a healthy weight and metabolism is related to the timing of food too, not just the quality or quantity of food. When it is time for food and we are hungry, the digestive system prepares itself for food, already beginning to secrete enzymes for breaking down the food that it anticipates will reach it.

If we eat when we are not hungry at all, or we do not eat when we are hungry, it throws off the rhythm of the digestive system. When we postpone our lunch because we have a meeting at that time, or we force ourselves to have an early lunch even though we are not hungry because we have a meeting later, we create confusion in our metabolism. Our metabolism does not follow the future based thinking of the mind; it functions in the present.

As you begin listening to your body more closely, you will see that hunger is a complex feeling; there are many levels of hunger. There is the hunger as a lack of energy from the level of the tissues. There is a drop of fuels such as glucose in the blood. Digestive hunger is when we feel a lack of satiety, a feeling of emptiness, in the stomach and digestive tract. Emotional hunger is when we eat as a substitute for other emotional needs. Cognitive hunger is when we eat because we recall food. Social hunger is when we eat because the setting demands it. Programmed hunger is when we eat because of habituation to the time or circumstances.

Paying attention to our internal state is a way for us to understand the differences between these forms of hunger. If we don’t, we will gradually lose sight of what it is to eat for healthful reasons!

Similar to hunger, it is important to learn to sense our other body rhythms like sleep and energy levels too. Yoga is a golden way to be present in the moment, be present with the body, and listen to its rhythms. In the fast pace of modern life, this is one of the best skills you can cultivate for wellbeing and long life.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/listen-to-your-body/article31106992.ece
25,2020/03/19,‘Built to last’ IT sector will navigate through: study,"Pipeline conversion, pricing pressures expected this year

The IT sector is ‘built to last’ and will navigate through the near-term economic shocks, says HDFC Securities Institutional Research.

However, on account of COVID-19, the research forecasts a delay in pipeline conversion and core business, impacting pricing during Q2FY21.

The research spotted improving ‘structural’ trends in key demand drivers, technology supply-chain (trends from leading global products and platform), and supply metrics (H-1B trends on wages, count and geo diversification).

“Our checks with IT companies suggest a moderate acceleration in deal pipeline, some 5-20% increase in ACV of digital deals, growth in digital, driven largely by existing logos indicating increasing stickiness, continuity in vendor consolidation, and limited impact on service delivery from COVID-19, with risk of pipeline conversion uncertainty,”’ said the research report.

The study also confirmed an uptick in retail and CPG and robust tech spend in BFSI, despite growth slowdown. “Tech spend intensity by large BFS remains strong, despite the recent slowdown (about6% YoY growth in BFS tech spend even though revenue growth was 1.6% in CY19),’’ it said.

Notwithstanding the interest rate trajectory impacting revnue performance, tech spend is supported by investments to build strong digital channels/platforms, decommissioning of legacy applications and deployment of BOTs/automation, infrastructure modernisation with shift to hybrid cloud model, and investments in RegTech and Security, the HDFC Securities study observed.

The study also spoke about an improvement in onsite metrics. Indian IT’s H-1B dependence has lowered based on increasing localisation, lower H-1B count and geo-diversification offsetting the impact of rising H-1B wages. Onsite wage inflationary risk mitigated by geo diversification of H-1B (shift to lower cost delivery locations of Texas, Virginia, Florida, Connecticut as compared to California and NYNJ cluster).

Digital playbook remained intact for Indian IT, it further said. “There is shift to hybrid cloud and multi-cloud model. Also there is increase in size of digital deals, examples being: Microsoft’s $10million plus signings, SAP’s €5mn cloud deal. Also there is focus on verticalisation of cloud offerings, in addition to visible digital growth in core verticals such as BFSI and retail impact on travel and hospitality segment expected to be higher (Mindtree/Hexaware).’’",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/built-to-last-it-sector-will-navigate-through-study/article31111408.ece
26,2020/03/19,Virus-hit tourism sector seeks bail out from PM,"About 38 mn may lose jobs as industry stares at bankruptcy, says FAITH

The Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism & Hospitality (FAITH) has sought the immediate intervention of the Prime Minister as the industry was in dire straits and stared at the prospect of unemployment of 38 million people and bankruptcy due to COVID-19.

In a letter addressed to the Prime Minister, a copy of which was released to the media, FAITH president Nakul Anand said as a result of the pandemic, about 38 million people would lose jobs. The effect of job losses is being felt and lay offs have already started.

“With declining revenue, almost all tourism businesses are running out of working capital. However, with the responsibility of staff and payment of their salaries, advance tax, PF, ESIC, GST, excise and other State levies, bank guarantees and security deposits, this industry needs your support now more than ever,” he said in the letter signed by 14 top leaders of the tourism and hospitality sector.

FAITH also sought a complete GST tax holiday for 12 months. “With almost nil revenue, there is hardly going to be any GST collection,” they said.

They sought a 12-month moratorium on interest payments on loans and working capital from financial institutions; doubling of working capital limits; deferment of statutory dues for 12 months and creation of a separate fund among others.

27,2020/03/19,IBA frames business continuity plan for banks,"Lenders told to relocate top officials

The Indian banking sector has been advised to take adequate preparations for any eventuality amid the spread of COVID-19, with the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) issuing norms for banks, including staggering of duties and back-up of essential services.

Since the MD and CEO as well as executive directors are located in the head office, banks have been advised to relocate top officials in different offices in the unforeseen event of quarantining the entire building.

Banks have been asked to monitor key installation centres such as data centres holding the core banking solutions, ATM switch, treasury and SWIFT operations centre, among others. Key officials managing these installations have been advised not to remain in the same office. The plan suggested splitting of treasury functions in different locations and an alternative disaster recovery (DRC) centre in case of complete shutdown of a building where such operations are located.

“In the event of complete shutdown of Mumbai, where most of the banks have treasury and data centres, the alternative DRC should be kept in readiness,” the guidelines said.

The guidelines were prepared after a meeting among bankers regarding preparedness of the banking system to tackle the situation. The human resources department has been asked to replace physical registers with biometric attendance and the management asked to be considerate in sanctioning leave for unwell employees.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/iba-frames-business-continuity-plan-for-banks/article31111381.ece
28,2020/03/19,Yes Bank yet to use RBI’s credit lifeline,"Bank may be having sufficient liquidity

After the moratorium was withdrawn from Yes Bank on Wednesday at 6 p.m. the troubled lender, so far, has not drawn from the creditline provided by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), indicating the bank is having sufficient liquidity to tide over the initial bout of cash withdrawals.

The RBI had sanctioned ₹59,000 crore for Yes Bank under the section 17(4) of the RBI Act that allows the central bank to give loans to lenders in lieu of securities. Sources said if Yes Bank were unable meet cash withdrawal demands on its own, then the limit would have been used. They said initial trends suggested the bank was able to meet cash withdrawal demand and there was also a good amount of funds deposited with the lender.

“Initial trend suggest, the deposits are more than the withdrawals. So, the bank has not utilised the RBI credit line so far,” the sources said.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had assured that the RBI would provide liquidity to Yes Bank if needed, after moratorium was lifted.

“Yes Bank has enough liquidity to meet any requirement. If there is a requirement, the RBI will provide necessary liquidity support to meet its requirements. So, that is a comforting factor for the depositors that the RBI will support Yes Bank if liquidity is required,” he had said.

The private sector lender was put on moratorium on March 5 following worsening financial condition and cash withdrawals were capped at ₹50,000. This was followed by superseding the bank’s board by RBI and an administrator was appointed. A reconstruction plan was drawn up by the RBI, which allowed the State Bank of India to pick up 48% stake in the bank. Some other private sector banks have also picked up stakes in Yes Bank after the SBI came on board.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/yes-bank-yet-to-use-rbis-credit-lifeline/article31111370.ece
29,2020/03/19,Retailers face large-scale closures amid COVID-19 alert,"Croma, which shut 30 stores on Thursday, eyes digital sales

Organised retailers, dealing with non-essential daily use items, are struggling to keep their business operations on, even as State governments are coming out with new regulations to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the country.

Though all business establishments inside shopping malls, other than those dealing with essential items such as grocery and vegetables, have been closed, several standalone stores of organised retail chains have also been closed to comply with the regulations.

According to retailers, authorities are not allowing stores located in densely populated areas to remain open. In Mumbai, civic authorities have identified areas where shops other than those selling groceries and medicines will remain open every alternate day. Similarly, authorities in Gurugram have imposed fresh restrictions. The ban on the presence of more than 50 people at one place is preventing many large stores from remaining open as their employee strength itself is high.

For example Croma, which had shut down 60 stores as of Wednesday, had to close 30 more outlets on Thursday to comply with restrictions. Earlier this week, the retail chain had shuttered certain standalone stores in Mumbai, which have now reopened. Croma has 161 stores nationally.

Ritesh Ghosal, Chief Marketing Officer, Croma, said, “Some of our stores are shut in light of the current events; however, due to our omni presence, we are able to cater to customers’ demand via croma.com. Customers are choosing options like 3-hour delivery on personal gadgets, next-day delivery on home appliances... We are ensuring utmost hygiene for our delivery staff and vehicles as well,” he said. Westside had to close 59 of its 164 outlets.

30,2020/03/19,IndiGo announces pay cut for its employees,"Worse is, perhaps, yet to come: CEO

IndiGo announced pay cuts for its staff with CEO Ronojoy Dutta volunteering to give up 25% of his remuneration.

“With a great deal of reluctance and a deep sense of regret, we are, therefore, instituting pay cuts for all employees excluding Bands A and B, starting April 1, 2020. I am personally taking a 25% pay cut, SVPs and above are taking 20%, VPs and cockpit crew are taking a 15% pay cut, AVPs, Bands D along with cabin crew will take 10% and Band C 5%. We know how hard it is for families to take a cut in take home pay. But unfortunately, it is impossible for our company to fly through this economic storm without all of us making some sacrifices,” Mr. Dutta wrote to his employees.

The move was necessitated because of a sharp fall in revenue, forcing the airline to pay careful attention to cash flows so that it did not run out of cash.

He said the travel advisories issued by various airlines to check the spread of COVID-19 has resulted in a virtual shut down of all of IndiaGo’s international operations and domestic flights, too, had witnessed a drop in bookings by up to 20%.”

He cautioned his employees that the worse was perhaps yet to come. “It is not clear that the situation will not get worse before it gets better,” he wrote.

31,2020/03/19,It may take 6 months for normalcy: CII,"Resort to pay cut, if need be, but keep employees safe: Vikram Kirloskar to corporates

India Inc. may require at least three to six months to restore normalcy and business continuity after the entire course of the COVID-19 event is over, says Vikram Kirloskar, president, Confederation of Indian Industry.

“All of us are facing a tough challenge. Overall, things are not looking good. All industrial segments are suffering. Small-scale industries are under severe pressure. Large industries can’t run without ancillary companies and supply chain support.

“Stock markets are down globally. The rupee is under attack,’’ Mr. Kirloskar told The Hindu.

However, he said, “The good news is that, the Indian government has been handling the issue very sensibly, right from the beginning, compared with other affected geographies. Some say India is the safest place today.’’

The CII has asked all its members to take up leadership role in ensuring the safety of enterprises, employees and society as a whole, and do not rely on rumours that are floating around.

“None of us should panic, rather, we should strictly adhere to advisories, stay calm, move around responsibly, work hard to contain and fight COVID-19, is the message CII wants to give out to all individuals, small entrepreneurs and large corporates in this country,’’ said Mr. Kisloskar.

He said he was supposed to have met a Japanese visitor in India on March 4, but the latter was not allowed into the country and was sent back from the airport itself.

“That means, our government has started taking precautions from the beginning of March. Therefore, I hope and trust that the numbers given out, of COVID-19 suspected and confirmed cases, are correct, of course with some plus or minus.’’

According to him, Indian corporates have been proactive as they are already allowing a lot of their employees to work from home.

“Companies now have to adopt various measures, including cutting operational cost and introducing effective risk management solutions to be able to come out unscathed.’’

As a piece of advice, Mr. Kirloskar said, businesses now have the heavy responsibility of realigning, not retrenching, their people effectively.

“Some top managers may have to take serious pay cuts, some employees can be sent on unpaid vacation for a few months while in some cases, employees may be asked to work extra hours/days to compensate the time that’s lost. However, companies should keep their most critical asset, the people, in safe custody,’’ he urged.

As a word of caution to people, he said, citizens, too, have to be highly responsible. People were missing quarantine and jumping on train or playing in the open. “Don’t take any risk at least for two weeks. We are one of the few countries where COVID-19 which is under control. We have to stop the virus from spreading, which is critical for the safety of our life and livelihood.’’

As per Mr. Kirloskar, the media, overall, has been doing a responsible job in terms of handling virus stories. “However, I am not tracking much of social media, because if I did I may go mad, so I avoid it,’’ he added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/3d971g/article27819792.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12VIKRAMKIRLOSKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/business/it-may-take-6-months-for-normalcy-cii/article31111352.ece

Crisil said a serious downside to the base case can emerge from two developments, one, the pandemic is not contained by April-June 2020 globally, and makes the global slowdown more severe.

33,2020/03/19,Real estate sector likely to suffer big jolt,"‘New sales may be hit badly amid surge in loan defaults and cash constraints’

The spread of COVID-19 in India and the resultant restrictions imposed by government authorities to contain it is expected to impact the real estate sector significantly, say developers and analysts.

“In the mid-term, it is expected that new sales will be badly impacted and there will be a surge in default by customers. This will certainly have a cascading effect on the repayment of loans availed by customers and developers,” said Sanjay Daga, chief operating officer, Runwal Developers.

He said developers would face the daunting task of servicing interest outflows amid constrained cash inflows, postponement of instalments and interest subsidy. “There is a lot of volatility expected in the market resulting in job losses and sustainability of businesses will be at stake,” he said.

‘Too early to predict’

“While it is too early and difficult to predict the exact impact on the realty market, we need to wait for the full economic cycle and implications that come along with it in the coming months,” he added. Farshid Cooper, MD of Spenta Corporation, said the disruptions in the business cycle are bound to impact the demand for commercial as well as residential real estate.

“People are avoiding stepping out of homes and hence there is a dip in walk-ins across all residential projects too. Investors, as well as end-users, are opting for a ‘wait and watch’ policy amid the pandemic,” he said.

Ashok Mohanani, chairman, Ekta World and vice-president, Naredco Maharashtra, said, “The momentum in the housing market, which had begun to show some potential over the past few quarters, would likely slow down in the first half of 2020. There is definitely a fall in site visits by potential homebuyers. This, in turn, will have a cascading effect on sales of property.”

Commenting on the issue Niranjan Hiranandani, national president, Naredco, said, “The pandemic menace has hit at a particularly sensitive time, that of the financial year closing. Across real estate companies, this is the time when statutory pay-outs and streamlining of balance sheets happen.”

He said this year’s festive occasion of Gudi Padwa/Ugadi might see a drop in launches and delayed deal closures, following a direct effect on site visits by potential buyers.

“When it comes to commercial real estate, the impact of COVID-19 in form of shutdown of retail outlets and malls as also entertainment and fitness centers has put commercial real estate deals on ‘wait and watch mode,” he added.

Anurag Mathur, CEO, Savills India said for the real estate industry, COVID-19 could prove to be an additional dampener in the short term as the sector is already under intense pressure because of the ongoing liquidity crunch and weak market sentiment.

“However, it is important to note that these are temporary disruptions and would not hold back the economy and the industry in the long run.

The rupee tumbled past the 75-to-a-dollar mark on Thursday for the first-time ever as foreign investors continued to pull out of emerging market economies following the spread of COVID-19 that has put global economic growth at risk.

The rupee opened weak at 74.96 to a dollar compared with the previous close of 74.26 and went on to hit 75.31 a dollar. Currency dealers said state-run banks had been spotted intervening on behalf of the central bank, helping the currency stem losses.

The rupee closed the day at 75.10, down ₹0.84 or 1.13%. The currency has lost almost 3% against the greenbackdollar this month. The rupee weakened despite the sharp fall in oil prices over the last few days and a narrowing current account deficit. The U.S. Dollar index surged 1.6% to a three-year high of over 100.

“The rupee remains under tremendous pressure given the fallout of COVID-19Similarly, various emerging market currencies are bearing the brunt of foreign capital outflows from equity and debt markets. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar continues to power higher against the basket of currencies as global financial markets remain very unsettled,” said Hitesh Jain, lead analyst, Yes Securities.

“On the rupee outlook, we sense that volatility will persist unless the adverse impact of the pandemic on the global financial markets abates. We see the rupee in the range of 74-76 for the next 1-2 months,” he added.

The weakness in the currency market spilled over to the bond market with the yield on the 10-year government bond jumping 11 bps to 6.41%.

36,2020/03/19,Fuel sales drop on virus impact,"People now commuting less; ATF sales hit as more international flights cancelled

Sales of sensitive petroleum products such as petrol and diesel have dropped in March compared with February as more people stay back at home to prevent COVID-19 from spreading.

Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOC), India’s largest fuel retailer, has witnessed a 10.92% fall in sales of diesel and a 1.74% drop in sales of petrol across its retail outlets in India in March compared with February.

IOC’s diesel sales had fallen by 1,84,071 kilo litres (KL), or 10.92%, to 15,00,965 KL as on March 18 compared with a sales of 16,85,036 KL from February 1-18.

Similarly, its petrol sales reduced by 13,492 KL, or 1.74%, to 7,60,629 KL as on March 18 compared with a sales of 7,74,121 KL from February 1 - 18. Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) sales have come down in March by 7%.

“During the period between March 1 and 17 (compared with February 1 and 17), IOC’s ATF sales are down by about 7%. It is expected to drop further in the coming days if the present scenario continues,” a source in the know of the development told The Hindu.

Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited’s (BPCL) aviation business has been more impacted on falling ATF sales as it services more international flights, which witnessed higher cancellations in March.

“The fall in the sales of sensitive petroleum products was sharper in the last one week and is likely to fall at a faster rate in the coming weeks as more and more people are staying back at home to avoid getting affected by the virus,” said an oil marketing company board member.

Double-digit decline

HPCL and BPCL have also seen double-digit decline in diesel and ATF sales.

R. Ramachandran, director, refineries, BPCL, told The Hindu, “We have seen a double-digit fall in diesel and ATF sales in March so far due to COVID-19 impact. Petrol is marginally up now but will also become negative by the end of this month, if the trend continues.”

The decline in sales comes even as prices of petrol had fallen by over ₹6 a litre and diesel by about ₹7 a litre since January 2020 on the back of plummeting global crude oil prices.

After all the four convicts in the Nirbhaya case got to know about their hanging on Friday morning, they started sobbing and refused evening tea on Thursday. The Tihar jail authorities held a meeting over the preparations and did a final trial run.

A Tihar jail officer said after the convicts were informed that the Delhi court had rejected the plea seeking a stay on the executions, they got restless and started sobbing. The convicts have been kept in separate wards.

“They tried to harm themselves but were stopped by jail staff. They have been put under surveillance and a counsellor was asked to talk to them. The jail staff have been instructed to keep a watch on them. In a shift pattern, jail staff will be stationed outside each ward to keep watch on their activity,” said the officer.

The officer said they are following the procedure as per the Tihar jail manual. The bodies will be shifted to the DDU hospital by 8 a.m. for post-mortem. The final meeting of the convicts with their family members had already happened except Akshay as no one had come to meet him.

The families have not informed the officials that they will take the bodies for cremation. If they refuse, Tihar will cremate them as per procedure, said the officer.

He said the money earned by the convicts during their stay in the jail would be handed over to their family members because they haven’t mentioned any beneficiary or signed any will.

Just before the convicts are taken to the gallows, the jail superintendent will visit the prisoner sentenced to death in his cell a few minutes before the hour fixed for execution. The Superintendent shall read over a translation of the warrant in vernacular to the prisoner. Any other documents requiring attestation by the prisoner, such as his will, shall thereafter be signed and attested in the presence of the Superintendent, said per jail manual.

40,2020/03/19,"Madhya Pradesh crisis: Kamal Nath govt. will face defeat, says Chouhan","Our MLAs have to take up a big responsibility now. The BJP bastion is strong: former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister

Hailing the Supreme Court order directing the Congress-led Madhya Pradesh government to take the floor test on Friday, BJP vice president and former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan exuded confidence that the government would face defeat, paving the way for a new regime.

“Satyamev Jayate! Truth has prevailed today, injustice has been defeated,” Mr. Chouhan told reporters. “People’s anger is taking the Kamal Nath government down. Our MLAs have to take up a big responsibility now. The BJP bastion is strong.”

Confident that the BJP had the numbers, the former CM said, “It will be proven on Friday that this government is in minority. Terrorism, pressure tactics, allurements and threats, Mr. Nath and especially Digivjaya Singh have been on them. Today, they have been defeated”.

Law Minister P.C. Sharma, however, expressed confidence the government would survive. “It will be a victory for the Kamal Nath government by all means. More hands will be raised for us in the Assembly,” he asserted.

Stating that the 16 rebel Congress MLAs in Bengaluru, who have reportedly pledged loyalty to the erstwhile Congressman turned BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, “must be heard”, Mr. Sharma said the Congress would take suggestions from lawyers representing it on the further legal recourse.

The embattled government is shored up by 92 Congress MLAs in Bhopal, while four independents, two BSP members and the lone SP MLA have backed it in the past. Even as the party tried desperately to woo back the 22 MLAs, who are currently in Bengaluru, the rebel members sent in their resignation letters through BJP leaders. The Speaker has so far accepted the resignations of six members. all of whom were ministers in the government.

In the wake of these six resignations and the earlier deaths of two members, the effective strength of the 230-member House now stands at 222. And Mr. Nath, Chief Minister for 15 months now, will have to secure the trust of at least 112 members, failing which the government will fall. The BJP, which remained in power for 15 years previously, has 107 members in the Assembly.

On whether the rebels would return to vote, Mr. Chouhan said, “It is for them to decide.” Revenue Minister Jitu Patwari, on the other hand, said it was crucial for the rebels to return and participate in the vote. “If they don’t, it will be considered a murder of democracy. How will they face their voters after that? To protect democracy, they have to be here.” The Congress has contended that the MLAs had been held hostage in BJP-ruled Karnataka, where several attempts by Congressmen to reach out to them had been foiled by the State police. The rebels, in several videos on social media, have ostensibly voiced their protest against the Congress government and said that they didn’t want to be approached by the party’s leaders. However, all but one are said to be undecided on joining the BJP.

Priyavrat Singh, Energy Minister, contended that in politics, all possibilities must be considered until the last minute. “The test needs to be conducted by 5 p.m. on Friday. Even for those 16 MLAs, possibilities are open until then.”

On Monday, when the Speaker had adjourned the Assembly to March 26 in view of the coronavirus threat, the BJP had paraded 106 of its MLAs at the Raj Bhavan to show the Governor that it had the numbers. “We have already shown our numbers. Where is the doubt?” asked Narottam Mishra, Chief Whip for the BJP in the Assembly. “The Congress has been constantly running away from the test. The disease was just an excuse to put it off.”

BJP State president V.D. Sharma said the court order reflected the decision of 7.5 crore people of the State, which the Congress “had been deceiving” all the while. “This is a win for the poor. The court has heard the cry of every BJP worker, harassed by the Congress government.”

An atmosphere of distrust had prevailed among the State’s people, said Leader of the Opposition Gopal Bhargava. “The order has set a precedent. In any case, no member is ignored in the BJP, as in the Congress,” he added.

Meanwhile, Mr. Nath posted on Twitter: “We will study the Supreme Court’s order and its every aspect, hold discussions with our legal experts, take advice, and based on that take a decision.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ixz7qe/article31111431.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THCHOUHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/madhya-pradesh-crisis-kamal-nath-govt-will-face-defeat-says-chouhan/article31111432.ece

Speaking after a meeting with Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal to assess measures to combat COVID-19 epidemic, Mr Kejriwal said all educational institutions have been directed to close till March 31 for both teaching and non-teaching staff.

Non-essential public services will be disallowed from Friday.

“The Delhi government is taking all relevant measures to contain the spread of coronavirus. We have had 10 cases in Delhi until now, with the unfortunate demise of one of the patients. Two patients have recovered and one patient has left for Singapore. We currently have six COVID-19 patients, most of them are recovering now,” he said.

The Delhi government, he stated, had an existing capacity of 768 beds to be installed in quarantine facilities until now of which only 57 beds that are currently occupied. Of the 550 isolation beds in Delhi government hospitals for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, 40 beds have been occupied with suspected coronavirus cases.

There are, he said, 95 beds available in the central government hospitals, out of which 67 beds have been occupied by suspected COVID-19 patients.

“We have also started stamping all the people who have been advised to self-quarantine themselves, owing to many of the patients who have been escaping the quarantine premises,” the CM said.

""We are disinfecting buses, ISBTs, and metros daily. We were also disinfecting private public service vehicles, like autos, taxis, and cabs daily in two shifts,” he added.

Mr. Kejriwal appealed to the people to comprehend the intensity of the situation and avoid stepping out of their homes.

“Stay at home as much as you can and work from home. I want to appeal to the private sector institutions to provide work from home permits to their employees… Senior citizens need to be the most cautious of all,” he said.

This, he said, even as the number of people banned to gather for any event was modified from 50 to 20.

“We had recently announced that no social, political, cultural, family, sports and seminars gathering comprising of more than 50 people will be allowed in the city. We have brought down the number of people to 20,"" he noted.

Meanwhile, Raj Niwas, in a statement, said Mr. Baijal has appealed all to follow government directives, practice social distancing and avoid unnecessary travel.

“The Private Sector be advised to work from home wherever possible, promote contactless digital transactions, stoppage of breath analyser tests by Traffic Police, waiver of tax for hotel rooms for quarantined persons,” Raj Niwas said the L-G had directed.

India slammed Pakistan on Thursday for raising Kashmir during a SAARC video-conference earlier this week, saying Islamabad “misused” the occasion as it was not a political platform, but a humanitarian one. A Pakistan Minister had called for an immediate lifting of the “lockdown” in J&K.

Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called for the SAARC nations’ video-conference to formulate a joint strategy to combat the coronavirus in the spirit that a crisis of this magnitude did not recognise borders.

Asked about Pakistan using the occasion to raise Kashmir, he said, “We believe that the platform was to bring the countries of the region together to address the pandemic. This was not a political platform, but a humanitarian one, and Pakistan misused it.”

During the video-conference on Sunday, Pakistan’s State Minister of Health Zafar Mirza called for an immediate lifting of the “lockdown” in Jammu and Kashmir to allow virus containment measures.

Apart from Mr. Mirza and Prime Minister Modi, Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Maldivian President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, Nepalese Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli, Bhutanese premier Lotay Tshering, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani had participated in the video-conference.

“Equity in health is a fundamental principle of public health. In this regard, let me say that it is a matter of concern that COVID-19 has been reported” from Jammu and Kashmir and in view of the health emergency, it is imperative that all “lockdown” there must be lifted immediately, Mr. Mirza had said.

“Opening up communication and movement would facilitate dissemination of information, allow distribution of medical supplies and allow containment...to proceed unimpeded,” the special assistant to the Pakistani Prime Minister on health had said.

Government sources had earlier said Pakistan’s attempt to “politicise” a humanitarian issue by its “unwarranted” statement on Kashmir during the video-conference on coronavirus reflected “very poorly” on it.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a6no40/article31074652.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-PM-Modi-saarc-twittermodi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-slams-pak-for-raising-kashmir-at-saarc-video-conference-says-it-misused-platform/article31111210.ece

Personnel of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) in Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) on Wednesday night traced and isolated an Assam man who had fled a quarantine centre for COVID-19 in Kerala.

The 24-year-old man, from Lahorighat in central Assam’s Morigaon district, was taken off a train at western Assam’s New Bongaigaon railway station and kept at an isolation ward of the railway hospital there for further observation.

Morigaon district’s Superintendent of Police Swapnaneel Deka said the Kerala police had tipped them off about the man having fled a quarantine facility along with two others – one from Odisha and the other from West Bengal.

“We tracked his mobile phone and alerted the railways after the train he was in entered Assam,” he said.

NFR spokesperson Subhanan Chanda said the man confessed to have fled from the Kerala quarantine centre. “He travelled by train to Chennai and Howrah. In Kolkata, he boarded the Kanchenjungha Express and was supposed to get down at the Guwahati station,” he added.

RPF personnel took him off the train at New Bongaigaon while doctors screened all the other passengers in the general coach he was travelling in. “The isolation ward is being guarded to prevent the man from escaping again while all the other passengers have been advised to go for home quarantine according to norms,” Mr. Chanda said.

A local youth who returned from Rajasthan with cough and fever a couple of days ago has put a village in central Assam’s Nagaon district on the edge. Suspecting that he was infected with the novel coronavirus, neighbours called in health officials.

But the youth fled when he saw an ambulance and health officials arriving to test him. Villagers have joined the local police in searching for him.

Cancellation of trains

On Thursday, the NFR cancelled a number of trains as a precautionary measure and advised people to avoid inessential travel. The Assam government also added beauty parlours, barber shops, libraries, bars, museums and coaching centres to the list of public facilities for closure till March 31.

The government had shut down all educational institutes, swimming pools, gymnasiums, children’s parks and all national parks and wildlife sanctuaries.

As matters under rule 377 began, more and more members raised specific issues with regard to the pandemic. Raju Bista, BJP MP from Darjeeling, said his constituency sees a large number of tourists but facilities for screening for the disease are not adequate. He raised the issue of racial profiling of people from the northeast as carriers of the disease. “Lately we are seeing that people from the northeast with different facial features are being singled out and racially profiled as carriers of the virus. I would like the government to give attention to this aspect as well,” he said.

Sumalatha Ambareesh, MP from Mandya, said while the virus was a big challenge, combating rumours circulating on social media was also a challenge. “This is the first pandemic in the age of social media and combating rumours is also important in the fight against the disease. I want to ask the government to set up a dedicated social media account just to bust rumours,” she said.

47,2020/03/19,"Coronavirus | Narendra Modi calls for determination, patience and a ‘janata curfew’","Apart from the people’s curfew on March 22, there were nine calls to action in the Prime Minister’s address including the formation of a COVID-19 task force under Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 19 urged Indians across the country to face the coronavirus pandemic with collective determination and patience, to make sure that “humanity and India prevails”. In his address to the nation over television, Mr. Modi also announced the setting up of the COVID-19 task force, under Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for measures to mitigate some of the economic hardships engendered by the pandemic.

There were nine calls to action in Prime Minister Modi’s address including a self-imposed ‘janata curfew’ (people’s curfew) on March 22, not to resort to panic buying, asking senior citizens to stay indoors, social distancing, avoiding elective surgery or routine health check-ups to not over burden health services, asking employers to pay employees in full when they have to stay home and to stay away from rumours.

Global crisis

The pandemic, the Prime Minister said, was a serious, global crisis, “involving more countries than any previous natural or political crisis, even during World War I or World War II”.

Mr. Modi said as there was no clear treatment, medicine or vaccine that had been found to counter the novel coronavirus, it was incumbent on people to observe escalation via social distancing. He asked all Indians, as a sign of their collective determination to observe a voluntary people’s curfew between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. on March 22. This, he said, would be observed and implemented by the people themselves, to not stir out of their houses.

He also asked that on March 22, at 5 p.m., people should step out on their balconies, verandas or doorways and express by clapping or beating thalis (metal plates), their appreciation for the work of those employed in hospitals, airports, railways, police and other essential services, who he said “were our bulwark, till now against the pandemic”.

He urged people to give up the attitude that all was well or that they would, somehow, escape the disease. “Since there is no firm treatment available for this virus, social distancing is the only thing to do. Therefore, give me a few weeks, and avoid going out unless it is strictly necessary,” he said.

The Prime Minister reiterated that enough supplies of necessities were available and he assured people that there was no situation where this would not be so.

“Therefore, I urge all of you to avoid panic buying and buy only as much as you would normally do,” he said.

Stating that the economic impact of the pandemic was significant and world wide, Mr. Modi said he had set up a ‘COVID-19 Task Force” under Ms. Sitharaman to consult with stakeholders and come up with measures to address the crisis.

Appeal to employers

“This pandemic will hit our middle and lower middle class and our poor economically,” he said, appealing to industrialists and employers to ensure that salaries of employees is not cut due to temporary shutting down of businesses and to take a “humane view” of things.

Mr. Modi also asked people to desist from routine check ups and elective surgeries as hospitals would get overloaded. “I urge you all that if you have a check up scheduled, please postpone it for a few days or try and get advise over the phone. Please postpone elective surgeries too,” he said. He urged senior citizens to stay indoors, stating “stay healthy to keep others healthy”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hk90i4/article31111258.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MODI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-narendra-modi-calls-for-determination-patience-and-a-janata-curfew/article31111259.ece
48,2020/03/19,Coronavirus | Care and containment will both be important but relative priorities will change: PHFI president Srinath Reddy,"Public health expert K. Srinath Reddy says it is up to the private sector to step up as a willing partner in a time of major national health emergency

Professor K. Srinath Reddy is the President, Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and formerly headed the Department of Cardiology at All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Under his leadership, PHFI has established five Indian Institutes of Public Health (IIPHs) in different regions of India, to advance multi-disciplinary public health education, research and implementation support for strengthening health systems. He holds advisory positions in several national and international bodies and recently published a book Make Health in India: Reaching A Billion Plus. He speaks to The Hindu’s Bindu Shajan Perappadan on how India’s strategy will change if community transmission starts, stating that care will take over priority in containment.

What should be India’s specific plan if we slip into community transmission?

It depends on how localised or widespread the transmission is across the country, and the speed of spread from one location to another, especially the urban to rural spread.

At all times, care and containment will both be important but relative priorities will change depending on the extent of community spread. In early stages of a spread, there would be a need to test on the basis of well-defined clinical criteria, isolate and treat the cases based on severity, and trace their contacts, while energetically working to prevent spread to unaffected regions.

In later stages, if many cases arise in different parts of the country, the highest priority would be to save lives by focusing resources on providing the best hospital care possible to those who are severely affected.

After stratifying risk, based on composite clinical criteria, less severe cases can be treated at home or in health facilities which do not offer intensive care. At that time, care overtakes containment in priority. We should mobilise both public and private hospitals and strengthen the collective capacity to deliver the type of care needed to all affected persons.

How are we enhancing our lab capacity? Do we have enough ventilator beds to cater to community transmission? How will the private sector be involved in terms of testing and bed facilities?

Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is expanding the laboratory capacity by accrediting medical colleges, research institutions and private laboratories which meet the required standards. The test kits needed are also being scaled up with domestic and imported components being made available for large-scale testing.

As for ventilators, it depends on how many persons will require intensive care. Recognising that there is presently a shortage compared to the anticipated need, if community spread occurs and numbers of persons with serious viral pneumonitis requiring ventilator care is large, efforts are being made to increase the procurement and availability of ventilators.

Dedicated intensive care areas are also being created in hospitals across the country. There is also an accompanying need for health personnel in intubation, efficiently operating the ventilators and providing respiratory care with efficiency and safety. That is also a gap that needs to be urgently filled.

The private sector has already been invited by the government to join hands in providing an accessible, effective and equitable response by participating in laboratory testing and in providing hospitalised care. It is up to the private sector to step up as a willing partner in a time of major national health emergency and use its institutional capacity and expertise as per agreed protocols. The specific modalities are being worked by the relevant governmental agencies at Central and State levels.

What is your advise to the general public, government and health care workers?

The public should, to the maximum extent possible, practice personal protection and social distancing to protect themselves. They should not be misled by incorrect messaging on social media and try to access authentic information from qualified sources. Xenophobia, of any kind, should be avoided. If there is an illness that arouses concern, they should report to a nearby health facility where they would be assessed. If found positive and advised home or hospital quarantine, they should accept that advice and not slip away to infect others.

The governments, at Central and State levels, should step up coordinated efforts to contain the epidemic and provide timely and appropriate care and counselling to all persons who need it. Healthcare workers should follow protocols for diagnosis and management at different levels of care and different clinical presentations. They should ensure that they themselves are well protected and not fall victim to infection or exhaustion.

What is the impact of people leaving isolation facilities and hospitals prior to discharge?

If quarantined persons leave the hospital during the infective period, they become a social menace. If they are ill, they do self-harm by depriving themselves of needed healthcare. This can have dangerous consequences and may end in avoidable fatality.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fu4so6/article31111237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th19-Srinath-Reddy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/care-and-containment-are-equally-important-phfi-president-srinath-reddy/article31111238.ece
49,2020/03/19,Coronavirus | Indian pilgrim dies of COVID-19 in Iran,"Indian Embassy opens a hostel to house a part of pilgrims who tested positive for coronavirus

One of the 255 Indian pilgrims in Iran suffering from COVID-19 has died, the government announced on Thursday. The death of the unnamed pilgrim came on a day when the Indian Embassy opened a hostel to house a part of the pilgrims who had tested positive for the virus.

“The Embassy, in cooperation with health authorities in Qom, set up a wellness facility to take care of and undertake 24/7 supervision of infected Indian pilgrims. The hygienic facility, surrounded by greenery, has ample space for the pilgrims to walk around. Two full-time and eight part-time Indian student volunteers are helping out dedicated Iranian medical personnel in the effort,” said the Embassy in a statement.

Evacuation assurance

The Ministry of External Affairs has assured those unaffected by the viral infection that they will be evacuated to India. “Let us assure you, those who have tested negative will be brought back,” said Dammu Ravi, Additional Secretary of the Ministry who is in charge of India’s global coordination to fight the coronavirus crisis. He indicated that those who have tested positive will for the time being stay in Iran and receive medical attention.

The pilgrims are part of a large team of 850 members mainly from Kashmir and Ladakh who were stranded after the cancellation of commercial flights in view of coronavirus outbreak in Iran. The Ministry of External Affairs indicated that the infected passengers will remain in the wellness facility as speculation continues for additional such facilities as the Iranian authorities have asked all hotels to be shut in view of the tough measures in the city of Qom which has emerged as the epicentre of the outbreak in the country.

Concerns over housing

While the creation of the wellness facility has ensured quarantine-like condition for the infected ones, concerns remain about the rest of the pilgrims who require financial help and housing till they are evacuated to India. Iran has asked hotels to be emptied of guests in view of the crisis and the pilgrims are seeking help from New Delhi to be evacuated.

“Adequate care was taken to analyse samples of pilgrims there. We have separated those who are negative and positive. Things are now quite controlled and people are recovering,” said Mr. Ravi.

50,2020/03/19,"Coronavirus | Stay where you are, MEA tells Indians abroad","Not advisable for people to move from one region to another, say officials

Urging Indians and residents who are stranded in different cities abroad to find alternative accommodation locally at least until the end of the month, the Ministry of External Affairs said Indian missions are helping them make arrangements and they must “stay put where they are”.

“It is not advisable for people to move from one region to another region. This must be understood in the context of the gravity of the crisis. These restrictions are temporary, so one should not panic. If Indians are held up in some places, our advice would be to stay put,” said Dammu Ravi, additional secretary in charge of coordinating the efforts to counter COVID-19.

MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar added that the government was requesting other countries to extend the visas for Indians who have to stay on, in the same manner that India has facilitated visa-extensions for foreign nationals in India.

Their remarks came just moments before the government announced it would suspend all incoming commercial flights to India from March 22, for a week until March 29, indicating that the government expects Indians abroad to stay there until March 30 at the very least.

The MEA said Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) who are based in India but were abroad at the time the government revoked their visa facility, would not be allowed back at this stage. Sources said the government’s aim was to “minimise the impact of what might happen until we know the full extent of the [virus’s spread].”

When asked how Indians and resident OCIs in these locations, including many students on a tight budget, were expected to manage, MEA officials said, “Ideally they must take care of themselves locally with whatever resources they have, and our missions are in the forefront to support these stranded Indian and helping them to the best of our abilities.”

In addition the MEA said it was attempting arrange enough flights for “Coronavirus-negative” Indians who are stuck at airports including London, Schiphol, Rome, Manila, Kuala Lumpur and other cities, as soon as possible, but may not be able to facilitate their return before the Sunday deadline.

According to Mr. Ravi, the government has managed to bring back all those who needed to be brought back from Singapore, and local missions would help passengers in other locations. The MEA conceded that many passengers had been offloaded from flights to India because some airlines had “wrongly interpreted” the embargo times, and they would study such cases separately.

In particular, the MEA expects to run a number of flights to Italy over the weekend from Rome and Milan. “We have received the test results of those stuck in Italy, and fortunately a large number have been found to be negative, and we will be working out the logistics for their return,” officials said.

Meanwhile the government said it is working on commitments made to neighbouring SAARC nations during the video-conference initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday. “The [$10 million] emergency fund is already up and running,” said Mr. Kumar, adding that requests totalling about $1 million for masks, gloves and disinfectants have already been received, of which supplies have been dispatched to Bhutan and the Maldives.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/y9g61r/article31111088.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NATIONLEAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/stay-where-you-are-mea-tells-indians-abroad/article31111089.ece

53,2020/03/19,Parliament proceedings | New definition of MSMEs before end of Budget session: Nitin Gadkari,"Minister flags pending payments to MSMEs by govts, PSUs

Union Minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Nitin Gadkari told the Rajya Sabha on Thursday that the government would come out with a new definition of MSMEs, which are currently defined on the basis of investment in plant and machinery, by the end of the ongoing session.

Concluding the discussion on the working of his Ministry that started on Wednesday, Mr. Gadkari said the government was working on the new definition.

Congress member Jairam Ramesh had suggested that MSME units should be defined on the basis of turnover as it would increase compatibility with the Goods and Services Tax (GST) system.

Responding to concerns raised by several MPs, Mr. Gadkari admitted that “there are problems” but asserted that the government was trying to convert those hurdles into opportunities. It had accepted 39 suggestions by the U.K. Sinha committee appointed by the Reserve Bank of India, including the setting up a “fund of funds” for the sector. The MSME sector currently contributed 24% of the GDP growth and 48% of exports, with an annual turnover of Rs. 1 lakh crore this year. A target of Rs.5 lakh crore in five years had been set, he said.

Among the hurdles before the sector was the pending payments by governments and public sector undertakings, which Mr. Gadkari estimated were Rs.5.5 lakh crore to Rs.6 lakh crore. These dues needed to be cleared in order to boost the sector.

He said he had made recommendations to help the sector in view of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had called a meeting to discuss the same on Friday. On the impact of demonetisation in 2016 and introduction of the GST in 2017, which several MPs said had hit the MSME sector, Mr. Gadkari said there had been a temporary impact that was no longer the case.

To boost products from rural India, Mr. Gadkari said the government had decided to set up an “Alibaba or Amazon-type” portal for Khadi Gramodyog.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/d0r5d0/article31111072.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THGADKARI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliament-proceedings-new-definition-of-msmes-before-end-of-budget-session-nitin-gadkari/article31111066.ece
54,2020/03/19,"Parliament proceedings | Will Delhi Police pay for damage to Jamia Library, asks Samajwadi Party MP Javed Ali Khan","HRD Minister ducked question from SP MP on compensation

Will Delhi Police pay for “vandalising” the library at Jamia Millia Islamia University on December 17, on the lines of U.P. government’s order to make the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protestors to pay for damages to public amenities, a Samajwadi Party MP asked the HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank on Thursday in Rajya Sabha.

The Minister evaded the question with a vague reply that the University Grants Commission funds all universities and will foot the bill.

“Whether it is a fact that the Jamia Millia Islamia University has sent an assessment of ₹2.66 crore to government to compensate for the damage done by Delhi Police in it’s library,” SP MP Javed Ali Khan said. Drawing a parallel with U.P. administration’s announcement to make the protestors pay for damage to public goods, Mr. Khan further enquired, “Since the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh have already booked the protestors for damage to public amenities, will the government here make Delhi Police pay for barging into the library and vandalising it?”

The HRD Minister had no definitive reply to the question. He said the University Grants Commission funds all universities and will be also be footing the bill in this case. When he was further questioned, Mr. Pokhriyal said, “Universities are autonomous bodies and they have the right to act independently.”

To this Mr. Khan said everyone is aware that the universities are autonomous bodies but they do not have power to recover the money from Delhi Police.

Asking a supplementary question, Congress MP Rajeev Gowda said whether the government plans to take any action against Delhi Police for attacking students at Jamia. “As HRD Minister, you are the protector of students in universities across the country. Here, in Jamia, we saw that the students were attacked; we saw that the institution's properties were attacked. There is evidence out there which shows policemen damaging the CCTV to cover up the evidence. What action have you taken against these police personnel against whom evidence is in the public domain for having vandalized Jamia property, which affected the lives and studies of the students?” he asked.

55,2020/03/19,Parliament proceedings | Don’t avoid deposing before probe agencies citing session: Venkaiah Naidu,"RS chairman’s comments come in the backdrop of ED summons to MP Subhash Chandra in Yes Bank case

Rajya Sabha Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday cautioned all members not to use the excuse of ongoing Parliament session to avoid deposing in front of investigating agencies. He did not name any one specifically, but his comments come in the backdrop of summons recently issued by the Enforcement Directorate to Rajya Sabha MP Subhash Chandra in connection with the Yes Bank case.

“I would like to mention that no member of the House should avoid appearing before any investigating agency, when she or he is called upon to do, by citing the reason of the House duty,” Mr. Naidu said in the Rajya Sabha in a suo motu statement. He said that as lawmakers, it was our bounden duty to respect the law and legal procedures. “It applies to all, in all cases, because you can only inform that the House is in session, seeking further date, but you cannot avoid the enforcement agencies or the law enforcing agencies’ summons or notices,” he added.

Congress MPs cheered his statement with many thanking him for making the position clear.

Mr. Chandra on Monday tweeted, “I have been requested by ED to make a statement on the information which is already available with them. I will be more than happy to be personally present at their office, honouring their request, in order to extend all the required co-operation.” He further added that the Essel Group which he heads has never made any transactions with Yes Bank promoter Rana Kapoor or his family or for that matter any private entities controlled by them.

56,2020/03/19,Parliament proceedings | Lok Sabha passes bill declaring Jamnagar ayurveda centre as ‘institution of national importance’,"The Lok Sabha on Thursday passed a bill that will accord the Jamnagar-based Institute of Teaching and Research in Ayurveda the status of ‘institution of national importance’ by clubbing the cluster of ayurveda institutes at the Gujarat Ayurveda University campus in Jamnagar.

The Minister of State for AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy) Shripad Yesso Naik said people across the globe were now showing greater interest in ayurveda.

Though Opposition members including Kerala’s N. K. Premachandran sought to move some amendments to the legislation, these proposals were defeated by a voice vote.

The three institutes which would be a part of the proposed conglomeration are the Institute of Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda, Gulabkunwerba Ayurveda Mahavidyalaya and the Institute of Ayurveda Pharmaceutical Sciences.

Initiating the discussion, the Congress’s Shashi Tharoor said that the proposed legislation was both “welcome and disappointing”.

He stressed on the need for documentation of knowledge sources so that none could describe ayurveda as a ‘vodoo science’ and cited examples of renowned medical practitioners writing international papers seeking to discredit ayurveda.

Describing Kerala as the engine of growth for ayurveda, Mr. Tharoor said 65-70% of rural India was dependent on ayurveda but not much was done to protect the practitioners.

“I request that what is being done for Gujarat should be done for Kerala,” the Congress MP said. Several members from Kerala, who spoke after Mr. Tharoor, expressed similar views.

Terming ayurveda as the oldest medical practice, the DMK’s K. Veeraswamy said there was a need to establish a council which could monitor practitioners of ayurveda.

58,2020/03/19,Nirbhaya case convicts to be hanged as Delhi High Court rejects plea for stay on execution,"Having exhausted all legal remedies, including mercy petitions before the President, three of the convicts met their families for the last time.

The four death-row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case were set to be hanged on March 20 at 5.30 a.m.

In a last-minute plea three of them had moved the Delhi High Court on March 19 evening, challenging a trial court order declining to stay their execution. The High Court said there was no foundation in their plea. A Bench, headed by Justice Manmohan, heard the matter at 9 p.m. The plea was mentioned before the registry officials who put it up before the Chief Justice of the High Court.

The trial court had in the afternoon dismissed the plea of Akshay Kumar Singh, Pawan Gupta, Vinay Sharma, seeking to stay the death warrants. They, along with Mukesh Singh, were scheduled to be hanged on March 20.

Having exhausted all legal remedies, including mercy petitions before the President, three of the convicts met their families for the last time. The family of one did not come to visit him.

Arguments rejected

Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana rejected the pleas of Akshay Kumar, Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma seeking a stay on their execution on the ground that the second mercy plea of one of them was still pending.

Advocate A.P. Singh, representing the convicts, argued that Akshay’s wife had filed for a divorce in a Bihar court, which was pending. Responding to this, the special public prosecutor said the petition did not fall under the purview of legal remedy in the present case.

On March 5, a trial court issued fresh death warrants for March 20 at 5.30 am for Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan (25), Vinay (26) and Akshay (31).

This comes seven years after the incident in which the four death row convicts; Ram Singh, the fifth accused who has died; and a minor gang-raped a paramedic student and left her fighting for her life for 13 days before she died of her injuries.

The March 20 date has come after a series of postponements. The first death warrants were issued by a trial court on January 7 for execution on January 22 but it was postponed by the court to February 1 and then further postponed to March 3.

The night before the hanging, Tihar Jail authorities said hangman Pawan and Jail Superintendent took stock of the preparation and found everything in order. They also conducted a “mock hanging” on March 19 morning using sandbags. “Just after being told that their review petition has been rejected and their execution date was final, the four convicts started sobbing,” said the jail authorities.

The Supreme Court on Thursday noted that the state of political uncertainty in Madhya Pradesh cannot continue and advanced the floor test to March 20.

A Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta Gupta has thus advanced the date of the floor test by six days. The Speaker had scheduled the floor test on March 26. This means that the floor test would not wait for the Speaker's decision on the resignation of the 16 rebel MLAs.

62,2020/03/19,Punjab reports first COVID-19 death,"70-year-old man, who arrived at Delhi airport on March 7 from Germany via Italy, dies in Banga town

Punjab has reported its first case COVID-19 death, after a 70-year-old man died at a civil hospital in the Banga town of Shahid Bhagat Singh Nagar district.

The deceased had arrived from Germany via Italy at Delhi airport on March 7, and proceeded to the State on the same day. He was known to have diabetes and hypertension, and was confirmed positive for the coronavirus on March 18, an official statement said on Thursday.

‘Allow private testing’

Warning of a worsening COVID-19 crisis in the country, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh asked the Central government to allow private hospitals and labs to conduct tests in order to ensure access to all people, making it clear that he did not agree with the current policy of the Centre in this regard.

He said he would take up the issue of testing by private hospitals and labs with the Prime Minister on Friday during the latter’s proposed video conference with all Chief Ministers, stressing that the Centre has to consider reviewing its policy in this regard.

“Given the fact that Punjab has private labs in all the major cities, it was not logical for a person suspected to have the coronavirus to have to travel to Chandigarh or some other place to get himself tested from a government facility only,” he said, adding that only in the case of doubt should such a person be required to go elsewhere for a second test.

The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) on Thursday issued another set of directives for government employees on preventive measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. The orders will remain in force till April 4.

The fresh instructions have been issued in continuation of the office memorandum dated March 17.

“Heads of Department [HoDs] may ensure that 50% of Group B and C employees are required to attend office every day, and the remaining 50 per cent staff should be instructed to work from home. All HoDs are advised to draft a weekly roster of duty for Group B and C staff and ask them to attend office on alternate weeks,” said the order.

While deciding the roster for the first week, the HoDs have been told to include officials who are residing in close proximity to their office or use their own transport to travel to the offices. The working hours for all those who attend office on a particular day has to be staggered.

“It is suggested that three groups of employees may be formed and asked to attend office as per the following timings:- (a) 9 a.m. 5.30 p.m., (b) 9.30 a.m. to 6 p.m., (c) 10 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. The officials who are working from home on a particular day as per the roster drawn up should be available on telephone and electronic means of communication at all times. They should attend office, if called for any exigency of work,” said the memorandum.

Similar instructions should be issued to the attached/subordinate offices, autonomous and statutory bodies. The Department of Financial Services and the Department of Public Enterprises also have to issue the orders regarding financial institutions and public sector undertakings.

“These instructions shall not apply to the offices and employees engaged in essential/emergency services and those directly engaged in taking measures to control spread of Covid-19,” said the order.

65,2020/03/19,Nirbhaya case: SC declines to entertain Mukesh’s plea claiming he wasn’t in Delhi at time of crime,"The Bench said it does not find any merit in the plea and hence it cannot be entertained.

The Supreme Court Thursday refused to entertain the plea of Mukesh Singh, one of the four death-row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, challenging the Delhi High Court order which rejected his claim that he was not in the city when at the time of crime on December 16, 2012.

A Bench of Justices R. Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan and A.S. Bopanna said the convict has exhausted all his remedies and no fresh evidence can be entertained at this level.

The Bench said it does not find any merit in the plea and hence it cannot be entertained.

“The petitioner has raised points on the merits of the trial, that is there was no consideration of the evidence about medical status of accused. Has raised doubts about arrest of the accused from Karoli,” the bench said in its order.

It said the convict was given every opportunity to raise his points and he was duly heard.

“After the petitioner was afforded all opportunities and appeal process, the criminal appeal filed before this court was heard at length.

“All points raised by the accused were considered and appeal dismissed. Review petition, considered and dismissed. Therefore, instant petition is dismissed,” the bench said.

The petition sought recording of calls, documents and reports by an investigating agency like CBI and to declare that the convict has legal and constitutional rights to approach any court at any time even in the last minute of hanging.

It also sought a declaration that concealment of documents by the state in trial is a serious fraud which vitiates a trial being unfair.

Mukesh in his petition said that even after his execution, facts in the case must be examined judicially so in the future no “innocent be victim of failure of justice under media pressure“.

“Petitioner is not looking for any adjournment of execution of death warrant and seeking justice that even after his death truth will survive and justice is done and seen by the world that he was innocent,” the plea said.

The High Court had on Wednesday said there were no grounds to interfere in the detailed and reasoned order of the trial court.

On Tuesday, the trial court dismissed Mukesh Singh’s plea and asked the Bar Council of India to appropriately sensitise his counsel.

The ministry has also decided to ask all state governments to encourage NCC certificate holders in the direct entry examination for their respective police forces.

The decision was taken by Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

In order to achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision to increase participation of youth in National Cadet Corps (NCC), the home minister has taken an unprecedented decision to give NCC certificate holders bonus marks in direct entry examinations for the CAPFs, as prevalent in armed forces examinations, a home ministry statement said.

While the NCC ‘C’ certificate holders will get an additional 5 per cent of the total number, the bonus marks for ‘B’ and ‘A’ certificate holders will be 3 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.

This scheme of awarding bonus marks to NCC ‘A’ certificate holders in CAPF recruitment will be applicable in the upcoming direct recruitment examination for the posts of sub-inspector and constable (general duty).

The government of India will also urge all state governments to make similar provisions in the direct recruitment examination for their respective police forces so as to encourage NCC certificate holders to join them, the statement said.

This decision will not only inspire youth to join NCC but also ensure the availability of trained and disciplined young minds to the CAPFs, it said.

The NCC is a tri-service organisation comprising of the Army, Naval and Air wings. The motto of the organisation is ‘Unity and Discipline’, following which it prepares youth as disciplined and patriotic citizens.

The NCC was formed under the National Cadet Corps Act, 1948. The home ministry has taken several steps to encourage the youth to join NCC and work devotedly for the betterment of the country. The cadets are given basic military and weapons training by serving officers of the armed forces.

Their proficiency and dexterity are periodically tested, only after which they are awarded the certificates.

The ‘A’ certificate is awarded on passing the first level and ‘B’ certificate on passing the second level.

Only those cadets who have ‘B’ certificate are eligible to get the ‘C’ certificate, the highest certification given to NCC cadets after passing tough training and examinations.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ncc-certificate-holders-to-get-preference-in-paramilitary-forces/article31107639.ece

Having exhausted all available legal remedies, including mercy petitions before the President, three of the convicts have met their respective families for the last time. The family of one of them did not come to visit him.

Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana rejected the pleas of Akshay Kumar, Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma seeking a stay on their execution on the ground that the second mercy plea of one of them was still pending.

Advocate AP Singh, representing the convicts, argued that Akshay’s wife had filed for a divorce in a Bihar court, which was pending. Responding to this, the special public prosecutor said the petition did not fall under the purview of legal remedy in the present case.

On March 5, a trial court issued fresh death warrants for March 20 at 5.30 am for Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan (25), Vinay (26) and Akshay (31).

This comes seven years after the incident in which the four death row convicts; Ram Singh, the fifth accused who has died; and a minor gang-raped a paramedic student and left her fighting for her life for 13 days before she died of her injuries.

The March 20 date has come after a series of postponements. The first death warrants were issued by a trial court on January 7 for execution on January 22 but it was postponed by the court to February 1 and then further postponed to March 3.

The night before the hanging, Tihar Jail authorities said hangman Pawan and Jail Superintendent took stock of the preparation and found everything in order.

The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected the curative petition filed by Pawan Gupta, one of the four death-row convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case, against the dismissal of his juvenility claim.

A six-judge bench headed by Justice N.V. Ramana dismissed the plea, saying “no case is made out.”

“The application for oral hearing is rejected. We have gone through the curative petition and the relevant documents. In our opinion, no case is made out... Hence, the curative petition is dismissed,” said the Bench also comprising Justices Arun Mishra, RF Nariman, R Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan and AS Bopanna.

On March 5, a trial court issued fresh black warrants for the execution of all the four convicts in the case — Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay (26) and Akshay (31) - in Tihar Jail at 5.30 am on March 20.

76,2020/03/19,"As former CJI Ranjan Gogoi takes oath as Rajya Sabha member, Opposition walks out","Congress says his appointment has disgraced the Indian judiciary

Former Chief Justice of India (CJI) Justice Ranjan Gogoi on Thursday took oath as a Rajya Sabha member amidst protests and walkout by Opposition parties. The Congress said his appointment had disgraced the Indian judiciary.

The ruckus began as soon as Chairman Venkaiah Naidu called out Justice Gogoi's name. Opposition parties, including the Congress, Left parties, DMK and the MDMK, started raising slogans- “Shame on You” and many screamed “Deal”. Mr Naidu ordered that the sloganeering would not go on record. He attempted to bring order to the House but without avail. The Opposition parties staged a walkout even as Justice Gogoi was taking oath.

“We know the constitutional position; we know the precedents; we know the powers of the President of India. We should not do anything like this in the House. Whatever views you have, you can express them outside; you are at liberty,” Mr. Naidu said.

Justice Gogoi (65), who retired in November last, took oath in English.

Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad rose to defend his government's decision to nominate Justice Gogoi citing the tradition of choosing eminent persons from diverse fields, including former Chief Justices by Congress governments in the past.

“Hon'ble member Ranjan Gogoi, who has taken oath today will surely contribute his best as a nominated member. It was grossly unfair on their part to do like that,” Mr. Prasad told the Opposition.

Minutes later, Congress leaders Anand Sharma and P. Chidambaram addressed a press conference outside the House. Mr Sharma said Justice Gogoi's appointment raised bona fide questions about quid pro quo.

Mr. Sharma said, “It has lowered the very dignity of the office that he had or rather disgraced judiciary. The constitutional scheme of things is very clear that the distancing between the Executive, Parliament and the judiciary.”

Rangnath Mishra appointment

He said that examples like Rangnath Mishra, the 21st Chief Justice of India who gave a clean chit to the Congress in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, serving as a Rajya Sabha member of the Congress between 1998 and 2004 could not be compared to Justice Gogoi's appointment because there was a time lag between his appointment to the House and retirement. In the case of Justice Gogoi, the difference between his retirement and entry to the Rajya Sabha was just four months, he noted.

The Congress pointed out that Justice Gogoi himself had said that post retirement appointment or accepting any position will be a scar on the independence of the judiciary.

During Justice Gogoi's 13-month tenure, the Supreme Court delivered landmark judgements in the Ayodhya case, on the decriminalisation of homosexuality, the entry of women into Kerala's Sabarimala temple and the Rafale jet deal along with Assam's National Register of Citizens (NRC).",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/yumbsm/article31106320.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19GOGOI-RS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/former-cji-ranjan-gogoi-takes-oath-as-rajya-sabha-member/article31106321.ece

81,2020/03/19,Gujarat RS poll: Chhotubhai Vasava to be kingmaker again in a close fight,"The votes tribal leader and senior legislator and his son Mahesh Vasava

With the Congress deciding to fight it out in the Rajya Sabha polls by retaining both its candidates in the fray, Gujarat’s tribal leader and senior legislator Chhotubhai Vasava and his legislator son Mahesh Vasava have emerged as the kingmakers in yet another nail-biting Rajya Sabha battle in the State.

There are five candidates in the contest for the four seats in the Rajya Sabha polls scheduled to be held on March 26: the BJP has fielded three candidates while two are from the Opposition Congress, which suffered a setback with five of its legislators resigning amidst allegations of bribery.

Read: Congress suffers Rajya Sabha setback in Gujarat as four MLAs resign

As of now, the Congress has 68 legislators while one independent Jignesh Mevani is expected to vote for the party, taking the likely tally to 69. However, to ensure victory of both its candidates, Shaktisinh Gohil and Bharatsinh Solanki, the Congress will need two more votes, which could only come from two legislators of Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) of Mr. Chhotubhai Vasava.

The BTP has two legislators: Mr. Chhotubhai Vasava and Mr. Mahesh Vasava.

‘Bribery and horse-trading’

“We have decided to fight it out instead of surrendering to the BJP’s naked politics of bribery and horse-trading. And we will manage to ensure victory of both our candidates,” said Gujarat Congress president Amit Chavda.

Earlier, after the five legislators resigned from the Assembly in a blow to the party ahead of the election, there was a possibility that the Opposition party would withdraw one candidate from the race.

However, after deliberations with party lawmakers camping in Rajasthan and senior leaders, party observers B.K. Hariprasad and Rajni Patil apprised the party high command about the situation and eventually it was decided to stay in the race with both candidates as it was felt that there was a window of opportunity to pursue the father-son duo and sail through.

The Congress also tried in vain to get lone NCP MLA Kandhal Jadeja, who on Tuesday told mediapersons in the State capital that he would vote for the BJP candidate even if a whip asked him to vote for the Congress.

In 2017 also, when party stalwart Ahmed Patel was fighting the nail-biting Rajya Sabha contest when more than 15 legislators had split from the party, it was Mr. Chhotubhai Vasava’s vote, which had helped Mr. Patel snatch a victory.

Recently, when Congress lawmakers resigned from the Assembly, Mr. Chhotubhai Vasava on his social media posts had slammed the Congress lawmakers for allegedly taking ₹50 crore to sell out their seats to the ruling BJP.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/6xvs13/article23364917.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Amit-Chavda,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gujarat-rs-poll-chhotubhai-vasava-to-be-kingmaker-again-in-a-close-fight/article31105325.ece

Job losses

The issue of job losses owing to the lock down due to COVID-19 outbreak was also flagged. The recent announcement by GoAir of making its employees go on leave without pay was also raised during the meeting. More than 70% of the tourism industry is hit, 95% of small and medium industries are teetering towards shutdown. “This will lead to mass unemployment, with 2.5 crore direct employees and 2 crore indirect employees going jobless.

86,2020/03/19,Former CJI Ranjan Gogoi’s Rajya Sabha nomination triggers plea in Supreme Court,"The petition filed by academic Madhu Purnima Kishwar contended that former judges should be insulated from “post-retirement allurements” like the Lokpal

A petition filed in the Supreme Court on Wednesday conveyed the “widespread disquiet and unease” triggered by the nomination of the former chief justice of India Ranjan Gogoi to the Rajya Sabha and sought the court’s intervention for extending the post-retirement restrictions imposed on the office of the Lokpal to former judges as well.

The petition filed by academic Madhu Purnima Kishwar contended that former judges should be insulated from “post-retirement allurements” like the Lokpal, as the country otherwise risked having public faith in an independent judiciary dry up.

Section 8 of the Lokpal Act mandates that a retired chairperson or member of the Lokpal, an anti-corruption ombudsman, would be ineligible for reappointment, not hold diplomatic posts or be made an administrator of a Union Territory, and observe a five-year moratorium from contesting elections.

The petitioner also noted how unlike in the case of the Comptroller and Auditor-General and Chairman and Members of the Union and State Public Service Commissions, the framers of the Constitution did not make any explicit provisions restricting the post retirement acceptance of public offices by the judges of the Supreme Court and high courts as “they (former judges) were expected to conduct themselves in such a manner even after their retirement so as not to create an adverse impression about the independence of judiciary”.

Ms. Kishwar said Justice Gogoi’s acceptance of the nomination was “befuddling” as he had “himself pronounced that there is a valid strong viewpoint that post-retirement appointment is itself a scar on judicial independence of the judiciary”. She also sought to remind the court that Justice Gogoi was one of the four apex court judges who had held the January 12, 2018, press conference demanding that the independence of judiciary from the executive be safeguarded.

Meanwhile, senior advocate Manan Kumar Mishra, chairperson of the Bar Council of India, said the former CJI’s nomination was a “novel initiative” by the President. It would be an “ideal opportunity to portray the first hand views of the judiciary before the lawmakers and vice-versa,” he opined.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/r57rgt/article31103294.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MADHUPURNIMAKISHWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/former-cji-ranjan-gogois-rajya-sabha-nomination-triggers-plea-in-supreme-court/article31103295.ece

Particularly, children and lactating and nursing mothers in rural as well as tribal areas are prone to such malnourishment.

90,2020/03/19,Rumours trigger panic buying,"Lockdown talk makes people throng provision stores

Departmental stores and malls saw a surge in footfalls on Thursday. Consumers went on a buying spree purchasing what all they could.

It turned out to be panic buying with rumours on social media that the government will announce a nationwide lockdown in view of the COVID-19 threat. Many parents also received Whatsapp messages and calls from their children studying or working abroad on the situation in the respective countries, where they are staying.

They told them how they had purchased provisions to meet their needs for the next few months in view of the impending crisis. Some advised their parents to stock essentials in view of the virus spreading its tentacles across the globe. A family living at a residential colony, beside Marripalem Highway Road, bought provisions to suffice their needs for the next six months.

A popular department store, opposite the Seethammadhara Rythu Bazaar, was teeming with buyers on Thursday evening. The consumers were seen buying rice bags, toothpastes and other essential commodities, obviously to meet their needs for a couple of months.

M.N. Rao, a resident of Seethammadhara, was seen asking whether the store would be open on Friday. When asked the reason for panic buying, he quipped back: “Have you not seen on TV that malls and cinema theatres would be closed”?

Rush peaks

The rush was seen at big department stores at Resavanipalem, Siripuram, Marripalem, Muralinagar and other areas.

“Normally, we see this kind of rush during natural calamities. During normal times, we see a rush of buyers during the first week of the month. We have been witnessing rush for the past three, four days but today (Thursday), panic buying has peaked,” says the proprietor of Kashyap G. Narasimha Raju.

“The stock available with us is sufficient to meet the needs of consumers for a week. We have already placed for a lorry load of groceries from Vijayawada. The suppliers say they have sufficient stock and there is no immediate cause for alarm,” he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/aw4ve8/article31111680.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20ONGRUSH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/rumours-trigger-panic-buying/article31111681.ece

With just two weeks to go for the Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission (APPSC) mains, candidates are again facing uncertainty as the High Court is yet to give clearance for holding the examinations.

Jagan Mohan Reddy from his Chief Ministerial post due to the Supreme Court ruling in the matter related to postponement of local body elections. “Even the apex court sided with the Election Commissioner, and the CM must take responsibility for the matter,” he added.

Addressing reporters here on Wednesday, Mr. Venkateswarlu claimed that the mistakes of the CM are piling up. He said Mr. Jagan is inexperienced and hence, he is faltering at every step.

Deploring the CM for his comments on COVID-19, he said: “While on one hand, the entire world is worried about the intensity of the disease, on the other, the CM is talking about tackling the disease with paracetamol and bleaching powder. We don’t even know what the government is doing to combat the disease,” he said.

Condemning CM’s statements on Election Commissioner (EC), Mr. Venkateswarlu said: “The EC took the decision to postpone the local body elections for six months keeping in view the threat posed by coronavirus. Mr. Jagan lacks awareness on the matter, and has criticised the EC only as part of his attack on former chief minister N.

99,2020/03/19,Jagan calls for liberal loans to tenant farmers,"‘Banks should also come to the aid of MSMEs’

Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has asked bankers to step up lending to the tenant farmers in the State.

“The extent of loans sanctioned to the tenant farmers till date is not encouraging,” Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said while addressing the 210th State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC) meeting on Wednesday.

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said the details of crops being cultivated by the tenant farmers would be available on e-panta. The tenant farmer and landowner would sign agreements in the presence of revenue assistants and submit the same to the banks. “The bankers are requested to sanction loans liberally,” he said.

Banks should come to the aid of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) as well, he said.

“Their accounts may be revitalised under the YSR Navodaya scheme. Effectively use the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana. The State government has plans to launch a scheme for micro enterprises in June. The government plans to provide an interest-free loan of ₹10,000 and identity card to the beneficiaries. The scheme is aimed at providing loans to the petty traders. We have some dreams and aspirations. To realise the same, we need your cooperation,” the Chief Minister said.

There was no uniform rate of interest across the State. Banks were charging different rates for six districts under Category-1 and the other seven districts. Also, the interest rates were abnormally high and hovering around 12.5% to 13.5%.

“It has become tough for us to convince couples in family dispute cases and reunite them. What is worrying is petty issues are leading to separation of young couples which are showing an impact on society as well,” said Andhra Pradesh Women’s Commission Chairperson Vasireddy Padma.

The commission, in association with universities and college managements, women protection cells, anti-trafficking cells, DWCRA and Mahila Mitra groups, Mahila police, Disha, NGOs and other stakeholders, was conducting awareness programmes on women rights, laws and Acts.

“On many occasions, the commission is getting cases only after the issue was addressed or taken to court or pending with the police. We are trying to settle family disputes and marital issues amicably and do justice to all concerned. My request to the couples is not to stand on prestige, lead a respectable life, share love and affection with their children and give good education for them,” Ms. Padma said.

Despite framing tough laws, complaints of domestic violence, sexual harassment, harassment at workplace and call money are flooding the commission.

“The commission has received as many as 500 petitions in the last six months, of which 102 relate to domestic violence (DV),” the Chairperson said.

Other cases we received were live-in relationship, suspicious deaths, missing, outraging of modesty, abandonment, threatening and child marriages issues, said Commission Director R. Suez.

101,2020/03/19,The case of the missing green cover,"With summer nearing, people in Guntur worry over the increasing dry patches

It’s early summer and the day temperatures are soaring. Year after year, the rising mercury levels have affected normal life in cities along the coastline.

Guntur, surrounded by dry and rugged hills on one side, and the Bay of Bengal on the other, usually experiences record high temperatures and heat waves during summer. The season’s highest temperature is recorded at Rentachinatala, near Macherla in the Palnadu region, where mercury levels touch 50 degrees Celsius.

It has become normal for the city to witness changes in weather with above normal temperatures, and the heat waves especially during summer and has turned into the urban heat island.

While Guntur is known for its torrid summers, what has been worrying is the alarming pace at which the green cover is fast depleting within the town. The rapid construction activity means that more and more trees are being felled. As roads are getting widened and new localities spring up outside the town, more dry patches are beginning to emerge.

Groundwater

The rapid depletion of green cover also means that the groundwater levels are being depleting as there is no way that the rainwater can seep into the earth’s surface. The groundwater levels have plummeted to a depth of 40 Below Ground Level (BGL) at Chandramouli Nagar during May 2018 and in May 2019, the BGL at Naidupet was 8.8 metres.

The Guntur Municipal Corporation has taken up tree plantation activity along the roads, improved residential parks, but the effort has to be complemented by civic society and it is heartening to see some youngsters chipping in.

Green warriors

A NIT Rourekala Engineering graduate NSV Sarath Chandra is leading a group of enthusiastic youngsters to take up tree plantation. A team of about 50 young men are part of a team which identify ideal locations, dig up pits, transport the trees in their own vehicles and plant them. They prefer public places where trees can grow well without any hindrances. The team members also urge the families and the and shopkeepers nearby to water them regularly.

There has been a good response to the drive and the team claims that they have planted 500 trees already. They have planted along Donka Road, Vidyanagar, Outer Ring Road, Mangalagiri Road, Ashok Nagar, Pandaripuram, Balaji Nagar and few locations in Lakshmipuram.

“We need to promote green cover along the road margins, and the civic body should mark specialised sites for planting trees. The civic bodies should also prefer planting trees which can grow big and offer shade rather decorative trees,” said Mr. Sarath Chandra.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/the-case-of-the-missing-green-cover/article31103326.ece

According to him, 22A is a major issue and many people have been suffering due to the lack of survey of sub-division of lands. “Once the survey is done and sub-division numbers are given, many cases will be de-notified,” he said.

Mr. Vijay Kumar also said that after the interim report was submitted in January to the State Government, 30 more cases pertaining to NOC (no-objection certificate) and 20 cases pertaining to allotment of government land were examined and the final report will be given shortly.

A door-to-door health survey being conducted by the 400-odd teams comprising civic staff and health department of the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) is in full swing and officials say that 90% of the survey is complete.

The survey has been taken up to check the health conditions of the public in the wake of the coronavirus scare, here in GVMC limits. The teams are focussing on finding out if any denizens have come from abroad in the last couple of weeks and have not undergone screening.

Officials said that given a target to conduct survey in about 4.5 lakh houses, the teams have already finished nearly 90% of the survey and are yet to visit a few more wards in the next couple of days.

“The team members include ward volunteers, staff from health department, ASHA worker or ANM. They inquire about the health condition of the family and check whether any one is suffering from cold, cough and fever. If they find any person with symptoms of COVID-19, they would make a note in online in the tab given to them. This would alert the GVMC and health department to take precautionary measures,” said Chief Medical Officer (Health), GVMC, K.S.L.G Sastry.

According to Mr Sastry, the teams have been specifically checking if any person who has returned from a foreign trip is showing any symptoms. He said that those exhibiting after noticing the symptoms, the medical teams are shifting them to isolation.

“The main intention of the survey to check public health and also create awareness over the precautionary measures to be taken. The teams have been demonstrating the correct procedure to clean one’s hands and other measures to be taken across all households,” he said.

As a precautionary measure, the GVMC has appealed public to refrain from going to gyms, swimming pools, theatres and other public places as far as possible to prevent the likelihoodof an outbreak.

The VPT has achieved highest growth rate of 12% compared to the previous year among all the major ports. The port is expected to cross 72 million tonne by March 31. The all-India growth of major ports during the current fiscal is 1.4%.

“Innovative marketing efforts such as signing agreements for preferential handling with SAIL and other PSUs, introducing end-to-end solutions and electronic cargo tracking system, and offering discount in vessel, cargo and storage-related charges have made the difference,” VPT Deputy Chairman P.L. Haranadh told The Hindu.

The port’s highest cargo of 68 million tonne was handled in 2011 when Gangavaram port was in the initial stage.

“Ours is the highest growing port in India and we have already achieved an unassailable lead over JNPT,” he said.

There is an impressive growth in handling steam and thermal coal, iron ore and containers. Iron ore handling has gone up by 4.2 million tonne, primarily because Jindal Steel is using the port’s facilities fully and attracting cargo from Paradip and Dhamra. Essar terminal productivity is very high due to handling of 75,000 to 80,000 tonne iron ore per day.

After expansion, Essar would handle 13 million tonne of iron ore this year and 16 million tonne next year, Mr. Haranadh said. Last year, it had received 10 million tonne. The port received 1.6 million tonne of coal additionally due to an MoU with the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board and agreements with SAIL and other PSUs.

Container growth

Container traffic from Visakhapatnam has gone up by 13% by February 29. The Visakha Container Terminal Private Ltd, a BOT operator, will handle 0.5 million twenty foot equivalent units (TEUs) , its full capacity, after a gap of 17 years.

Mr. Haranadh said that after declaration of Visakhapatnam as the second gateway port in 2017, the port was able to handle 65 to 70% of Nepalese cargo.

Incidentally, Visakhapatnam is about 1,600 km and Kolkata 700 km from Nepal. Still, due to handling of higher capacity container liners due to 16 metres draft, better dwell time and faster handling, the traders of Nepal prefer Visakhapatnam to Kolkata.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bhfuv5/article31103021.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19-VJ-VSPRECORDCARGO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vpt-handles-all-time-high-cargo-of-70-million-tonnes/article31103022.ece

109,2020/03/19,COVID-19: Doctor warns against complacency,"Virus found in blood samples too of late, says K. Surya Rao

Senior physician Kutikuppala Surya Rao on Wednesday urged people not to be complacent about the threat posed by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

Dr. Surya Rao was speaking at a seminar organised at Mrs. A.V.N. College titled ‘Break the chain of coronavirus’. Dr. Rao spoke on preventive strategies and mentioned how Italy recorded many fatalities due to neglecting the virus at the initial stage.

“Recognising the magnitude of the challenge, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The Government of India also declared it a national disaster soon after,” Dr. Surya Rao said.

According to him, researchers have detected coronavirus viral RNA and live virus in specimens other than nose-throat swabs and sputum samples, lung wash (bronchoalveolar lavage), lung biopsy, nasal, sputum and blood samples.

The doctor said that latest research results indicated indirect transmission of the pandemic novel coronavirus had been via inanimate objects or aerosolisation. Using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), investigators detected COVID-19 RNA in lung wash (93%), sputum (72%), nasal swabs (63%), lung biopsy (46%), throat swabs (32%) and faeces (29%). He said in virus was also found in blood and urine samples of late.

110,2020/03/19,SEC should have gone for early polls instead: Peddireddi,"Minister accuses State Election Commissioner of bias

Minister for Panchayat Raj and Rural Development Peddireddi Ramachandra Reddy has said the State Election Commissioner (SEC) should not have put the local body elections on hold and, instead hastened the process so as to save it from the impact of COVID-19.

Addressing the media at his residence here on Wednesday, he said the State government was equally concerned over the spread of the dreaded virus and would be too keen on initiating measures to contain it.

“We want the elections to be conducted on time so as to have elected bodies in place to guide the official machinery in the nook and corner of the State”, he said. The Minister expressed scepticism that the indiscriminate spread of the virus might become too unwieldy for the government to handle in the next few weeks, and as such, holding the election at that time would be an ill-advised move.

Mr. Reddy not only accused State Election Commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh of bias, but also the district election observer Siddharth Jain of being partisan towards the Telugu Desam Party, recalling incidents from the past.

Charge against Naidu

Reacting seriously to the SEC’s report, Mr. Reddy called it a cleverly-executed ploy by TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu, with support from what he mocked at as the party’s ‘puppet media’.

“Whenever he wants to paint somebody black or project something bad, Mr. Naidu is known to build a case through the newspapers and channels that have become his party organs. He will then submit a report to the SEC based on these skewed ‘media reports’. It is unfortunate that the SEC has also acted upon such baseless reports”, Mr. Reddy said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sec-should-have-gone-for-early-polls-instead-peddireddi/article31102979.ece

112,2020/03/19,"Give CRPF cover to SEC, Kanna urges Amit Shah","‘Police biased; threat of physical attack real’

BJP State president Kanna Lakshminarayana requested Union Home Minister Amit Shah to provide security to State Election Commissioner (SEC) N. Ramesh Kumar with the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) , alleging that the State police were acting at the behest of the ruling party and its cadres posed a threat to the SEC.

In a letter to Mr. Shah on Wednesday, Mr. Lakshminarayana said it was disheartening to take the atrocities, violations and abuse of government machinery during the local body elections (which were postponed by six weeks) to the Union Minister’s notice.

He observed that the violence was unprecedented and never in the past had the police personnel been involved in the election process asagents of the ruling party.

The unanimous declaration of around 25% of the MPTC and ZPTC seats itself speaks about the undemocratic way in which the elections were sought to be conducted, he said.

The State BJP chief said the problem of COVID-19 prompted the SEC to postpone the elections to local bodies as the virus was spreading due to the gathering of a large number of people.

‘Derogatory remarks’

Unfortunately, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, MPs, MLAs, MLCs and others, including Assembly Speaker Thammineni Seetharam, made derogatory comments on Mr. Ramesh Kumar, who faced the risk of physical attacks.

A hoax message claiming to have been sent by the Municipal Commissioner went viral in the city on Wednesday night, sparking panic among residents.

The message warned residents to stay indoors from 10 p.m. on Wednesday to 5 a.m. on Thursday, claiming that the civic body would be spraying some medicine in the air to eliminate the COVID-19 virus. The poorly worded message bore all the hallmarks of a hoax message.

However, as the message began circulating on WhatsApp, anxious residents began calling up GVMC officials and their friends in the media to ascertain whether the message was genuine. GVMC officials clarified that the message was a hoax and advised residents not to pay heed to such forwarded messages.

VMRDA Commissioner P. Koteswara Rao confirmed that the message was fake and said he would bring it to the notice of the Commissioner of Police and urge him to take action against those who created the hoax message.

Experts said that it was lamentable that netizens are so easily taken in by such hoax messages. “People make the mistake of thinking that whatever they read on WhatsApp as true. Netizens should use their common sense to identify a hoax message. In this case, how can spraying a disinfectant in the air eliminate the COVID-19 virus?

The anxiety of parents of children and other passengers, who were stranded at Kuala Lumpur, turned into joy as the Kuala Lumpur – Visakhapatnam flight landed at the airport here on Wednesday evening. All 185 passengers were cleared at the airport screening facility and sent back to their houses and advised self-quarantine.

District Collector V. Vinay Chand, who was supervising the operation, said: “We were fully prepared to handle any suspected cases. Luckily, all the passengers came under Category C and were sent home.”

The two-hour wait outside the airport seemed endless for the parents. Some of the women broke down as they were not sure whether the children would be sent home or quarantined at hospitals. The sight of ambulances and special buses added to their apprehensions.

The students were studying medicine in the Philippines. Their college had declared a shutdown in view of the COVID-19 threat and had asked foreign students to return to their respective countries. The students reached Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday, but they were told that flights were cancelled.

KM Sundaram of Kakinada whose son Bhavani Shankar, who is in the 1st year medicine, said: “My son told that the threat of COVID-19 was comparatively less in the Philippines but the cancellation of flights was causing anxiety among students.

Ms. Prasanna Lakshmi of Kakinada was seen weeping as the process of testing took a long time. Anxiety was writ large on the face of Y. Mallibabu of Kovvur in West Godavari district as he awaited the arrival of his daughter Satyakaveswari.

“We had no sleep for the past three days as news of the growing COVID-19 threat continued to pour in from around the world. My daughter Bhavana and my sister’s daughter Sravanthi are both pursuing medicine,” said Sri Phani of Kakinada.

The parents thanked the Jagan Mohan Reddy government and the government of India for coordinating with the authorities in Philippines and arranged the special flight to bring back the stranded students from AP. They also thanked Rajya Sabha member V. Vijaya Sai Reddy for taking up the issue with the Centre from time to time.

128,2020/03/19,State to ‘geofence’ people in home quarantine,"In the wake of several complaints regarding home quarantined persons moving around without following restrictions, thereby increasing the risk of spreading COVID-19 infection, the State government is all set to start “geofencing” such patients.

Announcing this at a press conference here on Thursday, Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said apart from this, a beat police will also make visits to the houses of the quarantined persons.

Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education), said geofencing is a location-based service in which an app or other software uses GPS, RFID, Wi-Fi or cellular data to trigger a pre-programmed action when a mobile device or RFID tag enters or exits a virtual boundary set up around a geographical location, known as a geofence. “It is similar to mobile tracking. This is essential now to ensure that the quarantined persons, who do not follow restrictions, are disciplined,” he said.

While home quarantine stamping of all international passengers began on Thursday, the Union government is also stopping arrival of international flights at Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru and Mangaluru International Airport from March 22, he said.

The Cabinet sub-committee and special task force set up to review the COVID-19 situation in the State met on Thursday and discussed the importance of social distancing at length. “Strict directions will be issued to all religious institutions and other authorities concerned to ensure there are no marriages, mass gatherings, jathres, santes and even prayer congregations held in their jurisdiction. Despite directions by the Chief Minister, it is unfortunate that mass gathering and marriages where people are assembling in large numbers are going on, the Minister said.

Approval sought

Responding to the need for more testing centres in the State, the government has sought Indian Council of Medical Research’s permission to start testing in private laboratories.

129,2020/03/19,Woman held for stealing bitcoins from ex- employer,"She made transactions worth ₹3.6 cr.

The cyber crime officials on Thursday arrested a woman who had allegedly stolen 63.54 bitcoins from the company she was working for, and made transactions worth ₹3.6 crore.

According to the police, the accused, identified as Aarushi, had stolen the 24-word passphrase before quitting the job and later traded the cryptocurrency. The passphrase is the key to authenticate bitcoin transactions online.

She worked at a company that dealt with cryptocurrency exchange. “Sixty-four of the 100 bitcoins possessed by the company were stolen,” said the police.

During the course of investigation, it was found that the complainant used to hold hardware wallets in which bitcoins were stored and a 24-word passphrase was written on a piece of paper and stored securely at their house/office banks for which only the complainant and partners had access to.

The crime came to light on March 13, when a company member realised that 64 bitcoins were missing. On further inspection, he realised they had been stolen in two batches: 33.54 bitcoins on January 11 and the remaining on March 11. It was further found that an unknown accused had hacked into their systems and had secured the passphrase.

The police realised that the culprit was familiar with the block-chain technology cryptocurrency transactions and was closely associated with BitCipher company. They suspected a former employee and made a list of suspects, including Aarushi, who on questioning allegedly confessed to the crime.

A hardware wallet is a special type of bitcoin wallet which stores the user’s private keys in a secure hardware device. The bitcoins were returned to the company’s account.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/woman-held-for-stealing-bitcoins-from-ex-employer/article31111768.ece
130,2020/03/19,"Amid Oppn. walkout, Assembly nod for land reforms amendment Bill","It aims to amend Section 109 of the 1961 Act pertaining to purchase of farm land

Amid a walkout by the Opposition Congress and JD(S), the Legislative Assembly on Thursday passed the Karnataka Land Reforms (Amendment) Bill, 2020.

The Bill aims to amend Section 109 of the 1961 Act pertaining to the purchase of agricultural land from farmers by investors who want to set up industries, educational institutions or other units. It also grants permission for the sale of lands exempted under Section 109 after utilising them for seven years for the purpose permitted.

Revenue Minister R. Ashok and Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J.C. Madhuswamy defended the Bill by saying that it was not against the spirit of land reforms. They argued that any investor who purchases land can resell it after seven years only for the purpose it was purchased for originally. For instance, if an industrialist purchases land from a farmer, it can be resold after seven years only for establishing an industrial unit.

Congress members R.V. Deshpande, K.R. Ramesh Kumar, Dinesh Gundu Rao, Amaregouda Bayyapur, Ramalinga Reddy, and Bandeppa Kashempur, H.D. Revanna (JD-S) opposed the Bill and termed it “anti-farmer” and that it promotes only real estate. Mr. Ramesh Kumar said it would enable “fake” industrialists to buy lands from farmers. Countering this, Mr. Madhuswamy said the Siddaramaiah government in 2014 had permitted change of land use by amending Section 109.

Many investors purchase lands at cheap rates to start industries and later convert the plot into real-estate business, Opposition members claimed. Not convinced by the replies given by the Ministers, the Opposition Congress and JD(S) staged a walked out from the House opposing the Bill.

The Bill provides for deemed exemption to purchase land for industrial purpose to the extent approved by the State High Level Clearance Committee (SHLCC) or the State Single Window Clearance Committee under the Karnataka Industrial (Facilitation) Act, 2002.

The Bill replaced the Ordinance promulgated on November 20, 2019. After SHLCC, the CM under his chairmanship clears investment projects. In case the land acquisition is delayed after the SHLCC’s approval, then the process for land acquisition is considered “deemed approval”.

The Bill was tabled in the background of the government’s decision to hold a Global Investors’ Meet in Bengaluru in November.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/5cfxd7/article31111758.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BGFARMLANDBILL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/amid-oppn-walkout-assembly-nod-for-land-reforms-amendment-bill/article31111759.ece

135,2020/03/19,Poultry farmers in Mysuru reeling under twin blows,"COVID-19, bird flu send prices plummeting; rumours another headache

The recent confirmation of bird flu cases in Mysuru has dealt a further blow to the poultry industry,which was already reeling under the impact of the COVID-19 scare.

While chicken stalls in Mysuru remained closed for the third day on Thursday after bird flu cases were reported from Kumbarkoppal, the price of eggs available at retail stores had plummeted to ₹3.20 per egg.

Poultry farmers are staring at bleak future, said Satish Babu, the Mysuru coordinator of National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC). Many are even considering the option of giving up poultry farming for good, he said.

The industry had already received a huge a blow from the false news and rumours spread on social media platforms linking consumption of chicken to COVID-19.

Though the government authorities including officials from the Department of Animal Husbandry clarified that there was no connection between chicken consumption and the virus, the price of chicken fell dramatically from ₹160 per kg to ₹80 to 90 a kg. The poultry farmers were unable to recover the cost they had incurred on rearing the broilers and were forced to sell them at an abysmal price.

When the bird flu cases were confirmed, the authorities not only culled more than 5,000 birds on Tuesday and Wednesday, but also closed all shops selling poultry products in a radius of 10 kms from Kumbarakoppal, which was the epicenter of the bird flu.

Though Mr. Babu is hopeful that the stalls will be permitted to be reopened after two days, sources in the Animal Husbandry Department were of the opinion that permission to open the stalls will be given only after the results of random samples collected from the region show negative results.

The poultry industry representatives met Deputy Commissioner Abhiram G. Sankar in Mysuru on Wednesday and sought permission for early reopening of the stalls.

While the poultry farmers claimed they are finding no takers for their broilers even if they wished to give them free, the stock of eggs was only increasing.

“There is a stock of 30 to 40 lakh eggs in Mysuru alone. In addition to meeting the demand for eggs in Mysuru, the poultry farmers used to supply about 12 lakh eggs per day to different parts of Kerala. But, we are neither able to sell eggs in Mysuru nor sell them in Kerala”, Mr. Babu bemoaned.

“This is the worst situation poultry industry had ever faced”, he regretted before adding that the 50 poultry farms in Mysuru were incurring a collective loss of more than ₹ 1.25 crore per day from the last one month.

Mr. Babu said they saw a silver lining among the dark clouds when Kerala State Animal Husbandry Department officials responded positively to their request to lift the ban on sale of eggs in Mallapuram, Kozhikode and Wayanad following bird flu cases. “They have assured appropriate action at the earliest to allow eggs from Mysuru with a certificate from authorities”, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ysyfy1/article31111459.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19MYSCHICKEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/poultry-farmers-in-mysuru-reeling-under-twin-blows/article31111460.ece

In the wake of tourists still continuing to visit the coastal district of Uttara Kannada and as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the district, Deputy Commissioner of Uttara Kannada Harish Kumar on Thursday issued an order banning the entry of tourists to the district.

In the order, the Deputy Commissioner has said that it had been observed from the information gathered from check-posts at entry points in the district that the number of tourists to the district had not reduced despite the COVID-19 threat and the appeals through media to the public to postpone their tour programmes.

He has said that as the visits continued, it had been found necessary to impose the ban on entry of tourists from other districts and from neighbouring States with immediate effect. The Deputy Commissioner has also directed the taluk officials to set up check-posts immediately in their respective jurisdiction to implement the ban.

The Deputy Commissioner has also imposed a ban on the entry of newcomers to the Tibetan colony at Mundagod in the district without requisite permission from the Mundagod tahsildar. In the order, Mr. Harish Kumar has said that those who had stayed away from the colony for long will have to compulsorily undergo home quarantine for 14 days.

Through the order, the Deputy Commissioner has also banned congregation of more than five persons in the colony.

He has said that those who had recently come into the colony should compulsorily undergo medical examination and those who want to go out of the colony, with the permission of the Tahsildar, would not be allowed to come back before a month.

Social reporting system

The Uttara Kannada district administration has also decided to start a “social reporting system “ in the taluk in the wake of the rising trend of non-disclosure of travel history by people.

In a release, Mr. Harish Kumar has said that helpline facilities will be set up in each taluk of the district to allow the citizens to bring to the notice of the administration about the non-disclosure of travel history .

The district administration will maintain secrecy about the identity of the callers, he has said.

Condemning the alleged failure by the State government to prevent the outbreak of Kyasanur Forest Disease(KFD), also known as monkey fever, members of KFD Janajagruthi Okkoota staged a protest in the city on Thursday.

Addressing the protest meet, K.P. Sripal, social activist and a functionary of the Okkuta, alleged that field level surveillance work including collection of the bodies of dead monkeys in the forest and testing their viscera in the laboratory and collection of tick pools in forest areas and testing them were not done in a proper manner this year, resulting in the outbreak.

Demanding that the State government promote research work on enhancing the efficacy of the vaccine administered against KFD, he expressed displeasure at the delay in commencement of work related to establishment of a study and research centre on KFD in Sagar town for which the State government has allocated an amount of ₹15 crore.

Writer and environmentalist Shashi Sampalli criticised the State government for the frequent change in its stand on reimbursement of the expenses incurred by the KFD affected people to get medical treatment at private health establishments and the delay in clearance of bills related to the treatment offered by private hospitals to KFD patients last year.

He said that, as agriculture labourers and small land holders form the major chunk of the residents of the villages affected by KFD, the State government should make reimbursement of expenses incurred at private health establishments a permanent aspect of its official policy on tackling the disease.

He also demanded measures to address the monkey menace in Malnad region that has resulted in outbreak of KFD and crop loss.

The protesters raised slogans demanding ₹10 lakh as compensation for the family members of the persons who die due to KFD.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/eivf8b/article31111437.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19SHIMOGAKFD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kfd-relief-measures-are-inadequate/article31111438.ece

‘Air of complacency’

Deputy Commissioner Abhiram G. Sankar told mediapersons here on Thursday that despite the seriousness of the situation there seem to be an air of complacency and casualness among the public and this laxity should go. But all the government offices will remain open and the staff will be present in full strength as they may be deployed on other emergency duty depending on the situation.

Exemption

The suspension of services will not apply to sanitary works to be undertaken by the local bodies in the district including the Mysuru City Corporation, UGD maintenance and repairs, water supply works and power supply.

In reply to a question the Deputy Commissioner allayed fears over possible scarcity of essential commodities and said that the APMC yard was still functioning, there were no curbs on trading in vegetables and fruits, the groceries were open and there was adequate stock for the long term while milk supplies, chemists and pharmacists will not be affected.

No dearth of funds

There was no dearth of funds to cope with any emergency and the quarantine centres have infrastructure to cope with any influx ofi patients with COVID-19 symptoms.

The isolation centres have the highest standards of hygiene with all required facilities and hence people should not harbour false notions about them, he added.

143,2020/03/19,Public transport services to Maharashtra suspended,"Intensifying the fight against COVID-19 virus, the district administration has suspended all public transport service (except trains) to Maharashtra from 6 p.m. on Thursday.

The decision has been taken to prevent the spreading of the virus in the district as a majority of the viruscases have been registered in Maharashtra.

Deputy Commissioner Y.S. Patil told mediapersons after holding the daily review meeting on Thursday that all private and government buses travelling to Maharashtra or coming from Maharashtra will stay off the road. “However private vehicles can go to Maharashtra or arrive. Similarly, train services will remain functional as no decision has been taken by the Railway Ministry to suspend services to Maharashtra”, he said.

Meanwhile South Western Railway has suspended services of eight trains plying between Yeshwantpur-Vasco Da Gama, Vijayapura-Mangaluru, Habibganj-Dharwad and Yeshwantpur-Vijayapura.

To prevent gathering of large number of people for any public or private events, the district administration has banned all programmes that invite more than 100 persons.

“ We have directed the people either to postpone the functions such as wedding or reception till the situation eases, or conduct it if it is inevitable with only some 100 persons. For that too, the permission of local administration is a must”, Mr. Patil said.

The administration is receiving around 15-20 calls everyday on helpline number 1077. People are giving information about persons arriving from foreign countries.

He said that as of now, 154 persons have been home quarantined and their movements are being watched. They have been instructed to stay at home for at least 14 days for their safety and safety of other people.

SSLC exams

The Deputy Commissioner said that with SSLC exams less than a week away, the district administration has made special provisions to hold the exam in a restricted manner to prevent spreading of COVID-19 virus.

Since the administration is facing shortage of health workers as they have been deployed on duty to prevent spreading of COVID-19, special training would be given to officials of the Education Department to monitor any cases of virus-affected students.

“ We will be educating them on how to check possible cases of affected person and inform the Health Department about it”, he said.

144,2020/03/19,"DRI officials bust illegal gold, silver transporting racket","7 held, 9.3 kg gold seized; valuables taken between Kozhikode and Mangaluru

The officials of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) have busted a syndicate which was illegally transporting gold, silver and cash between Kozhikode and Mangaluru and arrested seven persons in this connection. They have seized 9.3 kg of gold valued at approximately ₹ 4 crore and 5.2 kg of silver, ₹84 lakh in cash and two cars from them.

The racket was busted after the DRI officials intercepted Syed Mohammed and Ashoka K.S. at Mangaluru Central Railway Station and recovered 5.6 kg of gold bars in crude form on March 11.

The operation was conducted based on specific information about a network of operators who were bringing smuggled gold in the form of crude bars from Kozhikode to Mangaluru. The gold was then remelted and cast into 100 gram bars with foreign markings, using foreign marking moulds, and was then getting distributed to various locations in Karnataka, sources said.

Manjunath Shet alias Rupesh, who was supposed to receive the said gold from the passengers, was apprehended at the parking lot of the railway station.

Naveenchandra Kamath of Udupi, the mastermind of the racket, has also been arrested.

Simultaneous searches were conducted in three different premises in Car Street Mangaluru, Udupi, and Shivamogga in this connection, sources added.

Further, the source of the gold was traced to melters/jewellers in Kozhikode and swift follow-up action was conducted leading to seizure of gold and ₹82 lakh cash. The officials also seized two cars belonging to the syndicate having specially designed cavities for concealment which were used for transporting cash and gold between Kozhikode and Mangaluru.

The team which busted the network comprised 40 officials from Bengaluru, Mangaluru and Shivamogga.

Further investigation is on to uncover other persons involved in the racket, sources added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tpmhtj/article31108341.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19mn-gold-bars-949d2b051-e4b4-4fad-be77-a5429143320c,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dri-officials-bust-illegal-gold-silver-transporting-racket/article31107164.ece
145,2020/03/19,"Row over KSPCB chairperson post: HC says govt. ‘misinterpreted’ its order, asks it to withdraw letter","The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday asked the State government to withdraw a letter, written to the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) chairperson M. Sudhindra Rao asking him not to officiate as chairperson by quoting an order of the court.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi issued the direction on noticing that the State government wrote the letter by “misreading and misinterpreting” its order related to PIL petitions challenging appointment of Mr. Rao as chairperson of the board.

The Additional Chief Secretary (Forest, Ecology and Environment) on March 10 wrote to Mr. Rao asking him not to discharge functions as chairman till the court decided on the PIL petition while claiming that the court had “accepted” the government’s contention that his appointment was “wrongly” done without framing the rules as per the 2017 verdict of the apex court.

While orally observing that the letter amounts to criminal contempt of court, the Bench made it clear that it had only recorded the government’s statement admitting that appointment of Mr. Rao was done “wrongly” and it did not accept the contention that appointment was not lawfully done.

The statement made on behalf of the government was accepted to mean that the government cannot change that stand again during the course of hearing, correctness of appointment is yet to be adjudicated,” the Bench clarified.

Meanwhile, the Bench said that the government is free to take any lawful decision in this case during the pendency of the petitions. The government, which appointed Mr. Rao on December 30, 2019, made a U-turn before the court on March 6, 2020, contending that the appointment was done without framing the rules.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/row-over-kspcb-chairperson-post-hc-says-govt-misinterpreted-its-order-asks-it-to-withdraw-letter/article31103242.ece
146,2020/03/19,Using political influence proves costly for two officers,"HC directs govt. not to post both of them as Superintendent Engineer, PWD circle, Kalaburagi

The use of political influence to remain in a particular post has proved costly for two superintendent engineers of the Department of Public Works, Water Resources and Inland Water Transport as the High Court of Karnataka has directed the State government not to post both of them to the post of Superintendent Engineer, PWD Circle, Kalaburagi.

A Division Bench comprising Justice G. Narendar and Justice M. Nagaprasanna passed the order recently in the Kalaburagi Bench while observing that “political interference in transfers and posting of officers would result in politicisation of public office and put public efficiency and good administration to peril”.

Prem Singh, who was posted as Superintendent Engineer, PWD Circle, Kalaburagi, in November 2019 had moved the Karantaka State Administrative Tribunal questioning the action of the government in keeping his posting in abeyance. Though initially the tribunal permitted him to take charge of the post, later his plea was dismissed, resulting in continuation of Prakash B. Srihari, who was holding the post earlier.

While partly allowing Mr. Singh’s plea against the tribunal order, the Bench refused to direct the government to continue him in the post of Superintendent Engineer, PWD Circle, Kalaburagi, as he too had brought political recommendations to remain in the post when his plea was pending adjudication before the tribunal.

While three MLAs had issued recommendation letters to the Chief Minister, a Deputy Chief Minister, and the Secretary of the Department to retain Mr. Srihari in the post, a Minister had written a letter to the Chief Minister to continue Mr. Singh in the post when the transfer issue was pending before the tribunal. All the recommendation letters from MLAs and the Minister were found in the original file maintained by the government.

The Bench pointed out that the transfer guidelines, issued in 2013 and which had attained the statutory force due to declaration by the High Court, not only clearly prohibits officials from bringing political pressure for transfer but also prescribes that officers bringing political pressure should not be posted for the particular post.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/using-political-influence-proves-costly-for-two-officers/article31103193.ece
147,2020/03/19,"There is a saffron shawl beneath green shawl of Yediyurappa, says Siddaramaiah","He alleges that State Budget has not taken up any prominent scheme for farmers and downtrodden

Ridiculing Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa for projecting himself as a farmers’ leader by sporting a green shawl on important occasions, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah on Wednesday said the content of the Budget had showed that there was “a saffron shawl beneath the green one”.

Participating in a debate on the State Budget, Mr. Siddaramaiah alleged that the Budget had let down farmers, needy, and downtrodden sections by not taking up any prominent schemes for them.

“Whenever we used to question the Chief Minister on the plight of farmers and the downtrodden, he would ask us to wait for the State Budget and insisted that the Budget would give an answer. But, the Budget does not have any answer,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said.

Pointing out that there was a reduction of Central funds to the tune of ₹11,887 crore in terms of grants by 15th Finance Commission and GST compensation, he wondered how the Chief Minister, who also holds the finance portfolio, would raise resources to fund development schemes.

Pointing out that there were indications of the collection of State’s own taxes reducing by ₹4,000 to ₹5,000 crore, he warned that tough days were ahead for the State.

The coming years were bound to be very tough for Karnataka as the compensation towards losses on account of GST would end by 2022, he noted.

Funding development schemes would be a challenge in the coming years in the wake of shortfall in resources, he said. Making it clear that it was not possible to make up for shortfall in resources by resorting to borrowings, he said the norms stipulated that borrowings could not exceed 25% of the GSDP.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/there-is-a-saffron-shawl-beneath-green-shawl-of-yediyurappa-says-siddaramaiah/article31103127.ece

Even as more curbs are being imposed by the government for reducing the frequency of large gatherings and social interactions for containing the spread of COVID-19, its business as usual in the offices of sub-registrars here.

A large number of people throng the offices almost everyday for property and marriage registrations and to utilise other services despite the scare.

In spite of the guidelines for minimising public contacts for checking the spread of the infection, the offices have continued to work routinely with no communication whatsoever from the government.

The authorities in these offices cite “no direction” from the government for suspending the property registrations as a precautionary measure but the people and the staff are being exposed to the risks daily.

No sanitizers are available in the offices despite the fact that biometric impressions are mandatory for the registrations and hundreds of people give their thumb impressions to facilitate the registration process.

No precautions are in place and the authorities should have provided masks and sanitizers much earlier for the safety of the staff as well as the visitors.

People would avoid visiting the offices if the work was halted for at least few days as a precautionary measure, the locals said.

When contacted, Mysuru District Registrar Vijayalakshmi Inamdar told The Hindu that no instructions had been received from the government for suspending the registrations over the COVID-19 scare.

“However, we have received some guidelines from our higher authorities on the steps to be taken for the safety of public as well as staff health. The offices had been asked to procure masks and sanitizers immediately,” she added.

The offices had been asked to ensure cleanliness and hygiene on the premises and the public would be provided sanitizers as and when demanded by them after giving their biometric impressions.

Collect information about all those who have come from abroad and have a special vigil on them,” he said.

“Besides these specific measures, the administration should strictly follow the steps that the State government has announced for minimising the crowd gathering.

The centre can accommodate 14,000 trainees at any given time.

Though Infosys did not specify the number of trainees to be evacuated from its Mysuru campus, sources in the KSRTC said about 10,000 trainees are scheduled to leave over the next one week.

“We are enabling more of our employees and trainees to work and learn from home. We are also limiting the number of people at Infosys campuses. Therefore, Infosys has advised trainees residing at its Global Education Centre in Mysuru to return home as soon as possible,” said a statement.

154,2020/03/19,UDF-ruled civic bodies press for closure of Bevco outlets,"Malappuram, Manjeri, Valanchery councils pass resolutions

Three United Democratic Front-ruled municipalities in the district on Thursday passed resolutions against the functioning of liquor outlets and bars in their respective limits at a time when the COVID-19 scare had shut down almost all institutions.

The municipalities of Malappuram, Manjeri, and Valanchery passed resolutions showing their anguish at people crowding at liquor outlets when the government has banned all kinds of assemblies. The UDF has been on a campaign to shut the outlets and bars following the pandemic scare.

“Considering the health of the general public, we ought to tell the liquor outlets and bars within our municipal limits to close down until March 31,” said Valanchery municipal chairperson C.K. Rufeena.

Ms. Rufeena said the municipal secretary might have limitations in closing down the liquor outlets as they did not come within the municipal powers. However, she said the civic body was responsible for public health and that it would have to act in times of emergency.

Malappuram municipal chairperson C.H. Jameela said the crowding of people, especially immigrant labourers, in front of the government-run liquor outlets had become a matter of serious concern, especially as the government was shutting down everything.

“We have decided to serve notice on the liquor outlets to close down until March 31 in view of the COVID-19 threat. We have nothing against liquor outlets or people buying or consuming liquor. But the present situation calls for concern,” said Ms. Jameela.

Manjeri municipal chairperson V.M. Subaida said the municipality had stopped all assemblies, including the Vayomitram project for people above 60 years of age. “Why exemption for liquor shops alone? We have cancelled even our tax collection camps.

155,2020/03/19,Pandemic cloud over harvest-ready Kuttanad,"‘Puncha’ harvest in full swing, but farmers in the rice bowl apprehensive about near future

Harvest-ready lush green paddy fields stretching long and wide is a sight to behold. In Kuttanad, the rice bowl of Kerala, it is that time of year again when vast paddy fields go under combine harvesters.

Despite the COVID-19 scare, the harvest of the ‘puncha’ crop is in full swing in Kuttanad. Farmers and officials, however, fear a spread of the disease or imposition of more restrictions would create enormous challenges in harvesting, procuring and transportation of the produce.

Apart from being concerned about their own health, farmers worry that an outbreak would force harvester machine operators, most of them from neighbouring States, to return to their native places. It would also result in labour shortage when the harvest reaches its peak in the coming weeks.

“As of now, everything is going smooth. There is no shortage of combine harvesters and labour. In Kainakary, the harvest has been completed in Aarupanku, Cherukayal, and Chithira Kayal. However, in the next 30 days a large number of paddy fields will be harvested around the same time. If COVID-19 spreads, things will turn topsy-turvy. The coming days will be crucial for our health as well as farming,” says K. Renil, a farmer from Kainakary.

According to officials of the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), mills have started to feel the pinch due to a shortage of unloading workers. “A major mill in the State on Wednesday found it hard to unload sacks filled with paddy from a truck after 80 migrant workers employed by them returned to their native States even without collecting their dues. Several other mills are also facing shortage of workforce. As of now, we are procuring paddy as planned. But, if the disease is spread on the community level, the entire harvest and procurement will be derailed,” says A.V. Suresh Kumar, senior paddy marketing officer.

Procurement

According to the Agriculture Department, the farmers have undertaken paddy farming in more than 27,500 hectares in the district, a major portion of which is in Kuttanad. A total of 48,640 farmers have so far registered online with Supplyco for selling their produce this season. As of Thursday, Supplyco has procured 8,600 tonnes of paddy from the district.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wd89k/article31111793.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20tval3--Kuttanad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pandemic-cloud-over-harvest-ready-kuttanad/article31111788.ece

The anxiety over COVID-19 is playing out at the help desk set up by the Directorate of General Education (DGE) for assuaging concerns of students appearing for higher secondary exams.

We Help, the help desk set up by the Career Guidance and Adolescent Counselling Cell under the Higher Secondary wing of the General Education Department, for the fifth consecutive year has so far received over 500 calls from students and parents.

“Apart from the usual calls triggered by exam anxiety, this time we received a few calls related to COVID-19 as well. Though rarely, there were calls from quarantined parents seeking clarity about sending their children for exams,” said C.M. Azeem, State coordinator, Career Guidance and Adolescent Counselling Cell.

Exam postponement

While some were anxious about likely postponement of exams following COVID-19 and its impact on entrance exams, a few were concerned about their disturbed vacation plans.

Teachers deployed

Besides, the DGE deployed two trained teachers to the COVID-19 desk at the Thiruvananthapuram collectorate after doctors there started getting calls from anxious parents and children about exams.

A team of ten teachers drawn from a pool of 300-odd teachers who received advanced training in counselling has been deployed at the exam help desk.

“More than the number of calls, the focus is on spending quality time helping out students in need of help. Some calls even extend beyond an hour while some callers keep on calling on consecutive days. There was this highly anxious student who called for two or three days seeking help,” said Mr. Azeem.

The help desk service will be available between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. It will run till March 28, when the exams will conclude.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-fears-play-out-at-exam-help-desk/article31111774.ece
157,2020/03/19,Bid to restart rooster sacrifice ritual,"As part of Kodungalloor Bharani festival on March 27

Even as authorities are trying to conduct the Kodungalloor Bharani limiting the celebrations to rituals, an organisation has announced to bring back rooster sacrifice banned about half a century ago.

The Viswa Vamachara Dharmaraksha Sangam (VVDRS) has announced to restart the ritual by sacrificing thousands of roosters at the Kodungalloor Bhagavathy temple as part of the Bharani festival on March 27.

Posters

Posters have appeared across Kodungalloor town and nearby areas claiming that Vamachara Kulapathy Shivavathar Aadi Margi Mahachandala Baba Malavari will inaugurate the ritual at the temple during Aswathi Kavutheendal, the main ritual of the festival.

Seeking action against the move, V. Manoj, Kodungalloor area secretary of Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad (KSSP), said it was illegal to restart a barbaric ritual abolished in the 1960s. The ritual, kozhikkallu moodal, used to be held 10 days ahead of Meena Bharani at the Bhagavathy temple.

In olden days, the temple had the ritual of sacrificing roosters.

But as animal/bird sacrifice was banned, the ritual was held by covering the ‘balikkallu’ with a red cloth.

“In the name of the Kodungalloor temple ritual, the organisation is trying to bring back animal/bird sacrifice banned by the Kerala Animals and Birds Sacrifices Prohibition Act, 1968. The organisation, less known before, has announced to slaughter thousands of roosters,” said Mr. Manoj.

The bid to restart the banned custom is a publicity stunt at the cost of communal harmony and public health. The organisation is planning to bring thousands of roosters to the temple when poultry birds are being culled in the State in the wake of avian flu, he added.

The KSSP has written to the Chief Minister, District Collector, District Police Chief, Kodungalloor tahsildar, Kodungalloor Devaswom manager, and the municipal secretary to take action against the organisation.

“This is happening when the government has called upon devotees and organisers to limit the celebrations to just rituals in view of the COVID-19 outbreak. The call for restarting such a barbaric act is with a malicious objective to create tension in society. Even a symbolic ritual, with a single rooter, will initiate a dangerous practice, which may be continued by thousands in the coming years,” the KSSP said in its resolution.

Police begin probe

District Police Chief K.P. Vijayakumaran said the police were inquiring about the organisation and its move and would take appropriate action against the conduct of the banned ritual.

158,2020/03/19,A trip cut short by COVID fears,"Jeep drivers are hit by ban on T.N. workers to travel

Jobin is among the many who drive workers from Tamil Nadu daily in his jeep to the cardamom plantations in the border areas of the high ranges here. Since last month, after plucking of the final crop, the daily trips had as such reduced. Now, after COVID-19 fears forced the Theni district administration to ask workers not to travel to plantations, the trips have totally ceased. Many like Jobin face bleak days ahead.

The workers who come from Tamil Nadu are mostly women, who reach the plantations though the Kumily, Cumbom Mettu and Bodimettu check posts. They are much valued for the skill they show in selecting ripened beans, says Varghese Kurien, a medium-level farmer.

Harvest time

Though the harvest time is around the monsoon in June/July, the current months are when works such as clearing dried leaves from the plants and irrigation activities are held. Women workers usually collect ripened beans, clear dried leaves, and cover the soil with dried leaves. Their absence this year may delay plantation deadlines for the year, says Mr Kurien.

Some of the plantations had allowed the daily workers to be absent from work after the final crop was plucked last month, says a staff at a plantation at Vandanmedu.

Yet there were a few coming for work. With COVID-19 fears, the workers have totally stopped coming.

Jobin, rendered jobless now, wonders when the situation would be normal and when he would be back at work, ferrying workers through the lush pathways to the plantations.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-trip-cut-short-by-covid-fears/article31111751.ece
159,2020/03/19,Pipe relaying work at Thakazhy to be delayed,"COVID forces departure of skilled workers leading to crisis

Work on replacing 1,524 m of defective pipeline under the Alappuzha drinking water project is set to be delayed due to the unavailability of skilled labourers following the COVID-19 outbreak.

As per the decision, 1,084 m of the faulty pipeline at Thakazhy and another 440 m at Kelamangalam would have to be replaced.

Last week, a tentative schedule for the pipe-relaying work was prepared by the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) as directed by the government. As per the plan, the work was to begin on March 18.

From other states

“The pipe-relaying work needs skilled labourers. The contractor had arranged the necessary labour from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. But, they have now returned to their respective States following the COVID-19 situation. The contractor has given us a letter citing the issue,” said an official with the Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns (UIDSSMT).

Burst 40 times

The Alappuzha drinking water project was executed by the KWA with Central assistance under the UIDSSMT in 2017.

However, since its launch, pipelines under the project have burst more than 40 times, including 30 major bursts at Thakazhy, disrupting water supply and damaging the Ambalappuzha-Thiruvalla road.

A high-level meeting convened by Water Resources Minister K. Krishnankutty in November 2019 decided to replace the defective pipeline in three months.

Officials said that 1,000-mm high-density polyethylene pipe would be replaced with 900-mm mild steel pipe after digging the Ambalappuzha-Thiruvalla road.

The pipe relaying will be done by the same contractor who laid the pipeline and bear the cost of the mild steel pipe. The KWA will bear the cost of restoring the road dug up for laying the pipeline.

No estimate yet

Officials further said that the Public Works Department (PWD) was yet to provide the estimate for the restoration of the road after completing the pipeline work.

“We have already given letters to the Public Works Department and Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society urging them to prepare an estimate. But they have not responded to it. As such, we have prepared an estimate, but it needs to be vetted. Given all this and the prevailing situation, it is difficult to fix a date for starting the pipe-relaying work,” said the UIDSSMT official.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pipe-relaying-work-at-thakazhy-to-be-delayed/article31111727.ece

161,2020/03/19,Focus on mental impact of quarantine,"Enforced isolation, social rejection, financial crisis can contribute to depression

Quarantine can cause negative psychological impacts, including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, anger and depression, according to Roy Abraham Kallivayalil, secretary general, World Psychiatric Association.

Talking to The Hindu here on Thursday, Dr. Kallivayalil said officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than is required, chalk out clear rationale for quarantine, provide information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies for them. He added that the government decision to quarantine those returning home from COVID-19-affected countries was a step in the right direction.

Many people feel distressed at the prospect of being quarantined. One person ran away from the isolation ward at Pathanamtitta General Hospital a few days ago and was found hiding in his home, 20 km from the hospital. Two American citizens who fled from the Government Medical College Hospital, Alappuzha, were tracked down at the Cochin international airport last week.

He said a post-viral fatigue, due to consequences of the virus infection on brain function, and intense bereavement could cause severe depression among the quarantined people.

WHO guidelines

Enforced isolation in a quarantined environment, that too in strange places, and social rejection by people who are afraid of dealing with the cured or suspected patients, and unexpected financial crisis are the other contributing factors to depression and suicide thinking in the quarantined people, he said. Dr. Kallivayalil said the World Health Organization (WHO) had brought out certain guidelines to minimise the psychological stress in quarantined and affected people.

Those home quarantined should maintain a healthy lifestyle, which includes proper diet, sleep, exercise, and social contacts over phone.

Only credible info

As per WHO guidelines, quarantined and affected people should gather only credible information which could help them assess their risk and take precautions. They should find a trustworthy source like WHO website or a State public health agency in this regard, he said.

Dr. Kallivayalil said the quarantined and affected people should avoid media coverage which is upsetting and seek help from mental health professionals when needed.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/1gkodv/article31111721.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv20ptkalyss,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/focus-on-mental-impact-of-quarantine/article31111714.ece
162,2020/03/19,"Avoid crowding in churches, says Catholicos","Number of devotees should not exceed limit

As the State enters the crucial third phase of COVID-19 outbreak, Catholicos of the East Baselios Mar Thoma Poulose II, head of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, has directed the faithful to cooperate wholeheartedly with the safety directions issued by the Chief Minister.

Elaborating on the regulations to be followed by the faithful till March 31, the Catholicos said special care should be taken to avoid crowding on the church premises. All rituals, except the holy Eucharist on Sundays, could be performed by priests and their assistants alone.

The number of devotees attending the rituals on Sundays should not exceed the limit set by the civil authorities.

Care should be taken to maintain a safe distance between devotees, and those having fever or cold should abstain.

The parishes have been advised to arrange online streaming of the Sunday services. Face-to-face confessions should be avoided while the timings of services should be arranged in accordance with the existing regulations. In view of the disruptions in the election proceedings due to the virus outbreak, the existing parish administrative committees should continue in office till the next election.

169,2020/03/19,Airports in State face shutdown,"No international flights into country for a week from March 22

A virtual shutdown awaits the four international airports of the State with the Union government decision on Thursday not to allow international flights into the country for a week from March 22 as part of the precautionary and preventive measures being adopted to contain the spread of COVID-19.

Domestic carriers are also withdrawing their flight operations to Thiruvananthapurm, Cochin, Kozhikode and Kannur international airports due to the poor patronage arising out of the travel restrictions. Low-cost carrier GoAir had cancelled 14 flights to the Cochin international airport on Wednesday and Thursday citing poor load and Indigo, the largest domestic carrier of the country, cancelled some of its flights to Thiruvananthapuram on Thursday.

The Air India Express flight from Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Emirates flight from Dubai, Etihad flight from Abu Dhabi and Air India flight from Sharjah that arrived in Thiruvananthapuram on Thursday had a total of 700 passengers. Emirates that operates from Dubai daily using Boeing 777-300 ER, that can carry 350 passengers and 14 crew, had only 167 passengers.

Airport sources said the Emirates flight arriving here from Dubai on Friday had only 145 passengers and the return flight 75 flyers, mostly transit passengers to the U.S and Africa. Air India Express flight IX 539 from here to Dubai on Thursday had not even one passenger on board . The airline cancelled its IX 537 flight from here to Abu Dhabi and the return flight IX 538 of Friday.

In Cochin airport, the international flight operations has been limited to Singapore, Bangkok, Bahrain and Oman. The 50% of the flights from Cochin airport are international. The number of flyers had dropped from the daily 30,000 to 10,000 this week, CIAL sources told The Hindu.

The situation in Kozhikode and Kannur international airports was not different with the travel and Visa restrictions and the ban imposed by the UAE on resident visas from Thursday. Sources said the airlines, including the domestic and foreign carriers, were not even getting revenue for meeting the operational cost of the flights that they are operating.

Already, international terminals that was busy are deserted. The ban on long-haul international flights from Sunday will virtually close down the four airports as domestic carriers are also moving in this direction in view of the poor load factor, the sources said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/airports-in-state-face-shutdown/article31110630.ece
170,2020/03/19,Stimulus plan to cushion virus impact,"Chief Minister announces ₹20,000-cr. financial package to revitalise key sectors

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday announced a ₹20,000-crore stimulus plan to cushion the economic impact of COVID-19 in Kerala, revitalise key sectors and to recapture normal social life in the State.

Briefing mediapersons here on Thursday, Mr. Vijayan said the Finance Department and Planning Board were studying how COVID-19 had impacted various sectors

After two consecutive days of no new positive cases, a lone positive case was reported from Kasaragod on Thursday. The patient is a UAE returnee who had already been in quarantine.

The number of cases in Kerala in the second wave of COVID-19 is thus 25. A total of 31,173 persons are under surveillance, with another 6,103 people newly added on Thursday. But only 237 are isolated in hospitals while the rest are in self-quarantine in homes.

Pensions

The pensions for March and April would be disbursed this month itself. Regardless of APL/BPL status, all families would be given a months’ supply of foodgrains.

The government was expediting the opening of the chain of fair price eateries it had announced earlier. Instead of September, these eateries will now be opened in April and meals would be made available at ₹20.

Mr. Vijyan said ₹14,000 crore was being set aside for the arrears of contract payments in various sectors.

He announced relief in fitness charges for autorickshaws and taxis, three months’ relief in the payment of taxes by buses and a month’s allowance in paying electricity and water bills. Cinemas would get a waiver on entertainment taxes.

Keeping in mind that the possibility of community transmission of COVID-19 in the State could be very real and that extensive preparedness was necessary to manage a potential public health crisis, Mr. Vijayan said he had sought and ensured the cooperation of army and paramilitary forces ahead to help manage the situation.

Defence forces have offered the services of their technical staff, doctors, paramedics, ambulances and the use of helicopters if required to evacuate patients. They would also help with temporary hospital beds and other hospital supplies.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bru55z/article31112390.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20tv-stimulus-plancol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/20000-crore-stimulus-plan-to-cushion-covid-19-impact/article31110332.ece
171,2020/03/19,UDF bans liquor sale in Malappuram municipality,"More UDF dominated local bodies may follow suit

The United Democratic Front (UDF) Opposition on Thursday escalated its stand-off with the government over the contentious issue of allowing bars and liquor outlets to conduct business as usual when preventing crowding was the social norm during the COVID-19 outbreak.

The UDF-ruled Malappuram municipal council was the first to throw down the gauntlet to the government by ordering Bevco and ConsumerFed to close outlets in its jurisdiction.

More UDF-dominated municipalities and panchayats are likely to follow suit in a political bid to put the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government on the defensive in the run-up to the local body and Assembly byelection in Chavara and Kuttanad.

The Malappuram municipality had reportedly overruled the opinion of the Secretary that the council had no legal say in the State’s excise policy. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) members in the council opposed the move on the ground that it lacked candour and did not account for the social risks the step portended.

The government had clarified that it could ill afford to shutter liquor outlets and bars. It was unlikely to allow the writ of the municipality to run. The Excise Department had warned the government that closure of liquor outlets and bars in any one region would prompt consumers to travel to neighbouring localities to purchase legal liquor, thereby increasing the chance for transmission of the virus.

Prohibition could encourage the black market sale of liquor, hoarding and entry of bootleg alcohol of suspicious quality and dubious provenance into the localities declared ‘dry’.

A galaxy of UDF leaders had accused the government of having traded of public health for appeasing the liquor lobby by allowing crowds and long queues outside retail outlets and in bars.

Congress Working Committee member A.K. Antony said the government had imperilled public health by keeping bars and retail outlets open when Kerala was amid a distressing lockdown to prevent the community spread of the infection.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/udf-bans-liquor-sale-in-malappuram-municipality/article31110319.ece
172,2020/03/19,Palarivattom flyover case: HC seeks ED’s statement,"Involvement of Ebrahim Kunju in the case

The Kerala High Court on Thursday directed the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to file a statement on the action taken on a report given by the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) indicating the involvement of former Public Works Minister Ebrahim Kunju and others in the Palarivattom flyover corruption case.

The court directed the VACB to file a statement disclosing the actions taken following the suspension of two Vigilance officers in connection with the case.

When the petition seeking a Vigilance probe into the allegation of crediting ₹10 crore during the time of demonetisation into the account of Chandrika, the mouthpiece of Indian Union Muslim League, came up for hearing, Special Prosecutor for VACB A. Rajesh submitted that the Vigilance report on the need for investigation into the role of Mr. Kunju and others had been given to the ED.

The ED had earlier submitted that it could conduct a probe into the money laundering case only when such a case was registered. The court had earlier observed that the official duty of the VACB was confined to corrupt practices, while the ED could conduct a probe into the illegal money transactions under the Money Laundering Act.

174,2020/03/19,HC tells banks to stop all recovery proceedings,"Courts terms COVID-19 outbreak precarious and sensitive

Terming the present scenario in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak as precarious and sensitive, the Kerala High Court on Thursday directed banks, financial institutions, Income Tax Department and authorities under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) to defer recovery proceedings or coercive measures till April 6 in the State.

However, Justice Amit Rawal, while issuing the order, made it clear that the order would not be an impediment for any of the willing defaulters to avail themselves of the amnesty schemes as and when such schemes are promulgated or in vogue. Besides, defaulters of GST, Kerala Value Added Tax (KVAT), building tax and motor vehicle tax who are willing to pay the demanded amount subject to conditions fixed by the department would not be bound by the order.

The court restrained the adjudicating authorities from passing any adverse order till April 6, as the court felt that there was likelihood of parties not able to approach the authorities on appointed date in view of the present situation.

The court, which deals with cases pertaining to recovery of income tax dues, KVAT, general sale tax, taxes under the Kerala Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, and property tax under Kerala Building Tax Act, observed that handling of the files by the High Court staff as well as the Advocate General staff was done without proper precautions, as they were handled with bare hand instead of using protective gears such as gloves.

The court said the entire world was facing the threat of SARS-CoV2 and there have been a large number of such cases in the country, including the State. People have been requested to stay away from any potential source of the virus. Since Kerala has 42 lakh people over the age of 60 and 5.4 lakh over 80 years old, an unprecedented health crisis cannot be ruled out.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hc-tells-banks-to-stop-all-recovery-proceedings/article31109667.ece
175,2020/03/19,COVID-19 | Surveillance stepped up in Wayanad after Kodagu records first case,"Move comes after a case was detected in neighbouring Kodagu district

The Wayanad district administration has stepped up surveillance following the detection of a confirmed case of COVID-19 in neighbouring Kodagu district in Karnataka on Thursday.

The Kodagu district administration invoked Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the district after a confirmed coronavirus case was reported at its headquarters in Madikeri.

A person who arrived in India from Saudi Arabia tested positive for the virus.

Wayanad District Collector Adeela Abdulla told The Hindu that the border check post at Tholpetty on the Kerala Karnataka border would be closed and daily workers who were returning from coffee plantations in Kodagu to the State through the route would be quarantined.

As hundreds of workers from Thirunelly and Tholpetty area in the district have been working in coffee and ginger plantations in Karnataka, the District Medical Officer ordered public microphone announcements to keep the workers alert of the situations.

“We have already constituted special teams to intensify preventive measures against the spread of the disease in the district”, Ms. Abdulla said. The teams were constituted as per the Disaster Management Act, 2005.

As many as nine teams under a five-member district-level team, comprising the District Panchayat President, District Collector, district police chief, District Medical Officer and Deputy Collector (disaster management) would execute the preventive measures effectively.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-surveillance-stepped-up-in-wayanad-after-kodagu-records-first-case/article31107831.ece
176,2020/03/19,Coronavirus: Kochi man undergoing home quarantine attempts suicide,"The 47-year-old had gone to Dubai to find a job but could not and this coupled with isolation could have been the trigger, according to police

A person undergoing the mandatory 14-day quarantine at his house as part of the precaution against COVID-19 infection on his return from Dubai was found hanging in his room in an attempt to suicide, said North Paravur police.

He was rushed to the Government Medical College, Kalamassery, where his condition is said to be stable.

The 47-year-old had returned from Dubai on Tuesday and was put on home quarantine on the direction of the health department. He had gone on a visiting visa reportedly in the hope of finding a job but failed to land any.

“He was already anxious about not being able to find any job and that, coupled with the isolation, may have led him to the attempt to take his own life. This has nothing to do with the quarantine process,” North Paravur police said. Police also hinted that he was in the habit of drinking and lack of access to liquor during quarantine could also have been a triggering factor.

The incident took place between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. on Wednesday. He was chatting with his wife before he retired for the night to his room. An unusual sound alerted the wife who rushed into the room to find her husband hanging from the fan.

Police have not registered any case since they no longer register a case for attempt to suicide.

177,2020/03/19,Megalithic site found at Karayad,"Researchers stress the need for protecting 1,500-year-old Pandava Cave

A team of researchers from Nehru Arts and Science College, Kanhangad, has identified a megalithic site dating back to 1,500 years at Karayad in Badiadka village in Kasaragod.

Locally known as the Pandava Cave, the site has a rock-cut chamber. With a height of 4 ft, the chamber has a rectangular entrance and a well-carved circle hole on the top.

According to Nandakumar Koroth and C.P. Rajeevan, who led the team, structures like rock-cut chamber, umbrella stone, and cap stones were built by the megalithic people as part of their burial system. The burial caves are also called Muniyara, Kalpathayam, and Muthalapetty.

The megalithic people put jugs and jars in the burial chamber and this practice shows that they believed in the transmigration of the soul. However, such items were missing here as they might have been destroyed over the period by the people, the researchers said.

Mr. Koroth said that sites like the Pandava Cave are of great importance for the study of local history. However, now liquor bottles and plastic waste are found inside the cave here.

There are several such megalithic sites in Kasaragod that should be protected for academic and tourism purposes. Megalithic sites are found at Bengalam, Payam, Parappa, Banam, Thimiri, Chandravayal, Berikkulam, Karippadakam, Panayal, Thalayadukkam, Umichipoyil and Nalilamkandam in the district, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/3ch7hm/article31105577.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Rock-cut-chamber-4,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/megalithic-site-found-at-karayad/article31105578.ece
178,2020/03/19,Koodathayi serial murder case: Jolly’s bail plea dismissed,"C. Suresh Kumar, First Additional District Judge, dismissed the bail petitions on the grounds that the accused is likely to influence and intimidate witnesses who are family members and relatives, including her husband, children, father, brother, and even neighbours

The Kozhikode District Sessions Court on Wednesday dismissed two bail applications of Jolly Joseph, the prime accused in the Koodathayi serial killings.

C. Suresh Kumar, First Additional District Judge, dismissed the bail petitions on the grounds that the accused is likely to influence and intimidate witnesses who are family members and relatives, including her husband, children, father, brother, and even neighbours.

Special Prosecutor, N.K. Unnikrishnan, who opposed the bail pleas argued that about 25 witnesses were named in the chargesheet relating to the murders of Sily, wife of Shaju Zacharias, her second husband and Sily’s two-year-old daughter Alphine.

Mr. Unnkrishnan said granting bail to Jolly, arraigned as a accused in the cases of poisoning to death six persons including her former husband Roy Thomas, would sent a wrong message.

179,2020/03/19,Monthly rituals come to a close at Sabarimala,"Pilgrim turnout stays low on last day

The Ayyappa temple at Sabarimala witnessed a lean pilgrim flow on the last day of the five-day monthly rituals on Wednesday.

Very few pilgrims turned up at the temple owing to the stringent restrictions imposed by the government to curb the spread of COVID-19 infection. From March 14, when the monthly rituals began, all Sannidhanam-bound pilgrims were screened by a Health Department medical team led by Dr. Prashobh at Pampa before they were allowed to enter the trekking path.

Till Wednesday afternoon, a total of 9,110 persons were screened for fever. Two persons with fever were sent back as per the Health Department guidelines on the first day. Only 230 persons crossed the surveillance point at Pampa to enter the trekking path from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Wednesday, according to official sources. The Sannidhanam used to witness a crowd of 10,000 to 15,000 daily during the monthly puja period.

The Travancore Devaswom Board had conducted only rituals like Ganapati homom, Ushapuja, Deeparadhana, Utchapuja and Athazhapuja at the Ayyappa temple during the just-concluded five-day monthly puja. Rituals such as Udayasthamanpuja, Kalabhabhishekom, Sahasrakalasapuja, Pushpabhishekom, and Padipuja were not performed. The temple was closed after the Athazhapuja in the evening.

The temple will be opened on March 28 afternoon for the 10-day annual festival that begins on March 29. Tantri Kandararu Maheswararu Mohanararu assisted by Melsanthi A.K.

181,2020/03/19,UDF disrupts toddy shop auction,"Chennithala, Chandy say govt. aiding liquor lobby at the cost of public health

The United Democratic Front (UDF) on Wednesday ratcheted up its campaign against the government’s decision to allow the sale of liquor during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Opposition workers attempted to disrupt toddy shop auctions and forced the closure of liquor outlets in Malappuram, Ernakulam and Alappuzha districts. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy said the government had traded off public health for currying favour with the liquor lobby by allowing crowded Kerala State Beverages Corporation (Bevco) outlets and bars to remain open during the outbreak. They warned that the UDF would take the matter to the streets if the government did not roll back its decision that imperilled public safety.

However, Excise Minister T.P. Ramakrishnan ruled out any such rollback. He said the government had ordered Bevco employees and bar managements to prevent overcrowding in their environs and ensure social distancing. They should equip their staff with protective gear and keep water, soap and hand sanitizers at the disposal of the public.

Barge auction hall

The government's averments did not deter Youth Congress (YC) and Muslim Youth League (MYL) workers from disrupting the toddy shop auction in Malappuram. They barged into the auction hall and demanded the process be stopped and warned against overcrowding by participants.

Additional District Magistrate N.M. Meharali later suspended the auction. In Alappuzha, pandemonium prevailed when the Youth Congress and KSU activists entered the hall where the auction of toddy shops in nine ranges was progressing. A considerable number of people had turned up for sale.

The protesters objected their presence.

The police removed the activists later and the excise authorities concluded the sale process.

In Kochi, the police removed Congress workers who had temporarily shuttered a Bevco outlet. The protesters disrupted the auction of toddy shops in Ernakulam district, forcing excise officers to shift the location of sales to their office at Kacheripady.

The Excise Department later clarified that they had to complete the auction process before the start of the next fiscal, and it had observed safeguards mandated by the government to protect participants and officials from infection.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/senyvb/article31103139.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19tvSHAPPULELEAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/udf-disrupts-toddy-shop-auction/article31103140.ece

184,2020/03/19,China to screen ‘Harry Potter’ in 3D and 4K to revive cinemas post coronavirus pandemic,"Warner Bros. Studios released a new Chinese poster of the first movie in the series that stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, among others

Warner Bros. Studios have announced that a 3D and 4K version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone —the first movie in the Harry Potter series — will be used to revive Chinese cinema halls after they open following months of closure to battle the coornavirus pandemic that has spread across the country, after originating in Wuhan.

According to Variety, the news was confirmed when the studio released a new poster in Chinese that showed Harry’s snowy old Hedwig flying with his Hogwarts acceptance letter that has his address in green ink, and a tag that reads, “Magic is coming.”

The new Chinese poster of ‘Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone’

Though no official release date has been revealed, it is expected to be around April 30, so that theatres can draw in crowds during the May 1 Labor Day weekend.

The Harry Potter franchise has huge fandom in China, with the original eight movies, that starred the likes of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and other popular British actors (based on the seven books in the series) doing fantastic business upon release, and the re-release is expected to provide a boost right before the third Fantastic Beasts movie — a spin-off from the Harry Potter series — finds its way into the theatres eventually.

The news was understandably met with a lot of excitement online by not just fans of J.K Rowling’s series in China, but also all over the world, resonating that a bit of magic is exactly what the world needs during these troubled times.

Variety also reported that China is attempting to revive its entertainment sector after nation-wide closures and that though a few cinemas have tried to reopen, business remains non-existence as several citizens are still practising isolation and social distancing. But from Beijing to the southwestern province of Yunnan, cinemas are now planning to re-open in some regions after the government approves their healthcare precautions.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kylw1s/article31111834.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/dan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/china-to-screen-harry-potter-in-3d-and-4k-to-revive-cinemas-post-coronavirus-pandemic/article31111836.ece
185,2020/03/19,"'Bacurau' movie review: A confounding, dazzling and disturbing watch","The beguiling Brazilian film with its critique of politics rings true for India too

A gentle melody, a satellite going up from the Earth to the sky, the camera zooming in on the earth from up above to a long stretch of road with a solitary truck and an accident on the way of a biker and a truck loaded with coffins. All leading up to the milestone for the rural town of Bacurau that states, ‘17 kilometres away’ and that “if you go there, go in peace”. A preemptive warning or an enticing invitation for what lies ahead? The vivid opening sequence of the Brazilian film Bacurau sets the tone for what follows—one of the most beguiling of recent films; that captivates just as much as it confounds, dazzles as much as it disturbs.

The enigma is rooted in the telling and the tone and tenor that keeps changing as the narrative progresses. It starts off by following the tenets of a classic Western improvised to get the story rooted in the distinct space and context that it emerges from. And then somewhere in the middle it takes a sharp bizarre turn to become a seige thriller and an uber violent game of sorts, of armed combat. There are weird futuristic sci-fi--flying saucers and drones thrown in as well.

A young lady returns to her small town of Bacurau for her grandmother’s funeral. Bacurau is where all kinds of strange, sinister things are happening. Not just has its water supply been cut off and mobile signals are weakening but it has even disappeared from satellite maps and faces the threat of unknown, mysterious enemy. American mercenaries? White colonialists? Greedy corporates? Environmental predators? Plain menace? Or all of these?

The film, set as it is “few years from now”, is a dire allegory for the dystopian future (and the present as well) full of disorder and disarray? Or is it all about doffing a hat to the unity and resilience of the community of underdogs that will eventually overcome the foes from outside? Trust my COVID-19 hit mind and overthinking but while watching it the second time it felt as though Filho and Dornelles had somehow seen the future. A bit too far-fetched a correlation, alright but one can be pardoned for harbouring such thoughts in these desperate times. After all, the whole world is a Bacurau right now resisting the corona enemy.

The trenchant critique of the politics and politicians is just as relatable to our own world—the lack of law and order, gangs running amuck, an uncared for, forsaken electorate, a hateful local politician, corrupt government. Where have we experienced it first hand? In waterless Bacurau it needs to be delivered by truck, bullet-riddled ones at that and the only reassurance for getting a regular supply is given when the local politician comes canvassing for votes for a second term. Uncannily familiar again. But will he still remember the promise after winning the seat? That’s anybody’s guess.

186,2020/03/19,The industry doesn’t understand me: Mahesh Manjrekar,"The star on how web series have opened new vistas for actors and how he has compartmentalised his creativity and material needs

A man of many parts, Mahesh Manjrekar is now making waves in the web circuit. After an impressive performance as a cricket coach in the Netflix series Selection Day, Manjrekar is being appreciated for his role as an aging husband in Shaad Ali’s Pawan & Pooja on MX Player.

Edited excerpts:

What made you accept Pawan & Pooja?

I liked the concept and role. Not to mention a great cast featuring the likes of Deepti Naval, Gul Panag, and Sharman Joshi. As the shoot progressed, I realised, I made the right choice. The story is about three different couples in the present times which have complications in their lives. So they are Pawan and Pooja in three different generations. Whatever age you are in, there are always complications in every relationship. People who say that have a perfect relationship are lying. We are talking about two different individuals in a relationship. How can there be no complication? The whole idea of making a successful love story is accepting each other’s problems, accommodating each other’s problems, and then sorting out the complications. In the series, we have tried not to be judgemental or strive for happy endings. The stories are presented as they are.

Tell us about the dynamics between the characters played by you and Deepti Naval.

I remember Deepti Naval from the film Ek Baar Phir. She really came across as a breath of fresh air in that film. She was also wonderful in films like Chashme Buddoor and Katha. She was very different from the heroines of the time. So I always liked her approach to cinema. She would never go overboard and did her job peacefully. The Pawan and Pooja that I and Deepti play have been married for 30 years. So they got married at a time when women didn’t have much of a choice. In a way, Pawan is complicit in the kind of life that she has lived. He loves her but as the husband, he is very happy knowing that he is the only bright spot in her life. Maybe, he has even taken her for granted. And then something happens which really shakes him up.

How do you see the web as a medium vis-à-vis cinema?

When I started my career, I wanted to be an actor. But that time there weren’t many opportunities. So I did a lot of stage plays. But today there is so much work for any good actor. Now, when you are doing the web, people aren’t actually bothered whether you are a saleable actor or not. They only see if it’s the right actor or not for the role. Also, today talent has got precedence over your star value. So, it’s a great phase to be an actor.

You do a wide variety of films across different industries. How do you manage to strike a balance?

I acted in Kaante because Sanjay Gupta insisted me to do it. At that time, I had never thought that I would be acting in films. Later on, I reached a point where I got sick and tired of doing the typical Hindi cinema kind of roles which they wanted me to do. I thought that I should do Marathi cinema as I knew that there I would be able to explore different subjects. But I also need the money and acting is my bread and butter. So I started doing Bollywood films merely for money. And there I don’t differentiate. I just ask them what they want me to do and the money that I would get paid for it and I just deliver. Even if they want me to do buffoonery, I give them that. I have compartmentalised that well. I don’t get hassled when I am doing a role that looks idiotic to me.

You haven’t been as prolific as a director as compared to your contemporaries despite having made critically and commercially successful films like Vaastav and Natsamrat

Let me tell you what happens. I did a film called Kaksparsh which I think is one of my best works. Last year, I did a two-part film on the life of playwright and humorist P. L. Deshpande, which I loved doing. I consider Astitva, which I did two decades back, to be my best film. Then I have recently done Panghrun, releasing in April, which I feel would be my best work yet. So I am doing my own stuff. I don’t want to compromise it for the sake of money. If I need money, I can always go and act. The industry, somewhere, doesn’t understand me. You must understand that there are camps here – I am not talking about nepotism – I am talking about camps. And they are dangerous. They have this mentality of not letting anybody come into those camps. It doesn’t work for me. After I am done with the work, I don’t hang out for parties. I also avoid award functions. I just don’t like all that. I am comfortable in my space doing films that I want to.

You contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Mumbai North West. What went wrong with your innings in politics?

I would have ideally loved to make my own political party with people who are actually on the same wavelength. I did join politics but I soon realised that this was not what I wanted. The problem is that there are few leaders around who are actually trying to address people’s problems. Mostly what we get to see is divide and rule politics where people are being used by politicians. Now, I wouldn’t like to give it another shot until I have some like-minded people who are actually interested in addressing people’s problems.

187,2020/03/19,George RR Martin using coronavirus self-isolation period to finish next book ‘Winds of Winter’,"71-year-old ‘Game of Thrones’ writer added that he falls into the vulnerable cateogry, but was fine and staying in a remote location

The coronavirus pandemic has sent a lot of people into self-quarantine or isolation, whether they like it or not: one person who is using the time productively though is Game of Thrones author George RR Martin, who has revealed to fans that he is busy writing his next!

Winds Of Winter has long been in the works, and now looks like the coronavirus outbreak has given Martin all the peace and solace he seeks to finish the novel. The 71-year-old wrote in his blog, Not a Blog, about the pandemic, posting, “Strange days are upon us. As ancient as I am, I cannot recall ever having lived through anything like the past few weeks.”

He also wrote that he realises he falls into the vulnerable category, given his “age and physical condition” but that he was feeling fine and staying in a “remote isolated location” and maintaining social distancing,

Martin stated, “I am off by myself in a remote isolated location, attended by one of my staff, and I’m not going in to town or seeing anyone. Truth be told, I am spending more time in Westeros than in the real world, writing every day.”

The novelist added, “Things are pretty grim in the Seven Kingdoms… but maybe not as grim as they may become here. Some days, watching the news, I cannot help feeling as if we are all now living in a science fiction novel. But not, alas, the sort of science fiction novel that I dreamed of living in when I was a kid, the one with the cities on the Moon, colonies on Mars, household robots programmed with the Three Laws, and flying cars.”

Martin concluded, asking his readers to stay safe: “I never liked the pandemic stories half so well… Let us hope we all come through this safe and sound. Stay well, my friends. Better to be safe than sorry.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/tlzzqi/article31109435.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BOOKSGEORGERRMARTIN,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/george-rr-martin-using-coronavirus-self-isolation-period-to-finish-next-book-winds-of-winter/article31109436.ece
188,2020/03/19,"Salman Khan sketches, Jacqueline does yoga, Vicky works out: How are Bollywood stars spending their self-isolation breaks?","As the industry has come to a standstill thanks to the coronavirus outbreak, actors find time to indulge in favourite hobbies

All activity in Bollywood studios has come to a standstill owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, and Bollywood stars are making most of the free time. Forced to being confined to their homes, actors are trying to enjoy the unscheduled break while they are on self-isolation and this is reflected in their social media posts.

Sharing a picture of his workout equipment kept at home, Vicky Kaushal wrote: “Work(out) from Home! #QuarantineStacking.”

Jacqueline Fernandez shared a video of her performing Surya Namaskar at home. The actress captioned: “This is 1 surya namaskar, 20 mins you can do 20 and it’s a great workout! I do 108. yoga to the rescue!!!”

Urvashi Rautela is into yoga too, right now. Urvashi wrote: “24 MILLION love on @Instagram love you all. practicing self quarantine doing #BACKWALKOVER (CHAKRASANA+BACKBONE+URDHVA DHANURASANA) indoors ! Self training is best training. To my 24M family & loved ones i’d like to encourage all of you to workout indoors amidst the Coronavirus heath scare.”

Other like Sidharth Malhotra and Siddhant Chaturvedi are using up the free time to catch up on reading.

Sharing a photo where he can be seen reading a book while sipping coffee, Sidharth wrote: “It’s time to take some time off and focus on things we’ve always wanted to do but never had enough time for. Let’s read, reinvent and live our hobbies, spend time with our family and just try to do all we can to stay safe and keep others around us safe too! I love you guys, so please take good care of yourself, stay at home, wash your hands and avoid unnecessary travel.”

Siddhant shared a photo where he reads a book in bed. “Life’s slow down and I’m by myself all day, I’m glad I found you the old-fashioned way,” he wrote.

Sharing a picture of her performing yoga, Rakul Preet Singh wrote: “Excuses never burn calories. Who knew home furniture makes for the best props. Don’t let #self quarantine stop your growth. Do things that you never found the time for !!”

Sharing a selfie from home, Arjun Kapoor wrote on Instagram: “Quarantine Day 3. Can’t deal, Feels surreal. The paranoia is real, maybe its her way of putting us back on an even keel.”

Shilpa Shetty is using her break to spend quality time with her kids. The actress shared a video where she is seen having fun with son Viaan as they engage in some tie-and-dye activity.

Shilpa wrote: “How do I keep my child occupied?!” is the million dollar question playing on every parent’s mind right now. This ‘unplanned’ break has to be endured, since it can’t be cured. We try planning a few hours of interesting activities in a day for our kids...invent, innovate, and come up with something as it’s a DO OR “DYE” situation.. that’ll keep them busy and you happy. Today’s bonding session with Viaan happened with some tie-and-dye activity at home, with a special appearance by Simba! (Who nearly got her tail dyed).”

189,2020/03/19,BIFFes 2020: A window to the world,"A low-down on what happened at the twelfth edition of the Bengaluru International Film Festival

The recently concluded twelfth edition of BIFFes was easily the most competently organised in all these years. The crowds have swelled gradually over the years and the first day saw a queue befitting a blockbuster. The serpentine queues were pretty well regulated with the volunteers keeping a hawk’s eye for those who jumped or joined midway. The steep discount on foodstuff was welcome, though the service inside was a mild irritant. The Corona virus was yet to go viral, but people squirmed involuntarily whenever someone coughed continuously.

The quality of films has improved too. More producers are willing to send their work now probably because the digital format makes it much easier than sending reels. Film Festivals are a window to the vast world, from breathtakingly beautiful locales to the various languages, cultures, customs and colours of different people and landscapes. In one week, you get to traverse the globe with a single ticket sans passport or visa. What bind us are emotions and relationships which are universal.

Andrei Tarkovsky and Anant Nag were honoured with richly deserved retrospectives. While Tarkovsky has inspired many a filmmaker, Anant is the envy of most performers for his sheer effortlessness as a performer.

The atmosphere was definitely festive. Poring over the menu card of movies and scampering from screen to screen trying to time the next show is a common sight.

Strangely, there’s a sense of satisfaction in knowing ours is not the only country where heinous crimes are committed against women or where only women are blamed for a childless marriage. ‘Zana’ is about a Kosovar woman browbeaten by her mother-in-law into meeting fertility experts as well as faith healers and witches in an effort to get her to conceive. The rich details about the customs of this clan in Kosovo are captured with a keen eye. In the lead role, Lume infuses an emptiness into her character, reacting with a physical attack only when her husband suggests getting another bride.

Set in Melbourne, ‘Measure For Measure’ is a gritty tale about morality and mercy set in housing commission apartments. The characters are colourful — from a drug kingpin to an immigrant falling for a musician earning the wrath of her brother, a goon. Love is a key element, but the clash of cultures and egos has a foreboding of doom and gloom.

‘Sister’ from Bulgaria is about a mother and her two daughters. The younger one spins colourful tales to brighten up her dull existence selling the amateurishly crafted figurines they make. The yarns she spins seem innocuous till it alienates her sister and sends their boring existence into a tizzy turning the film into a psychological thriller while throwing relationships in disarray. The poignant climax highlights nature’s ability to bind people irrespective of their inherent nature and morals.

‘All About Me’ is about a pudgy child who brightens lives around him with his mimicry even as he watches his mother’s health deteriorate after a botched surgery. Based on a best-selling autobiography, the film is about the therapeutic powers of laughter. The highlight of the film is the warm relationship that bonds the family and sees them emerge unscathed from emotional wounds. The film effortlessly makes you laugh and cry, as well.

Next, we move to Turkey where a censor in charge of screening letters to and from prisoners, becomes fixated with the wife of a particular inmate. Fancying himself a writer, the officer starts imagining a tale that could possibly be true. Soon, curiosity turns to obsession, blurring the line between reality and imagination.

‘A Regular Woman’ is based on a 2005 honour killing of the eldest daughter in a Sunni Muslim family by her youngest brother in Germany. Sadly, the sufferer is the woman’s child who thankfully wasn’t handed over to the family for whom honour is more important than their daughter’s happiness. ‘A Painted Bird’ from Venice is a three-hour tour of the hell a child undergoes in ravaged East Europe. The film was shot in black and white over several years to show the growth of the boy and his journey from innocence to the depths of despair after his encounters. The graphic scenes make you want to bolt out the door, but the cinematic quality keeps you riveted to your seat.

Film festivals are like train journeys where you may not meet old friends, but definitely make new ones. It’s the annual gathering of cinema gourmets who want to sample everything, but can’t for want of time, rather than an ability to digest.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/v4k0l1/article31108174.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BIFFES4,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/biffes-2020-a-window-to-the-world/article31108175.ece

191,2020/03/19,"Popcorn Time, the ‘Netflix of piracy’ is back during the coronavirus outbreak","The streaming app hosts just-released movies, TV shows and anime, that users can watch free of charge

People across the world are staying in, self-isolating, social distancing or in self-quarantine as the coronavirus pandemic spreads all over: so what do they do at home? Binge-watch, of course! The likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime and other OTT platforms have been getting a lot of new users in the past few weeks, as people working from home or those in isolation use the time to catch up on their favourite shows or discover new ones.

But what about those that can’t afford paying the subscription fee to these platforms?

Newly emerging like a phoenix from the ashes, Popcorn Time has the answers. Known previously as the Netflix of piracy, the platform is available to download on Windows, MacOS, Linux and Android, and hosts a range of just-released films like Frozen 2 or Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, or TV shows and anime, though not legally. However, its become one of the most-visited sites on the Internet over the last few days, thanks to its easy-to-use interface and verified streaming links, reports Motherboard.

“Love in the Time of Corona Version 0.4 is out,” tweeted the Popcorn Time Twitter account, announcing their return.

Users don’t have to download the movies or install a tracker. The streaming app became popular in 2014 for people who wanted to access films that were still running in theaters. However, it faced court orders and IP blocks, leaving to its eventual demise.

194,2020/03/19,"I accept only scripts that resonate with me, says cinematographer Sanu Varughese","The ace technician says that the visual language of Fahadh Faasil's 'Malik' is more dramatic than that of 'Take Off'

With movies in multiple languages, commercials and documentaries, cinematographer Sanu John Varughese is a busy man. His filmography includes movies like Karthik Calling Karthik, Elektra, Vishwaroopam, David, Wazir, Take Off, Badhaai Ho, Jersey and Android Kunjappan Version 5.25. The much-awaited Malik, directed by Mahesh Narayanan with Fahadh Faasil in the lead, is getting ready for release.

In an interview, Sanu talks about his work as a cinematographer and Malik. Edited excerpts.

After Mahesh’s Take Off, you are working with him again in Malik. What was your approach towards the two movies?

Both these movies are in totally different zones. Take Off was more of an internal story where we were travelling along with the character. The geography of the location in Malik is a major factor. The formats and the pitching are different as well.

When you are narrating a story based on true events or on people who actually lived, is it more challenging than narrating a fictional tale?

We have treated both Take Off and Malik as fiction though both are based on real incidents. When compared to Take Off, the visual language of Malik is more dramatic.

Sanu John Varughese | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

What were the challenges in creating the time frame in Malik?

That was a combined responsibility of mainly five departments — costume, make up, art, cinematography and direction. Malik has been an exciting project and it was creatively satisfying. I did feel nostalgic on seeing costumes from the 1970s, which brought back memories of my younger days in my home town.

Looking back, what prompted you to become a cinematographer?

My focus was on still photography while studying at the College of Fine Arts. Then I became a news cameraman. One thing led to another and in a matter of six years since the start of my career, I shot my first feature film, Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon in 2003.

Do cinematographers look for ways to leave their signature each time they work on a movie?

I don’t believe in that. Having said that, it is true that there would be some elements that come from our tastes, which could be seen as the director of photographer’s signature work. Cinematography can also be seen as a tool that sets the mood of a story pretty much like music, sound and silence.

So what is your working pattern like?

I accept only scripts that resonate with me. From the time of listening to a script, I make it a point to proceed through constant communication with the director. It is easier with directors like Mahesh who is good at visualising the story. Moreover, being an editor himself, he is sure about what he wants and that initial editing process is evident even in his writing.

When directors can visualise their story, there is more clarity during the shooting. See, movie-making is a collaborative effort. My process is always to find the director’s vision and to move in tandem with that. I have worked with many first-time directors and my effort is to go with them without tampering with their spirit. Usually, a well-written script will have its own visual flavour.

Is there a difference in the way you approach movies belonging to various genres?

Definitely, that difference will be there. For instance, while doing the sports movie Jersey (2019) in Telugu, the treatment was to capture the action as such. I approach each script based on the emotion that it intends to convey. The composition and lighting of every frame depend on the mood of the story.

Is there a huge difference in the shooting of Hindi and Malayalam films?

As the working costs are more in Hindi, I believe there are more experiments in regional languages these days. For instance, it would be quite difficult to make a fresh concept like Android Kunjappan Version 5.25 in Hindi.

Does the performance of the actors matter to a cinematographer?

Where you place the camera, how you light it and how you compose depend on the actor’s performance. There are times when seeing the eye of the actor is crucial to communicate the emotion of a scene. There are certain other times when seeing the body language in the context of the background is more effective in communicating the emotional content of the scene. This is again dependent on what the scene is conveying in the story being narrated. Performance does change the nature of cinematography. But the challenge for the cinematographer is to creatively interpret it in the context of the story being told.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/qhrtw0/article31105517.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20tvfSanuJohnVarugheseleftwithMalikdirectorMaheshNarayanan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/cinematographer-sanu-varughese-talk-about-his-craft-and-his-upcoming-project-malik/article31105518.ece

The festival was scheduled to be held from May 20 to 24 at three venues — Liberty Cinema, Metro Inox, and Alliance Française de Bombay.

Billed as the biggest queer film festival in South Asia, Kashish is counted among the important events in Mumbai’s film festival calendar. “The Kashish team feels that precaution is the best way and it is time for all of us to stand in solidarity and ensure everyone’s safety and health. We look forward to being able to share a later date in September with everyone to celebrate Kashish 2020 with the same grandness, joviality and community bonding that the festival is known for,” Sridhar Rangayan, festival director, said.

199,2020/03/19,Big B spreads awareness of BMC’s stamp for quarantine,"Late on Tuesday, actor tweeted a photograph of a hand with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) home quarantine stamp.

Who better to lend a strong hand to spread awareness of COVID-19 than Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan himself? Late on Tuesday, he tweeted a photograph of a hand with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) home quarantine stamp.

From Monday, the stamp in indelible ink stating: “Proud to protect Mumbaikars. Home quarantined,” is being put on the back of the left hand of people who need to stay isolated at home for suspected exposure to the coronavirus. These are people who do not have any symptoms but have recently returned from the affected countries. They are supposed to self-quarantine or home quarantine for 14 days, wherein BMC will monitor their symptoms.

Mr. Bachchan tweeted alongside the picture, “Stamping started on hands with voter ink, in Mumbai .. keep safe, be cautious, remain isolated if detected.” The BMC handle in turn thanked him for spreading the word and “reiterating the need for #HomeQuarantine to those select few, for them to be safe, cautious & responsible towards not just near & dear ones, but all!”

However, the good effort also led to a bit of a confusion, with some assuming that Mr. Bachchan had been quarantined himself. However, his spokesperson told The Hindu that the picture was a representational image that had already been in circulation and not of his hand. Mr. Bachchan hasn’t travelled abroad recently, in fact he has been in Mumbai and working towards spreading awareness about COVID-19 among his fans.

He recently cancelled the Sunday practice of meeting his fans at his Juhu bungalow Jalsa. He advised them to take precautions and stay safe and careful.

Mr. Bachchan also tweeted about the World Health Organization and UNICEF asking him to send out video messages. A few days back, he had posted a video of the recitation of his self-penned poem on coronavirus. Written in Awadhi, it talks about how people are offering remedies like kalonji powder and amla juice, but the real deal to fight the virus is to maintain hygiene and keep washing hands with soap.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/big-b-spreads-awareness-of-bmcs-stamp-for-quarantine/article31103579.ece

Raising the issue during the Zero Hour in the House, DMK Deputy Floor Leader Duraimurugan said several commercial establishments, including malls, cinema halls and other establishments have been ordered to close until March 31 due to which these establishments have suffered economic losses.

Referring to news reports, he contended that daily wage labourers have also been affected due to the disruption in businesses and went on to urge the State government to consider tax holiday and extension in paying up of electricity bills and the likes.

Moving a call attention motion, DMK president and Leader of the Opposition M.K. Stalin referred to the losses by several small industries and claimed they faced closure. He also pointed out the economic losses and unemployment due to the scare of Coronavirus.

Listing out measures taken by the United Kingdom, Italy, New Zealand, Germany and other States in India such as Odisha, which have announced measures to benefit businesses suffering losses, Mr. Stalin sought to know whether the AIADMK government would come up such measures.

Commercial Taxes Minister K.C. Veeramani said the business in small industries continued to operate, since precautionary measures have been taken by the State government in this regard. Minister D. Jayakumar (handling GST issues) said it was the GST Council that was to take a call on issues relating to imposition or deferring of tax in this regard.

Mr. Palaniswami intervened in the debate to say small industries have not been closed in Tamil Nadu. “So, there is no need to panic. Small industries are continuously operating.” Since the Labour secretary and Industries secretary have issued necessary precautions to be taken by those small industries, there was no need to panic, Mr. Palaniswami said.

As for other steps taken in other countries, pointed out by Mr. Stalin, the CM said: “As far as TN is concerned, precautionary measures have been taken in full swing. The virus is being spread from those from outside and not from those inside the State.” He added that those with symptoms would be given appropriate medical treatment.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/6rfcgg/article31108414.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/STALIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/covid-19-dmk-wants-tax-holiday-for-affected-industries/article31108416.ece
201,2020/03/19,Will health insurance schemes cover COVID-19 asks DMK,"DMK legislator Duraimurugan sought to know whether government-assisted health insurance schemes would cover the expense of testing and treatment

DMK legislator Duraimurugan (Katpadi) sought to know from the AIADMK government in the State Legislative Assembly on Thursday whether the various health insurance schemes run by the government would cover treatment in private hospitals for Coronavirus.

Raising a query during the Question Hour, Mr. Duraimurugan claimed private hospitals were charging up to ₹5,000 for screening for Coronavirus and sought to know whether the government-assisted health insurance schemes would cover the expense. Earlier, Congress legislator K.R. Ramasamy (Karaikudi) sought to know the status of the pandemic in the State.

Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said that the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) has approved only certain labs to check samples and hence the DMK leader need not be anxious.

The Minister also said private hospitals such as Christian Medical College in Vellore and Apollo in Chennai, among others, have been asked to set up isolation wards with certain specifications, if need be. “We will only put forward their cases but the ICMR will take a final decision,” he said.

Presently, there are only 11 facilities across the country to test samples for SARS-CoV-2. The 20-year old male, who tested positive on Wednesday was under treatment in an isolation ward in Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital and was “stable”, the Minister said.

Another 10 persons, who were in contact with the 20-year old man have been traced and were being quarantined, he said. “Presently, 32 persons have been admitted and kept in isolation wards in four cities,” Mr. Vijayabaskar said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/will-health-insurance-schemes-cover-covid-19-asks-dmk/article31108388.ece

203,2020/03/19,COVID-19: Anbumani Ramadoss calls for complete shut-down for three weeks across India,"The PMK youth wing leader and Rajya Sabha member said this was the only way for the country to protect its population

PMK youth wing leader and Rajya Sabha member Anbumani Ramadoss has called for an immediate lock-down in Tamil Nadu and across India for the next three weeks to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and imposition of Section 144.

In a statement, he said that is the only way for the country to ensure that it does not move to stage 3 from stage 2 of COVID-19 transmission and also to stop a potential huge loss of human lives. Dr. Anbumani charged that the current measures in Tamil Nadu like closing of malls, education institutions and movie theatres were not enough to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

All shops and all transportation should be shut in Tamil Nadu, along with the imposition of Section 144 to prevent a huge loss of human lives, he added. He said the shut down would result in losses to traders and the Centre and State government should compensate them. Loan payments should be deferred till things return to normal and interest should be waived off, he said.

The government should also ensure adequate supply of essential goods, Dr. Anbumani said.

“The measures I have suggested might create a sense of fear.

206,2020/03/19,Tamil Nadu’s Sixth State Finance Commission constituted,"It has been set up under the chairmanship of retired bureaucrat Mohan Pyare

The vexatious issue of local bodies not paying their bills to service providers such as Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) is among the three new issues to be addressed specifically by the 6th State Finance Commission (SFC) that has been set up under the chairmanship of retired bureaucrat Mohan Pyare.

Local bodies, both urban and rural, have also been found to be have outstanding bills with the Tamil Nadu Water Supply & Drainage Board (TWAD) and Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) for water charges. As the service providers have been facing severe financial problems, they have been representing to the government that many of their financial woes can be resolved if the local bodies make timely payments towards electricity and water charges.

As done in the past, the Commission will go into the entire subject of devolution between the State government and local bodes, apart from identifying measures needed to improve the financial position of the local bodies and new avenues for resources mobilisation.

As for the other two new issues, the Commission is required to suggest ways to strengthen the service delivery capacities of local body administration to enable them to effectively discharge their roles and responsibilities and examine the possibility of providing devolution to Cantonment Boards from out of the Consolidated Fund of the State.

The Commission is expected to present its report by July 31 ,2021 covering the period of five years commencing on April 1, 2022, according to a gazette notification issued earlier this month

The SFC will include C.V. Sekar, Pattukottai legislator, Commissioner of Municipal Administration and Directors of Town Panchayats and Rural Development and Panchayat Raj as members.

Mr. Pyare is the second retired officer to head the SFC after R. Arumugam, who headed the first Commission in the mid-1990s.

207,2020/03/19,"COVID-19: Schools, teachers demand Tamil Nadu postpone exams","While public examinations for class 11 and class 12 are under-way, examinations for class 10 commence on March 27

With the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (ICSE) postponing all examinations till March 31 because of the COVID-19 situation, a number of associations have demanded that the School Education Department in Tamil Nadu follow suit.

While public examinations for class 11 and class 12 are under-way, examinations for class 10 commence on March 27. Classes 11 12 have two exams left.

P.K. Ilamaran, president, Tamil Nadu Teachers’ Association, said that in the worst case scenario, the government could allow just the class 12 examinations to finish, since delaying them will have repercussions on college admissions. “There is no reason why children of other classes should be put to risk,” he said.

Neelan Arasu, coordinator, Tamil Nadu Private Schools’ Association, said that it is not just the number of children we have to factor in, but their families, school staff, and transportation. “When the children come for examinations, it will be nearly impossible to provide hand sanitisers or other such necessary amenities for all of them,” he said.

Highlighting similar demands, P. Patrick Raymond, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Graduate Teachers’ Federation, said that if class 12 examinations have to be continued, adequate precautions must be taken for the well-being of the students in all examination centres. “They should be allowed to use handkerchiefs in the examination halls or the government must provide tissue paper. Adequate distance should be maintained between the students in the examination halls,” he said.

Mr. Neelan Arasu said that private schools have also appealed to the State government to declare that annual exams were not necessary for all other classes this year.

208,2020/03/19,Five killed in car accident near Tiruppur,"This accident comes within a month after the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) bus accident that claimed 19 lives on February 20 in the outskirts of Tiruppur city

Five people, including four college students from Salem, were killed in a collision between a car and a truck near Tiruppur on Thursday.

According to the police, eight members, seven of whom were students from a private medical college in Salem, were travelling on a national highway in the four-wheeler towards Udhagamandalam. They started from Salem in the early hours of Thursday after their college was shut down due to the COVID-19 scare, police said.

At around 5.45 a.m., the car lost control and rammed the back of the moving truck near Ranga Nagar in Avinashi. ""The truck driver was not at fault here,"" a senior officer from Tiruppur district police said.

Elavarasan, Vengatasalam, Rajesh and Vasanth, all aged 21 years, along with the driver Manikandan were killed on the spot. Three others - Santhosh, Jayasurya and Karthi, escaped with injuries from the accident. The first two were admitted in a private hospital at Thirumuruganpoondi in Tiruppur city while the third student was referred to Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH), according to the police.

The truck driver absconded following the accident. Avinashi police registered a case and efforts to nab the truck driver are under way.

Rejecting the allegation that only five contractors were allowed to participate in the tender process for Performance Based Maintenance Contracts (PBMCs) for road-laying work in the State, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Wednesday said projects were awarded only to those who quoted the lowest price.

“The e-tender system is followed for PBMCs. We are honestly following the tender process,” he said while responding to DMK MLA Thangam Thennarasu, who sought to know why the government had awarded projects only to five contractors. Speaking during the debate on the demands for grants to Highways and Minor Ports and Buildings and Irrigation (Public Works Department) Mr. Thennarasu levelled a series of allegations against the government, with the CM frequently intervening to give clarifications and deny the charges. “Under the e-tender process, no one knows who the bidders are,” he said, adding, “Whoever fulfills the necessary requirements can bid for projects.

210,2020/03/19,All six Rajya Sabha candidates declared elected,"All six candidates who were nominated to the Rajya Sabha from Tamil Nadu have been declared elected unopposed.

Three of them have one common feature — Tiruchi Siva of the DMK and M. Thambi Durai and K.P. Munusamy of the AIADMK had served in the Lok Sabha at least once.

Mr. Siva was elected to the Lower House from the now-abolished Pudukottai constituency in 1996.

However, in a close three-cornered contest in 1998, he lost to Raja Paramasivam of the AIADMK by a margin of around 30,000 votes. S. Thirunavukkarasar, now in the Congress and then heading a party of his own — M.G.R. Anna DMK (MADMK) — came third by polling about 2.26 lakh votes.

It was then that Mr. Thambi Durai and Mr. Munusamy made it to the Lok Sabha from the Karur and Krishnagiri constituencies respectively. The former won in Karur for the second time while it was the maiden victory for the latter.

A year later (1999), Mr. Thambi Durai was fielded from Krishnagiri, his home district, and Mr. Munusamy from Dharmapuri. Both lost by margins ranging from 25,500 votes (in Dharmapuri) to 31,800 votes (Krishnagiri).

Since then, Mr. Thambi Durai has never contested from Krishnagiri again, though he got elected from Karur on two more occasions (2009 and 2014). In April-May 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Mr. Munusamy returned to Krishnagiri, only to lose to A. Chellakumar of the Congress by a margin of about 1.56 lakh votes. Mr. Thambi Durai too suffered defeat in his familiar terrain, Karur, as he was beaten by S. Jothimani of the Congress with a difference of about 4.2 lakh votes.

Mr. Siva, who began his innings in the Rajya Sabha in 2007, was re-elected to the Upper House in 2014. The latest election is the third one for him.

The three other candidates who have been elected to the Rajya Sabha are N.R. Elango and P. Selvarasu, both from the DMK, and G.K. Vasan of the Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar).

211,2020/03/19,"Following war of words, remarks by CM, MLAs expunged in Assembly","Heated exchange during Senthil Balaji’s speech

The Assembly witnessed a fierce debate for more than an hour on Wednesday, in the midst of DMK MLA Senthil Balaji’s speech during the debate on the demand for grants to the Public Works Department — a portfolio held by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami.

Speaker P. Dhanapal expunged nearly all the comments made by all members, who spoke at multiple points during the debate.

Mr. Balaji alleged lack of progress in extension work on National Highways, State Highways and district roads during the AIADMK regime. Mr. Palaniswami intervened multiple times and offered his explanation. At one point during the debate, the Chief Minister made a remark that prompted the DMK MLAs to protest in unison, following which Leader of the Opposition M.K. Stalin also made certain remarks. A fierce debate ensued, with Ministers intervening and the Chief Minister himself offering explanations and making counter-remarks.

Things settled down after a prolonged series of remarks and counter-remarks from both sides, at which point Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam requested the Speaker to expunge the remarks made by everyone. The Speaker expunged the whole debate except the part where Mr. Balaji was speaking about the department’s statistics.

Even as Mr. Balaji continued to raise issues, Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar stood up, reverted to the earlier comments and read out portions of one of Mr. Balaji’s speeches from the Assembly records when he was with the AIADMK. This led to another series of interventions and counter-arguments. These too were expunged.

Again, when Mr. Balaji started speaking about an issue, the AIADMK immediately took issue with his remarks. This time, Transport Minister M.R. Vijayabhaskar made certain allegations, to which the DMK objected, arguing that such allegations can be made only with proof. Mr. Dhanapal said he had given proof in the morning, but the DMK insisted that Mr. Balaji must be given the proof to respond. As the arguments got heated up yet again, the Speaker decided to expunge the debate yet again, recording only the proof submitted to him.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/following-war-of-words-remarks-by-cm-mlas-expunged-in-assembly/article31103365.ece
212,2020/03/19,"Coronavirus | Thousands defy health advisory, stage anti-CAA protest across Tamil Nadu","TNTJ cadre take to the streets across the State, but give up ‘fill the jails’ initiative

Despite the State government’s appeal to the people to stay at home to contain the spread of COVID-19, the cadre of the Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamath took to the streets in their thousands on Wednesday to participate in a pan-Tamil Nadu agitation to demand the withdrawal of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Population Register and the National Register of Citizens.

A day earlier, the Shaheen Bagh-style protests at Old Washermenpet were suspended as a precautionary measure.

While thousands took part in street protests, a ‘fill the jails’ initiative was given up in the wake of a public health advisory urging the people to avoid large gatherings. The TNTJ’s decision to risk a COVID-19 outbreak by mobilising thousands across Tamil Nadu drew sharp criticism from various quarters, including sympathisers.

When asked why the TNTJ pressed ahead with the protests, Abdur Rahman, a spokesperson for the organisation, said, “When we announced it (after meeting the Chief Secretary on Saturday), the situation was not this serious. We understand the urgency of the issue. We went ahead with the protests since these steps were only considered precautionary. We decided to scale down our protests once the situation became serious.”

Mr. Rahman added that the TNTJ did not want the protest, which was being organised to safeguard the rights of Indians, to end up affecting the larger society.

“We reduced the duration of the protest to just one hour and also didn’t push for our arrests after the police told us that lodging us in a marriage hall was not feasible due to the coronavirus scare.

213,2020/03/19,Court shocked over lack of funds for treating rare diseases,"‘Can’t let people die just because there’s no hope of recovery’

The Madras High Court has expressed dismay over the delay on the part of the Centre in finalising the National Policy on Treatment of Rare Diseases and the reluctance of the State government to allocate funds for treatment of rare diseases on the perception that treatment could only prolong longevity of patients and not cure them permanently.

Passing orders on a public interest litigation petition by Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSD) Support Society, a Bench, led by Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi, said: “We may put on record that such a perception need not deter the government from proceeding further as we are of the firm opinion that it is difficult to exactly predict the expiry of anything in this world.

“In the hope that a person cannot be treated, one should not forget that hope itself, at times, brings about miracles and therefore, it is the duty of every responsible citizen, more so that of a welfare State, not to lose faith or hope and continue to provide whatever assistance is possible within the means available. The perception, therefore, need not detain the government.”

The Bench, also comprising Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, pointed out that the PIL petition filed by LSD (a group of 50 genetically inherited and potentially fatal disorders) Support Society, seeking funds for treatment, had been pending in the High Court for the last three years and before Chief Justice Sahi himself for the last three months.

National emergency

In his first order interim order passed on January 6, the Chief Justice hoped that the Centre as well as the State government shall consider provision of funds for treatment of rare diseases as nothing less than a “national emergency.” He also granted time till February 10 for the governments to come up with a concrete decision on allocation.

However, nothing fruitful transpired and hence the governments were given further time till March 2. Still, it was reported that the national policy was yet to be notified and that the State government was awaiting the notification. On his part, V. Ramesh, counsel for petitioner society, said other High Courts in the country too had taken serious note of the issue.

He said certain budgetary allocations made for expenditure on health in the neighbouring States had gone unutilised. After recording his submission, Chief Justice Sahi said: “It is quite possible that such a situation may be or may not be in the State of Tamil Nadu for which the learned Advocate General will call upon the government to inform the court about the same.”

His Bench also directed the Centre to allocate forthwith ₹ 4.40 crore for treatment of 11 LSD patients, who required around ₹ 40 lakh each per year for the treatment in Tamil Nadu and ordered the State government too to immediately release at least ₹ 5 crore to meet the expenses of those suffering from rare diseases in the State.

The High Court Registry was directed the list the case next on June 9 and hoped that by then, the national policy on treatment of rare diseases would have been put in place.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/court-shocked-over-lack-of-funds-for-treating-rare-diseases/article31103321.ece
214,2020/03/19,"Coronavirus | Drug combination in the works, says T.N. Health Minister","Everyone will be safe when the good news is out, says Vijayabaskar

Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar on Wednesday told the Assembly that doctors in Tamil Nadu were trying a drug-combination to treat patients affected by COVID-19, and expressed the hope that “everyone will be safe when the good news is out”.

“The research activities involve medicines used in the treatment of other viral diseases and other medicines. I don’t want to reveal the names of the medicines, keeping medical ethics in mind. We are trying the combination on those who have come from other States and those who are ready for the trial,” he said while responding to Opposition leader M.K. Stalin, who referred to reports that medicines were available in Rajasthan and the U.S.

The Minister said that when the doctors told him about the drug combination, he fixed a meeting of government doctors and experts of the King Institute.

Pointing out that the doctors had already successfully treated a patient, Mr. Vijayabaskar said there was no drug of choice, and doctors were providing “supportive and symptomatic treatment”.

Recalling the meeting he had with a youth at the Rajiv Gandhi Government Medical College Hospital, who had come there to get tested for COVID-19 because the multinational company for which he was working had insisted on a certificate though he had no symptoms, Mr. Vijayabaskar said samples should be taken only if a persons manifested symptoms.

When DMK member K. Ponmudi asked about the possibility of granting permission to private hospitals to conduct testing for COVID-19, the Minister said the Christian Medical College in Vellore and Apollo Hospitals in Chennai had already applied for the same, and the government had also made a recommendation for them.

“But the approval should be given only by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). In a few days, we will get the testing facilities in private and corporate hospitals, and the government will fix the rate,” the Health Minister said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/q6geee/article31103316.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19DMKSTALINHEALTHCORONAVIRUSTHERMALHANDSANITIZE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/coronavirus-drug-combination-in-the-works-says-tn-health-minister/article31103317.ece
215,2020/03/19,HC grants permission for anti-CAA meet after threat of COVID-19 subsides,"Court comes down hard on police for discouraging dissent

Justice G.R. Swaminathan of the Madras High Court on Wednesday quashed an order passed by Tiruchi district police on March 4 denying permission for an anti-CAA public meet. However, the judge refrained from permitting the meet on Friday due to a government imposed ban on congregations till March 31 to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

“The jurisdictional Deputy Superintendent of Police shall issue proceedings permitting holding of the event at Kadaiveethi in Enamkulathur of Tiruchi district immediately after the ban issued by the government in the wake of Novel Coronavirus outbreak pandemic is lifted,” the judge ordered while allowing a petition filed by Sunnathaval Jamath Jumma Periya Pallivasal.

Disagreeing with the rejection of permission for the public meet on grounds of possible disturbance to law and order, the judge said, since the police invariably deny permission for such anti-CAA meets across the State, their attention must be drawn to the Justice P.D. Desai Memorial Lecture delivered by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud of the Supreme Court last month.

In that lecture, the apex court judge had said: “A state committed to the rule of law ensures that the State apparatus is not employed to curb legitimate and peaceful protest but to create spaces conducive for deliberation… The blanket labelling of such dissent as ‘anti-national’ or ‘anti-democratic’ strikes at the heart of our commitment to the protection of constitutional values.

“Protecting dissent is but a reminder that while democratically elected governments offer us a legitimate tool for development and social co-ordination, they can never claim a monopoly over the values and identities that define our plural society.” Stating that there was a reason for him quoting the lecture, Justice Swaminathan said, it was not as if officials alone discourage dissent.

He went on to state: “Recently, in the 43rd book fair organized by The Book Sellers’ and Publishers’ Association of South India (BAPASI) in Chennai early this year, a publisher was evicted from his rental stall. The eviction notice read that the action was on account of the allottee selling a book against the government. (The Hindu dated 13.01.2020).

“I can understand prohibition of sales of banned and pirated books and CDs. But to say that books that are critical of the government cannot be sold or displayed in a book fair is absurd. BAPASI is not before me and I do not know if really there is such an allotment condition. I have no doubt whatsoever in my mind that even if such a condition has been incorporated in the allotment order, the same is unconstitutional.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-grants-permission-for-anti-caa-meet-after-threat-of-covid-19-subsides/article31103222.ece

Responding to DMK member Thangam Thennarasu, who complained that even the MLAs were not informed about the work being undertaken in their constituencies, the Chief Minister said the legislator would have been aware of the same had he visited his constituency. To this, Mr. Thennarasu said, “Had I not visited my constituency, the people would not have elected me for the fourth time.”

The CM said tenders were not used for projects under the Kudimaramathu scheme. Instead, the works were awarded to farmers and their associations. “Rainwater will be effectively harvested when all the 14,000 lakes are desilted. The lakes will supply water for drinking and irrigation purposes,” he said.

To the MLA’s claim that many works couldn’t be completed due to the government’s failure to acquire land, the Chief Minister said the projects were started only after acquiring 80% of the land required.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/1364-kudimaramathu-projects-this-year/article31103213.ece

Three more COVID-19 positive cases were reported in Telangana on Thursday. This takes the total number of cases in the State to 16, including the index (first ) case who was discharged last week after recovering completely.

The 14th patient is a man who travelled from Dubai to Hyderabad on March 14. On developing virus symptoms on March 17, he was isolated at a government hospital and samples were collected. The person tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday.

The people he came into contact with him were traced and placed under home quarantine. The Health department is waiting for details of passengers in the flight he took.

223,2020/03/19,COVID-19 adds to the woes of jailbirds,"Mulakats cancelled for convicts and undertrials as precautionary measure

As such, social distancing is a harsh reality for jailbirds. But the COVID-19 has ended, at least temporarily, whatever connection the jail inmates were allowed to have with their families.

Since the advent of human rights and rights of prisoners, the physical well being of convicts and undertrial prisoners has become top most priority for jail managements, notwithstanding the occasional custodial death or death of a prisoner. As part of their rights, the inmates are allowed to meet their near and dear ones during the daily ‘mulakat’ session.

Given the scare of COVID-19, the government has suspended the mulakat provision unless it is necessary. The undertrial prisoners are also not required to be produced in courts as the latter have suspended routine work and taking up cases which need urgent attention.

“We stopped mulakats starting March 17 to keep the inmates for their own safety. Foolproof safety from the virus is also ensured as we are insisting on screening and sanitising everybody who needs to go out or come in unavoidably,” divulged Deputy Jail Superintendent of Adilabad District Jail Roopani Shobhan Babu as he talked of the measures taken to keep the 150 inmates ‘safe’ from the deadly virus.

Everyday, about 25 to 30 mulakat slots were made available by jail authorities to relatives. It meant some 50 people used to visit the undertrial or convict inmates.

“We are allowing only those who ‘must’ meet an inmate. The risk is being done away with screening and sanitation of such people,” the jail official added.

The inmates also tend vegetable farms within the jail premises. Mr. Shobhan Babu pointed out that the farms are located within the restricted four walls of the jail and hence there was no issue of virus contamination.

While Adilabad district jail is the only such detention centre in the district there are three sub-jails at Nirmal, Luxettipet and Asifabad where also the district jail kind of social distancing has begun. The one at Asifabad has 40 to 50 inmates while the sub-jail at Nirmal houses 30 to 40 and the one at Luxettipet accommodates 20 to 30 undertrial prisoners and convicts at present.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hdxnx7/article31111292.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY20ADB-JAIL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/covid-19-adds-to-the-woes-of-jailbirds/article31111293.ece

The Telangana Congress has demanded the government to ensure that the loan waiver was applied to farmers who are yet to get their new passbooks.

In a statement here, All India Kisan Congress vice president M. Kodanda Reddy said that the guidelines issued by the government were not clear about the farmers who are yet to get their new passbooks. The benefit should be extended to all the farmers who have land but don’t have the passbooks.

He said in the last term of the TRS government the loan waiver benefit did not reach the farmers as the banks collected the interest amount after the government paid in four instalments.

Given the past experience, the government should give a guarantee to the bankers on behalf of the farmers so that the benefit actually reached them.

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has said that he will request Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the video conference with the chief ministers on Friday, to ban all international flights immediately.

Addressing a media conference, Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao said so far 1,165 people were quarantined in Hyderabad and those who requested to be sent home too would be under government’s medical supervision. Initially, those who came from seven countries and later 11 countries were quarantined but now the virus had spread to 161 countries. Thus, every one coming from overseas would be quarantined, he said.

He said there were six screening centres in the State and they would also request the Prime Minister to let the State use the facility at the CCMB.

Ruling out that the State was not imposing prohibitory orders under Section 144 to prevent gathering of people, he said he expected people to voluntarily refrain from gathering in groups and adhere to safety and preventive measures and cooperate with the government to keep the State safe from onslaught of COVID -19.

The government was not in favour of shut down and bring the State to a standstill. They would let various sectors function but emphasis would be on measures to be taken by people to check spread of virus.

228,2020/03/19,CM announces more curbs to check COVID- 19,"18 check posts to be set up to identify overseas travellers

Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao has announced some more regulatory measures across the State in the wake of incident in Karimnagar when some preachers from Indonesia who interacted with people there tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday.

The Chief Minister, who held an emergency meeting with District Collectors and Superintendents of Police addressed a media conference at Pragathi Bhavan here on Thursday evening, said the Karimnagar incident made it imperative to put in more regulations.

He said of the 14 COVID-19 positive cases in Telangana so far, five of them landed at Shamshabad International Airport and rest came to the city by road and other means of transport from other parts of the country. The preachers who went to Ramagundam were now under the surveillance of doctors.

The District Collectors and SPs have been instructed to identify every one in their respective districts who came from abroad after March 1 and conduct medical tests and subject them to house quarantine under the supervision of DMHO at the district level. Village secretaries, mandal and municipal officers through Gram Sabhas would identify such persons and inform the medical and health officials. He also called upon people to report such persons who came from overseas after March 1 and persons who returned from foreign countries should voluntarily disclose such information and cooperate with the government.

The State shared borders with Maharashtra, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh and as people would enter the State through various means of transport, 18 check posts would be set up to identify those who came from overseas.

If strict measures were adopted by everyone, the State would be safe, he asserted and cited the example of Taiwan, neighbour of China which took strict measures and prevented the virus from spreading. On the other hand Italy and Iran were the worst affected as they were negligent.

He announced that cinema halls, function halls, bars, pubs, clubs, amusement parks, swimming pools, gyms, indoor and outdoor stadia, zoo parks and museum would remain closed till March 31. They were earlier closed for one week. All educational institutions and coaching centres, summer camps would remain closed till March 31. Permissions would not be given for public meetings, conferences, seminars, exhibitions, trade fairs and cultural events.

The Chief Minister, however, said SSC examinations being held at 2,500 centres would continue where 5 lakh students were appearing. The decision was taken to continue the exams as 90% of the students and parents were in favour but instructions were given to conduct the exams in a highly sanitised environment. At every SSC centre, tables would be thoroughly cleaned.

Malls, super markets and other shops would function normally but they should ensure that there would be no crowding. The situation would be reviewed next month.

No Srirama Navami feast

KCR said the best protection against virus was avoiding public gatherings and announced there would be no gathering for Panchanga Shravanam on March 25 and the event would only be through live telecast and Sriranma Navami celebrations too would stand cancelled. The Muslim religious leaders also agreed not to conduct the ‘Jag ne ki Raat’ on March 22 to avoid public gatherings.

231,2020/03/19,DGP office staff to attend duties on rotation basis,"Staff not attending office are to be available ‘on call’

In wake of COVID-19 outbreak, Director General of Police M. Mahender Reddy asked the ministerial staff at State Police Headquarters to work on alternative working days on a rotation basis to ensure that contact among individuals is minimised to the extent possible.

In the instructions issued on Thursday, he said that all the staff belonging to the category of senior assistant and below, including outsourcing staff and home guards, who are attached to sections have to attend office on alternative working days.

Each section superintendent has been instructed to make arrangements to divide the staff working in their respective sections into two groups and to assign alternate days of their attendance in the office so that work in the sections is not disturbed.

Single digit

Those who attended the office should look after the work in their section irrespective of the seat. If the strength of the section is limited to a single digit, no alternative arrangements are necessary and they should attend the office daily on the working days.

It is specifically informed that the alternate attendance to the office cannot be construed as a holiday. As it is treated as a working day only, each of the staff members should be available at their respective residences and should respond to the calls from the office. If necessary they should come to the office in person on being intimated from the office. It is an ‘on-duty and on-call’ arrangement.

Spreading infection

As it is an arrangement made on the lines of ‘work from home’ no employee should leave headquarters or make themselves unreachable, like switching off phones or refusing or delaying to come to office if called for.

In case, if any employee develops fever, cough, body pains, they may immediately report the matter to DSP (Stores) so that precautions can be taken to prevent the infection of others. Mr. Reddy said that the instructions shall come in to effect from Friday and will be in operation till further orders.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/z9uwcg/article31110665.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY20DGP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/dgp-office-staff-to-attend-duties-on-rotation-basis/article31110666.ece
232,2020/03/19,PIL plea to defer SSC exams,"Proper measures not in place at the exam centres, says petitioner

A PIL petition seeking deferment of SSC annual exams, which had begun on Thursday in the State, in the backdrop of rising number of COVID-19 cases was filed in Telangana High Court.

Faculty member in a private educational institute M. Bala Krishna requested the HC to declare conducting the SSC exams by the authorities as illegal and arbitrary. He asked the court to pass interim direction to postpone the exams since the COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and taking into consideration the advisories issued by the Centre.

Already, the Central boards of ICSE and CBSE had postponed their exams following advisories from the Health Department. The petitioner maintained that on one hand the Telangana government declared holidays for educational institutions but on the other was conducting SSC exams for which thousands of students would be appearing.

Normally, examination halls and rooms would be cramped. It would be difficult for the organisers to maintain the mandatory one metre gap between two persons (in this case students writing exams) to avoid contacting coronavirus, the petitioner contended. Considerable number of the students would be using public transport mode like buses to reach examination halls.

Since the SSC exams are the stepping stones for future, no student showing symptoms of COVID-19 would desist from appearing the exam. This would only contribute to the possible spread of coronavirus, the petitioner said. He maintained that he personally visited some exam centres only to realise that sufficient safeguards and precautions were not taken by the authorities.

The mandatory wearing of masks by the students and invigilators and providing sanitisers at the exam centres was not being followed strictly, the petitioner said. No thermal screening arrangements were made at the exam halls. An inspection by the HC would reveal the inadequate arrangements, he stated.

He sought a direction to the authorities to ensure wearing of masks was followed and thermal screening was done at the exam centres.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/xpr37w/article31111230.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY20SSC-KRN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/pil-plea-to-defer-ssc-exams/article31110538.ece
233,2020/03/19,No plans for staggered working of govt. staff yet,"State unlikely to follow Centre’s move to regulate working hours of staff

The State government is unlikely to regulate or stagger the functioning of the government staff at least for the time being.

Asked whether there was any proposal before the government to allow work from home option for the staff on the lines of the Central government, a senior official replied in the negative. The government, it is learnt, is yet to give serious consideration to the issue as the incidence of COVID-19 was marginal in the State with 14 cases being reported and all these cases were related to “outsiders”, not residents of the State.

The development comes at a time when the Director General of Police had instructed the officials concerned to take steps to ensure alternative working days for the staff on rotation basis so that physical contact among the individuals is minimised to the extent possible. The Department of Personnel and Training of the Central government had instructed the heads of departments of the Central government to ensure that 50% of the Group B and C employees attend office every day and the remaining 50% should be instructed to work from home as part of containing the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

Favouring alternate weeks working for the Group B and C employees, the DoPT said working hours for the staff should also be staggered. The officials who are working from home on a particular day as per the roster drawn up should be available on telephone and electronic means of communication at all times. They should attend office if called for any exigency of work, the DoPT said in its advisory.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/no-plans-for-staggered-working-of-govt-staff-yet/article31110352.ece

236,2020/03/19,Indonesians visited several mosques during their stay two-day stay in Karimnagar,"The 10 Indonesians who camped in Karimnagar town for two days before being isolated after suspected COVID-19 infection had visited several mosques and madrasas in various parts of Karimnagar town on March 14 and 15. They also participated in preaching with the support of a guide and translators.

First, the Karimnagar Commissionerate of Police had shifted the Indonesians to the Government Hospital’s isolation ward in Karimnagar town on March 16 and later to Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad. After tests on March 17, it was confirmed that one of them had tested positive. On Wednesday (March 18), seven other Indonesians tested positive.

Eight persons shifted to Gandhi Hospital

Medical teams, with the support of local police immediately shifted around eight persons from Mukarampura locality, including a special branch police constable to Gandhi Hospital on Wednesday night following their close movement with the foreigners during their two-day stay.

Following the spurt of the virus in Mukarampura area where the Indonesians stayed in a mosque, the police swung into action and began collecting information pertaining to their visits to various locations in the town. During preliminary inquiries it was found that the Indonesians have split into groups and visited mosques in Salehnagar (Rekurthi), Hussainpura, Khanpura and Kharkhanagadda, and madrasas. They also conducted prayers and delivered speeches.

Visitors toured several locations

Besides, the Indonesians were provided accommodation in a private guest house in Bahupeta village on the outskirts of Karimnagar town. Police officials were shocked to find the Indonesians touring several locations in the town with the support of locals.

Police officials said they had taken measures and quarantined some of the people according to their own convenience to avoid the virus spreading. “In the wake of the seriousness of the spurt of the virus, we cannot disclose some of the initiatives taken up jointly by the police and revenue officials. We are quarantining the suspected persons in their homes,” they maintained.

Sources also said they were analysing the CCTV footage to track the movement of the Indonesians in various parts of the town, and the locals, who moved with them.

239,2020/03/19,Collector reviews COVID-19 readiness,"Three booked for spreading false information about the virus outbreak

Collector R.V. Karnan on Wednesday reviewed the preventive and surveillance measures to curb the spread of coronavirus (COVID 19) in the district.

Though no positive case of coronavirus has been reported from anywhere in the district so far, the district administration laid paramount focus on preventive measures to keep the highly contagious disease at bay.

Mr. Karnan visited the isolation ward at the District Headquarters Hospital here on Wednesday afternoon and took stock of the preparedness to deal with any exigency.

The officials of the Medical and Health Department apprised him of the infection prevention and disease surveillance measures being implemented in the district.

Various aspects of strengthening community level surveillance on those arriving in the district from coronavirus-hit countries and strict implementation of guidelines pertaining to ‘self-quarantine’ were reportedly discussed.

Meanwhile, Manuguru police have invoked Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act 2005 against three persons, including administrator of a WhatsApp group, for circulating fake news about COVID-19. The three are on the run.

“Acting on a complaint lodged by a doctor of a Manuguru-based private hospital, we have booked the admin of a WhatsApp group and two others on Tuesday for circulating fake news and spreading rumours that the complainant and several other staffers of his hospital contracted coronavirus, said Shukoor, Circle Inspector of Manuguru police.

240,2020/03/19,Action sought against ex-Karimnagar Municipal Commissioner,"Former Mayor levels allegations of corruption against Venugopal Reddy

Former Mayor and TRS corporator S. Ravinder Singh, on Wednesday, demanded the State government to suspend and take disciplinary action against former Municipal Commissioner G. Venugopal Reddy for “irregularities and flouting norms” during his seven-month stint in Karimnagar.

During the first general body meeting of the newly-elected Municipal Corporation of Karimnagar (MCK) to discuss the budget for the year 2020-2021 on Wednesday, Mr. Singh sought permission to discuss the charges of corruption and irregularities by the former Commissioner, under supplementary agenda in the meeting.

He said that Mr. Venugopal Reddy had brought disrepute to the MCK and was responsible for delay in the conduct of municipal elections by two days.

The High Court and Election Commissioner had also instructed the government to take stern action against the errant officer.

But, the district authorities had surrendered DCP Purushotham and revenue officer Ramulu and saved Mr. Venugopal Reddy, he charged.

The former Mayor also found fault with the MCK authorities for non-allocation of funds for SCs and STs in the budget.

“Though it is mandatory to allocate 15% funds for SCs and 7% for STs, the MCK had not allocated a single paise for their welfare and upliftment,” he stated.

He also criticised the MCK for allocating only ₹20 lakh in the budget for implementation of the ambitious Anthima yatra (last journey) programme.

He also flayed the MCK authorities for supplying packaged bottled water to members at the general body meeting when the government was encouraging people to consume Mission Bhagiratha water.

He ridiculed the MCK authorities for wastage of funds to buy bottled water and sending the wrong message to the people of the town on Mission Bhagiratha water.

242,2020/03/19,IIT-H researchers make their own hand sanitiser,"‘Purely done to support the community; have not thought of commercialisation’

Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H) have developed their own hand sanitiser, in line with the standards recommended by World Health Organisation (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC), a Federal Health Agency in the U.S, for the institute community.

Around 10 litres of the hand sanitiser have already been made available on campus for students, staff and faculty at locations such as faculty lounge, Shiru Café, meeting halls and laboratories, among other areas.

The sanitiser was developed by Shivakalyani Adepu, a research scholar at the Department of Materials Science and Metallurgical Engineering, IIT-H, along with Mudrika Khandelwal, associate professor, Department of Materials Science and Metallurgical Engineering.

Speaking about their effort, Ms. Khandelwal said: “My research group has always believed in doing scientific research and outreach for the benefit of society. This is our small contribution in the time of need. I am glad we would make this happen and hope to make similar contributions in future”.

The composition of this hand sanitiser is 70% isopropanol with glycerol and polypropylene glycol to increase the viscosity and reduce the volatility so that the sanitiser stays on skin to allow action, as well as lemongrass oil for antimicrobial activity and therapeutic aroma. The 70% IPA solution penetrates the cell wall, coagulates all proteins, and kills the micro-organism.

Ms. Adepu, who completed her PhD last month, said: “This was done purely to support the community at a time when it is critical to adopt safe and hygienic practices. We have not thought of commercialisation. Our motto is to help people around us. We can assure that these are as safe as any commercial sanitiser and possibly more effective. Our laboratory conducts a lot of microbiological studies and we have tested these kinds of materials before and have been using the same for several years now. Its efficacy is well known and has been reported”.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/rrbdlh/article31102614.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18-IITH-SANITISER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/iit-h-researchers-make-their-own-hand-sanitiser/article31102602.ece
243,2020/03/19,"Self-help apps to be treated as ‘fake news’, developers may be booked","Downloading an app sent through APK files could compromise safety of phone

At a time when panic over the coronavirus scare has gripped the world, smartphone ‘self-help’ apps claiming to analyse COVID-19 symptoms have started to surface in the city.

While it appears that Google Play Store has blocked any ‘COVID-19’ or ‘coronavirus’ related searches, those who have developed such apps appear to have found a workaround. They are using the APK files which have been shared on social media.

Workaround

An APK file unpacks an app in the Android ecosystem, thus enabling a download. Sending these files over social media or internet-powered messaging apps allows the receiver to download the app by simply tapping on the APK. Such files can be accessed by means of links as well.

However, downloading an app sent through APK files could be risky. They might compromise the safety of the phone and also its user. “Play Store has strong checks and balances in place. The biggest problem is that APK files shared on social media can contain spyware. After downloading the app using the APK file, the user may not even know that his or her phone has been compromised. I saw one such coronavirus self-diagnosis tool on a website. It is best to stay away, unless it is ratified by a competent authority,” Syed Zain, a data scientist, said.

Apart from the risk of compromising the phone, such apps may land developers in trouble with the law enforcement agencies. Speaking to The Hindu, IT Principal Secretary Jayesh Ranjan said that these apps will be treated ‘fake news’ and ‘misleading’.

“The government has not released such apps and no certification has been given. The authority on coronavirus in India is the Indian Council of Medical Research. The Prime Minister has announced on MyGov.in that if any solutions are available, they be shared. Till the time a tech solution is finalised and announced, these apps will be considered as fake news and misleading,” Mr Ranjan said.

Police action

Meanwhile, Cyberabad Police Commissioner V.C. Sajjanar, who is also the nodal officer dealing with coronavirus panic, said that strict action would be initiated against persons developing and sharing such apps. “If we get a complaint, we will book cases against such people,” he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/self-help-apps-to-be-treated-as-fake-news-developers-may-be-booked/article31102577.ece

245,2020/03/19,In the world of imaginary realism,"Artist Raghu Vyas on how he combines the elements of Basholi School of Art with the techniques of Italian Renaissance Art

Raghu Vyas is not just adept at painting different forms and contours but also suffusing them with palpable energy which is palpable. Besides being pleasing to the eye, they make viewers reflect on their backstories. This is evident at his ongoing solo show, “Melange: The Art Of Raghu Vyas”, at Shridharani Art Gallery. Twenty of his works, dealing with diverse themes such as Lord Krishna, Buddha, divinity, Venus, Sikh history, are on display.

Stepping into the gallery, a huge six feet by nine feet work canvas, catches the eye. Called “Celebration”, it depicts Lord Krishna’s return to Dwarka after the victory of Mahabharata. “Enigmatic Shiva”, shows the lord in a meditative posture, and the touching “Guru Nanak Dev at carpenter Lallo’s house”, displays the Guru reaching out to common people.

In an interaction, the seasoned artist talks about how he became an artist, his style, and how Krishna inspires him.

Edited excerpts:

“Guru Nanak Dev at carpenter Lallo's house”

What made you chose art as a profession?

As a child growing up in Basholi, Jammu and Kashmir, I always admired miniature paintings from the Basholi School of Art. In my school days, I showed a passion for drawing real objects on paper and was drawn towards figurative forms and nature from the very beginning. Over time, the decision to become an artist became really strong. Though self-taught, I am greatly inspired by Raja Ravi Varma’s paintings and European masters like Rembrandt, Raphael, Rubens, and Botticelli. I learnt my technique by visiting and working under different realist artists following the Renaissance technique.

How did you combine Basholi miniature art and Renaissance-style contemporary imaginary realism?

My art is rooted in Basholi School as is evident by the fine detailing in my works. This is visible in the clothes, hair, jewellery, etc shown in the paintings, and this can be seen in miniature paintings also. Also, my colour palette is inspired by miniature art as I use vibrant colours like gold, yellow, red, blue, orange, etc. Thus the “Vishnu Lakshmi”, “Yashodha Krishna”, and “Nav Durga” portray fine jewellery and these hues. The technique used to make these paintings reflects the Renaissance style. The use of light and shade and the depth in the work reflects this style. I use four layers of colours and plan a painting before I begin work on it through the mathematical calculation of the Golden Ratio. Finally, I call it imaginary realism because I visualise the subject in my mind, in my imagination.

The artwork “Celebration” highlights fine detailing, scale and craftsmanship…

This is about Krishna’s arrival at Dwarka after the victory in the Kurukshetra war. Realism art needs intricate detailing without which you can’t capture the expressions. Despite the fact that this is a huge work and the forms in it have been done in a miniature style, every character in it stands out. The body language, attire, expressions – everything is clearly visible.

The golden coloured entry gate shows sculptures of Ganesha and Devil’s head – to ward off the evil while the Garuda, Lord Vishnu’s mount, on the pillar, stands guard. The Golden Ratio gives the painting depth thus one sees distant buildings, and crowds celebrating Krishna’s return.

Lord Krishna is a recurring theme in your works…

Krishna has inspired me from my childhood as a God of love and compassion. The stories of Krishna leela are a major part of Basholi miniature art, and I am familiar with them since childhood. I find his life, deeds, playfulness and childlike innocence deeply stimulating; and this amply echoed in the works like “Yashoda Krishna”, “Shrine In The Cupboard”, “Krishna Balram” and others.

How does “Enigmatic Shiva”, highlight God’s varied facets?

Shiva is the creator and destroyer. This painting has Shiva in the foreground as the omnipresent being while the background reflects modern buildings of Banaras and the Kingdom of Ravana, which has gone underwater. So there is both destruction and regeneration. This work is about both change and hope, as seen through Shiva.

What made you choose Sikh Gurus as the subject of your paintings?

“Guru Nanak Dev at carpenter Lallo’s house” depicts Guru’s visit to the poor carpenter’s house where he sat with him and shared his food. The tools reflect Lallo’s profession while the dilapidated hut his poverty, and the Guru’s presence there shows how the Guru treated everybody as equal. The valour of Sikh Gurus has been always inspiring. The painting of Guru Gobind Singh came into being when I saw the replica of a 17th Century painting at Nanded gurdwara in Maharashtra.

What made you use celebrities for your paintings?

I have used Nicole Kidman and Sushmita Sen as models in “The Three Graces” and “Princess of Fantasy”, because viewers can identify them. Many European master-artists have used celebrity faces in the past. “The Three Graces” is about Beauty, Creativity, and Fertility and it has been done historically by classical artists like Raphael, Rubens, and Botticelli.

I find Nicole’s face apt for representing the three graces. Sushmita, reflecting love, affection and the grace and poise of a swan, is appropriate for the “Princess of Fantasy”.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/rfowkx/article31109808.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Celebration,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/in-the-world-of-imaginary-realism/article31109811.ece
246,2020/03/19,‘Social distancing fuels creativity’,"Guru Rewben Mashangva says his latest song captures the emotions of people affected by COVID-19

Social distancing may be challenging to practice for many, but leaning into solitude comes quite naturally to Guru Rewben Mashangva. The Manipur-based musician believes that periods of self-quarantine are “useful for artists to fuel their creativity”. At the same time, contemporary issues and connection with human experience remains at the heart of his improvisatory approach to folk music. Sifting through the newspaper headlines a few weeks back, he had composed a song on coronavirus.

“On the empty streets, of Wuhan,

Fear and despair roam,

Wearing the face of

Coronavirus today….

Heartache and pain, we’ve been through before,

Heartache and pain, you’ve been through before,”

Driving home the point that music must be in sync with our shifting world, he says, “The news headlines talk of people as statistics, the number of affected people in China, Italy, India, but what are the feelings people are going through? Music must talk about that,” he emphasises, moving to the refrain of the song: “China be strong, be strong Wuhan…”

The self-taught musician blends folk music of the Tangkhul Naga tribe with Blues to create a unique musical universe. He has played with bands and as a soloist he sings and plays several instruments.

Extended hours of solo practice mark most days for Mashangva. Yet, when it comes to musical interactions, he prefers unrehearsed jams with other fellow musicians. “I like the spontaneous chemistry that emerges when musicians get together. I don’t like rehearsing too much with others and being too fixed, we need to tune in to each other in the moment and improvise.” His music remains rooted in folk flavours, yet it flows with the sway of the times. “The mind is fleeting all the time, our thoughts change each day, each moment. Even if I perform the same song another day, it will have different influences. It’s a different song each day.”

Re-imagining sounds

As we delve deeper into the conversation, Mashangva dishes out the slide he uses with his guitar. It is unusual, and looks slightly different. His face lights up with a grin as I curiously handle the slide ring. “I made this myself,” he adds quietly, “from spare car parts.” I wait for him to explain while he chuckles with enthusiasm. This is one among many more musical parts and instruments that he crafts himself.

“Sometimes, I am unable to find in the existing instruments, the exact sound that I’m imagining in my mind. So, I begin searching for ways to create those sounds, sometimes that leads to playing new instruments, playing the same instruments differently, producing new dimensions or carving a new instrument entirely!”

The guitar is his constant companion as he sings, yet he also dabbles with the bamboo flutes, drums and a variety of horns. “My father used to play the trumpet,” he recounts, “and he was also a carpenter.” For him, passion for music and carpentry fuse into experimenting with old and new tones.

As a youngster, he got his first guitar from buffalo traders from Burma who were travelling through a nearby village in the 1970s. “I had this guitar with me for a long time but I didn’t know how to play it, there were no music teachers in the district.” He would strum the instrument fondly, hoping to learn complex techniques some day, while he listened and learnt many folk songs from the singers in the community.

Turning point

“In 1987, I composed a folk song with my brother,” Mashangva recalls with delight. This became a turning point in his musical journey as they attempted to sing the folk melody with the guitar.

“We didn’t know how to play the guitar properly, and people told us that the guitar didn’t suit folk music. But I remember this strong conviction that I wanted to fuse the two. I didn’t know how, but I could sense this was what I wanted to do!”

His resilience led to deeper explorations into Blues, country music, and other similar genres. A decade later, he was skilfully fusing forms, hailed as the ‘father of the Naga Blues’ and the ‘Bob Dylan of the Nagas’. He reminisces, “In 1992, I performed a Bob Dylan song at a community celebration. I couldn’t speak English fluently, but I got the lyrics, and added a folk touch.”

Back to roots

He knew he had hit upon a unique aesthetic. Rehearsing alone for hours on end, he melded Dylan songs with the traditional folk repertoire.

A few months later, performing to an audience of more than thousand people at a festival, he received a standing ovation. He had carved his niche.

“Sounds of nature really inspire me,” he shares as he belts out another composition he calls ‘The Cicada Song’.Inspired by the sounds of the crickets, the song thrives on catchy rhythms and gripping insect sounds. The lyrics, written by Mashangva himself, are alternately hilarious and philosophical. His voice is strikingly youthful and matches the exuberance on his face. “Each season sounds different, have you noticed? In winters grass has dried, in the spring the new leaves blow with the wind, in the rains the water trickles at different speeds, it’s all music.”

For the musician, his folk roots are the essence of his music. “There is so much more to explore and share from the treasure of folk music. I find the new experiments by young musicians very exciting. If they layer western influences with the wisdom and depth of folk music, it will give their music a different dimension,” he says.

For Mashangva, no conversation is complete without music. He picks up the guitar again, and asks me to tap along as he attempts to improvise a song out of our conversation.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/7mcbt7/article31109385.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Rewben-Mashangva-in-performancePhotograph-by-Anoop-Negi,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/social-distancing-fuels-creativity/article31109386.ece
247,2020/03/19,Fragrance of metaphors,"A flower could mean many things in the creative realm

The flower doubtlessly presents random bubbling of possibilities inspiring and recording the creative impulses of man. It is a powerful symbol of the ironical scale of eternity. Even in its ephemeral tangible form, it stands to sway in the breeze, hypnotising the human eye with its colour and fragrance. Amidst turbulence, the flower provides hope for the survival of human dignity.

Flowers carrying metaphoric implications feature in the Indian spiritual terrains, rituals, literature, paintings, dance, music, and poetry. Dr Sanghamitra Basu from the Indira Gandhi Centre for the Arts says, “The fragrance and colours materialise as paths of energies connecting the deity with the devotee.”

“Your garland falls on Krishna’s chest like white cranes on a dark cloud, Shining lightning over him, Radha, you rule in the climax of love. In woods on the wind-swept Jamuna bank, Krishna waits in wild flower garlands,” writes Jaidev in the “Gita Govinda”. The verse is painted, sang and danced. In the painted representation from Guler, an upright tree is entwined with a flowering creeper that suggests the manner the Sakhi/ friend implores Radha to go to Krishna.

In “Pushp ki Abhilasha” (The Desire of the Flower), Hindi poet Makhanlal Chaturvedi impacted by the freedom struggle pens the desire of a flower. “I do not want to be made into a necklace, or given as a gift to a lady, or thrown on a corpse. I want the gardener to throw me on the road where a soldier fighting for the motherland picks me.” “Chah Nahin Mai SurBala Ke Gehnon Mein Guntha Jaaon…. Mujhey Tod Lena Banmali, Us Path Par Tum Dena Phaink, Matra Bhoomi Per Sheesh Chadhaney, Jis Path Jaayen Veer Anek”

Classical singer Subhadra Desai sings Kumar Gandhrava’s composition, “Tesul ban Phoole rang chaaye, Bhavar Leit Firat Mad Bhare” (The black bumble bee flies listlessly intoxicated by the tesu flowers the Flame of the forest). “The composition in the late-night raga Bhageshree,” says Desai, “provides a frame to enact transcendence. The buzzing sound of the black bee explores in darkness the self while seeking dissolution in the sharp needle flame-coloured flowers. When singing, I aspire to capture the process of that dissolution.”

Bharatanatyam dancer Ragini Chandrashekhar

Says Bharatanatyam dancer Ragini Chandrashekhar, “I endeavour to bring out the essence of a flower defined by its texture, softness, colours, and shape. It is more for me a part of abhinaya. However, if I am required to define the flower in the rhythmic element, I would use patterns that are simple and flowing. My dance will seek to capture the flowing essence described in the Tamil word ‘nalinum’ meaning elegance. Our abhinaya repertoire is replete with the imagery of the lord’s eyes, feet, arms compared to flowers. I am fascinated when I show like – lotus-like face; it is not the open lotus but the layered half-opened lotus bud eyes. In Goswami Tulsidas’ famous “Shree Ram Chandra Kripalu Bhaju Mana” the second line is “NavaKanj Lochana Kanjamukh Kara Kanjapada Kanjaarunam” The Eyes of the lord are half-newly opened lotus. The half-open implies both the outward compassionate receptivity of the lord to the needs of his devotee coexisting with his introspection.”

Flowers are metaphors of dynamic flow in the movement in their fragrance, the shape of their petals, and the rays of their colours. They represent a cosmic clockwork of impermanence that leaves the permanence of inspired creativity emerging from their ephemeral existence.

Ethos of flowers

Pondering on the ethos of flowers in the Indian civilisational context, one recalls the writings of Roger Lipsey, the famous American art historian’s reference to three concepts. First, Thomas Merton presented a monk’s knowledge of painting which he called ‘Eyes for the Art’. Henry Corbin was inspired by Sufi concepts. As a scholar of Islamic religious history, he introduced two other concepts - 'eyes of flesh' and 'eyes of fire'.

The ‘flower’ in its tangible form communicates multiple sensations. Its outward reality of colour, softness, and fragrance of the flower awaken the ‘eyes of flesh’. Next, the functional journey of the flower proceeds to enact the process of ‘eye of fire’ where the outer form of the flower awakens inner energy.

Taking the three concepts – eyes of flesh, of fire and art, one can critique Alka Pande’s latest book “Flower Shower” (Niyogi Books). She aspires to explore a multi-layered trajectory of the ‘flower’ in the Indic topography. Her work refers to ideas, rituals, and creative expressions – in art, cuisine, textiles, sculpture, gardens and much more. The flower as ‘Nature’ is linked to gods and goddesses. “My work is based on the spirit of the idea of Pushp Varsha (showers of flowers). It seeks to capture the ehsas or the intrinsic Indian experience of aesthetics and beauty of the 'flower'. The book locates the symbol in arts and crafts and indirectly refers to the economic ecology related to flowers,” says Pande,

Symbol of dignity

The Indira Gandhi Memorial Tulip Garden in Srinagar, Kashmir, the largest Tulip Garden in Asia, will soon open for visitors. Tulip presents a fascinating history. Interestingly, in the seam of turbulent existence, the tulip symbolises human resilience and human dignity; for it stands amidst the Himalayan conflict zones of Afghanistan and Kashmir. The enigmatic flower carries an intriguing economic heritage from the Ottoman Empire to the Dutch Renaissance and is illustrative of the first major financial bubble. Presently, a visual phenomenon for flora-tourism, it is placed as a lucrative commodity.

The tulip features in the Persian tragic romance of Farhad and Shireen. The red tulips emerge from the drops of Farhad’s blood that appears after he commits suicide on learning of his beloved’s death. The flower stands for martyrdom and selfless love. The tragic story is retold by Georgians, Parsis, Afghans, Kurds and many other communities.

Tulip in conflict zones

The etymology of the three-petalled flower is ‘turban’. It is the national flower of Afghanistan where interestingly it is the black tulip that has gained contemporary relevance. Says Sonia Nassery Cole maker of the film “Black Tulip”, Afghanistan’s entry in the Best Foreign Language Film category in Academy Awards in 2011, “In North Afghanistan, there are fields of ‘black’ tulips. They represent the persona of an Afghan who, despite everything, is filled with pride, hope, and resilience.” There are two stories linked to the Afghan black tulip. Cole narrates, “A young Afghan boy bravely fought the Soviets. He was killed. His family found a black tulip tattooed on his chest. The flower is both delicate and resilient, the petal colour forms a permanent stain. It has become a ritual among Afghans to mark the body of martyrs with the black tulip flower. In the 1970s, during the Soviet occupation, the helicopters called Black Tulips were in-charge to pick the corpses of the Soviet soldiers lying in the fields.”

According to botanist Aarti Saxena of the Delhi University, “Plants do not synthesise black pigments. The colours of the flowers are in the visible range of VIBGYOR. Flowers like the black rose or the tulip are actually closer to deep shades of blue or violet.” The artistic freedom expressed by Cole in the title ‘Black Tulip’ communicates a strong emotive metaphor which perhaps other colours would not.

Despite the politically contentious situation in Kashmir, the spring has arrived and the tulips are set to bloom. A few years back one met young Samina walking the brilliant flower fields of the Srinagar Garden, while her father back home was embroidering shawls. “He will get 1500 rupees for the entire shawl. I get more by taking some women tourists around the Tulip Garden,” said young Samina.

The garden provides an avenue of growth in the conflict-ridden region where jobs and shrinking agricultural land are important socio-economic issues. Even between the socio-political uncertainties, both in Afghanistan and Kashmir, the tulip could provide the potential for unique soft diplomacy of floral trade and floral cultural skills.

The Tulip gardens of Kashmir, the Netherlands and other countries present an idiom of coloured hope and nostalgia as one could recall the romantic Bollywood song, “Dekha yeh khwab toh yeh silsile huye” (The view of the blooming fields become the dream of elusive affairs).

The song was picturised in the Tulip gardens of Keukenhof, Netherlands alternated with the scenes from the misty landscape of Pahalgam, Kashmir. Tulips bloom in spring as windows to paradise. They stand upright, the single flower will not bend until the last leaf blows away. It reflects perfection, pride, and human dignity.

Poetic and mystical

In October, which completes two years this April, screen writer Juhi Chaturvedi effectively uses the shiuli flower (night flowering jasmine) as a metaphor for her vivacious female protagonist who falls off a hotel roof, and goes into a coma. The Shoojit Sircar film is about a relationship where one doesn’t seek anything in return. “When I was writing the film, I struggled a lot with the name of the female character. Once I named her Shiuli, everything fell in place. It became poetic and mystical as the flower itself,” says Juhi.

Growing up in Lucknow, the writer has a lot of memories of the short-lived harsingar flowers. “But you can’t name a character thus. So I opted for its Bangla name. “Like harshingar, Shiuli also has a short life. I insisted on using it on the poster as well,” recalls Juhi.

251,2020/03/19,Madhya Pradesh crisis | Supreme Court suggests Speaker interact with rebel MLAs via video conferencing,"The Speaker refused to accept the top court’s proposal; the court also asked the Speaker whether any inquiry was made on the resignation of the rebel MLAs and what decision has he taken on them.

The Supreme Court on Thursday suggested that Madhya Pradesh Assembly Speaker N.P. Prajapati should interact with the rebel Congress MLAs through video link or the court can appoint an observer to allay the fear that the Legislators are in captivity.

Rebels in Bengaluru speaking under duress, must be freed immediately: Madhya Pradesh Minister

The Speaker refused to accept the top court’s proposal. A Bench comprising Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta said it can create conditions to ensure that “exercise of volition” of the rebel MLAs is “truly voluntary”.

“We can appoint an observer to Bengaluru or some other place so that the rebel MLAs can connect with the Speaker through video conferencing after which he can decide,” the Bench said.

It also asked the Speaker whether any inquiry was made on the resignation of the rebel MLAs and what decision has he taken on them.

Senior advocate A.M. Singhvi, appearing for the Speaker, said the day court begins to give time-bound direction to the Speaker, it will be constitutionally problematic.

The counsel appearing for Governor Lalji Tandon told the Bench that Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath was “sitting aside” in the turn of events and it is the Speaker who is “leading the political battle” in court.

The Bench asked all the parties how does the decision of a Speaker in matters of resignation and disqualification of MLAs affect the floor test.

It said the constitutional principle that emerges is that there is no restraint on trust vote because of resignation or disqualification being pending before the Speaker. It said, therefore, the court will have to flip around and see whether the Governor acted beyond the powers vested in him.

During the hearing, the Bench said that if the government loses the majority when the Assembly was not in session, then Governor has the power to direct the Speaker to summon the Assembly.

“What happens when the Assembly prorogues and the government loses its majority, then the Governor can call the Assembly,” the Bench said.

Mr. Singhvi said the Governor has very limited power with regard to functioning of the Assembly and he can only summon, prorogue and dissolve the House, but he cannot intervene into the functioning of Assembly which falls under the purview of the Speaker. The Governor cannot ask the Speaker that you should do this, you should not do this, it is beyond his power, he said.

However, he added, the Governor has the right to summon the House but it cannot decide the functioning of the House.

254,2020/03/19,"Fire breaks out in Pune slum cluster, no casualties","40-50 fire-fighting personnel involved in dousing the blaze believed to have been caused by a cylinder explosion

A major fire broke out at the Wadarwadi slum cluster in the city’s Shivajinagar suburb area early on March 19, gutting around 20 shanties and causing significant material damage.

Authorities said there was no loss to life in the blaze which is believed to have been caused by a cylinder explosion sometime after 1.30 a.m.

“We received a call a little after 2 a.m. today that a big fire had broken out in the Wadarwadi slums. We rushed around 15 fire-fighting vehicles, including three tankers and three Quick Response Vehicles (QRV). Prima facie, the blaze appears to have been caused by a cylinder explosion,” said a fire department official.

Prashant Ranpise, the Pune Municipal Corporation’s chief fire officer, said that around 40-50 fire-fighting personnel were involved in dousing the blaze.

“It was a major fire and we had to spray water from four sides to get the blaze under control. We managed to quell the flames after an hour of fierce fire-fighting, after 3 a.m.,” he said.

In November 2018, a fire, which was caused due to a gas cylinder explosion, rapidly engulfed scores of tinderbox slum-houses in the city’s heavily crowded Patil Estate area.

255,2020/03/19,Manjhi’s meeting with Nitish fuels speculation in poll-bound Bihar,"Mr. Manjhi said that it was because of him that the RJD had won the Araria and Jehanabad bypolls

Former chief minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) (HAM(S)) leader Jitan Ram Manjhi’s meeting with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday night has fuelled speculation in poll-bound Bihar after Mr. Manjhi, on Wednesday, said that the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) being the big brother in the mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) ought to form a coordination committee by March 30 as otherwise he would “not be with the mahagathbandhan and mull forming a greater alliance with other parties”.

“The coordination committee in grand alliance must be formed by March 30 as other three alliance partners Congress, Rashtriya Lok Samata Party and Vikashil Insaan Party too have supported this,” Mr. Manjhi said, while addressing mediapersons in Patna.

“If it is not done HAM (S) will not move even a single step ahead in grand alliance and mull over formation of a greater alliance with other parties,” he cautioned. Mr. Manjhi has been demanding the creation of a coordination committee in the grand alliance since October 2019.

Also read: Jitan Ram Manjhi says party will go it alone in 2020 election

“When four partners demand the formation of a coordination committee why does the RJD alone not favour this,” asked Mr. Manjhi. “If our demand is not met, we — all the four allies and some other parties like CPI and Pappu Yadav’s Jan Adhikar Party (Loktantrik) — would form a greater alliance in the State” he declared. “I’ll also go to Delhi after this coronavirus scare and speak to BSP chief Mayawati and CPI-ML to include them in the greater alliance,” added Mr. Manjhi.

However, when asked about his meeting with Mr. Kumar on Tuesday, Mr. Manjhi said, “one should not read too much into the meeting”. “I’d gone to meet Nitish Kumar to invite him for the inauguration of a polytechnic institution for Scheduled Caste students in my village Mahkar in Gaya district, and to [ask that government] provide me special security which was withdrawn recently,” he asserted. “We’ll decide our future course after party’s rally in Patna on May 10,” the HAM (S) leader added.

RJD leader and party chief Lalu Prasad’s heir apparent Tejashwi Yadav, who on Wednesday postponed his ongoing berojgari hatao (remove unemployment) yatra till March 25 in view of the coronavirus epidemic, had earlier in the day dismissed Mr. Manjhi’s meeting with Mr. Kumar and said, “let Manjhi ji say whatever he wants to say… I cannot do anything on this but it was RJD who had made his son an MLC from its own party quota”. He also rhetorically wondered: “Moreover, how many seats were the NDA giving him in 2015 Assembly poll?”

Also read: Jitan Ram Manjhi accuses Tejashwi of showing ‘soft corner’ for NDA

At his press conference, Mr. Manjhi countered and said that it was because of him that the RJD had won the Araria and Jehanabad bypolls. “Lalu Prasad had called me up several times requesting me to join the mahagathbandhan,” he asserted. “They gave a ticket to my son for MLC in their own self-interest… Tejashwi knows nothing but Lalu Prasad knows everything well.”

Meanwhile, State Congress leader and party Rajya Sabha MP Akhilesh Prasad Singh said, “Manjhi ji is a mature politician and he will not go anywhere… he will remain with us”. And RLSP leader Madhav Anand said, “every one has his own interest and says things, but RLSP will remain with mahagathbandhan”.

The ruling JD(U) and BJP leaders, however, saw an opportunity to take a swipe at the opposition mahagathbandhan and said, “everything certainly is not well in there… let’s wait as before the Assembly polls mahagathbandhan will break away in parts”.

The Rajasthan government on Wednesday imposed prohibitory orders across the State, restricting assembly of people at public places till March 31, to contain the spread of COVID-19.

The decision was taken after three new COVID-19 positive cases were detected in Jhunjhunu district.

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot authorised the District Magistrates and Sub-Divisional Officers to issue orders under Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code to enforce the ban on gatherings.

Emergency meeting

Mr. Gehlot addressing an emergency review meeting here, said that public announcements on loudspeakers would be made urging people not to assemble in groups.

Returned from Italy

A couple and their three-year-old daughter, who returned from Italy to Jhunjhunu on March 8, tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday.

Mr. Gehlot gave instructions for clamping curfew in a one-km radius area around the family’s house for the next two days to check the spread of infection.

The three patients were taken to Sawai Man Singh Government Hospital in Jaipur for their treatment.

A rapid response team, accompanied by a representative of the World Health Organization (WHO), left for Jhunjhunu for surveillance to trace the people who came in contact with the family during the last 10 days.

The man, 33, his wife, 30, and their daughter were earlier placed under observation and admitted to the government hospital in Jhunjhunu on Tuesday where they showed symptoms of the virus.

Their samples were taken on Tuesday and sent to S.M.S. Hospital in Jaipur for testing.

New laboratories

Mr. Gehlot said new testing laboratories would be established in Jhunjhunu, Ajmer, Kota, Bharatpur and other towns and the capacity of diagnostic facility in Jaipur would be doubled.

258,2020/03/19,COVID-19: Tea body demands closure of estates,"Workers vulnerable as they don’t have safety gear such as masks, gloves

The Assam Tea Tribe Students’ Association (ATTSA) has demanded the closure of all estates till March 31 in view of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Apart from keeping the plantation workers indoors, the association has asked Labour and Tea Tribes’ Welfare Minister Sanjoy Kishan to ensure preventive measures for keeping COVID-19 away from the plantations.

The workers are referred to as ‘tea tribe’ though they are not among Assam’s Scheduled Tribes and prefer to be called Adivasis comprising 106 sub-groups. They comprise about 18% of Assam’s population of more than 3 crore with 1.1 lakh employed in 803 registered estates.

An unspecified number of Adivasis are employed in at least 65,000 small tea gardens, so classified for plantations covering 100 bighas (33.06 acres) or less.

“We are highly concerned about the grave threat to the tea garden workers. They pluck tea leaves within a distance of one foot and it will be risky for them if the virus attacks through infected people who have returned or are returning from jobs elsewhere in the country,” ATTSA president Dhiraj Gowala said.

He said the workers are vulnerable as they don’t have safety gear such as masks, gloves and sanitisers. “The government should shut down the tea gardens since schools, colleges and other public facilities have been closed till March 31.”

260,2020/03/19,Advisory to be issued on racist slur against people from northeast,"Some incidents due to cultural ignorance and lack of understanding, says Rijuju

Union Minister Kiren Rijiju said on Wednesday a strict advisory was in the process of being issued to all States amid incidents of people from the northeast facing racial slur as COVID-19 spreads.

Mr. Rijiju, who represents Arunachal Pradesh in the Lok Sabha, also said the issue was taken up with the North East division in the Ministry of Home Affairs.

“Some incidents of racial remarks against northeast people have emerged in some parts of India in the wake of #Coronavirus due to cultural ignorance, prejudice mindset & lack of understanding. Matter discussed with NE Division, MHA. Strict advisory is being issued to the States,” Mr. Rijiju tweeted.

On March 17, Arunachal (East) MP Tapir Gao had also raised the issue in the House. Raising the matter during the Zero Hour, he requested the government to issue an advisory to all the States to protect students from the northeast who were “facing discrimination to the extent of vacating them from the rented apartments”.

“It is like double coronavirus for students from the northeast….students are asked to vacate hostels and rented accommodation after being subjected to racial comments like dekho dekho ye coronawala aaya (look the corona people are here)…This is a conspiracy to cut off the northeast from the rest of India through racial discrimination,” the BJP MP said.

261,2020/03/19,"Remain in home isolation, Mamata tells people coming from abroad","An 18-year old student, who returned to Kolkata, tested positive

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on March 18 urged people returning from abroad to remain under home isolation and not to visit malls or parks where they can come in contact with others.

The remarks of the Chief Minister came in the context of the first positive case of COVID-19 was reported from the State late on Tuesday evening. An 18-year old student, son of a Home department official, returned to the city on Sunday and tested positive after 48 hours.

During the two days, the student was not under isolation and went to a State-run hospital before giving samples for testing. His mother attended office at the Secretariat on Tuesday where she is said to have interacted with several officials of the department.

Home Secretary, wife in self-quarantine

This development triggered panic in the Secretariat with not only the office of the bureaucrat being sanitised but also Home Secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay going into self-quarantine. He did not report to work during the day. His wife Sonali Chakravarty Banerjee, Vice-Chancellor of the Calcutta University, is also under home isolation.

“I request everyone who comes from abroad. Please do a test. You should isolate as per WHO guidelines. No VIP culture will be tolerated…[if] you are having symptoms and behaving irresponsibly, it’ll be highly irresponsible of you as you’ll infect thousands”, Ms. Banerjee said at an event at the Secretariat.

The incident created huge uproar in social media with many demanding a thorough probe. “I should be aware that I am coming from somewhere where the disease has spread, why should I not be responsible?” the Chief Minister said, referring to the incident. “Why will I not undergo the tests. Why will not isolate myself,” she said referring to the student testing positive.

Ms. Banerjee said so far 95,000 people had returned to Bengal after the crisis from foreign countries.

263,2020/03/19,NHRC notice to Assam govt. for relief to man assaulted for selling beef,"The National Human Rights Commission has issued a notice to the Assam government asking why a man assaulted almost a year ago for selling beef should not be paid ₹1 lakh as compensation.

The panel instructed the State’s Chief Secretary to reply within six weeks from March 12. It gave a similar deadline to the State’s Director General of Police to submit an action-taken report against the policemen found guilty of letting the assault happen.

Some youths had assaulted 68-year-old Shaukat Ali for selling beef in his restaurant at a weekly market in northeastern Assam’s Biswanath Chariali town. There were allegations that the police were mute spectators when the youths assaulted him on April 7, 2019.

MLA complaint

The NHRC had taken up the case after Congress MLA and leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Debabrata Saikia lodged a complaint on April 12, 2019, against the assault and the indifference of the police to pursue the case even after an FIR was registered.

Citing a report of the Biswanath district magistrate on September 14, 2019, the NHRC said some local unemployed youths were collecting tax from the vendors and shopkeepers in the market that had not been leased out for three consecutive financial years.

“The market is in Hindu-inhabited area and selling of beef hurts the religious sentiments of the local people and some youth thus insulted and disgraced Shaukat Ali,” the NHRC said.

The commission concluded that the youths were allowed to collect professional tax illegally while the assault on Mr. Ali violated the provisions of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993. It accordingly prescribed a compensation of ₹1 lakh to the victim of what it categorised as mob lynching and issued the show-cause notice to the State’s Chief Secretary.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nhrc-notice-to-assam-govt-for-relief-to-man-assaulted-for-selling-beef/article31103516.ece
264,2020/03/19,"CAA has made 6 lakh refugees forever stateless, says rights group","‘They are defined as illegal immigrants, shall remain liable for deportation’

A New Delhi-based rights group has said that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 has made about 6,00,000 refugees in India forever stateless and vulnerable to refoulement.

The CAA prescribes citizenship for six non-Muslim communities which took refuge in India from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan till 2014.

The 6,00,000 refugees who stand excluded from the Act comprise 3,04,269 Sri Lankan Tamils, 1,08,005 Tibetans, some 1,00,000 Chins from Myanmar, 40,000 Rohingyas from Myanmar and 39,619 others recognised by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the National Campaign Against Torture (NCAT) said on Wednesday.

“As any person who entered India without valid documents or overstayed after May 30, 2003, are defined as illegal immigrants under the Citizenship Act of 2003, they and their descendants are ineligible for Indian citizenship, and shall remain forever stateless and remain liable for deportation,” NCAT coordinator Suhas Chakma said.

He said this in reference to the Centre’s August 2010 statement in the Rajya Sabha regarding Tibetan refugees. “As the Union of India has no intention to repatriate any refugee except the Rohingyas, the Tibetan and Tamil refugees are destined to stay in India, forever, as stateless while the Chin refugees have mostly been assimilated in Mizoram,” Mr. Chakma said.

‘Refugees as pawns’

The NCAT claimed the Centre was using “false narratives” – as in the case of Baldev Kumar, a former lawmaker from Pakistan who took refuge in India in September 2019 – to defend the constitutionality of the CAA on “legally unsustainable grounds”.

“The provisions of the Citizenship Act cited in the case of asylum-seekers like Baldev Kumar prohibit the grant of Indian citizenship to an illegal migrant. Every persecuted religious minority from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan has neither come nor will come as a legal migrant, thereby negating the need for the CAA,” Mr. Chakma said. “The CAA has therefore been enacted for mala fide purposes,” he added.

The NCAT coordinator further said that the classification of persecuted refugees based on geopolitical considerations was illegal, inhumane and immoral and cannot be justified in the eyes of the law.

He asked the Centre to stop using “refugees as pawns” for its foreign policy, implement the apex court’s judgments on granting citizenship to Chakma and Hajong communities pending since 1996, and take measures to naturalise the identified 6 lakh refugees instead of pursuing the CAA for unidentified beneficiaries.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/caa-has-made-6-lakh-refugees-forever-stateless-says-rights-group/article31103492.ece

A day after declaring that government offices and city public transport would not be shut, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday issued directions to ensure only 50% attendance in all government offices.

This will however, not be applicable to Public Health, Medical Education and Drugs departments and to those working with disaster control mechanism.

Directions have also been issued to ensure that anyone with a “home quarantine” stamp remains in isolation for the safety of self and others. “In case found travelling outside, that person will be admitted to hospital forcefully,” the order said.

After a meeting on Wednesday with senior officials to chalk out strategy to reduce traffic and crowd to avoid the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19), Mr. Thackeray said, “It is important to control the crowds to reduce the spread of the disease. We have decided to implement several measures from Thursday.”

Restrictions have been imposed on buses, metro and local trains to ensure public transport runs with only 50% of its total carrying capacity. BEST buses in the city will not allow No standing commuters will be allowed on BEST buses and even sitting arrangement will be changed to maintain distance between individuals.

Attendance in government offices will be maintained at 50% with alternate working day for employees. “This will be applicable to all government offices in the State,” said an official who attended the meeting. No office will be permanently shut down, he added.

266,2020/03/19,‘Gurugram domestic workers being ignored’,"Union seeks expanded health facilities

The Gharelu Kamgar Union (GKU) has alleged that the district administration had ignored the security and health concerns of domestic workers in its efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19.

GKU convener Maya John, in a press statement, said there was a serious lack of adequate action by the district administration of Gurugram with respect to enforcing precautionary measures to ensure the virus containment.

“Though advisories on travel have been followed by closure of public institutions, domestic workers have been ignored and their security and health concerns discarded,” said the statement by the GKU.

“Domestic workers in Gurugram have been discussing the unfolding scenario in upscale housing societies and are extremely worried about the growing risk that they are compelled to take. The union points out the lack of any safety measures by the district administration in addressing the concerns of the scores of domestic workers whose nature of manual work in homes actually exposes them to high risk of picking up the infection,” said Dr. John.

She added that the workers were also wary of the fact that in many cases their employers had a history of foreign travel.

The GKU is thus pressing for some proper regulatory measures and expanded health facilities by the district administration that cater specifically to the scores of informal workers, said the press statement.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gurugram-domestic-workers-being-ignored/article31103308.ece
267,2020/03/19,Workers in Manesar labour under shadow of COVID-19,"Auto and garment workers at Industrial Model Township demand paid leave

Hurriedly finishing his lunch close to his workplace in the Industrial Model Township here on Wednesday, Ravi Kishan, 28, does not want to talk about COVID-19.

Working as a checker at Richa Global, a garments firm, Ravi said messages on social media and the news of deaths across the globe has frightened him out of his wits. “Not just me, but most of the workers here are living under fear. Not very far away from here, a company was apparently locked down two days ago after a suspected COVID-19 case was detected. I would prefer to go back home in Bihar, but I need to work as well to earn my living. I have little choice,” said Ravi, echoing the predominant sentiment of the workers class here.

The company’s record keeper Ajay said that only 280 operators (tailors) had reported back to work out of the 365, as many chose to stay back in view of the virus scare. Ajay said there were rumours of shut down, but there has been no confirmation. He, though, claimed that the company had taken several preventive measures such as installation of sanitisers, checking body temperature of the workers and distributing masks.

Mohammad Ali, 40, a worker, however, said masks were distributed only a day ago and were not of satisfactory quality.

Biometric attendance

Assistant Merchandiser, Richa and Company, Pradeep, said the workers travelled from across NCR, mostly taking public transport. “This makes me feel unsafe coming to work. The workers in our company still mark their attendance through biometrics,” he said.

Wasim, hailing from Bihar, said the workers were not subjected to body temperature check-ups, and the leave was not granted even in case of illness.

Working at Denso International India Private Limited, an auto parts company, Naresh Kumar said that around 20%-30% employees, mostly in management, in the company were from Japan and around 4,000 workers stood at very close distance to work. “We at factories are at greater risk than schools and colleges. It is crowded everywhere inside the premises,” he said.

His colleague, Ramprakash said that a vast majority of the workers in IMT was contractual and could not afford to stay at home for long without earning and the factory owners were not likely to grant them paid leaves. “We know we are at risk, but have no choice but to work,” said Ramprakash.

Bellsonica Auto Component India Private Limited employees union vice-president Ajit Saini demanded that all factories should be shut and the workers granted paid leaves. “When the colleges, schools and cinema halls have been shut to prevent mass gatherings, the same logic applies to the factories as well,” he said, adding that a large number of foreigners frequented the firms in the IMT and are allowed to enter without any check-ups.

Deputy Commissioner Amit Khatri, said the manufacturing industries were told to adhere to social distancing norms as per the directives of Union and State governments. He said the advisory issued to companies to allow their staff to work from home “also applied to manufacturing industries”. On some firms still allowing biometric attendance, Mr. Khatri said the administration would reach out to them to ensure required measures were taken.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ad1hp1/article31103305.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18DELPRIYAAUTO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/workers-in-manesar-labour-under-shadow-of-covid-19/article31103306.ece

269,2020/03/19,Allahabad High Court terms U.P.’s recovery of damages ordinance arbitrary,"The Uttar Pradesh government has armed itself with a stringent new law to recover compensation from those who damage public and private property during protests and riots.

The Allahabad High Court on March 18 asked the Uttar Pradesh government to file a reply by March 25 in the recovery of damages ordinance brought by it last week.

The court was hearing a Public Interest Litigation challenging the Uttar Pradesh Recovery of Damage to Public and Private Property Ordinance, 2020, notified by the government on March 15 after the Cabinet passed the proposal on March 13.

Lucknow banners issue | Allahabad HC grants govt time till April 10 to file report

In its order, the Division Bench of Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Samit Goyal, while issuing notice to the government, noted the arguments raised by the petitioners and said that the “ordinance is arbitrary in its very nature”.

“According to learned counsels, provisions of the ordinance shall allow the persons to be viral for public at large as criminal without their adjudication for any criminal charge. The ordinance as per learned counsels is also in contravention to the law laid down by the apex court in the Rojer Mathew Vs. South Indian Bank Limited 2019 SCC Online SC 1456,” the court said.

The Bench also stated that it is also “emphasised that the intention of the ordinance is only to frustrate and overrule the law laid down by” a bench of the HC which recently asked the state to forthwith remove hoardings erected by it displaying the perosnal information of those accused in the violence during the protests against the CAA.

“Having considered the arguments advanced and also of the facts and grounds referred in the petition for writ, we consider it appropriate to have a counter affidavit to have adequate response by the State of Uttar Pradesh,” the Bench ruled.

The order so notes that the petitioners further submitted that the field wherein the ordinance of 2020 is sought to be operated is already occupied and exhausted by the Central enactments, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984.

The plea filed by lawyer Shashank Tripathi prays the court to issue a writ, order or direction declaring the ordinance “ultra-vires” to the constitution. The PIL seeks the suspension of or stay against the ordinance brought by the BJP-led Uttar Pradesh government for the recovery of damages to public and private property during protests, bandhs or riots.

“To evade from justifying itself from court of law, the State has played mischief upon the Constitution,” argued Mr. Tripathi in the plea, referring to the questions asked of it by the HC and the Supreme Court in the ‘name and shame’ hoardings episode.

Lawyer Ashma Izzat, a petitioner in another PIL in the case, has argued that the ordinance “is unconstitutional.”

“...Stting up of a tribunal with multiple members and functioning even with a single judicial member and several non-judicial members is not permissible in law as laid down by the Supreme Court,” the PIL said.

The PIL further read: “The ordinance is arbitrary and unconstitutional because it allows for proceedings to be instituted against persons against whom no prima facie evidence exists either of commission of a crime or of destruction of property.”

The Uttar Pradesh government armed itself with a stringent new law to recover compensation from those who damage public and private property during protests and riots.

Claims for compensation will be decided by designated ‘Claims Tribunals’ that will be authorised to investigate complaints and assess the damage.

As per the ordinance, the owner of any private property or the head of the office concerned in respect of public property, may file claims for compensation within three months of any incident that causes any damage during public protests, bandhs or riots. The claim can cite as respondents those who “exhorted” or “instigated” or “committed” acts that caused the damage, as well as those named by the police.

Every order or award passed by the Claims Tribunal would be “final” and no appeal against such orders would be “maintainable” before any court, it said. Also, no civil court will have the jurisdiction to entertain any questions regarding the claims.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article18718532.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Lucknow%20Bench%20of%20Allahabad%20HC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/allahabad-high-court-terms-ups-recovery-of-damages-ordinance-arbitrary/article31103077.ece
270,2020/03/19,Maternity benefits for second child in Rajasthan,"Scheme announced by CM Gehlot in the Assembly will cover four districts for now

The Rajasthan government has announced a maternity benefit scheme for four districts in the State on a pilot basis under which it will offer ₹6,000 for the birth of the second child.

The scheme will be implemented in Udaipur, Pratapgath, Banswara and Dungarpur, where nutrition indicators among children and anaemia levels among mothers are worse than the average for the State.

The government aims to reach out to 75,000 beneficiaries annually. It estimates an expenditure of ₹45 crore per year. The State scheme will complement the Central government’s Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana which offers ₹5,000 for the birth of the first child.

The Rajasthan government scheme is called Indira Gandhi Matritva Poshan Yojana, and was announced by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot last week in the State Assembly.

“The scheme is covered under this year’s budgetary allocation. The State government plans to implement it within this financial year. While the government has prepared an estimate for an initial period of 5 years, it may be extended and even be implemented in more districts in the State,” Secretary for Women and Child Development Department of Rajasthan, K.K. Pathak said.

“The government feels that the second child doesn’t receive as much attention as the first child and, therefore, it is important to extend this cash benefit to ensure adequate nutrition for the second child,” Mr. Pathak explained.

Beneficiaries will receive cash in three or five instalments upon meeting certain conditions. However, unlike the Central scheme they will not have to submit an Aadhaar card for the State scheme and the money will be transferred directly to their bank accounts.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/51e7va/article31102517.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE18-GEHLOT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maternity-benefits-for-second-child-in-rajasthan/article31102518.ece

The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has trained more than 15,000 staff deployed at the air and land ports across the country on the protocols to be followed in view of the COVID-19 outbreak.

NDRF Director-General S.N. Pradhan told The Hindu that as part of the awareness and acclimatisation drive, the personnel of the Central Industrial Security Force and the Bureau of Immigration posted at these ports have also been sensitised.

Mr. Pradhan said over 5,000 personnel of the NDRF, stationed in different States, have been kept on standby. The units are in regular contact with the State and District Disaster Management Authority officials. It is learnt that the NDRF officials have also been provided with personal protection kits.

India is currently at the second stage of the virus outbreak. At the national level, a government official said, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has been coordinating with the State and District authorities for implementing measures on a war footing to check the spread.

Strategy meetings

The National Crisis Management Committee headed by the Cabinet Secretary, which is devising the strategy to deal with the outbreak, has held over half-a-dozen meetings. Concerns and suggestions of Chief Secretaries from the States are being taken into consideration for devising the action plan.

The NDMA's National Executive Committee (NEC), which ensures implementation of the policies on disaster management, has been constantly monitoring the situation.

The NEC is headed by the Union Home Secretary. It comprises Secretary-level officials in all the key Ministries or Departments, and the Chief of the Integrated Defence Staff of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Union Health Secretary is coordinating the meetings with the stakeholders.

It is learnt that the Textiles Ministry has been roped in to ensure mass production of protective clothing. The government has also placed an order for about 1 million nasal swab pins from Germany. Taking into account a possible proliferation of the infection which impacts the respiratory system, the authorities are also preparing to make adequate arrangement for ventilators.

On the health front, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is monitoring the developments pertaining to testing labs. Apart from 72 ICMR labs, 49 others in government institutions will become functional this week. The ICMR, which is coordinating with the World Health Organisation, the Indian Medical Association, Council is also in touch with over 50 private accredited labs for facilitating free-of-cost testing.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ndrf-puts-contingency-plans-in-place/article31102490.ece
272,2020/03/19,Rajasthan SHRC recommends meditation to fight COVID-19,"Chairman made infamous peahen pregnancy remarks in 2017

The Rajasthan State Human Rights Commission on Wednesday recommended “meditation in solitude” to fight COVID-19 which has infected over 150 persons across the country.

The Commission took up the matter suo motu, taking cognisance of the pandemic, and advised the affected persons to live in isolation.

“While those suspecting infection should immediately report to the nearest health centre and be sent to isolation for 14 days as per the World Health Organisation's guidelines, the Commission recommends that all people should meditate in solitude,” SHRC chairperson Justice Mahesh Chandra Sharma said in his two-page order.

Justice Sharma praised the State government's measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 virus and especially applauded the treatment given by doctors at Sawai Man Singh Government Hospital here to three coronavirus-positive patients who have since recovered.

The treatment regimen included a combination of drugs for swine flu, malaria and HIV.

As a Judge of the Rajasthan High Court, Justice Sharma had created a flutter in 2017 with his remarks that the peahen gets pregnant after swallowing the tears of the peacock.

His comments came after he passed an order on his last working day asking the Centre to declare the cow as a national animal and increase the punishment for cow slaughter to life imprisonment.

‘Peacock a celibate’

Justice Sharma commented that the peacock was a lifelong brahmachari (celibate) and it never had sex with the peahen to reproduce.

Amid the COVID-19 scare, the Punjab government is mulling giving bail to those convicted of minor offences and parole to those who had spent considerable time in jail.

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, while disclosing this, pointed out that the Supreme Court had talked about decongesting the prisons. “The final decision would, however, depend on the courts. State Advocate General Atul Nanda is taking up the matter with the Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court,” he said here.

In an attempt to check the spread of COVID-19, the State government has also decided to launch a door-to-door awareness campaign from March 19 across the State.

Capt. Amarinder also appealed to religious organisations and Dera heads to keep gatherings under 50 in support of the government’s efforts to check the spread of the virus.

The Chief Minister said, after a series of review meetings with the Health and other concerned departments, that while Punjab, with one confirmed case, was so far safe, it could not afford to be complacent in the face of the spreading pandemic.

“The State government is taking all possible measures to stop the disease from spreading further. Strict monitoring is being done of all those arriving from high-risk countries and so far, 116 suspected cases had been tested,” he said.

Earlier, Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar had written to the Chief Minister urging the government machinery about intensifying the drive to tackle the COVID-19 threat.

In a letter to the Chief Minister, Mr. Jakhar said there have been reports that garbage dumps had piled up in some towns and cities due to strike by sanitation staff or other reasons.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/9qf3gg/article31102451.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE18-AMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/punjab-mulls-giving-bail-for-minor-offences/article31102452.ece

A 25-year-old junior resident doctor of the King George Medical University here has tested positive for COVID-19 after coming in contact with two patients undergoing treatment for the disease at its premises, a hospital spokesperson said on Wednesday.

The KGMU subsequently, in a statement, announced suspension of all undergraduate academic classes and examinations till April 2 as a preventive measure to stem the spread of COVID- 19.

The doctor has been kept in an isolation ward and is undergoing treatment, the spokesperson said.

“A woman from Canada and one of her relatives, who came in contact with her, are undergoing treatment for COVID-19 at an isolation ward of the KGMU.

“A 25-year-old junior resident doctor had taken the samples of these patients. Suddenly, some symptoms were seen in him and he was tested at the university laboratory, where he was found positive for COVID-19 affliction,” the KGMU spokesperson, Dr. Sudhir Singh said..

“The resident doctor has been kept in an isolation ward and is undergoing treatment,” he said.

Dr. Singh said 14 other people working in the isolation ward were also tested and they were found negative for the affliction.

Classes suspended

In a statement, KGMU Registrar Ashutosh Kumar Dwivedi later said, “As approved by Vice-Chancellor of King George’s Medical University UP, Lucknow, all undergraduate (MBBS, BDS, BSc. Nursing and Paramedical) classes and examinations have been suspended till April 2 as a preventive measure to avoid the spread of COVID-19.”

Dr. Vikasendu Agrawal, the Joint Director-cum-State Surveillance Officer of the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) in a statement said, “As on March 17, total number of samples found positive is 15 (Agra-8, Ghaziabad-2, NOIDA-3, Lucknow -2). Three have been declared recovered.”

275,2020/03/19,Lucknow administration asks 13 to pay ₹21.76 lakh or face confiscation of property,"They are among the 57 who were put on ‘name and shame’ posters in U.P.

The Lucknow administration has issued fresh notices to 13 persons, accused in the vandalism during the protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act last December, to pay a fine of ₹21.76 lakh within a week of face confiscation of their property or even arrest.

The 13 are among the 57 persons whose names, photographs and residential addresses were put up on hoardings by the administration across the Uttar Pradesh capital.

The court of Additional City Magistrate in Lucknow had last month issued notices to recover ₹21.76 lakh from the 13 persons accused or damaging public and private property in the vandalism and arson that took place during protests under the Hasanganj police station area.

Fixing culpability of the 13 persons, ADM Trans-Gomti Vishwa Bhushan Mishra had given them 30 days to deposit the penalty amount, either collectively or by a single person.

Now, the Tehsildar (Sadar) has issued 'demand notices' and recovery certificates to the 13 accused asking them to deposit the amount ₹21.76 lakh within seven days or explain in presence why punitive action should not be taken against them under the U.P. Revenue Code, 2006.

""This includes your arrest and the confiscation or auction of your movable and immovable property,"" said the orders.

Tehsildar Shambhu told The Hindu that the accused would also ""have to pay 10% collection charge"" along with the amount issued as per the notice.

In the particular case, the district administration had issued notices to 20 persons to recover damages to property, but charges were fixed only against 13.

Seven exonerated

The remaining seven were exonerated from paying the damages as the police could not provide evidence that they were present at the protest site in Khadra locality with ""common object"" on December 19, the notice issued by the ADM Trans-Gomti said. Of the remaining 13, seven could not prove that they had no role in the damages to the property, while six did not reply to the notices, the ADM order said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/4js6in/article31085064.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE16-SHAME,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/13-asked-to-pay-2176-lakh-or-face-confiscation-of-property/article31102424.ece
276,2020/03/19,Meet Opera’s Nayika,"Meera Varghese had up her sleeve, a surprise blend of Indian Classical arts and German repertoire

If you thought ‘never the twain shall meet’ — Opera and Bharatanatyam — you would have been in for a surprise at Meera Varghese’s lecture-demonstration on ‘The Nayika in Opera and German Art Song’ for Sahrdaya Creative Spaces’ Mandala series. Being an opera singer and a Bharatanatyam dancer, Meera has a helicopter vision of the classical art forms. That evening (March 11), she was able to break down the components of Western classical music, such as the poetry and music, of Lieder (German Art Songs composed for one voice and piano) and Arias (solos in Italian that are a part of larger works such as operas) especially, and compare it with the components of Carnatic music and Bharatanatyam, so we could connect with her hypothesis, that ‘Since both singing and dancing are forms of storytelling, the songs could be interpreted and performed like padams.’

Meera’s presentation was unique. Having chosen love themes in 19th and 20th century compositions, she explained each classifying the nayikas or heroines in each according to the Nayika Bheda theory propounded by the second century text on dramaturgy, Natya Sastra. True to Western classical vocal tradition, she sang the Lieder and opera arias without a microphone. She sang in an agile, soprano voice, while she emoted the lyrics with her eyes, adding a slight tilt of a shoulder or torso for greater effect. The facial expressions were not of the spontaneous kind, but studied netra abhinaya.

“I explored the ways in which abhinaya theory could be applied to the performance of these compositions. Each song that I chose represented a different Nayika or Rasa. For example, to demonstrate the Khandita Nayika, I chose Hugo Wolf’s Lied ‘Wer rief dich denn? Wer hat dich herbestellt?’ (Who called you? Who asked you to come here?), which for me is like the German equivalent of the padam ‘Indendu Vachitivira.’ So this was really a way for me to bring together my two artistic worlds, and to introduce the audience here to a different form of abhinaya… My Bharatanatyam training has enhanced my facial expression when performing Lied and opera repertoire. It requires some coordination to get the vocal chords and the eyes and the body to work together. There is the ‘giving it all you have’ concept in Western classical music, on the need to communicate as an actor while singing, but the acting here was not just spontaneous expression but backed by technique.

Soulful melody

The songs were short, one to three minutes, but the impact was tremendous. The music was powerful and her expressions so piercing that neither time, geography nor language seemed to matter. The opening Lied, ‘Verschwiegene Liebe’ (Silent Love), music by Hugo Wolf, was breathtakingly evocative, as the poet Joseph von Eichendorff speaks of thoughts of love flying, ‘Over treetops and cornfields… If only she could guess who has been thinking of her... when no one was awake… my love keeps its secret and is beautiful as the night.’ The soulful melody carried the delicacy of the poetry so lightly and so artistically. It was so with every composition that evening. Whether it was the Lied ‘Die Lotosblume’ (The Lotusflower) by Robert Schumann, text by Heinrich Heine, in which the nayika — like as the lotus flower — lifts her head up only for the nayaka, the moon, or the tear-jerking Aria, ‘O Mio Babbino Caro’, (O My Dear Papa) music by Puccini, from the opera ‘Gianni Schicchi’ in which a little girl, Mugdha Nayika, is pleading with her father to let her marry the boy she loves, or the protagonist yearning for one who has passed away and may return on All Souls’ Day in ‘Allerseelen,’ (music by Richard Strauss, text by Hermann von Gilm), each brought a different nuance to human emotions.

There was drama and artistry in every note sung that evening. A high pitch sustained in a quiet way in the opening notes lent a sense of flying thoughts, ‘Over treetops...’ in Silent Love; in the Aria (‘Quando me’n vo’) with music by Puccini, from the opera “La Bohème” where a confident woman, Pragalba Nayika, sees her former lover and wants to tease him, the sustained highest note of the evening, falls on the words “I know well that you feel like dying” to make him feel squirm.

The piano is said to be an equal partner in Lied. The last piece, ‘Gretchen am Spinnrade’ (Gretchen at the spinning wheel), had such a haunting background score. With music by Franz Schubert and text by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (from his play “Faust”), it is about a girl who has fallen in love for the first time and is at the spinning wheel with her thoughts. Through feelings of discomfiture and helplessness, she describes him with a sense of pride when the wheel is at its most intense; and when she thinks of a kiss, the wheel suddenly stops, and there is silence, to restart slowly as she goes back to her sombre thoughts. Besides the music, Meera highlighted the many moods the nayika goes through in this piece, drawing a parallel to the Vyabhichari bhavas in Abhinaya/ Rasa Theory.

Meera had a caveat: “Traditionally Lied recitals are sung with live piano and operas are performed with live orchestra. To accommodate the black box at Sahrdaya Creative Spaces, which does not have a piano, pre-recorded piano and orchestral accompaniment tracks were used for the lecture demonstration.”

Straddling two worlds

Meera’s journey, in her own words:

I was born and brought up in Canada and started training in piano at the age of six. Most of my early music experience as a student was working as a pianist and musical director and conductor for musical theatre productions. I completed a Bachelor of Music in Voice Performance and a Master of Arts in Ethnomusicology at the University of Alberta (Canada) with a research focus on Bharatanatyam in the Indian diaspora. I then moved to Germany and completed my Master of Music in Opera Performance at the Hochschule für Musik Köln.

Parallel to my music studies, I trained in Bharatanatyam under S. Ramalingam in Karaikkal, and have since attended additional master classes with Bragha Bessell and Priyadarsini Govind apart from training with Jai Govinda in Vancouver, Canada. I’m currently staying in Chennai to attend private classes in abhinaya with Bragha Bessell, in preparation for my next Bharatanatyam solo recital in Germany.

I’m a second-generation Indo-Canadian, so the idea of straddling two worlds was a fairly normal aspect of my experience growing up in the Indian diaspora. From a very young age, I was drawn to the arts in many forms, not only music and dance, but also theatre and visual arts. So I was always eager to explore different forms of artistic expression. When I started to seriously pursue both Western classical music and Indian classical dance, I found common ground in the storytelling aspect. Even though these two disciplines are technically and culturally worlds apart from each other, my training in each art form has given me a unique perspective that complements both sides.

(In Germany) I work as an opera singer, Bharatanatyam dancer and theatre actor. So depending on the project, I either sing as a soloist in opera productions or Lied concerts, or perform solo Bharatanatyam recitals, or act in plays at German theatres. As a multidisciplinary artist, I sometimes have the chance to work in projects that combine these different art forms. For example, last year when performing the role of Aouda in a German theatre production of “Around the World in 80 Days,” I also choreographed and performed Bharatanatyam in the play.

Over the years, I’ve managed to find a balance between my work as a Western classical singer and as an Indian classical dancer, to the point where I feel completely at home in both worlds. Depending on my performance schedule, I may have to devote more time to one or the other at various points throughout the year... I’ve tried to find creative ways of maintaining contact with both art forms. For example, if I’m commuting to another city for opera or theatre rehearsals, I’ll listen to my dance repertoire while riding the train.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/luyh8d/article31107654.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20FRMEERA5,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/meet-operas-nayika/article31107666.ece
277,2020/03/19,How Bharatantya changed Dominique Delorme’s perception of dance itself,"Dance has to be fluid: Dominique Delorme

Each piece presented by internationally acclaimed Bharatantya artiste Dominique Delorme at the recent Nirantara Narmada Festival in Bengaluru was crisp and different from the other in its content and approach. He first elaborated some of the karanas before moving onto showcasing angaharas through a sholkattu. His piece on the navarasas was a collage of various scenes from the Ramayana and his extensive work on akasha charis could be seen in this.

The thillana in mahati raga and adi tala was centred on climate change and pleased nature lovers. Choreographed by Padma Subramanyam from whom Dominique learnt the 108 karanas, the thillana’s strength was in sincere imitation of various life forms on earth. For instance, including minute details such as tossing of the head by a horse versus just having it gallop in the choreography made it subtle and delightful.

His last two pieces, one on the harp (instrument) and the other on spirituality in Sufi and Hindu traditions, had a contemporary touch to them, taking the audience to different cultural realms.

A common thread that ran through all his presentations was the ‘Karanas’. In an interview for The Hindu, Dominique who also happens to be the first to perform all the 108 karanas on a proscenium at a single stretch, talks about the significance of karanas, their universal nature and the challenges of being a Bharatantyam artiste in the West.

Karanas have become a characteristic feature of your dance. What prompted you to learn them?

I must say I was extremely fortunate to learn from Paddu Akka and it happened quite spontaneously. I was in Chennai learning from Muthuswamy Pillai and happened to watch her performance one evening at the Music Academy in the late 80s. I was instantly fascinated with her style of dance. I invited her as the chief guest for my arangetram and she asked me to work for one of her documentary projects. My engagement with her began then.

However, a decade later I again had the opportunity to come back (on a Villa Medicis fellowship) to learn the karanas in depth. It happened because Paddu Akka persuaded me to. She nudged me saying, “Dominique, if you want to learn the karanas, do so at the earliest because you are soon going to be 40!’, he says, laughing. After I learnt the karanas, my dancing wasn’t the same. It shouldn’t be. Otherwise, what is the significance of the karanas? Till then, I perceived dance as moving from one position to the next. But the karanas taught me what a true dance is — it happens between these two positions and it is more about ‘how’ you go from one point to the next in a three dimensional space.

How do the karanas of Natyasastra hold good for Western classical dance forms?

Learning the karanas is like getting to the roots of dance grammar. They are the shastras (theories) of body movement which are applicable to any kind of dance form. When I got back to Europe, the second time in the early 2000s, I was thrilled to recognise many karanas in Western dance forms and named each movement in them according to the Natyasastra!

Do male dancers bring a different kind of energy onto the stage?

Yes, although the divine dancer is Nataraja, it is unfortunate that we have very few male Bharatanatyam dancers today. Male dancers, my guru Muthuswamy Pillai felt, could bring to dance something unique. While choreographing a piece for me that involved a lot of mandi adavus, he once said, “Dominique, I cannot do the same with my other disciples.”

That is when I realised the magnitude of my first guru Malavika’s words when she had said Muthuswamyswamy Pillai, also her guru, was waiting for a male student for more than two decades!

This does not mean female dancers are not agile or energetic. It is just that working on the male body for athletic movement is easier than training the female body.

What are the challenges of showcasing Bharatanatyam outside India?

I began designing shows specific to Western audiences way back in 1993 as I realised the usual margam doesn’t appeal to them. Nandanar, a production based on the life of an eighth century saint, was conceived understanding the imagination of the Western audience. The agricultural hardship, poverty, unequal treatment and other facets of this story connected well with them. I also placed emphasis on theatrical elements and did not neglect verbal explanations wherever required as they provided clues for the audience who came from a very different culture.

Later, I collaborated with Western dancers and musicians to create pieces like the one on the harp. The next step was to connect to a global audience through choreographies that combined various cultures. The last piece I presented here connected the Sufi concept of enlightenment with the Hindu philosophy of seven incarnations and moksha. I think all these made it work.

However, on the institutional front, there has been unequal treatment for Indian classical dance forms. They do not receive the same support that Western and contemporary forms do. It is because many countries in the West still view Indian dance as a folk form!

How then did you sustain the interest and tradition of Bharatanatyam away from its land of origin and practice it for three long decades?

Practice and dedication, what else? My gurus live in me and my dance even if they are not physically present. This is how they prompt me to tread the path of sadhana. For a man who was as mad as leaving medical school just to visit India and be in touch with its rich heritage, having learnt one of its dance form is a huge blessing and why wouldn’t I rejoice in it every single day?",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/d2un4p/article31107483.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DOMINIQUE1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/how-bharatantya-changed-dominique-delormes-perception-of-dance-itself/article31107484.ece
278,2020/03/19,Relevance of a devadasi’s work,"Muddupalani’s poem unlocks the door to an era, when the female voice rose above patriarchy of all kinds

This is the first of a four-part collaborative writing/discussion between Dr. Priya Srinivasan and Priyadarsini Govind, examining the silencing of the female voice at different historical moments. We ask what it means to engage with Bharatanatyam and Carnatic music in experimental ways when social justice issues are placed in the forefront to ask difficult questions. The first piece we write looks at the devadasi Muddupalani’s epic poem, Radhika Santwanamu and its staging in Melbourne, Australia, in 2019, within a broader framework of power. The second piece will focus on a work in development called “Sthree,” which toggles in time between Devi Mahatmyam and everyday rape cases in New Delhi and Melbourne using a Carnatic ladies choir, which will premier in December 2020 in India. The third piece will examine what it means to look at the entangled relationship between the devadasi/brahmin/NRI. We would look at this particularly in relation to marginalisation and Indigenity as interpreted in our project called “Churning Waters,” which was developed from 2017 and premiered in South India for Australia Festival in India in 2019. The fourth and final piece in the series will look at the dancing body today and what its future might be.

Which other woman of my kind has felicitated scholars with such gifts and money?

To which other women of my kind have epics been dedicated?

Which other woman of my kind has won such acclaim in each of the arts?

You are incomparable, Muddupalani, among your kind.

So begins Radhika Santwanamu, an erotic poem by the devadasi Muddupalani, who dared to write about female desire in the mid-18th century. We came across the Muddupalani’s work at different moments in different spaces across the globe but united by our need to understand how women have played with power and survived.

Priya Srinivasan: I came across Radhika Santwanamu in 1996 in Los Angeles, in a writing class, as a fragment when Susie Tharu and K. Lalita published small sections in their larger work “Women Writing in India Part 1 and 2” and wrote that the devadasi Bangalore Nagarathnammal published the poem in full with the recovered coda (above) in 1910 that named Muddupalani as the rightful author of the work. The work was censured, banned and destroyed in 1911 by the British colonial authorities, who did not want to read women writing about their sexuality and desires. It was also in 1996, I encountered the hybrid and appropriated history of our form (in Avanthi Meduri’s unpublished dissertation), which stopped me from presenting Bharatanatyam to the public for the next 12 years in order to understand this complex history. I sat with the work for many decades wondering when and how it should be presented, under what circumstances and who had the right to present it — in what form? As more and more sections began to be translated, we had the complete work in English by Sandhya Mulchandani in 2009. We began seeing how women’s bodies and voices continue to be silenced around the world. I felt it was time to start to engage seriously with Muddupalani’s text because of its continued relevance in today’s world.

Priyadarsini Govind: My first encounter was in the 1990s, when V.A.K. Ranga Rao brought Radhika Santwanamu to my attention as a unique piece of writing by a woman, a Devadasi whose work had survived the test of time. I returned to it when Priya Srinivasan brought it to my attention. The complex characters in the poem — Radhika and Ila (two women) — and their love for Krishna caught my imagination. A love triangle with a twist in that Radhika marries Krishna to her own niece, Ila, in an effort to retain her hold over Krishna. It was interesting to interpret the multilayered character of Radha — by giving him away did she think she could keep him? But when things go beyond her control what would be her reaction? What about the man’s role? Has society changed since then? Where does this inspiration for Muddupalani come from? To what extent is it autobiographical? I was also curious about the reason it was banned as it was no more licentious than the works of many of her male counterparts. Perhaps the most powerful aspect of this work to me as an artiste, is the concept of a woman revealing both her most vulnerable moments and her greatest strengths with equal candour and courage.

Together we decided to rework the poem taking only small sections of it. The collaboration occurred between us (Priyadarsini Govind and Dr. Priya Srinivasan) with Uthra Vijay (Carnatic music vocalist/composer), Lalgudi Vijayalakshmi (violinist/composer), Ching Ching Ho (Director/dramaturgy) and Dr. Philipa Rothfield (philosopher and dance writer) in Melbourne in November 2019 as part of the inaugural show of ‘Sangam: Performing Arts Festival of South Asia and Diaspora’ held at Dancehouse (the home of contemporary dance in Australia). Using performance methods of Carnatic music, Bharatanatyam, spoken word and literary readings, our intention is to represent the devadasi Muddupalani and the characters in Radhika Santwanamu but to analyse the 18th century text from the perspective of 21st century artistes.

Fragments of history reveal that Muddupalani was a consort in the court of the Thanjavur ruler King Pratap Singh. It is also understood that her grandmother (not by blood), the great devadasi Tanjanayaki was also his consort. We’re talking about women, who have no claim on the King and therefore had to negotiate power accordingly. Muddupalani’s work was written during the transformation of the East India Company into a military power and King Pratap Singh was negotiating his own power. All this gives the composition and the author a unique place and voice in history. How she deals with the various relationships in her life — be it the King or her grandmother — are perhaps reflected in the characters in the poem.

Startling difference

The questions brought to the forefront in this work differs from the questions usually raised by male artistes, who write from a female perspective. We are aware that many devadasi and women’s poetry were subsumed by male poets in history. The startling difference here is that Muddupalani negotiated the male powers in the court and became acclaimed for writing as a woman in her own time. In the process, she claims a woman’s right to pleasure and sexuality on her own terms, something women even in the twenty-first century are not always able to do. Through acts of subversion, Muddupalani writes erotica. It is interesting to look at Saskia Kersenboom’s dual concept of bhoga and citta where the devadasi’s reality was a sensuous reality as opposed to a reality of the mind. Perhaps these realities are irreconcilable and without a clear resolution.

The work attempts to heighten the differences between the historical poet/woman /devadasi/writer who still lies partially hidden and obscured in time. This poet can only be partially recovered through a nuanced reading. Muddupalani leads the reader tantalisingly into her world, offering ways to almost hear her voice. We point to the fact that during Muddupalani’s time and up until the mid-20th century, most women, including Brahmin women, were rarely educated and subject to the extreme burdens of patriarchy, enforced servitude and often led labour intensive lives in the domestic spheres. While some devadasi women were educated and could move relatively freely in the public sphere, Brahmin women were not educated and in fact prevented from entering the public sphere until the second half of the 20th century.

Brahminical, Colonial and other forms of patriarchy eventually led to the Devadasi Abolition Act of 1947. This silenced the so called “immoral” and “erotic” devadasi bodies and interestingly enough, enabled Brahmin women to emerge in the public sphere as performers. Ironically, this was on the terms of the very “chastity” and “morality” that had kept them locked in the private sphere. Understanding patriarchy and different women’s class and caste burdens across time helps us to visualise the psychological and political landscape in which the Muddupalani text is located and therefore connect to it. What does it mean now — in the 21st century — to question different class/caste/female voices, lost in time, in order to examine how female sexuality and power vis-a-vis patriarchy have operated?",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/wfvvr9/article31107078.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20frPriya1JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/relevance-of-a-devadasis-work/article31107081.ece
279,2020/03/19,Sreehari Chakyar’s ‘Maya Seethankam’ — a mature approach,"Nepathya Sreehari Chakyar presented the nuances of Koodiyattom in his dramatic monologue

In keeping with the ‘Future of the Arts’ theme at Utsavam 2020, young artistes were chosen for the cultural programmes. Plus 1 student, 17-year old Nepathya Sreehari Chakyar performed ‘Maya Seethankam’ from the third act of Shaktibhadra’s ‘Ascharya Choodamani.’ The act presents Ravana’s dramatic monologue, when he is on his way to kidnap Sita.

The challenge in Koodiyattam is to present the delicate nuances with regard to the character’s emotions; though Ravana is predominantly fierce, his infatuation with Sita makes him vulnerable. Ravana’s lust-filled eyes gleam with anticipation as he thinks of her. He describes her hair, eyes, face, breasts and feet, and suffers love pangs, the episodes called ‘Panchangam’ and ‘Kamasaram.’ When he realises that Soorpanakha has seen his innermost thoughts he is embarrassed, sheepish and when the gods mock him, he is defiant. Sreehari proved his maturity as an artiste, when he handled the Ravana characterisation with the required delicacy.

Ravana bemoans the fact that it was not a god or an emperor but a mere human, who fights the cold and the heat and has unkempt hair, who harmed Soorpanakha. This entertaining episode showing a human being shivering from cold and facing unbearable heat, knotting matted locks on top of the head, was portrayed with great clarity. The all-body shivering, from the toes to the shoulders, was captured excellently.

He day dreams of killing Rama, declaring he does not need a sword to kill a human, his bare hands were enough to wring Rama’s neck, and demonstrates it with relish. The last part of ‘Maya Seethankam’ was a Pakarnattam, where an actor plays more than one role. As he picturises the kidnapping of Sita, he alternates between a ferocious Ravana and a helpless Sita. Sreehari maybe considered a star actor on the horizon.

The young artiste was supported by Kalamandalam Manikandan, Nepathya Jinesh (mizhavu), Kalanilayam Rajan (edakka), Dr. Indu G. (talam) and Kalanilayam Sundaran (chutti).",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/sqpd2g/article31107029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20frKoodiyattam2JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/sreehari-chakyars-maya-seethankam-a-mature-approach/article31107030.ece

Despite the communication gap, the school children try to help the aliens who want to regain their ‘shakti’ so they can go back to where they came from. They approach a monkey, a tortoise, a magician, a doctor and finally a clown, who shows them the way.

The dance-theatre was tuneful, colourful and entertaining. The singers along with the accompanists on the harmonium, mridangam-dholak and talam (cymbals), comprised the support group.

Kamsa-Krishna encounter

Four disciples of Manjunath Kulal Airody of Udupi Yakshagana Kendra, Karnataka, between the ages of 6 and 12, presented a lively ‘Kamsa Vadhanam’ in the traditional dance-music-theatre style of Yakshagana. Though the actor-dancers were very young, they strangely suited their roles. Not only did Swastisri (Kamsa), Aarush Shetty (Krishna) and Sachin Kullal (Balarama) carried conviction, but their ages also seemed to tally with Krishna’s age when he killed his uncle Kamsa (some say 11, others 16). The encounter between Kamsa and Krishna — Balarama was the highlight of the show.

The play opened to prayers to Dakshinamurthi, Vinayaka and the song on Balagopala (six-year-old Advik Shetty) that had high energy rhythmic sequences in between. Kamsa is introduced as a big-haired ferocious ruler, who has a bad dream in which he is killed. Seeing Krishna everywhere, he tries to calm his agitated mind saying, ‘Vishranti beku’. He orders Chanura and Mooshtika to kill Krishna and Balarama.

When Kamsa is sitting on his samhasan, the two children, Krishna and Balarama enter observing Kamsa’s arrogance. Impudently they sit on his lap addressing him as ‘Mama!’ Immediately they are pushed away. A conversation between them begins when the children question him about dharma. Kamsa asks them about the demons he had sent, for which Krishna nonchalantly replies how they killed each of them. He accuses Kamsa of being a paapi who imprisoned his parents and attacks him. The fight is very brief.

The dance drama ends with Kamsa’s death and a subsequent prayer. It was marked by excellent footwork, time-keeping and dialogue delivery.

The Himmela, all under 25, consisted of Madhukar Hegde (bhagavatha- singer), Lohith (maddala) and Bharath Chandan (chende). An interesting exploration of rhythm by the percussionists preceded the drama.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/y8u6kx/article31107007.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20FRKATTAIKUTTU,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/at-their-expressive-best/article31107008.ece

288,2020/03/19,TNSTC halts inter-State services to two States,"No buses from Krishnagiri-Dharmapuri to Bengaluru; no services to Kerala and Karnataka from the Nilgiris

Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC), Dharmapuri, has drastically cut down the number of buses plying in the Dharmapuri- Krishnagiri-Hosur region, while inter-State transport has been been stopped completely with no passenger traffic into Bengaluru. As of Wednesday, over 100 buses, including local and inter-State buses, were pulled off roads.

A total of 958 bus services are operated in the Dharmapuri division, which includes Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri and Hosur. On Wednesday, a little over 10% of the buses were pulled off the roads for want of passengers.

An official source in the TNSTC told The Hindu that inter-State bus services to Bengaluru has been cut, as the city reported a number of COVID-19 cases. “There is no passenger traffic within Bengaluru as well for our buses to ply,” the official said. The buses were running empty even locally and the number of buses would be brought down considerably each day, according to the official. “Tomorrow (Thursday) 20% of the buses will be stopped,” he said.

Inter-State passenger flow froze on its own volition in view of the caution over the transmission of COVID-19 virus. Hosur and Krishnagiri have a significant number of people commuting to Bengaluru every day for work. The lockdown in Bengaluru has stopped the worker flow.

On Wednesday, all main bus stands had separate hand wash stations set up as part of awareness creation by the TNSTC. In addition, protective masks and gloves were given to the drivers. The steering wheel, gear boxes and foot board railings were sanitised.

Staff Reporter adds from Udhagamandalam

The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) stopped bus services from the Nilgiris to Kerala and Karnataka from Wednesday, officials confirmed.

The services were stopped as there were very few passengers. Both Kerala and Karnataka transport corporations also reduced the number of buses coming to the Nilgiris to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

At a press conference here on Wednesday, Nilgiris Collector J. Innocent Divya appealed to the public to not spread rumours about the spread of the virus.

291,2020/03/19,Fake explosives found in front of police stations in Coimbatore,"Two objects that looked like explosive substances were found in front of two police stations in Coimbatore city on Monday and Tuesday.

The objects, looking exactly like improvised explosive devices (IED), were found in front of Saibaba Colony police station in the early hours of Monday and Variety Hall Road police station late on Tuesday.

A check by a police dog and a bomb detection squad found both objects to be fake.

In both instances, police found a box with a battery and wires attached. When opened, these had nothing but polystrene pieces. Both the instances triggered two theories: one that these were placed by miscreants, the other that the police were testing the alertness at their stations.

A source in the police said that the fake IEDs could be planted by a special team code-named “Decoy” to check the alertness of Coimbatore city police in the wake of communal tensions.

During a visit on March 11, Director General of Police J.K. Tripathy had reviewed the law and order situation in Coimbatore. Following this, senior police officers were directed to check the alertness of the city police force.

292,2020/03/19,"Captain and coach understand importance of my playing style, says Pujara","Pujara finds the constant fuss over his strike rate a tad unfair and wants to clarify once and for all.

Cheteshwar Pujara finds the constant fuss over his strike rate a tad unfair and wants to clarify once and for all that he has got full backing of the team management which understands the “importance” of his style of play.

Also read: Cheteshwar Pujara: Have got better at dealing with failure

In the age of slam-bang cricket, Pujara brings delight to the purists of the game by batting on and on without worrying too much about the strike-rate. But to appreciate someone who epitomises patience in Test cricket is may be asking for too much from the “millennials”.

Last week, the soft-spoken 32-year-old from Rajkot found himself at the receiving end again on social media as he laboured his way to 66 off 237 balls in the Ranji Trophy final against Bengal.

To his credit, he overcame fever and throat infection to share a game-changing stand with Arpit Vasavada, helping Saurashtra to their maiden title on the basis of first innings lead.

Whether it is playing for Saurashtra or India, Pujara is used to constant chatter around his strike-rate.

“I don’t think there is too much talk (on the inside). In media, it is described differently but the team management has been backing me on this completely. There is no pressure from the captain, coach or anyone else,” Pujara, who is currently getting much-needed family time due to the COVID-19 outbreak, told PTI.

Also read: Cheteshwar Pujara: You become even more determined once you are benched

“I just want to clarify that when it comes to strike rate people start pointing towards team management’s take on it but there is no pressure on me at all. The team management understands my style of play and its importance.”

Perception counts

For someone who averages 48.66 in 77 Tests, perception counts for little.

“The question that was asked on social media (during Ranji final) was ‘why am I taking so long to score X number of runs’? Whether I pay attention to that, no, I don’t. My job is to make sure that the team wins at all times.

“People have this tendency to pinpoint one person but it is just not about me. If you look at any Test series where I have scored runs and taken little bit of time, the opposition batsmen, most of them, have consumed same number of balls.

“I know I can’t be a David Warner or Virender Sehwag but if a normal batsman takes time there is nothing wrong in that.”

Also read: Ranji Trophy 2019-20: Pujara, Jackson too hot for Karnataka

The entire batting unit had a tough time in New Zealand with the 0-2 loss in Tests marking the end of the international season. Pujara collected five half centuries this season, including one in New Zealand, but could not add to his 18 hundreds.

“People expect big knocks from me. I always challenge myself to score a 100 but to average close to 50 in Tests means you are scoring a half-century almost every second innings.

“My standards are always high and I am not satisfied with the season that I had but I would not call it a bad one at all.”

Batting long excites Pujara

It may be boring and exhausting for majority of the fans, batting time and wearing out the opposition excites Pujara the most. Asked why they don’t make it like him any more, Pujara gave a practical response.

“I don’t think it is on the decline (art of batting time). There is value for it. May be the youngsters are not inclined towards this format. It is a fact that there are more games in white-ball cricket. A youngster would want to play shorter formats because it is financially better.

“There is nothing wrong with that but they should understand that real cricket is Test cricket and you will be judged only on the performances in the five-day game.”

With uncertainty over the upcoming county season in the U.K. due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Pujara has no game time lined up in the near future. The biggest international assignment for him this season is the tour of Australia and he can’t be more fired up for that.

Rather than focusing on the loss in New Zealand, Pujara looked at the Australian challenge, especially after India’s historic triumph Down Under last year.

“It is one of the most important series for us.”

On playing a full-strength Australia this time, he said: “They (Smith and Warner) are important players but if we played the way we played in the last series, we should be able to beat them.

“Fast bowlers have to be fresh and ready for that series and I am sure their workload will be managed. Best part about the tour is that we recently played in Australia (2018-19). I feel that is the biggest advantage for us.”

Pujara acknowledges that no team, including India, is doing consistently well overseas and picked the reducing pool of quality Test cricketers as the reason for this trend.

“The importance of limited overs cricket has increased significantly. You are not getting too many quality Test players. Earlier, there was a lot of importance given to a Test series. Players used to take ample rest before that. Now we see so many injuries during the season.

“If you look India, Australia, England, the pool of players will be not more than 20-25 whereas if you talk about 10 years ago, India used to have 30-50 players who were ready for Test cricket. I am not saying there are no players available. But if they are ready for Test cricket or not, that is the question.”

Over the past 24 months, India have lost Test series in England, South Africa and New Zealand. Pujara said the batsmen’s shot selection could have been better in New Zealand where they were completely outplayed.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/4a4puc/article31108932.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PUJARA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/captain-and-coach-understand-importance-of-my-playing-style-says-pujara/article31108933.ece
293,2020/03/19,"COVID-19 impact: ECB suspends recreational cricket, discusses ways to save county season","“This extends to training, pre-season friendlies and any associated cricket activity.”

The England and Wales cricket Board has discussed “contingency plans” to save the upcoming county season amid the rapidly-growing COVID-19 pandemic and suspended all recreational cricket, including pre-season friendlies and training.

According to a report in ‘ESPNCricinfo’, the ECB had a video call with county chief executives to discuss ways to ensure that the event’s April 12 start can be stuck to.

The meeting will resume on Thursday “to make decisions about inevitable postponements and cancellations due to the COVID-19 pandemic which is certain to have a significant effect on the shape of the English home season”.

According to the report, measures such as scaling down the championship, have it behind closed doors and shrinking the duration were discussed during the call. The county season runs till September.

In a statement issued on Wednesday, the ECB said “it is with sadness and reluctance that we recommend that all forms of recreational cricket are for now suspended.”

“This extends to training, pre-season friendlies and any associated cricket activity,” it added.

England is now among the worst-affected by the coronavirus spread, which has led to more than 8,000 deaths and has left over 200,000 infected. In the United Kingdom, the number of dead is above 100 with over 50,000 infected.

“Sport plays an absolutely vital role in the nation’s mental and physical wellbeing, and it helps people find meaning where there is fear and uncertainty, so one of our goals in the coming weeks will be to explore ways that we can support some levels of physical activity in communities — particularly at junior levels,” the ECB stated.

“Using our cricket community to support others could be one of the most important services we can offer during the difficult next few months.

“It will be critical that any decisions we do make are medically-led. And we will continue to work with Government and their advisors to ensure we are informed by science in our decision making,” it added.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/rqt64f/article31106251.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LORDSCRICKETGROUND,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/covid-19-impact-ecb-suspends-recreational-cricket-discusses-ways-to-save-county-season/article31106252.ece

295,2020/03/19,Meagre returns for openers in Ranji Trophy,"Wasim Jaffer attributes it to delayed start and lack of adaptation time

From Arun Lal to Wasim Jaffer, Abhinav Mukund to Vikram Rathour, Shiv Sundar Das to Surendra Bhave, opening batsmen have emerged as run-machines in the Ranji Trophy over the years. But the recently-concluded edition threw up a startling fact — not a single opener featured in the top-20 run-getters.

In fact, the highest tally by an opener came from Goa’s Sumiran Amonkar (24th with 646 runs), who played in Plate Group, the lowest rung. Each of the last 20 editions of the tournament has seen at least one opener in the top-five run-getters.

So what has led to the drastic change in the openers’ numbers? Jaffer believes a delayed start to the tournament is a “major reason”.

Aiding the bowlers

“Since the tournament started in December this time around, the conditions were in favour of pace bowlers. Earlier we used to start in October and the conditions would be even,” Jaffer, the former India opener who retired recently as the highest run-getter in Ranji history, tells The Hindu.

Not just in the north, but a majority of places are so cold that it works against batsmen, especially openers. Add to that the SG ball that aids bowlers and has made life difficult for openers.”

India-A players struggle

Vijay Dahiya, the former India wicketkeeper-batsman who also coached Delhi to its last Ranji title in 2007-08, doesn’t see the late start as a factor, but is worried about the lack of runs from the likes of Priyank Panchal and Abhimanyu Easwaran.

The duo, a regular with India-A for the last couple of seasons, had a miserable season.

While Panchal, who plays for Gujarat, tallied 457 runs from 17 innings at 28.57, Abhimanyu, who led Bengal to the final, scored just 258 runs from the same number of innings at 17.20.

Ranji trophy | Saurashtra’s win a culmination of its rich cricketing history

“A worrying trend is that some of the regular openers who have been playing for India-A haven’t been able to score runs in the Ranji Trophy. I am not sure on what basis will they be persisted with the next time an India-A or Rest of India squad is picked,” says Dahiya, a regular in commentary crew for domestic cricket.

TN coach’s take

D. Vasu, Tamil Nadu’s coach, feels the absence of established batsmen in a few games has also played a role in the low returns.

“Senior players in a few sides were coming in and going out. Even for Tamil Nadu, we struggled to get an opener. Murali Vijay went out and then Abhinav Mukund didn’t play a few games,” Vasu says.

“We had issues because of that. Once the senior batsmen go out, getting replacements becomes a problem.”

Jaffer concludes by pointing out the lack of time to prepare ahead of the tournament after a prolonged white-ball season.

No breather

For the last couple of years, the inter-State domestic season has started with the Vijay Hazare Trophy and moved to Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, leaving barely a week for the players to prepare with the red ball.

“After playing one-dayers and T20s, if you start Ranji Trophy in eight or 10 days, you are bound to struggle. Even the best find it difficult to cope with the change in the formats and suddenly if you enter Ranji Trophy in that kind of weather, it’s bound to be challenging for the openers.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/shb5i3/article31102373.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19WJ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/meagre-returns-for-openers-in-ranji-trophy/article31102374.ece

Tamil Nadu's Janani Narayanan and Vrinda Rathi of Mumbai were named in the International Panel of ICC Development Umpires on Wednesday. The announcement comes soon after the launch of 100% Cricket, a 12-month campaign to build on the momentum of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup 2020.

A software engineer, Janani wrote her umpiring exams in 2015 before officiating in the TNCA league.

Speaking to The Hindu, she said, “I have not played cricket but always wanted to be associated with the game. I could write my exams only in 2015 because women were not allowed before that.”

The 34-year-old said she idolises the late David Shepherd of England and retired India umpire S. Venkatraghavan. Janani has been umpiring in Indian domestic tournaments since 2018.

“It feels great to know that Vrinda and I have been inducted into the ICC's development panel. This gives me the chance to learn from seniors on the circuit and improve in the years to come. Cricket has become part of my daily routine since the 90s, and I look forward to being associated with the sport at a higher level,” said Janani.

Vrinda, 31, a former varsity player who has kept scores in international matches, has also been umpiring in Indian domestic cricket from 2018. She was inspired to take up umpiring after watching retired woman umpire Kathy Cross of New Zealand at the Women’s World Cup 2013.

“I feel privileged to be named in ICC’s development panel as this opens new avenues for me. I am sure I will get to learn a lot from other members of the panel and look forward to future assignments,"" said Vrinda. “Having played cricket and also officiated as a scorer, this was a natural progression for me and I am happy at the way things unfolded.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/yc4rov/article31102415.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19UMPIRES,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/janani-vrinda-named-in-international-panel-of-icc-development-umpires/article31102416.ece

Delhi has begun stamping the forearms of people, who have been advised home quarantine in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

In a crackdown on people who have been advised home quarantine but are found travelling/mingling in public, authorities have begun stamping the hands of people with an indelible ink similar to the one used to mark voters.

Most of them have a travel history.

In Delhi, people arriving at the Indira Gandhi International Airport from abroad are being checked for COVID-19, and if directed to remain at home, are being stamped ‘Home Quarantined’. It also states “Proud to protect Delhiites. Home quarantined,” and has a date showing when the person was stamped.

“We started stamping people, who are directed at the airport to be home quarantined, from yesterday [Wednesday] evening,” a Delhi government official told The Hindu.

People coming from abroad have to undergo two different medical checks and they are stamped at the second screening point at the airport, run by the Delhi government. The first test is done by the airport authorities for visible symptoms, where, after an initial thermal screening, symptomatic passengers are isolated and moved to designated hospitals. Others move to the second screening point, where they are either home quarantined or sent to a quarantine facility run by the government, depending on risk factors.

Uttar Pradesh, the most populous State, also today began stamping people who need to be home quarantined at airports, according to Principal Secretary (Health) Amit Mohan Prasad. ""Proud to help my countrymen stay free from Coronavirus. Home quarantined,"" the stamp in Hindi roughly translates.

One of the first States to swing into action has been Maharashtra, where four people who were travelling from Mumbai to Surat were deboarded at Palghar from on board the Garib Rath train from Bandra to New Delhi when co-passengers raised an alarm and the Train Ticket Examiners (TTE) noticed their stamps. All four had arrived from Germany.

The episode prompted railway authorities to decide not to allow passengers with ‘Home Quarantined’ stamping on hand to travel in trains, and TTEs have been authorised to de-board them.

On Monday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation began stamping the hands of those advised to undergo home quarantine, stating, “Proud to protect Mumbaikars.

Over three weeks after riots broke out in the Capital, the number of victims currently residing at the Idgah relief camp in Mustafabad has touched 870, said Delhi Waqf Board, who had set up the camp.

“By the first week of March, we started the process of writing down names and details of those residing in the camp. Initially, the number was around 550 and by Tuesday night, it went upto 870,” said Mohammed Imran, media coordinator [Idgah relief camp] and Nodal Officer of Delhi Waqf Board.

While many who owned houses in riot-affected areas have started to return, Mr. Imran is of the view that the number of people residing in the camp is high because people only leave for a brief period and are returning. “People who had returned to their homes are coming back saying that they’ll finally leave the camp once their burnt or vandalised houses are in order,” he said.

“People are coming back saying that they were staying at relatives’ houses,” he said.

Relief measures planned

The Board, he said, has planned to give ration for three months, ₹1 lakh to owners whose houses have been burnt and vandalised and ₹60,000 to tenants.

When asked about the ration distribution, Mr. Imran said that the Board has taken the addresses of those who own houses and the ration will be given when they go back to their houses. Those on rent are also sharing their address. “In case, they shift to another place, they have been asked to share the new address,” he said.

The plan is to ensure everyone leaves the camp feeling safe and secure, he said. “An Assistant Sub Inspector rank officer had visited the camp on Wednesday and spoke to the victims.

The Delhi High Court on Wednesday directed the government to expedite the process of DNA test of a charred body recovered from the side of Khajuri Pushta Road following the Delhi riots, to ascertain the identity.

Justice Navin Chawla ordered the government to complete the test within 15 days and to communicate the result with the petitioner, whose 20-year-old son went missing on February 25 during the riots.

Sajid Ali, in his petition, claimed that his son, Mohsin Ali, had left their shop in Noida’s Sector 5, on February 25 towards Green Gardens on Khajuri Pushta Road, around 5 p.m. in the evening and has not returned since then.

“Khajuri Pushta Road is en-route Green Gardens. However, upon receiving news of continued violence in that area, Mohsin’s family started calling him to enquire about his safety and well-being, but could not reach him,” the plea said.

The family members went to the Sector 20 police station for filing a missing complaint the next morning. They were returned and asked to file the complaint at Khajuri Khas Police Station since the area fell within its jurisdiction.

When the uncle and brother of Mohsin went to West Karawal Nagar looking for Mohsin, they were informed by the police personnel and security forces manning the area that a car of their description has been burnt on Khajuri Pushta Road. The brother and uncle reached the spot and identified the car. However, Mohsin or his body was not found, the plea said.

Later, they were informed by the police that a burnt body was found next to the car.

Refused to give body

The police informed the family members that since the body is in a charred condition and no conclusive identification is possible without a DNA test, the body could be handed over only after confirming its identity through a DNA profiling and identification test.

The petition stated that it has been almost 22 days since Mohsin went missing. And, it has been more than 14 days since the DNA samples were sent for examination and results.

316,2020/03/19,Keeping children engaged at home a task for parents,"With schools shut, many finding it difficult to manage children’s ‘vacation’

With schools, cinema halls and other amenities closed by the government in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak, several parents said that keeping children locked inside houses was turning out to be a “tough job” even as “family time” had increased.

Amid the COVID-19 scare, which has also led to most parents getting work-from-home directives from their respective offices, keeping children engaged with “constructive activities” has proven to be quite a task.

Mitali Basu, a homemaker, said that managing a six-year-old along with another child who is currently appearing for his board examinations, has been difficult.

“Apart from schools shutting down, what has hit the most is that the child also cannot be sent for extra-curricular activities. Constantly being restricted inside the house is also making the child impatient and we cannot figure out a way to divert all that energy in a constructive manner. We have also reduced her outings to the park as we want limited exposure for now. All that we can provide to her right now is activity books and other such things as we also do not want her to start watching television all day long,” said Ms. Basu.

Rediscovering games

Taking a break from games on mobile phones and other devices, several kids in a south Delhi neighbourhood have rediscovered “hopscotch”. “When our normal routines are on, our playtime is restricted. Now that we are at home all throughout the day, we needed new games that we could try. Our parents suggested that we try out hopscotch and that’s why we have made the numbered boxes in our lanes. Earlier, badminton in winters was the only outdoor activity we had,” said 12-year-old Shalini Mathur.

Shishir Deo, a parent who has been working from home said, “We have taken to playing board games with our daughters. They are loving it as it is quality family time together.”

Mr. Deo’s daughters Aisha and Alaiya said, “We have google classes in the morning and zoom calls and after finishing school work we go down to the park to cycle and then at night play board games or watch TV.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/keeping-children-engaged-at-home-a-task-for-parents/article31103328.ece
317,2020/03/19,‘Prepared to tackle virus menace’,"Safdarjung Hospital’s medical superintendent says coordinated effort has helped keep numbers low

Central government’s Safdarjung Hospital currently has the highest load of admitted COVID-19 patients and suspected cases in the country. The hospital is in the forefront of dealing directly with the novel virus, which in four months has spread across 114 countries.

On Wednesday, India had 145 active cases, three deaths and 14 discharges.

Safdarjung Hospital’s medical superintendent Balvinder Singh speaks to Bindu Shajan Perappadan about how one of the busiest and most packed hospital’s in the country is coping with treating COVID-19 patients while trying to keep its staff and other patients safe from this highly contagious virus.

Delhi has so far seen a small number of COVID-19 cases. Are we heading towards a sudden rise in numbers? What is your advice to the public?

India had the advantage of an early warning unlike China where situation escalated rapidly. We also closed our international borders well in time. The coordinated efforts of the government, medical staff and public has contributed in keeping the numbers low till now.

The coming few days, however, are critical and we have to give it our best to delay or even prevent community transmission. Our hospital is prepared for a rise in numbers. While we are offering 75 beds now, we can quickly go up to 90 if the need arises.

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a new virus that had not been previously identified in humans. The virus causes respiratory illness (like flu) with symptoms such as cough, fever and in more severe cases, pneumonia.

So far, we know that we can protect ourselves by washing hands frequently and avoiding touching our face. Social distancing and other measures announced by the Central government need to be followed to ensure that limited transmission is possible.

What is the patient load that Safdarjung has on Wednesday and what are the facilities that are in place to treat COVID-19 patients?

Safdarjung Hospital currently has 32 persons in its COVID-19 facility. This includes 14 positive cases, three negative cases and 15 whose reports are awaited.

What we have done is created a city within a city or even a pocket within a pocket to keep the COVID-19 patients. They are completely cut-off from the rest of the patients, staff and hospital. Our super-speciality wing has been pressed into service where eight floors are dedicated for COVID-19. We have a state-of-the-art ICU with nine beds and floors 3, 4 in the building are currently hosting cases. Each patient is allocated a single room as we currently have patients who are COVID-19 positive and those who are negative but have travel history or contact with a positive person.

Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital is sending its COVID-19 positive patients to us. The wards have been prepared (ventilation and sanitation) as per World Health Organization guidelines.

What is the staff strength that has been diverted for COVID-19 and is there a back-up staff team that has been made ready?

We have a dedicated team of eight specialities, 60 senior and junior resident doctors and 100 nurses. We have also specially hired 100 sanitation staff. We have a back-up staff team. The staff is provided with all safety equipment. Two stores (general and surgical items) are opened round-the-clock to cater to any needs for any hospital items.

We have also brought in additional security staff and pressed into action our ambulance services when need arises.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/prepared-to-tackle-virus-menace/article31103318.ece

With several videos surfacing on social media showing frustrated flyers waiting at the Delhi airport in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak, the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) on Wednesday said that the videos were old and that normal operations had resumed.

“The videos being circulated are old. Currently, all immigration-related processes have been streamlined and operations are normal. We continue to work in close coordination with all stakeholders to minimise any inconvenience to passengers,” the DIAL said in a tweet. In the videos, passengers can be heard complaining that they have been waiting at the airport for a long time.

People coming to India have to undergo two medical check-ups at the airport.

The first test is done by airport authorities for visible symptoms. After initial thermal screening, symptomatic passengers are isolated and moved to designated hospitals.

Asymptomatic passengers are allowed to move to designated immigration counters with passports and a copy of the self-reporting form, said officials.

After clearance of immigration, the passports of the passengers are retained by the Immigration officials. In batches of 30, the passengers are taken by an escort team to a designated triage area run by Delhi government officials.

The passengers are screened again and those without any risk factors are sent for home quarantine, and handed over their passports. High-risk passengers identified for quarantine are asked to opt for either a paid hotel quarantine facility or a government quarantine facility, and then shifted to the location.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nwiws8/article31105273.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18bm-Aditya-GoAG2P78RMHR3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/videos-of-people-stuck-at-airport-old-says-dial/article31103212.ece

321,2020/03/19,Got mild symptoms? Stay home,"Private doctors are advising people to self-quarantine

Private practitioners in the city are advising patients who have mild flu-like conditions to take symptomatic treatment and not get worried. As per current government guidelines, only patients with a history of travel to certain countries and contact with individuals affected by COVID-19 should be recommended for screening, said doctors.

Given that the virus leads to symptoms similar to regular flu, including sore throat, cough, mucus build-up etc., doctors said that many patients were anxious about their condition.

Rajat Agarwal, head of critical care at Fortis Escorts, said, “There are two reasons we advise patients with such conditions to not come to the hospital. One, if they are in fact carrying the virus they could pass it on to others at the hospital. Two, if they do not have the virus, they might catch it from someone else in the hospital.”

“Instead, such patients, especially those who have recently travelled to Europe, the Middle East, and China, are advised to self quarantine and take certain precautions. These include staying in a single room with an attached bathroom, have clothes washed separately, and wear a mask,” he said.

‘Do not panic’

R.S. Mihra, a general practitioner in Saket, also advised people with mild flu symptoms to not panic.

“There is no need for unnecessary visits to the doctor. The steps taken by the government to combat COVID-19 are assuring, and there is awareness among the public,” added Dr. Mihra.

While providing diagnosis over the telephone is not allowed in India, some doctors said they were asking patients, who called for an appointment, to stay at home in case of mild symptoms.

“Telephonic diagnosis is a grey area. Over the phone, we are simply relaying ICMR advisory,” said a doctor requesting anonymity.

At government hospitals, however, individuals presenting even mild flu-like symptoms are being recommended for screening, said Shivaji Dev Barman, president of the Residents’ Doctors’ Association. “This is being done to slow down the progress of the virus to stage three: community transmission,” he added.

Hospitals restrict services

Meanwhile, All India Institute Of Medical Sciences issued an advisory to OPD patients on Wednesday asking them to postpone their appointments, unless they were urgent in nature.

322,2020/03/19,It’s business as usual at hotels providing quarantine facilities,"Delhi govt. has asked three hotels to set aside rooms to battle COVID-19 outbreak

At 1.30 p.m. on Wednesday, around 15 people were eating at a restaurant located on the ground floor of the ibis Hotel in Aerocity, while several guests in the lobby tried to check-in or out.

There were no signs that the hotel is providing paid quarantine facility.

On Monday, the government had announced that people who are unsatisfied with government quarantine facilities could pay a capped rate to stay at either ibis Hotel, or Lemon Tree Premier, or Red Fox — all located near the airport. The hotels have earmarked separate entries and lifts for the quarantined.

They are being accommodated on dedicated floors and a separate set of employees is looking after their needs. The guests cannot step out of their rooms or use any other facility in the hotels. Food is also given to them in disposable plates and cutlery, and it is delivered outside their rooms to avoid contact.

“The waste from these rooms is treated as biomedical waste and is disposed of by a company hired by the Delhi government. We have ensured that the quarantined will not come in contact with other guests,” said Additional district magistrate (south) D. Karthikeyan.

At ibis Hotel, the quarantined guests are not being offered laundry facilities due to safety concerns, but the hotel said it is working on solving the issue. “Ibis has not become a hotel completely for quarantine, but a fully functional hotel providing quarantine facility,” said an employee of the hotel.

According to the Delhi government, 92 rooms on the sixth floor of the ibis hotel have been isolated for quarantine facilities.

On Monday afternoon, around 40 people were checked by doctors at the hotel. Many were advised to self quarantine at home, and some opted for government facilities. Only three people decided to stay at the hotel.

On Wednesday, eight people were being quarantined in the three hotels.

Five are Indians, two are Chinese nationals and one is a United Nations Diplomat, Mr. Karthikeyan said.

“There is medical team here, and they check them for any symptoms at least two times a day,” he added.

At 3.30 p.m., security staff outside Lemon Tree Premier said that there was no one quarantined at the hotel.

“On Monday night, a bus with 20 people had come, but no one went inside or stayed at the hotel. They left after preliminary checks by the doctors,” an employee said. According to the government, 54 rooms on the fifth floor of the hotel have been reserved for quarantine facilities.

“Ibis DIAL is providing full assistance to the Delhi government with regards to medical care and observation for guests returning from abroad... we are closely following the strictest hygiene and sanitation procedures and government requirements,” the hotel said in a statement.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/fglozq/article31103115.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19DEIBIS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/its-business-as-usual-at-hotels-providing-quarantine-facilities/article31103116.ece
323,2020/03/19,Lady on a bicycle,"More than just a professor of German in Aligarh Muslim University, Renate Sarma will be remembered for her environmental concerns and her translations of voluminous works from German to English

Two enduring images define Renate Helga Brigitte Sarma (1941-2020) for people of Aligarh, one of a tall, white, European sari-clad woman, comfortably riding a bicycle in the entire length and breadth of the university campus and the other that of a stern, serious-looking teacher terribly busy with her classes, students and books, rarely indulging in any gossip or small talk. The ‘lady with her bicycle’ image defined her environmental concerns, her egalitarianism, and her vision of a university campus without the invasion of ugly and noisy automobile.

It was also her voice against the consumerist ethos in universities where everyone must of necessity own a car. Her husband, a professor of Sanskrit, an Indologist, a multilingual scholar, and a translator of difficult German texts was also often seen enjoying his walks, constitutional in his Joycean English, in a green campus, ‘the best University campus in the country’, as the university professor played by Manoj Bajpayee in the movie Aligarh describes it.

Renate Sarma herself contributed in a big way to make the campus lush, verdant and beautiful with flowers of rare varieties blossoming everywhere. As member-in-charge of Land, Gardens and Parks, her duty involved taking care of the shrubs, plants, trees and land on the campus. Her contribution was to build flower beds and grow rare flowers on both sides of the roads in the university. Undoubtedly, one can partake of a sense serenity and peace on the university roads but only if one is walking or cycling as she used to do. And she loved this campus so much that once back from a visit to a relatively big city in Uttar Pradesh, which she found very congested, she remarked, “Thank God! we live in Aligarh”.

Most of her students remember her total commitment to teaching German in the afternoon in the Faculty of Arts. In the later part of her career, she even took one year’s leave for academic pursuits in 1992-93 to work on her project of developing software for teaching German language. Not limited to teaching German language alone, she also taught iconic German novelist Thomas Mann to English Literature students and was a reliable source to offer a comparative perspective on the source German and English translations of classic texts of German literature. Her view was that Kafka in German is even more difficult than in English translations.

Born in Homberg, a small town in Germany, and having been educated at Homberg, Marburg, and Berlin, she also met her future husband Sreermula Rajeswara Sarma in her native country where he had come to pursue his doctorate. Renate Sarma worked for two years as Language Assistant at the College of Wooster, Ohio where earlier she had also been a Fulbright Scholar. She spent another two years as language trainee at Kassel before she found her moorings at Aligarh Muslim University both as a university teacher with varied interests and a family-oriented woman.

Both Renate and Sreermula Rajeswara joined Aligarh Muslim University in 1969, she as a lecturer in German in the Department of English and Modern European Languages and he as a lecturer in the Department of Sanskrit. She went on to become a senior lecturer and a reader before her retirement in July 2003. In between her engagement with teaching, she also nurtured the creative interests of students as president of Hobbies Workshop and helped the University with her work as the manager of university’s Abdullah Nursery and Primary School. A great lover of India and its literary traditions, she earned her PhD early in her career in 1972 on R.K Narayan from Marburg, Germany.

Her publications were on diverse subjects ranging from Indian English novelist R.K.Narayan to black American writer James Baldwin, from German novelists Thomas Mann’s magnum opus “Buddenbrooks” and Gunter Grass’s classic “The Tin Drum” to incisive reviews of books on medicine and science. She was a very fastidious editor and many error-free issues of “The Aligarh Journal of English Studies”’ owe their perfection to her work with the journal as a key member of its editorial board.

Her sincerity and hard work are also reflected in her remarkable work as a translator of voluminous works from German to English. She translated Horst Kruger’s “Indian Nationalists and the World Proletariat”. A tome of more than 500 pages, this work, as historian Ishrat Alam, formerly a Member Secretary of Indian Council of Historical Research which published this, informs was assigned to her by eminent historian Irfan Habib, incidentally another environmentally- conscious professor known for riding his bicycle in the campus. Such was Renate’s competence and seriousness that she translated this doorstopper in just three months. A family friend of Sarmas, Alam also informs how Renate’s father faced persecution at the hands of Hitler’s Nazi Party which partly explains her love for India’s liberal and tolerant traditions.

She remained active as a translator even after her retirement. Together with her husband Sreermula Rajeswara Sarma, she translated Fuat Sezgin’s five-volume “Science and Technology in Islam” (2010) which includes History of Arabic-Islamic Sciences and some other interesting titles.

‘Beware the ides of March’, cries the soothsayer in Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar”. On the ides of March came the sad news of her death from oesophageal cancer. Survived by her husband and son, Renate Sarma’s death has left Aligarh Muslim University poorer.

325,2020/03/19,Places of worship issue advisories,"Congregation to be limited, with prayer time reduced

Places of worship cutting across faiths began to put in place measures to tackle the coronavirus scare. With a large number of congregations expected at mosques on Friday, masjid managing committees and religious organisations issued instructions for shortened prayer time. They also announced the cancellation of the Shab-e-Meraj, popularly known as jaagne ki raat, gatherings.

In an advisory issued over its WhatsApp group, the Mahmood Habib Masjid and Islamic Centre removed the lecture before Friday prayers, barred handshake and close physical contact, permanently closed toilets, the ablution area, and restricted the participants of a congregation to 15.

The masjid advisory also included instructions to all to stay at home for at least a fortnight if either they, or somebody from the household had a history of international travel.

Speaking to The Hindu, the khateeb of the mosque Mirza Yawar Baig said, “It is not only about saving yourself but also about acting responsibly so that others are not harmed. This pandemic, if we do the right thing and act with compassion, should bring us close as neighbours, and fellow citizens.”

The Jamiat-e-Ulama Telangana Andhra Pradesh, an organisation of clerics, directed mosques, which are under its control, to ensure cleanliness of toilets and a thorough cleaning of prayer mats and carpets. Noted cleric Hafiz Peer Shabbir, who is the president of the body, said, “We have directed masjids to ensure that skull caps are not available. Instructions have been issued to reduce the prayer times. Non-obligatory prayers should be offered at home. We are encouraging ablutions to be done at home.”

The Jamaat-e-Islami Telangana and Odhisha zone has appealed to masjid managing committees to limit the the total prayer time, including the sermon, to 15 minutes for the next three consecutive Fridays. The organisation also urged the mosque administration to comply with advisories and instructions issued by the Health department. “Those who have symptoms of the virus are instructed not to come to the masjids,” an excerpt from the advisory reads.

With Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao directing the mosques, churches and temples to take steps to curtail movement of people, heads of churches are likely to adhere to the decision after a meeting on Friday.

“Safety and health of people coming to the churches is of paramount importance to us. We will meet on Friday to take stock of the situation and decide on the scheduled Sunday and other mass gatherings.

The Medak diocese has already issued direction to the congregation to do away with distribution of holy wine from Chalice and instead use small cups. In view of the prevailing situation, the church services have seen dwindling crowd.

Reverend Swarna Bernard, Vicar-General of Archdiocese of Hyderabad said a circular had been issued sometime ago advising the congregation that it was not obligation to attend the holy services on Sundays and other days. “We have already asked those above 60 years to avoid coming for the service. People are exempted from attending the Sunday mass and we are encouraging only small gatherings,” he said. But the Archdiocese was expected to give another advisory to its member churches shortly.

327,2020/03/19,ATA urges families to accommodate Telugu students in need,"With universities suspending classes in the United States and asking students to move out of the hostels, Telugu associations in the United States are asking Telugu families to accommodate students in need for living space.

The American Telugu Association (ATA) has sent a mail to all its members and other Telugu households asking if they can accommodate students for some time before the classes resume. ATA president Parmesh Bheemreddy said that it was a voluntary effort and the mail was getting some response from families willing to help the Telugu students in need.

A form sent to the ATA members asked if they were willing to host students, what kind of students, whether girls or boys and the number of days they could host them in their homes. Mr. Bheemreddy said the response was positive and they were working with the Indian embassy as well to help students who were in real need for accommodation.

Though most of the Indian students pursuing Masters courses stay outside the campus in flats along with their friends and classmates, there are quite a few who prefer campus accommodation. “Our effort is to extend help to whoever is in dire need,” he said.

Given the scary situation it becomes difficult for families to host unknown people in view of the spread of coronavirus. Most families seem to be willing to host girl students and also realising that they can’t move to friends’ flats as easily as boys do, a senior member of ATA said.

Other Telugu organisations like the Telugu Association of North America (TANA) and local chapters are also chipping in with assistance to reach out to Telugu community in the USA.

Celebrations may be hit

The bi-annual celebrations of the ATA to be held in Los Angeles from July 3 to 5 this year may see the coronavirus affect with travel plans of invitees, celebrities and participants likely to be hit with visa restrictions and airlines availability.

The ATA team is not sure how it shapes out given the growing threat of corona. “As of now the present dates stand but we will review the situation when required given the enormous restrictions around,” Mr. Bheemreddy said.

The celebrations see participation of thousands from across the USA and also India and other parts of the world. The programmes are centred on the celebrities and politicians that provide a platform for discussions, debates centred around developments in the Telugu States.

The Minister cautioned people to take the advisories of the government seriously and try to stay indoors. Mr. Rajender spoke about the coronavirus crisis and deaths in Italy and said that if proper precautions were taken in the State, a similar situation could be avoided.

The Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) has transported as many as 149 persons from the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) to quarantine centres in Vikarabad and Dhulapally, so far.

The RTC used the 20 seater Vajra air-conditioned buses to transport people showing symptoms to these centres. RTC officials said that buses were being regularly sanitised.

In a separate development, the Cyberabad Police, acting on an additional advisory by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, extended the compulsory quarantine for a minimum period of 14 days for passengers coming from UAE, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait.

Passengers from Turkey, countries of the European Union and European Free Trade Association and United Kingdom to India, have been barred. These measures will be in force till March 31.

Airline operators have been directed to inform passengers about the directions and quarantine policy.

332,2020/03/19,Coronavirus | 750 foreign returnees in Hyderabad to be home quarantined for 2 weeks,"‘In case they are found to be negligent, they will be shifted to government quarantine facilities forthwith’

People who have returned to the city recently from listed foreign countries with rampant coronavirus outbreak will have to home quarantine themselves for the next 14 days without fail. In case they are found to be negligent of this regulation, and roaming free outside, they will be shifted to the designated government quarantine facilities forthwith, officials informed.

Already, details of over 750 people, who have returned from these countries to the city, have been made available to the district administration by the Immigration officials. The countries include China, South Korea, France, Italy, Iran, Germany, Spain, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and Oman. A total of 150 three-member teams, one for each ward in GHMC area, will visit the homes of all foreign returnees every day, to make them aware about the spread of COVID-19 and also to check upon the persons concerned.

The teams will have members drawn from Health, GHMC and Police departments, officials informed. The Revenue department too was roped in initially, but it had to be exempted owing to the existing work load.

“Though details of foreign returnees since January 15 have been collected, the focus of the visiting teams will be mainly on those returning within the last 15 days. They need to be monitored on a daily basis,” said an official unwilling to be identified.

While the practice adopted by Maharashtra to stamp the left hand of all those under home quarantine is not under consideration here, implementation of the home isolation will be strictly watched over.

In case any of the foreign returnees or their family members present with symptoms of COVID-19, home quarantine will not be an option for them. They will be immediately shifted to the designated quarantine facilities.

If no symptoms are present, such persons will be allowed free after 14 days of watch. While officials are unwilling to disclose details about locality-wise distribution of the identified persons, they said concentrations are high in a few areas, up to 100 to 150, which could put more pressure on certain teams in terms of daily visits. “We will continue to get updates about latest returnees from the Immigration, and take necessary action accordingly,” informed the official.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/e5wkg5/article31103149.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-CORONA-MAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/750-foreign-returnees-to-be-home-quarantined-for-2-weeks/article31103141.ece
333,2020/03/19,Preventive steps at market yards,"Officials told to coordinate with civic body for sanitation

In the wake of the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in the country, the TS Agricultural Marketing Department has decided to implement preventive measures in all market yards by maintaining hygienic conditions and ensuring proper sanitation.

Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy has instructed the officials to display posters on the care to be taken by farmers who come to markets for disposal of their produce.

The officials were told to coordinate with the local civic body officials to ensure proper sanitation in case the farmer turnout is high.

According to officials, there are 187 agricultural market committee yards and 89 sub-yards across Telangana. Besides, there are 36 Rythu bazaars in the State.

The officials have been told to take extra care about hygiene at drinking water points, canteens and toilets.

They were asked to educate all those involved in the functioning of market yards – Hamalis, farmers and other labourers as also officials, to not gather at one place.

Further, the officials have been told to make available soaps and water to wash hands and make announcements frequently, through the public address system, about preventive measures to be taken against the spread of coronavirus.

The officials at Gaddi Annaram, Bowenpally, Malakpet, Gudi Malkapur, Miryalguda, Enumamula, Khammam, Jammikunta, Gajwel, Siddipet, Nizamabad and Adilabad market yards and Rythu bazaars, were told to be extra cautious as these places are heavily crowded with farmers and consumers.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/preventive-steps-at-market-yards/article31103128.ece
334,2020/03/19,Kavitha files nomination for MLC post,"BJP fields Laxminarayana while Congress is yet to name its candidate

TRS president and Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao has finalised the candidature of Ms. Kalvakuntla Kavitha as the party’s nominee for the MLC seat under Nizamabad Local Bodies category.

Ms Kavitha filed nomination for the MLC post on Wednesday. Accompanied by Minister for Roads and Buildings V. Prashanth Reddy, MLAs and MLCs hailing from the integrated old district, former MP Ms. Kavitha submitted two sets of papers to the Collector and Returning Officer C. Narayana Reddy.

At one stage, it was believed that Ms Kavitha would be selected for the Rajya Sabha. However, after the party leadership proposed K. Kesava Rao and K.R. Suresh Reddy, her followers were disappointed. Given the strength of the TRS in the local bodies in the constituency comprising the integrated old district, her election seems to be a cake walk.

Out of a total of 824 voters, TRS alone has 532, registering 64.5%, while Congress has 140, and BJP 85.

Ms Kavitha will have 22-month term as MLC and is likely to be renominated after her terms ends in January 2022. She is now contesting for the remaining term of former MLC R. Bhupathi Reddy who forfeited his membership following his defection to the Congress.

Speaking to the media , Mr. Prashanth Reddy said KCR took the decision to field Ms. Kavitha taking into account the requests of all MLAs.

Before coming to file nomination, Ms. Kavitha called on Assembly Speaker P. Srinivas Reddy at his residence in Hyderabad.

Meanwhile, the BJP fielded P. Laxminarayana as its candidate. Mr. Laxminarayana, after his retirement from the Commercial Taxes Department, joined the party, and is the party’s BC cell and retired employees’ cell district president.

He also played a crucial role in Telangana agitation.

Though the Congress has decided to field its candidate, it has not yet named the candidate, with just a day to go for the last date for filing of nomination.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/8wgen5/article31102655.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY19BJP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/kavitha-files-nomination-for-mlc-post/article31102657.ece
335,2020/03/19,"Telangana releases ₹1,210 crore for crop loan waiver","About 5.84 lakh farmers likely to be benefited

The State government has given administrative sanction for release of ₹1,210 crore for implementing the first phase of crop loan waiver scheme – to repay the debt of farmers up to ₹25,000, including the principal amount and interest per family.

In his budget speech, Minister for Finance T. Harish Rao announced in the Legislative Assembly on March 8 that the State government had already made a provision to release ₹1,198 crore towards writing off the debt of farmers up to ₹25,000 during the month of March itself.

Budget release order

Accordingly, the Finance Department issued a budget release order for ₹1,210 crore on March 13.

In the orders issued on Wednesday, Secretary (Agriculture) B. Janardhan Reddy has given administrative sanction for the release of the amount towards meeting the expenditure for the scheme of debt relief to farmers (loan waiver).

It was mentioned in the budget that nearly 5.84 lakh farmers were preliminarily estimated to be covered in the first phase of loan waiver scheme.

The State government has issued guidelines for implementation of the scheme on Tuesday and as part of it, the commercial and cooperative banks have been asked to furnish the details of farmers having debt up to ₹25,000 as on December 11, 2018.

The village-level lists would then be scrutinised at mandal and district-level to avoid duplication as some farmers families avail crop loans from different banks and in different villages since some families would have landholding in more than one village.

Two-week time

Official sources stated that although the government has released the amount required for implementing the first phase of the loan waiver scheme, finalisation of the beneficiaries would consume a minimum of two weeks time.

After finalisation of the beneficiaries, village-wise lists the State Level Bankers Coordination Committee (SLBC) would give clearance for disbursement of cheques, which in all probability is expected to take place only in the month of April.

As decided, the cheques of the loan waiver would be handed over to the beneficiaries concerned personally by the legislators concerned as against the practice of release of money directly to banks to adjust it against the farmers debt.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/szqx1s/article31105498.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY19HARISH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/state-releases-1210-crore-for-crop-loan-waiver/article31102634.ece
336,2020/03/19,Kavitha’s re-entry may lead to new political developments,"A senior legislator on condition of anonymity says the Chief Minister has bigger plans for her

The unexpected nomination of Kavitha Kalvakuntla as the TRS MLC candidate from the Nizamabad local body elections, which she will surely win given the strength of the party, might lead to new political developments in the State.

Senior TRS leaders, who were expecting her to be nominated for Rajya Sabha, were surprised by the Chief Minister’s decision. Though her name cropped up several times, none of them believed it to be true as Legislative Council, they believed, was politically not considered the right place for her.

A senior MLA on condition of anonymity said her stature as a strong warrior in the Telangana movement and later as Parliament member doesn’t fit as a member in the Council. He expects that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has bigger plans and doesn’t rule out she being inducted into the State Cabinet in the near future.

Her nomination seems to be a bigger political move, and to send her from Nizamabad district is also a signal to the people who have defeated her in the last Lok Sabha elections.

“The CM wants to send a strong message that she will be the strongest politically not just in Nizamabad but in the entire north Telangana that has been the citadel of TRS party ever since it has been launched in 2001,” he argued.

A senior leader agreed that ever since she lost to BJP’s Arvind Dharmapuri in the last Lok Sabha elections, she has been maintaining stoic silence and literally stayed away from active politics. She now wants to come back from the same place where she served as an MP and lost, to regain the ground.

“It’s a kind of settling scores with BJP that is claiming her loss as Chief Minister’s loss.”

As an MLC, she will officially be among the people of north Telangana again participating in official programmes and get active politically ruling out criticism from the Opposition parties that she is being given importance as Chief Minister’s daughter. If inducted into the Cabinet her protocol ensures she will be above her political rivals.

The Turmeric Board issue that is considered to have played key role in her loss will be constantly in light as the BJP MP Arvind Dharmapuri has failed to fulfill his promise. Moreover, as a Minister, if inducted, she can wield enormous power in the region and that will help her regain her support, and her charisma will help the party to take on the BJP that is planning its expansion in the region with three sitting Members of Parliament.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/kavithas-re-entry-into-politics-may-lead-to-new-political-developments/article31102624.ece
337,2020/03/19,Revanth Reddy released on bail,"Malkajgiri Congress MP A. Revanth Reddy was set free from Charlapally Central Prison on Wednesday after Justice K. Lakshman of Telangana High Court granted him bail earlier in the day.

Observing that all the offences the MP was charged with were bailable, the judge said Mr. Reddy should not interfere with the investigation directly or indirectly. He should cooperate with the investigating officer, the judge said in the order.

The bail was being granted since Mr. Reddy is a public representative and as Parliament session is on, the judge stated. The MP was instructed to furnish a personal bond for ₹10,000 along with two sureties each of similar amount.

The MP was arrested by Narsingi police of Cyberabad on March 5 when he walked into the police station and picked up an argument with the officials as to why he was named in a criminal case relating to usage of drones to shoot farm-house of Minister K.T. Rama Rao. The MP, along with others, were booked for ‘using drones without permission to film the Minister’s farm-house and posing threat to his security’ on March 2. Public Prosecutor Pratap Reddy told the court the MP was arrested as he was not leaving the police station.

He was eventually presented before a local magistrate, who remanded him. Mr. Reddy filed three petitions, one seeking bail order, another to set aside the order remanding him in judicial custody and the third to quash the First Information Report (FIR) issued against him. With the HC granting him bail, the petition praying to set aside his remand order became infructuous.

The judge posted the third petition for hearing after four weeks.

Presenting his arguments, Supreme Court senior lawyer Salman Khurshid Alam Khan appearing for Mr. Revanth Reddy said all the sections of law invoked against the MP were bailable. Though Section 115 of the Indian Penal Code, which was added in the case against the MP by Rajendranagar Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court, was non-bailable, it cannot be applied in the present case, he argued. He brought it to the notice of the court that Justice G. Sridevi of the HC had earlier passed an interim direction to police not to take any coercive action against two other accused in the same case.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/revanth-reddy-released-on-bail/article31102606.ece
338,2020/03/19,"Coronavirus | Restaurants, hotels in Hyderabad have no plans to down shutters","‘Closure will worsen the business already looking down’

On a day when the National Restaurant Association of India asked its restaurant members to close dine-in facility following COVID-19 outbreak, the restaurants’ association in Hyderabad has taken a different path.

“We are not planning any advisory to close the restaurants and hotels in Hyderabad,” said S. Venkat Reddy, president of Telangana State Hotels Association on Wednesday.

‘Panic among workers’

“Our business is down. In the past three days, the footfall has have declined by 50%. Room bookings have also fallen. If the government orders us to close down, we will, but it should support us financially,” said Mr. Reddy. “There is panic among the workers. If we close, many of our staff will have to travel to their native places like Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar and Karnataka, and that will put them at risk,” he added.

While most of the restaurants stayed open, the upscale cafes and bistros saw sparse crowds in the city. The owner of a well known cafe in Banjara Hills said business was down by 40% on Sunday but, improved slightly on Monday. The owner of a snacks centre near Rajiv Gandhi International Airport said the business was down by 70%.

“We moved to Madhapur four days ago and business is thanda,” said Ali, owner of a restaurant that specialises in grilled food. “It will be easy for the government to order a closure but we will have to pay the rent, electricity bills, workers’ salaries and other expenses. That will affect us a lot,” said Mr. Ali.

“Restaurants will have no choice but to shut down if the government orders them. I came to know about restaurants and pubs being shut in the Gachibowli area. If the government decides to close restaurants for the safety of people, we will have to accept the decision,” said Ravikanth Reddy, an entrepreneur who runs a popular food blog.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/evk3fq/article31102593.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18-DAKSHINVILASRESTAURANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/restaurants-hotels-have-no-plans-to-down-shutters/article31102594.ece
339,2020/03/19,Revanth rues lack of support from party leaders,"Malkajgiri MP A. Revanth Reddy, who was released from the Cherlapally jail on Wednesday evening, sounded hurt with the State Congress leaders for not extending support during his jail period even as he said that united fight against the TRS government would ensure Congress party’s return to power.

Speaking to party supporters at his residence, he said jail inmates and constables were expecting TPCC chief N. Uttam Kumar Reddy to visit him. “I am not blaming anyone but it would have been good if the PCC president along with other senior leaders paid me a visit to send a message to the party cadre that they are united,” he said. Mr. Revanth Reddy said his fight against the TRS government and its leaders was for the party but some leaders had different thoughts. He had seen news reports of some leaders criticising him but he would not fault them. The reaction of his supporters on social media was also because of some communication gap.

He reminded that AICC incharge for Telangana R. C. Khunita had given some responsibilities to several leaders to expose the misdeeds of the TRS government during a meeting in Delhi and his fight in ‘exposing’ the government was a part of that strategy and not for himself.

Stating that he would not keep silent on the misdeeds of the government, he said he would continue to release documents ‘exposing corruption’ in the government and how it was ‘illegally’ extending support to some businessman. Naming a few channels and newspapers, he said they all belonged to businessmen close to the Chief Minister and Congress party supporters should not take them seriously.

Reacting strongly to the Chief Minister equating Congress with Corona virus, he said the TRS was like “AIDS” and those who went to the party for personal gains would regret. He listed out a few names how senior leaders who went to TRS from different parties were used and thrown away.

Meanwhile, there was high drama after Mr. Revanth came out of the Cherlapally jail. Instead, of allowing him to travel by his personal vehicle, the police reportedly took him in a different vehicle and dropped him at his residence.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/revanth-rues-lack-of-support-from-party-leaders/article31102600.ece

341,2020/03/19,Coronavirus | NPA shields probationers from external world,"Three-day special permission will be granted to those wishing to attend UPSC interviews

Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy (SVPNPA), the country’s premier police school, here is taking extraordinary measures against COVID-19 to protect the 170 probationers, including 20 from four other countries.

Travel on hold

After COVID-19 cases emerged from different parts of India, their attachment training to Delhi, Indo Tibetan Border Police and other places has been put on hold. As they do not travel to other States by air, chances of contracting the infectious disease is substantially reduced.

Three-day special permission will be granted to probationers who want to attend UPSC interviews.

However, they will be quarantined for a few days after returning to campus to continue training.

Speaking to The Hindu, SVPNPA Director Atul Karwal said they are taking all precautionary measures to reduce the direct contact of probationers with the outside world. “No visitors are allowed inside campus. The body temperature of our staff who live outside is checked at the entry point every time they enter the campus,” he said.

Thermal screening

Sleuths of Central Industrial Security Force, who guard the 300-acre campus situated in the heart of the city, undergo thermal screening before their scheduled shift. “The training will continue till we get holding orders from the Central government. So far, no suspected case is reported from the academy. Everyone is doing well,” Mr. Karwal said.

Currently, a total of 170 trainees, which include 150 IPS probationers of 72 Regular Recruites (RR), six from Royal Bhutan, five each from Nepal and Mauritius Police Force, and four from Maldives Police Service ,are undergoing phase-I training at the academy which will continue till October.

After that, the probationers will be sent to their cadre for District Practical Training (DPT) and later come back to NPA for phase-II training.

‘Adequate supplies’

The academy has over 1,000 staff, including officers and contract employees, many of whom live outside the campus. Asked if the probationers of 71 RR who are undergoing DPT will be asked to come back to the campus, the director said, “No, the current situation is the time for them to learn beyond regular policing”. Mr. Karwal added that they have adequate stock of food supplies.

On Sunday, a trainee forest service officer from the Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy, Dehradun, tested positive for COVID-19, as a result of which all probationers have been quarantined since they returned from a study tour to Spain, Finland and Russia.

Meanwhile, RBVRR Telangana State Police Academy director V.K. Singh also said that the training for 1,800-odd cadets, including 660 sub-inspectors (civil) and 670 women constables will not be stopped due to COVID-19 outbreak.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/4ewge6/article31102554.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18-NPA-HYD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/npa-shields-probationers-from-external-world/article31102558.ece
342,2020/03/19,Coronavirus | South Central Railway records over 50% cancellation of tickets,"The zone has cancelled as many as 70 services

South Central Railway (SCR) has announced cancellation of several special trains and the number of reserved ticket cancellations has also reached an all time high of over 50%. It is pertinent to note that the trains were cancelled not due to COVID-19 shutdown but ‘lack of patronage’.

“We have cancelled services of our special trains. However, most of our mainline trains are booked to capacity and more, due to the cancellation of flight services within the country. The thinking right now in the railways top brass is to wait and watch before going for any drastic step of halting all services. For now those with less capacity are being stopped,” say senior railway officers, pleading anonymity.

Data shows that the reserved ticket cancellation spree is likely to reach the ‘popular’ trains too, considering the trend in the last few days with the Central and State governments slowly but surely clamping down on public congregations. “Shutting down of public transport is a big step and the signal has to come from the top if this has to be shut down to halt citizens from rushing to hometowns in view of the enforced holidays,” they aver.

In the past four days alone (March 14-17), SCR has seen cancellation of 3,37,312 tickets out of the 6,16,658 booked, bringing the cancellations percentage to 54.7%. “It is quite unprecedented since the average reserved ticket cancellations is to the extent of 14-18% only. The cancellations have only been showing a rising graph in the past few days ever since the coronavirus scare and possible spread became more prominent,” explain senior officials.

Of the about ₹31.2 crore earned by the zone during this period, it had to refund reserved ticket fares to an extent of ₹15 crore. “This is the time of the year where our trains usually run full for the holiday season and so it is a big dent in our revenues,” they point out.

They are not off the mark considering that the number of reserved tickets booked has been 7,87,683 during the same period last year and earnings has been to the tune of ₹40.4 crore with just 17% cancellations and ₹7.02 crore of refund. If the average daily bookings last year in the same period has been 1.96 lakh, it has come down to about 1.54 lakh this year.

The zone has announced cancellation of as many as 70 services of close to 40 trains bound to destinations as diverse as Villupuram, Kakinada Town, Machilipatnam, Ernakulam, Vijayawada, Tiruchchirapalli, Aurangabad, Kanpur, Mumbai LTT, Karimnagar, Nagpur, Kalaburagi, Chennai, Visakhapatnam, Tirupati, Bhubaneswar and so on.

343,2020/03/19,‘I think of this as a new journey’,"Singer Armaan Malik on recording a single for Arista Records, his social media posts and working with the flaws

On March 11, all posts on Armaan Malik’s Instagram account vanished. Instead, a single cryptic post appeared on the 24-year-old singer’s page: “I can’t take it anymore.” Hundreds of fans posted messages of concern. Over the next couple of days, more cryptic messages followed. Finally, the big reveal arrived: Malik announced that he has signed with Arista Records for his first English single ‘Control’, which will be released worldwide on March 20.

Proud legacy

Arista Records boasts an illustrious history: It was launched in 1974 by Clive Davis and was associated with acts such as Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin and Whitney Houston. It was re-launched in 2018 by Sony Music and is now led by hitmaker David Massey, who is credited with overseeing hits from Shawn Mendes, Demi Lovato, Nick Jonas, The Killers, Fall Out Boy, and Elton John, among others.

Malik is thrilled by this new adventure. “I’ve always wanted to write and release English music”, he says. “I’ve grown up listening to a lot of English music and it’s been a huge influence: especially pop and R&B. In fact, even when I write music I think in English.” He is careful to emphasise that his new single isn’t the result of a sudden stroke of luck. “I’ve been writing and recording a lot of English songs over the past few years with friends and writers in Los Angeles,” he says. “It just so happened that one of my friends played something of mine to David Massey, and he felt we should collaborate. He was especially excited to know that I’m an Indian artist. Both of us are thrilled by the potential of changing the status quo.”

Universal appeal

Were there any reservations about singing in English as an Indian singer? Malik says that, to the contrary, it’s an exciting opportunity to take more of India to the world. “India is known for Bollywood music but individual artists get little recognition. And English is a universal language” he says. “I’d love Hindi to be as universal as, say, Spanish. But that requires an entire cultural shift. And as far as the accent goes, you’ll realise when the single is released that it’s been sung a certain way. I’ve never tried to put on an accent. I think it sounds very global.”

The song itself is about a controlling relationship, where one person has an adverse influence over the other. Malik says he wrote the song based on the experiences of his friends and acquaintances around him. “I was drawn to it and felt it would be an interesting theme to explore. As far as the song goes, it’s an upbeat number, which is a departure from my usual romantic numbers in Hindi. Also, the bassline that you hear in the song, that’s played by me. I play the guitar but the bass was a first,” he laughs.

Fine-tuning the process

Recording in LA also introduced Malik to a more collaborative way of recording music. “In Bollywood you have the composer, lyricist and producer who create the song and then give it to a singer”, he explains. “Here, we had a larger set of people (all of them are called writers by the way, some write the music, others write lyrics) who created the song together.” Malik says the iterations are quick and there’s a lot of back and forth to constantly hone the song.

Recording the single, due to this collaborative process, was blazing fast. Malik says they recorded the song in one day. “Of course it’s been refined a little, but the song that you’ll hear on the 20th is not very different from the original we recorded that day. We probably got 80% of the song done that very day.”

During the recording, what stood out for Malik was how comfortable he was made to feel with flaws in his singing. “I’m notorious for beating myself up if even a single sur is out of place,” he laughs. “On the other hand, while recording here, sometimes I’d feel I had messed up something but I would be told it’s perfectly fine. They’d tell me the flaws make it sound natural, more human.”

“I grew up listening to Michael Jackson and Michael Bublé”, he says. “In my teenage years, my friends introduced me to artists like Bruno Mars and Chris Brown. These days I absolutely love Charlie Puth and Ed Sheeran. They’re complete artists. Not only do they sing, but they write and produce their own music as well.”

In the pipeline

Is the strategy to release a single and gauge the response before releasing more? Malik says there are more songs in the pipeline that will definitely be released in the coming months. However, whether they’ll release an album or an EP is still undecided. None of this means that Malik will give up his Hindi music that’s made him such a star. Fans can expect exciting developments, “A couple of film releases are forthcoming. But I’m looking forward to doing more non-film music. I’m planning to start my own imprint as well,” he says.

Malik laughs when asked about his Instagram strategy: “Many fans were concerned that I’m deleting my old memories. That’s not true. They remain with me forever. I’ve merely archived the posts. It’s a clean slate on Instagram because I think of this as a new journey for me. You could call it Armaan 2.0.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/iajh7c/article31111331.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20bmarmaan1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/i-think-of-this-as-a-new-journey/article31111332.ece
344,2020/03/19,Strong and sure,"The 11th edition of Smaran concert series of young classical musicians, featuring Ishaan Ghosh and Aditi Sharma Garg, was a memorable experience

Born into a family of renowned musicians, Ishan Ghosh is the gifted son/disciple of Pt. Nayan Ghosh who is an equally proficient tabla and sitar maestro. The fact, with its distinct advantages, stood out clear at the very first stroke of his seasoned fingers on tabla with indubitable clarity of tone and timbre. Ishaan played Teentala in slow, medium and fast tempos respectively with melodious sarangi support by Mudassir Khan.

His touch on the instrument was strong and sure, when he opened with a detailed aalap like peshkara in vilambit Teentala making its way into a qayda from Farrukhabad Gharana. The umpteen varieties of traditional qaydas and relas, comprised some of those composed by Pt. Nayan Ghosh.

The floral bouquet of his repertoire had the leaping trajectories of rhythmic compositions left behind by a whole stream of tabla maestros . The technically complex rela of Ustad Amir Hussain Khan, for instance, in which the bol ‘Dhere-Dhere’ repeated 12 times consecutively, was played with utmost ease and clarity.

The Madhya-laya portion included a ‘rau’ (a pattern of tabla bols) which was derived about 150 years back in Lucknow from the dhol and tasha played during the processions of Muharram. The drut segment comprised marvellous works of great masters such as Ustad Amir Hussain Khan, Ustad Masit Khan, Ustad Ahmad Jan Thirakwa and Pandit Nikhil Ghosh. A unique ‘Chaturang’ composed by Guru Gyan Prakash Ghosh comprised mnemonics of tabla, tarana, kathak and pakhawaj.

Ishaan played all these remarkably distinctive compositions of varied shapes and geometries with absolute ease. There were moments when he went into extempore playing with impressive variations that teased the mind and brought an element of surprise. His instant rapport with the audience and explaining the beauty and uniqueness of compositions were products of insight.

There was not much time left for the Dhrupad singer Aditi Sharma Garg, specially to do justice to a raga like Darbari Kanhada that she chose to sing. She cut short the duration of aalap, although rendered complete in slow, medium and fast speeds, before presenting a Chaturdhatu Prabandh, comprising all four components Sthayee, Antara, Sanchari and Abhog, a traditional Dhrupad “Raajat chandra lalaat…” set to Chautala.

This was followed by her self-composed “Gopeshwar Mahadevan…” set to Tevra tala of seven beats. Accompanied on pakhawaj by Pt. Radhe Shyam Sharma and on tanpura by Ila Sharma and Arush Datt Sharma, Aditi concluded with a Dhamar in raga Jhinjhoti.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/149e7p/article31109887.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ishaan-Ghosh,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/strong-and-sure/article31109888.ece
345,2020/03/19,In safe company,"The 73rd edition of the Shriram Shankarlal Music Festival added a note of cheer to the sombre atmosphere

The COVID-19 scare made its impact on the 73rd edition of the Shriram Shankarlal Music Festival as well. The turnout was low in comparison to previous years but the seasoned musicians were in full flow.

The superb tabla accompaniment by India’s top artists was one of the highlights of the festival. It started with Punjab gharana exponent Pt. Yogesh Shamsi, who accompanied Senia Maihar sitariya Niladri Kumar on the first day of the festival. Keeping his accompaniment within the parameters explored by Niladri, Shamsi matched the sitarist’s thoughts perfectly.

Niladri had started with an aalap in raga Bageshwari, impressively focusing on slow longs meends on both his kharaj wires. The gats in Rupak and then Teen taal providing a wide canvas to explore the laya. Both played smaller improvisations rather than elaborately structured longer pieces, keeping the pace of the concert taut. Appreciative of his expert and highly musical accompanist, Niladri later shared, “I cut short my drut gat to play a longer jhala than usual, as I wanted to savour his amazing “na dhin dhin na” theka a bit longer.”

Bhairavi bandish

Pt Shubhankar Banerji

Pt. Suresh Talwalkar with Pt Ulhas Kashalkar, as always, lent sensitive support. Their interactive jodi brings out the best in each other. When Pt Kashalkar sang raga Bihagada, sadly, the sound system was not well set and his voice amplification was not at its best. However, his rendering of the raga Bahar composition, “Kaliyan sang karta rang raliyan”, was simply divine. But the piece de resistance of his concert was his Bhairavi bandish in memory of Ustad Vilayat Khan’s death anniversary. Pt. Subhankar Banerji, who accompanied Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, revealed his total mastery over the tabla, but again within the parameters set by the Ustad. During both Rageshwari compositions, Zila Kafi and concluding Bhairavi, Banerji played with finesse and restraint.

The fourth noteworthy tabla player at the festival was the much younger Ojas Adhiya who accompanied both Rakesh Chaurasia on the flute and Ustad Rashid Khan.

Vidushi Shubhra Guha was a welcome addition to the festival. She is one of the rare female Agra gharana exponents and her singing style remains pure, confined to her gharana. Starting with raga Chayanat, she sang two khayals, then a tarana, before moving onto raga Basant Bahar in which she sang a complicated composition of Pt Dinkar Kaikani “aayee basant ki bahar”. Her concluding Holi revealed her mastery over thumri. Her focus was on establishing the mood rather than displaying vocal virtuosity and over embellishment as many younger exponents of thumri tend to do nowadays.

Another addition to the festival was the inaugural dhrupad concert by the Darbhanga gharana brothers, Prashant and Nishant Mallik. Bhuvanesh Komkali, a regular at the festival, seems to be getting better every year. Manjiri Asnare Kelkar, with her impeccable Jaipur Attrauli training, rendered a superb Basanti Kedar, a signature raga of the gharana.

The festival concluded with a superb recital by Ustad Rashid Khan. He sang raga Shudha Sarang, then moved on to raga Madhmad Sarang, singing a composition of Ustad Inayat Khan. Singing with passion and involvement, the concert was a fitting finale to one of the Delhi’s favourite classical music festivals.

Under the shadow of coronavirus

It was a strange feeling as one entered the Bharatiya Kala Kendra grounds. The music connoisseurs' temperature was being checked at the gate. One was instructed to use the hand sanitiser before moving inside. Once inside, one discovered that the chairs were placed at a distance of a foot from each other. There was a prominently placed portable hand wash basin near the chairs. It looked out of place, but safety was the priority.

There was no 'baithak' seating at all, as the organisers explained it was impossible to ensure adequate space between people. Several people in the audience wore face masks, and there was a visible vivadi sur when anyone sneezed!

Shankarlal Music Festival was the only classical music event in Delhi that was not cancelled because of Covid-19 scare. Those postponed included Dhrupad Festival, Bhilwara Festival and Habitat Morning Ragas concert which.

The ever humorous Rakesh Chaurasia thanked the organisers for inviting him to perform as “it gave him an excuse to leave the house”. Ustad Amjad Ali Khan dedicated his concert to all the people who had lost their lives to the virus. Ustad Rashid Khan kept asking the well-being of the audience during his concert and asked them to tell him when to stop.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/m5mmli/article31109447.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/rashid-khan-PC-RAKESH-BHARADWAJ,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/in-safe-company/article31109449.ece
346,2020/03/19,A feast for the ears,"The R K Srikantan Trust recently held a four-day music fest in memory of their founder

The sixth Remembrance Day and Vaggeyakara Music Festival recently organised by the R K Srikantan Trust saw many musicians regale audiences their vocal and instrumental music concerts over a period of four days.

K. Srilatha, a disciple of R K Srikantan presented a vocal concert with Gayatri Shivani Vishnubhotla on the violin and Sachin Prakash on the mridangam. She opened her concert with the Tyagaraja composition, Intanuchu varnimpa tarama in Gundakriya raga. This was followed by her rendition of Narasimha mamava bhagavan in Arabhi, a composition by Maharaja Swati Tirunal.

During the course of her concert, she covered a composition by Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar — Shankari sadaananda lahari paahi — in raga Malavi, apart from Muthuswami Dikshitar’s Ramanatham bhajeham, in raga Pantuvarali and Purandara Dasa’s Naranaada mele Hari naama jihveyolirabeku in raga Nadanamakriya.

Srilatha concluded her session with Patiki Haratiyare, a Tyagaraja composition in raga Surati.

The vocal stylings of Mahesh Narayan were accompanied by Anand Vishwanthan on the violin and Ranjani Venkatesh on the mridangam.

Narayan began with a Tyagaraja composition, Kanna thandri naapai in raga Devamanohari, before moving on to Dikshitar’s Sri Mathru bhutam trishira girinadham in raga Kannada. With each performance, whether it was Maharaja Swati Tirunal’s Paripalayamam Sri Padmanabha murari in raga Reetigowla, Tyagaraja’s Vachamagocharame in raga Kaikayasi or Enduko Peddala vale buddhineeyavu, Narayan showcased his mastery in this genre. He closed his schedule with Purandara Dasa’s Rama Rama Rama Sita in raga Tilang.

A special mention should be made of the Thaniyavartanam by Anand as well as Ranjani’s exceptional artistry, which only added to the brilliance of this session.

The Music Festival also saw a flute recital by L V Mukund. He was accompanied by C N Chandrasekhar on the violin, Renuka Prasad on the mridangam, A S N Swamy on the kanjari and Bhagayalakshmi Krishna on the morsing, as part of his repertoire.

Mukund began his recital with a rendering of varnam in sree raga and went on to play Namami Vighna Vinayaka, a composition by Krishna Swamy Ayya in raga Hamsadhwani.

His Niravadhi sukhada Nirmala roopa by Tyagaraja in raga Ravichandrika using a regular as well as a larger flute, ushered in a joyous celebratory mood. He continued with two of Tyagaraja’s compositions — Ennallu urake in Shubhapantuvarali raga and Nadopasana in Begada raga. After presenting Lalgudi Jayaraman’s Thillana in raga Revathi, he ended his presentation with a Mangalam.

All in all, the event proved to be a genuine treat to ears of both amateurs and connoisseurs alike.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/4ys26i/article31108288.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FR20P4Anc1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/a-feast-for-the-ears/article31108291.ece
347,2020/03/19,Arjun R Shaankar’s ‘Hike Kadha’ series blends his wanderlust and passion for music,"Music series ‘Hike Kadha’ essentially captures the vibrant diversity of the country, all given a musical form through his travels

After avid traveller Arjun R Shaankar took a solo bike trip to the snow-capped Himayalas in 2018, the picturesque locales left a deep impression on him. Unable to resist the charms of the hills, he went back again and again as if in a journey of self-discovery, each time the cold mountain ranges warming up something musical in him.

“I started chronicling my jaunts on social media, making it a point to capture some of the not-so-talked-about aspects associated with travelling in the Himalayas such as music under the rubric ‘Hike Kadha’. In fact, it’s a place where many famous musicians often come for performances,” says Arjun. Last December, he formed his band, Indian Music Thali, with his musician-friends — Liboy Praisly (lead guitar), Vinil LV (drummer), Jackson Varghese (piano), Reji (keyboard), Gautam Sajeev (bass guitar), Athul Stephen (acoustic guitar) and Krishna R Shaankar (female vocalist) while Arjun himself is the lead vocalist and composer.

So, the last time he took to the hills, Arjun decided to marry his twin passion of travel and music, which planted the idea for a music video series, ‘Hike Kadha’ that essentially captures the vibrant diversity of the country, all given a musical form through his travels.

Arjun recently released the first part, titled ‘Chapter 1’, of the series on YouTube with the Malayalam song ‘Agaadha neelimayil.’ Penned by Vinod Kottayil, the first two lines of song have been inspired by the words of legendary poet and lyricist Vayalar Ramavarma. “I love Vayalar’s songs. However, more than the songs, perhaps I’m more inspired by their literary value,” he says.

The words attempt to encapsulate the mood of music series. “The song falls under the genre of spiritual rock as the soul and the lyrics of the song are essentially a quest. In fact, the series’ tag line is ‘A journey into yourself’. However, the track’s framework is that of rock music. The video, that starts at the Golden Temple in Amritsar is, mainly in Ladakh and near Kargil,” explains Arjun, who works in a civil services training centre in the city.

Indian Music Thali is also bringing out a Tamil (‘Nilai aana neela vaanil’) and Telugu (‘Nethone ne prayanam) versions of ‘Agaadha neelimayil’, slated to be released soon with the same visuals. The lyrics are written by Jayasree Rajaram and Solipeta Narendher Goud respectively. Arjun says ‘Chapter 2’, a Tamil romantic melody titled ‘Un polave’, and ‘Chapter 3’, titled ‘Ittefaq’ and in Hindi, of the music series will be released in the coming month. “‘Un polave’ is shot mainly in Delhi and Kodaikanal and ‘Ittefaq’ in Amritsar and border regions of Attari,” says the 31-year-old.

Arjun says that having previously travelled to many of the scenic places that served as fitting locations for the song videos, helped him conceptualise the shoot.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/2nkrdo/article31108163.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20tvmArjun2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/arjun-r-shaankars-hike-kadha-series-blends-his-wanderlust-and-passion-for-music/article31108165.ece
348,2020/03/19,The language of music,"Western classical music enthrals audiences, both young and old, during a recent event at Alliance Francaise

Activity in any organisation’s event calendar is always welcome, so it was not surprising that The International Music & Arts Society accepted the offer of a duo piano concert, The Language of Music by Natallia Kapylova and Liudmila Drazhnik.

This duo of local piano teachers has often been heard in the city and Natallia has also accompanied many vocalists. Their programme largely consisted of popular pieces; pupils of the keyboard would not only have recognised them, but were also probably taught many of the shorter ones. Natallia interacted with the audience, introducing each piece with customary aplomb, her showmanship counterpointing Liudmila’s contained, quiet personality.

Before the start of the concert, it was intriguing to see books and other objects being placed on the strings of one of the pianos, which had its lid up. The reason became apparent when they opened with G Anderson’s arrangement of Vivaldi’s A Rain of Tears: as the strings did not vibrate, Natallia’s staccato notes sounded more like guitar strumming, not an effect one expected to emanate from a keyboard!

“Yes, I thought of this idea myself. It is nice to experiment, though I had to be very careful not only while placing the weights, but also when removing them, so the piano would retain its tuning for the rest of the pieces.” Vivaldi intended this operatic aria to be a metaphor for sorrow, with external elements mirrored internally by tears and weeping.

Therefore, Natallia’s innovation cleverly suggested the pointillistic patter of rain, while Luidmilla played the more sombre rubato, suggestive of gloomy downpour.

The First Movement of Mozart’s Symphony K550 is so popular as to be almost trite. Not only is it probably the most heard of his symphonies, it was also heard by Indian audiences who did not normally listen to Western classical music, as Salil Choudhury copied much of it in his Itna na mujhse tu pyar badha in the 1961 Hindi film ‘Chhaya’. When plagiarism from Western music went unchallenged, the industry freely “borrowed” from all genres, the other well-known instance being Dil Dekhe Dekho, a blatant clone of the pop song ‘Sugartime’.

Audience appreciation was audible with the first bars of Mozart’s Sonata K545, for it is one of the piano pieces students learn early, Mozart himself having catalogued it as ‘for beginners’. Grieg arranged it for two pianos, his additions being mostly for the second piano, leaving the first to render Mozart’s score largely as he wrote it. Luidmilla sensitively rendered the almost nostalgic regret that the second movement Andante suggests, when it modulates to the minor keys of G and C, her piano’s lovely mellow tone underlining the mood.

Mozart’s Fantasy K608 was originally written for a mechanical clock with a built-in organ, a trendy novelty in its day. He undertook the commission with reluctance, as the contraption’s high-pitched range was limited. “I always have to break off as it bores me”, he complained. However, the piece was subsequently adapted so often, that versions of it were even more popular than the original, particularly in the nineteenth century, when Busoni arranged it for two pianos. The middle fugue section clearly echoed Bach, whose music Mozart studied.

After the interval, the programme switched to Romantic and Modern pieces, lesser known than those in the first half. Some of them were written for two pianos, rather than being transcriptions: Bruch’s Fantasie op 11, Rachmaninoff’s Lilacs and Medtner’s Russian Round Dance op 58 #1. The inclusion of the last was a nod to a founder member of IMAS, the late Maharajah of Mysore who founded the Medtner Society, thereby ensuring that the composer’s works were recorded.

Rachmaninoff’s Italian Polka was delightful with its catchy tempo, and Argentinian composer Guastavino’s Two Romances op 2 were also punctuated with dance rhythms. The concert closed with a very popular piece, Liszt’s Hungarian Rhapsody #2, Kleinmichel’s transcription diluting Lizst’s fiendish playing demands between the two pianos.

While both pianists played competently, their commitment in no doubt, there was little opportunity to gauge either emotional expression or technical excellence, as both these essential elements of a performance were shared, particularly as most of the pieces were adapted for two pianos, dividing the onus normally carried by a soloist. Even the pieces written specifically for two pianos, demanded neither a great degree of virtuosity or intense feeling.

It is not surprising that the opening bars of the encore, the famous Czardas by Vittorio Monti, recalled Liszt, as it owes a lot to the Hungarian folk dance, with dramatic changes in tempi and dynamics. Nattalia hoped that the audience would hum along, but perhaps they were too young to recognise that its allegro vivo bars figured in Danny Kaye’s delightful comic song, The Little Fiddle, or that Shankar-Jaikishan liberally filched portions (more Bollywood plagiarism!) of it for the immensely popular 1951 film Aawara. It was an appropriate close to a pleasing and entertaining evening.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/th7vdf/article31107906.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FRP3Anchorjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/the-language-of-music/article31107907.ece
349,2020/03/19,Musicians bring out varied facets of India’s art forms at Teen Prahar,"Intricate interpretations

Banyan Tree recently presented a series of vibrant music performances as a part of its annual festival Teen Prahar. True to its mission of preserving and promoting the diverse performing arts of India, the event covered not only classical music, but also living traditions from different parts of India.

Young talent, poetry through music, lesser-known instruments and forms, artistes-in-the-making as well as established masters shared a single platform, showcasing the rich variety of artistic communication enabled by music.

‘Young Blossom’ set a joyous and vibrant tone to the evening’s music. Flutist Dhruva Hanagal, grandson of Pt Sheshagiri Hanagal, tabla artiste Pradyumna Karpur, son of Pt Udayaraj Karpur and Chinmay Bharadwaj on harmonium stole the show with their proficient presentations.

Two compositions in Raga Hamsadhwani (ek-taal and drut-teen-taal) were executed by Dhruva with a mature finesse, ably accompanied by Pradyumna who is endowed with amazing percussive skills and sense of laya. A tabla solo by Pradyumna played to Chinmay’s harmonium lehra-saath had the audience spellbound. The narrative of percussion is certainly more complex and abstract than the flow of melody. Hence, Pradyumna’s intricate aesthetic delineation of the teentaal had a stunning impact. He played different compositions of Delhi, Ajarada and Farukhabad gharanas, while also reciting traditional tukras and farmayiesh chakradhars.

Classical music is truly blossoming in the hands of these little masters who are investing their best efforts into this genre.

’Folk India:Connecting the Rivers’, the next performance, was an ode to rivers, ‘which are not just the lifelines of our country but the nucleus of cultural activity’, silent witnesses to the journey of our civilization. Vibrant folk songs from Punjab, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and West Bengal celebrating our country’s rivers, rendered powerfully by eight brilliant performers made a huge impact. The vocalists Devendra Pal Singh from Punjab, Nazrul Islam from West Bengal and Deu Khan from Rajasthan were supported by Lubhanu Priy on keyboard, Abjijit Jadhav and Ratnadeep Jamsandekar from Maharashtra playing sambal and naal, Devu Khan on kadtal and Mehran Khan on the dholak.

Char Yaar, aka the Faqiri Quartet, is a unique band comprising vocalist and composer Madan Gopal Singh, guitarist and banjo player Deepak Castelino, sarodiya Pritam Ghosal and Amjad Khan, the talented percussionist. The committed group combines poetry and music to project their narrative of harmony and pluralism. Four musicians playing four different instruments speak a common language of love and amity.

Beginning with a Punjabi invocatory composition of the 16th century, addressed to marginalised beings with no might, the group took up Kabir’s anand mangal gaavo mori sajni, the song of joy, to celebrate the renewal of the cycle of life through the seasons. A mélange of different cultures journeying through different centuries followed, covering Sufi poets Rumi and Bulleh Shah, John Lennon and Kabir. The robust Sufi composition mast-qalandar marked the end of their session. The poetic compositions in various ragas including Des, Bhupali and Yaman drew energy from instrumental orchestration and percussive support.

Rakesh Chaurasia, nephew of Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia, was the next performer. As he tuned into his initial phrases, a soulful alaap in Jog, a straightforward melodious raga, pervaded the hall. He rendered two compositions, a seven-beat gat in Rupak-taal followed by a fast paced composition in teen-taal. Two tablas onstage added to the rigour of his presentation, especially in the sawal-jawaab portion. Amit Choubey and Sapan Anjaria on the tabla added charm to the percussive aesthetics of the gats rendered on flute.

Ustad Shujath Khan who has been with Banyan Tree for the last two decades, put up the grand finale. Son of Ustad Vilayat Khan and a prime torchbearer of the Imdadkhani gharana, Shujath performs extensively around the world and is a highly creative collaborator, singer and articulate musician. As the melodic strains of the sitar poured in, the notes were transformed into an intricate and elaborate gayaki.

For a while, Raga Tilak Kamod seemed to become the medium for exploration of instrumental possibilities invoking sitar gayaki. But in fact, Tilak Kamod of the Khamaj thaat was chosen by Shujath Khan for a detailed exploration. After a brief alaap, he sang the springtime wedding folk-song Woh kaise gora. The same was rendered on the sitar distilling the gayaki with precision, while also interspersing the tantrakari elements in a spontaneous fashion. Progressing gradually, the sitarist concluded with a highly-charged jhala. The concluding piece in the meandering raag Pahadi on flute and sitar was an elegant intermingling with a fine sense of collaboration.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/2m6uq/article31107769.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20FrP3Pradyujpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/musicians-bring-out-varied-facets-of-indias-art-forms-at-teen-prahar/article31107771.ece
350,2020/03/19,COVID-19: Harish Sivaramakrishnan of Agam band regales his fans on Facebook,"The musician posted Carnatic music version of ‘Go Corona’ chant along with his versions of evergreen film songs

Work from home has proved to be an opportunity for fans of Agam to listen to Harish Sivaramakrishnan’s impromptu song sessions on Facebook.

On Wednesday (March 18) for nearly an hour Harish, the lead singer of progressive classical rock band Agam, regaled his fans from all over the world with bits and pieces of their favourite songs as he hosted a watch party. Listeners joined in from Sweden, US, Kuwait, Spain, UK and so on to listen to him crooning notes from ghazals of Mehdi Hassan, Gulam Ali, Hariharan and more and also some evergreen hits of Malayalam and Tamil film music.

In between singing for his fans, he reminded every one to wash their hands, stay safe and to keep an eye on the elderly in their vicinity. Harish told them that he had been staying at home for seven days without stepping out even once and requested every one to maintain social distancing to break the chain of the Coronavirus spread.

On the previous day (Tuesday), he came up with a Carnatic music version of the ‘Go Corona, go Corona’ chant recited by a Minister along with his fans at a gathering. The melodious version of ‘Go Corona’ was also posted on his Facebook page on Tuesday.

The recording was preceded by his message that said: “Stay safe Guys. Always remember to wash your hands with soap and water (not gaumutra) regularly, use hand sanitiser ( alcohol based) when you can’t wash your hands. Practice [practise] social distancing. We will overcome”

‘Go corona’ - Ragamalika (Carnatic style) inspired by a similar video that was posted by one of my friends earlier. Please note - singing this or any other ‘cover’ version of the same won’t help stop the spread of covid 19”

Harish laughs when he talks about the ragamalika he had sung. “Since we are all working from home, I recorded the ‘Go Corona’ ragamalika with a selfie recorder during a five-minute break. I was inspired by a post put up by my friend Vignesh Iyer who had turned the ‘Go Corona’ chant into a melodious virutham-like piece (a devotional piece that is sung in Carnatic music concerts). The original idea belongs to Vignesh,” he explains.

Home entertainment

With many tech firms closing down to enforce social distancing and going in for home from work, many have been turning to music, reading, watching films and so on to entertain themselves after work, all at home of course. Harish, a techie himself, has been posting some lovely versions of Malayalam golden oldies of MS Baburaj’s. First came a Mehdi Hasan classic number ‘Pyaar bhari do sharmeele nayan’, on March 12.

Then came ‘Thaamasamenthe varuvaan’ from the Malayalam feature film Bhargavi Nilayam, a cult favourite composed by Baburaj and sung by K J Yesudas. It was followed by another golden number, ‘Suruma ezhuthiya mizhikale’, again composed by Baburaj and sung by Yesudas.

“Bangalore is shut down for a week. Stay safe everyone and I am sure we will overcome . Have decided to take solace in music as we try to ride past this difficult time,” he writes on his Facebook page.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/2hx4sf/article31107517.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20TVMAGAM,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/harish-sivaramakrishnans-impromptu-song-sessions-on-facebook-as-he-works-from-home-due-to-coronovirus-outbreak/article31107518.ece
351,2020/03/19,Nagaswaram giants of Tiruveezhimizhalai,"The duo, Subramania Pillai and Natarajasundaram Pillai, were known for marathon performances of lyrical beauty

Subramania Pillai and Natarajasundaram Pillai.

The nagaswaram vidwans missed their train, and by the time they arrived at the Kattuputtur Zamin, they were half an hour late for their kutcheri at the wedding in the Zamindar’s family. The Zamindar asked them to leave. They suggested that they would play for half an hour, and he reluctantly agreed. But when the half hour was up, the Zamindar signalled to them to continue, and for the next three hours, they gave a scintillating performance. The Zamindar was late for lunch! He urged them to stay on and play the next day too! He even did a kanakabhishekam for them! The vidwans were the Thiruveezhimizhalai Brothers — Subramania Pillai and Natarajasundaram Pillai. Recalling the incident, 85-year old Pandian, last son of Subramania Pillai, who still resides in Thiruveezhimizhalai, says, “There was a time when weddings in the 18 Vathima agraharams would be fixed only after checking when the Thiruveezhimizhalai brothers were free.”

The Thirveezhimizhalai duo were famous for their rendering of kritis. They had a huge repertoire of Tyagaraja kritis, for which they had to thank their younger brother Kalyanasundaram Pillai, who was a student of Naina Pillai. He and Chittoor Subramania Pillai learnt from Naina Pillai at the same time. During visits home, Kalyanasundram Pillai used to teach his brothers the kritis he had learnt. The duo’s rendering of the kritis was faithful to the nuances of the sahitya, not easy in any instrument.

Subramania Pillai and Natarajasundaram Pillai with Koranadu Govindaraja Pillai on the thavil

Their father Swaminatha Pillai, a nagaswaram vidwan himself, could also play the flute. He was the brothers’ first guru. In the early years, Subramania Pillai was a flautist and Nataraja Sundaram Pillai was a vocalist. “Subramania Pillai married my father’s sister Sethu Ammal,” says Sembanarkoil Rajanna, grandson of Sembanarkoil Ramaswamy Pillai. “ My grandfather suggested that Subramania Pillia take up nagaswaram, and this was how the Thiruveezhimizhalai nagaswaram duo entered the arena.”

Konerirajapuram Vaidyanatha Iyer, a good friend of Swaminatha Pillai, taught the brothers many kritis. Their first concert was in 1925. “Their father ensured that his sons were proficient in Sanskrit and Telugu, so that they could understand the sahitya. Subramania Pillai would insist that before taking up the instrument, a nagaswara vidwan must learn to vocalise the syllables. Otherwise, it would sound as if they were just rendering a string of swaras, and not a kriti,” says Rajanna.

Mridangam player Pandanallur K. Parthasaarathy, Rajanna’s grandson explains: “A certain flow has to be maintained by the players, so that the sahitya does not get mutilated. For this, the permutations and combinations of akaram and tutukaram must be proper. Tutukaram is the control of the sound using the tongue. Hukaram is produced by the throat. For tannakaram, which is essential for tanam playing, both throat and tongue are used.”

Kunchithapatham Pillai, son of Nataraja Sundaram Pillai, preserved some hand-written notes of the Thiruveezhimazhalai Brothers, and from one of them we gather that the brothers learnt how to vocalise syllables from their father. Their training under Umayalpuram Doraiswami Iyer, Umayalpuram Swaminatha Iyer, and Kumbakonam Janakiammal also helped. Subramania Pillai’s copper plate writing records that nagaswaram players competed in demonstrating their skills. In temple festivals, if one nagaswaram player played a raga or a pallavi, the next would also continue the same raga and Pallavi. If there was a slip, seniors would point out the mistakes. This helped players correct their mistakes.

Parthasaarathy recalls an incident he has heard from many people in Mayavaram. At least five melams would be engaged during the festival of Mayuranatha Swami temple. The utsavar would be taken to the banks of the Cauvery, with each melam playing for one stretch of the procession. One year, the Thiruveezhimizhalai Brothers had to play during the procession from Pathamangalam Theru to Madavilagam, a particularly long stretch. For some reason, the procession took longer than usual, and the Thiruveezhimizhalai Brothers ended up playing for four hours. They played an alapana of Sankarabharanam, and then played ‘Swararagasudha.’ And their Sankarabharanam alapanai became the talk of the town. “Vandadu varaamal vaasithaargal” — they played without repeating a single phrase —was the unanimous praise of all the stalwarts who heard them.

Sembanarkoil Rajanna recalls: “The Sembanarkoil school excelled in rakti melam and pallavis. My father played at a fast pace. The Thiruveezhimihalai Brothers played in a slow tempo. T.N. Rajarathinam Pillai was famous for his outstanding raga renditions. Once, there was a wedding in a zamindar’s family, and M.K. Tyagaraja Bhagavatar and TNR were both to give concerts. Noticing that Bhagavatar had not been offered a seat by the zamindar, TNR just pulled up two chairs and said, “Why do we have to stand before the zamindar? If he is king of his zamin, you are king of the cinema and I am king of the nagaswaram.’”

Rajanna continues to reminisce: “Thiruveezhimizhalai Brothers signed a contract with tavil vidwan Needamangalam Meenakshisundaram Pillai. One of the terms was that Meenakshisundaram Pillai was not to play for anyone else during the period of the contract. The women in our family said, ‘Why did our family not think of this? Now they are going to have a monopoly over that brilliant tavil vidwan.’ The Tyagaraja kriti ‘Chetulara Sringaramu’ was a staple in their concerts. And when Meenakshisundaram Pillai parted ways with them, they stopped playing ‘Chetulara’ and Tyagarajaswami’s ‘Koniyadina.’ Other tavil vidwans who accompanied them were Koorainadu Govindaraja Pillai, Nachiar Koil Raghava Pillai, Needamangalam Shanmugavadivel (son of Meenakshisundaram Pillai) and Thiruchengattakudi Uttirapati.”

In 1956, Subramania Pillai was the first nagaswara vidwan to be awarded the Sangita Kalanidhi. At the Music Academy, he won the admiration of the audience by playing a chauka pallavi set in 64 kalais, in eight different speeds. He was awarded Padma Sri in 1974. Both brothers received the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award and were Isai Perarignars.

“The Thiruveezhimizhalai brothers never played solo. However, on one occasion, when the Dharmapuram Pontiff sent for them, it so happened that Subramania Pillai was in Madras. So Natarajasundaram Pillai asked me to play with him. I was so overwhelmed by his ‘Birana varalichi’ in Kalyani, that I wasn’t sure I could match him. That was the only time he played without his elder brother,” says Rajanna. “The brothers could play a pallavi in a complicated tala, consisting of 108 aksharas,” he marvels.

Rajanna says that the Thiruveezhimizhalai Brothers disapproved of using the sruti box for setting the sruti for nagaswaram. They used only the othu, which is also a reed instrument like the nagaswaram. Resonance of othu matches the adhara sruti of nagaswaram perfectly. Those who heard the Thiruveezhimizhalai Brothers play could never tell that two nagswarams were being played, because their music blended so beautifully, and the drone of a sruti box would have been incongruous. “When age caught up with the Thiruveezhimizhalai Brothers, they decided to stop playing, and they gifted their nagaswarams to a museum in Delhi,” says Jayaprakash, grandson of Natarajasundaram Pillai.

Govindaraja Pillai and Dakshinamurthy Pillai, the first two sons of Subramania Pillai, also played together and people used to call them the Junior Thiruveezhimizhalai Brothers. Dakshinamurthy Pillai was awarded Padma Sri in 2007.

The family manages a Mariamman temple in Thiruveezhimizhalai, and this is their family deity. Kalyanasundaram Pillai, the youngest brother of Subramania Pillai, composed a potri agaval in praise of Mariamman, which has been inscribed on the walls of the temple. “Kalyanasundaram Pillai also had to his credit many compositions for dance,” says Rajanna.

When Musiri Subramania Iyer wanted to introduce nagaswaram lessons in the Madras Music College, he roped in Natarajasundaram Pillai on the syllabus committee for both nagaswaram and tavil, and entrusted to him the task of making nagaswaram and tavils for the students. T. Sankaran, grandson of Veena Dhanammal, was a close friend of Natarajasundaram Pillai, and in 1977, Natarajasundaram Pillai and Sankaran organised a nagaswaram programme on ragam, tanam, pallavi. Nagaswara vidwans Thirucherai Krishnamurthy Pillai and Dharmapuram Govindaraja Pillai were invited to perform. Each had to play an alapanai of Husseini, and then play the pallavi ‘Netrandi nerathile neeradum karai thanile’ in misram. Natarajasundaram Pillai’s idea was to bring out the style of different nagaswaram schools.

Thiruveezhimizhalai Brothers were great devotees of the composer Tyagaraja, and were members of the Tyagabrahma Mahotsava sabha, Tiruvaiyaru. “My grandfather Nataraja Sundaram Pillai was reciting Rama nama even in the last moments of his life,” remembers Jayaprakash.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/nagaswaram-giants-of-tiruveezhimizhalai/article31107092.ece
352,2020/03/19,Music of the Diaspora Kid,"Vocalist Aditya Prakash’s new album maps his journey across borders

It’s been almost a decade since Aditya Prakash graduated from California’s prestigious UCLA, the place where his first-ever ‘band,’ the Aditya Prakash Ensemble, came together, jamming over shared enthusiasm for Carnatic music and jazz, as well as other artistic systems.

The bond he has with his bandmates is a resilient one as they gear up to release their third album, ‘Diaspora Kid’, across all digital platforms on March 20.

“Diaspora Kid is about finding my roots in an ever-changing environment, filled with a diverse array of inspiration. From rhythmic Carnatic grooves over a brass band to an alternative rock Radiohead-inspired feel and so much more, this album is about moving through the melting pot of cultures I grew up with in Los Angeles through the lens of the Indian classical voice,” says Prakash.

While certain tracks on this album pay direct homage to composers such as Muthuswami Dikshitar with his composition ‘Ramakali’ in Rupaka talam, most of the nine tracks are inspired from a myriad of ragas, as well as differing jazz modes that Prakash has played with in his years studying Ethnomusicology.

“The songs in their entirety explore sounds of rock, jazz, hip hop, and Western folk through the Indian classical voice — my voice. This doesn’t necessarily mean that I set a raga and tala for them to make them ‘Indian.’ Instead, I try to give them the same vocal tonality, aesthetic, and power that I give different ragas,” he explains further.

Featuring 24 other musicians from across the globe, Prakash hopes the album reflects him at his very core.

“I am of the diaspora. I have experienced America and India — I have sounds from both worlds embedded in me, and this is my outlet for expressing it,” he smiles.

By definition and classification, he plays the role of Carnatic vocalist quite often, a role well-known to his Chennai-based audience. But the album and what it stands for seems to represent a crossover and merging of artistic worlds that more and more musicians are making nowadays, including many of Prakash’s own contemporaries.

“Yes, you could definitely say the lines are blurring more each day. Musicians are interested in experimenting with different sounds, instruments, and cultures because our world is getting smaller. We travel more and with that comes novel technology and, well, more world experience,” he says.

So what it is about an album that makes this whole process work together seamlessly?

“As an artiste making an album involves hearing the music unfold at every step of the way, which is the most enriching. From its ideation to the mixing and producing, every step is just one bit closer at getting to that initial vision you had in your head. It’s hard to sum it up, but let’s just say it’s exciting, frustrating, challenging, and rewarding, all at once,” he signs off.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ioefec/article31106954.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20frband-aditya1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/music-of-the-diaspora-kid/article31106955.ece
353,2020/03/19,Corpn. e-governance project in jeopardy,"Computer system running on outdated technology

E-governance services, including tax payments and obtaining birth, death or marriage certificates online, will continue to evade the city with the Kochi Corporation council failing to arrive at decisions that could push the project forward.

The Corporation’s IT officer had in a report placed before the council listed urgent issues that would have to be resolved. The server hardware that was purchased for the e-governance project a few years ago was now in poor shape and was running on outdated technology. To avoid a disastrous loss of data on birth and death and other registrations from the servers, new hardware would have to be purchased immediately.

Tata Consultancy Services, which had readied the software, would have to be roped in again to move the application onto other servers. But the services of the company were no longer available since the Corporation’s agreement with them had expired and their officials were withdrawn from the Corporation last year.

A meeting chaired by Local Self-Government Minister A.C. Moideen last year had specified that salaries of two TCS employees would be paid by the Corporation to fix the glitches in the system and quantify the work that the company has already done.

With the point about the salaries not being mentioned in the minutes of the meeting and requests to the LSG Department over the past few months to include it not materialising, the Finance Standing Committee had sought the Corporation council’s approval to send the IT officer’s report to the department to drive home the urgency of the matter.

Action sought against TCS

At the council meeting on Thursday, which concluded hastily in the wake of restrictions on large gatherings, Opposition leaders refused to allow the agenda on sending the letter to the department to be passed, arguing that TCS had not completed the work it was required to. Opposition leader K.J. Antony said that TCS had already been paid some of the amount due to them and that the Corporation must not foot the salaries of the two TCS employees, since the company had not made all e-governance modules available yet.

Since there are glitches in the existing modules, action should be taken against the company for having violated their agreement, said LDF councillor V.P Chandran.

“The system is clogged with information and will collapse soon if it is not replaced. The cooperation of the company is essential to fix it,” said Mayor Soumini Jain.

Tender delayed

The Opposition also protested against the delay in tendering work like the management of the slaughterhouse, parking spaces and public toilets. The tenders allotted to those currently managing these services will expire at the end of the month. But the matter of having to retender the work had not been placed before the council till Thursday, Mr. Chandran said, at which point it had turned into a proposal to simply extend the contract of those currently handling the services.

Ms. Jain said the reasons for the delay in placing the matter before the council would have to be examined.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/corpn-e-governance-project-in-jeopardy/article31111017.ece

The police charged her under IPC Sections 420 (Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property and 269 (Whoever unlawfully or negligently does any act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life).

She was picked up from her house at Cheranalloor around 1.45 p.m. on receiving a complaint that she was claiming to cure COVID-19 through unscientific and occult practices teetering on sorcery. She will be produced before the court on Friday.

“The accused was known to be engaged in similar practices to cure ailments including addiction to liquor. With the onset of COVID-19, she started ‘treatment’ for it and handing out ‘medicines’ like some powders and solutions,” said the police.

361,2020/03/19,Setting an example in ensuring water security,"Amballur panchayat launches projects

The emergency situation created by the spread of the coronavirus has held up the distribution of report cards on the quality of water and quality of the water source for all of 4,182 drinking water wells in Amballur panchayat on the eastern outskirts of Kochi.

The panchayat has set an example in managing water resources and ensuring the quality of available water through a series of programmes that have culminated in the panchayat authorities checking water quality in all its drinking water wells with the help of the State authorities under various schemes.

Panchayat president Jalaja Mohan said that it was a programme drawn up by the ruling council to test water quality and to ensure water supply even as a hot summer season approached. Drinking water supply is a major problem in the dry months.

The panchayat council drew up a plan to test water quality in all of its open wells and to implement water recharging programmes across the panchayat, she said. The project was brought before the ‘Jalanidhi’ programme, which aimed at ensuring drinking water supply and promoting sanitation programmes across the State.

The Amballur panchayat has a total of around 6,000 households and a total population of 28,000. It was necessary that the panchayat authorities did something at the ground level to ensure that water supply was not disrupted under any circumstance.

The testing of water from the wells was carried out after a survey was conducted in the panchayat using a mobile application that provided a list of the open wells that comprised those under private and public ownership, said Ms. Jalaja Mohan.

Water from the wells were collected and tested using help from the Jalanidhi project and the results are ready.

A card has been prepared for each of the wells on the quality and standard of the water. These would be distributed as soon as the current situation changes, the panchayat president added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/setting-an-example-in-ensuring-water-security/article31103288.ece
362,2020/03/19,Water Transport Department revenue takes a hit,"COVID-19 scare keeps passengers away

The State Water Transport Department (SWTD) is facing a dilemma as it is compelled to continue the operation of its largely service-oriented schedules in the district despite revenues plummeting to unprecedented lows in the wake of the COVID-19 scare.

The department daily operates nearly 100 services in nine schedules mainly on four routes — Ernakulam-Fort Kochi-Mattancherry, Ernakulam-Vypeen, Mulavukad-Varappuzha and Vyttila-Kakkanad.

During normal days, these nine schedules brought in a collective revenue in the range of ₹65,000 to ₹90,000 while on Sundays it crossed even the ₹1-lakh mark. “However, it now comes around mid ₹30,000 while on last Sunday, revenues were pegged at a meagre ₹24,000. In fact, revenue is not even touching ₹40,000 on any day,” senior SWTD sources said on condition of anonymity.

Usually, the collection at the Fort Kochi ticket counter alone exceed ₹15,000, which has fallen below ₹6,000 ever since the second wave of COVID-19 scare set in. “With a uniform ticket rate of ₹6 to both Ernakulam and Island from Fort Kochi, the fall in revenue shows that not even 6,000 passengers are using our services. The average daily passenger flow in the Ernakulam, Fort Kochi, Mattancherry and Vypeen belt is roughly around 12,000 to 15,000, which has now fallen by more than 50%. While 30% of total passengers were made up of regular passengers, floating passengers who accounted for the remaining 70% were now staying away, dealing a heavy blow to our revenue,” sources said.

The situation means that the gap between operational expenses, including wages and fuel cost, and the revenue is widening by the day despite the revised fare that kicked in only last December. “But we cannot afford to cancel those regular services since they are largely service-oriented. Besides, any cancellation will not sit well with regular commuters who question it, forcing us to operate services even with very low occupancy,” said an official on condition of anonymity.

A similar tale is being played out in the case of services being operated using high-speed double hull Vega boats with a capacity to carry 120 passengers. It comes to Ernakulam from Vaikom in the morning before returning in the evening and in both services the occupancy is far from encouraging.

Even more pathetic is the case of the 12 daily services operated locally on the Island-Fort Kochi-Kamalakkadavu route using Vega boats. “During normal days, the services earn anything between ₹10,000 and ₹15,000 whereas on Sundays it’s in the range of ₹15,000 to ₹25,000. But now the weekday collection has plummeted to around ₹1,500 and on last Sunday it touched a low of a mere ₹550. We are at times forced to call off the services when the passenger inflow is really low since expenses of operating these boats are way higher,” the official said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/a5w17p/article31103278.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WATERBUS1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/water-transport-department-revenue-takes-a-hit/article31103279.ece
363,2020/03/19,More employees at stores start wearing masks,"The number of employees in retail stores and shops wearing surgical and N95 masks has shot up in the district.

Employees at a retail store in Aluva, who were not wearing masks till Monday, were found covering the faces on Wednesday. “Strict instructions have come from our head office asking us to wear masks in view of COVID-19. Till Monday, it was left to our choice,” said a cashier.

Asked whether the management had given them sanitisers, the employees said that they had received hand sanitisers even though the frequency of their use was low. “We cannot use the sanitiser every other minute despite our hands touching a whole range of products kept on shelves,” they said.

A salesman said that wearing an N95 mask for longer duration was difficult. “I am feeling short of breath while using it for even less than an hour. But we have no choice as wearing masks has been made compulsory by the management,” he said.

However, employees at a bakery at Edappally said that they were not wearing masks thinking that it might not be comfortable for customers. “We do not want sales to be affected as customers visiting us without wearing masks may not feel okay seeing us in masks,” he said.

364,2020/03/19,COVID-19: shops in Kochi yet to keep sanitisers at entry points,"‘Chances of customers getting infection cannot be ruled out’

Several retail stores, bakeries and eateries frequented by the public in Ernakulam are yet to keep hand sanitisers at entry points despite the Health Department’s Break the Chain campaign against COVID-19.

A random check held from Vyttila to Aluva on Wednesday revealed this gap in efforts to check the speedy transmission of COVID-19. A visit to a retail chain store at Vyttila revealed that there was no hand sanitiser kept at the entrance or kiosk encouraging people to sanitise their hands before entering and exiting the place. Unlike select offices and stores where thermal scanning of customers is in place, there was no such facility at the entrance of the hyper market.

The situation was no different at a margin-free shop and most of the eateries at Vyttila Junction. People were seen entering these stores and eateries without washing hands or disinfecting them using a hand sanitiser.

The manager of a leading retail store admitted that they were yet to provide hand sanitisers to visitors. “We just ran out of stock of sanitisers. The idea of keeping one at the entry point never came to our mind,” he said.

According to the Health Department, public behaviour is largely responsible for the speedy transmission of COVID-19 and that adoption of hand hygiene and practising social distancing can to a large extent prevent the spread of the virus. Handwashing should be complemented by maintaining proper respiratory hygiene, avoiding touching on face unnecessarily and by doing away with social greetings like hand shakes.

A frequent visitor at a grocery store at Edappally pointed out that customers were at risk at stores that failed to keep hand sanitisers at entry points.

“Think of a situation where an infected person visits the store. He may touch many items kept on shelves and chances of others getting infected cannot be ruled out,” he said.

The government had directed all institutions and workplaces to make available hand sanitisers at entry points, which should be used by employees before and after entering workplaces. Apartment complexes should establish kiosks at entrances and encourage people to sanitise their hands before entering or exiting the places.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/covid-19-shops-in-kochi-yet-to-keep-sanitisers-at-entry-points/article31103263.ece
365,2020/03/19,MGU law students in a spot over exams,"Outstation candidates want fourth semester tests postponed

The decision of the Mahatma Gandhi University to commence the fourth semester examinations for LL.B courses in its affiliated colleges on April 1 has put the students of Government Law College, Ernakulam, especially those residing in other districts, in a spot. A third-year student residing in Malappuram said the applications (without fine) for the exam had to reach the university office in Kottayam by March 21. “I am staying in Areekode, where a COVID-19 case has been confirmed. Most of my family members are not venturing out of the home in view of the health scare,” he said.

The student said many students residing outside Ernakulam will have to use public transport to reach the campus within two days to submit the application for the examination. “We will be in for trouble if the hostel is not re-opened. It was closed following a government directive after the COVID-19 scare. The exams are to begin in 10 days.

367,2020/03/19,New protocol for Gulf returnees to reach home,"Passengers from seven highly affected countries will continue to be transported home by ambulance

With the mandatory quarantine period of 14 days being extended from Wednesday to passengers flying into the country from the UAE, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait, health authorities have chalked out a plan to systematically deal with the additional number of passengers who will have to be quarantined upon deboarding at the Cochin International Airport.

Since it would no longer be practical to arrange ambulances from the airport to their homes for such a large number of passengers, their transport from the airport would be streamlined, said Dr. Mathews Numpeli, Ernakulam District Programme Manager, National Health Mission. After screening, asymptomatic passengers will be allowed to take airport taxis or their own vehicles after ensuring that they wear masks and the vehicles are not air conditioned.

They will be required to sign an affidavit to the effect that no pitstops would be made en route and that they would not take public transport, and would remain in home quarantine for 14 days.

Asymptomatic passengers arriving from the seven highly affected countries that were notified earlier - China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, France, Spain and Germany - will continue to be transported by ambulance to their homes. Symptomatic passengers will be transferred to the isolation facility at the government hospital at Aluva.

“The alternative strategy is in anticipation of an inflow of passengers from the Middle East. Already, 2,300 of the roughly 2,600 passengers arriving at the airport travel from or via airports in the Gulf countries,” Dr. Mathews said.

The revised protocol would be implemented at the airport from Wednesday night.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/new-protocol-for-gulf-returnees-to-reach-home/article31102676.ece
368,2020/03/19,Water supply to three panchayats disrupted,"Pumping halted after contaminated water enters system

Drinking water supply to over one lakh people in Vazhakulam, Kizhakkambalam, and Kunnathunad panchayats of the district was disrupted on Wednesday after contaminated water entered the drawing lines of the pumping station of the Kerala Water Authority at Marambally near Aluva.

The pumping had to be stopped at 6.30 a.m. on the day after polluted water, which emanated a strong stench, entered the water drawing system. Besides the stench, foam was also visible in the water. The pumping system was shut down after the contamination was noticed, said K. K. Jolly, executive engineer of the PH Division of the Kerala Water Authority.

The stench of sulphur was discernible. Some untreated effluents might have reached the water body leading to contamination. The issue was brought to the notice of the Kerala State Pollution Control Board, which collected the water samples for analysis, and the local bodies concerned. A police complaint was also filed, she said.

It may take around four days for restoring the water supply as the system has to be cleaned. If left unattended, it would have contaminated the water supply to other areas of the district, she said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/m20ape/article31102649.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PHOTO-2020-03-18-21-20-57,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/water-supply-to-three-panchayats-disrupted/article31102650.ece

370,2020/03/19,Kochi ranked 21 among Smart Cities,"City improves position from 54 in September last year

Kochi city has improved its position several notches by taking a leap from 54 in September last year to 21 on the list of 100 smart cities under the Smart Cities Mission.

The new rankings take into account several Smart City projects being implemented by the Cochin Smart Mission Limited.

“The CSML has faced many issues relating to availability of land, lack of bidders and the like. We are almost in the last phase of the tender procedures and many projects are ongoing. Kochi has now moved to the higher ranking as efforts in the implementation of projects carried out by Cochin Smart Mission Limited got a higher weightage. A Smart City can do a lot of things for the improvement of the life of the citizens in the city. We hope that all the projects taken up by the Kochi Smart City will help in the quality of living of people in the city,” said Alkesh Kumar Sharma, CEO of CSML.

The revised city ranking formula had taken into consideration several criteria including value of tendered projects, value of projects for which work order had been issued, value of completed projects and value of convergence projects.

Projects worth 65% of Smart City funding are in various stages of implementation right now and CSML expects to award projects costing ₹150 crore in the coming months.

371,2020/03/19,Private hospitals briefed on COVID-19 guidelines,"District administration conducts video-conference

The district administration on Wednesday held video-conferencing with private hospitals in which guidelines to deal with COVID-19 infection were issued to them.

Assistant Collector M.S. Madhavikutty led the video-conferencing session in which medical experts including WHO consultant P.S. Ragesh and Deputy DMO K. Savitha interacted with doctors of 92 hospitals in the district.

Many wanted to know if they could continue to be on duty if someone in the family had recently returned from overseas. They were told to continue, unless unwell. They should, however, stay away from the rest of the relatives at home.

The hospitals were told that in case samples of a COVID-19 suspected patient are sent for testing at NIV, Alappuzha, this could only be done through the control room. In case of any confirmation of the disease in a patient under treatment, the patient should continue at the private hospital, provided it was equipped for this.

372,2020/03/19,Celebration of theatre,"At the five-day Bikaner Theatre Festival, varied themes and styles entertained the audience

Bikaner is generally known for its forts, palaces, the Karni Mata Temple, sweets and spicy snacks. What is little known is its vibrant theatre landscape and discerning audience. This fact is vividly illustrated by the five-day Bikaner Theatre Festival 2020 which ended recently and featured five plays daily at different auditoriums across the town. It is a matter of pride for the theatre lovers of Bikaner that it has more than five auditoriums available to amateur theatre groups at nominal rental charges.

One of the prestigious events of Rajasthan, the theatre festival was dedicated to eminent theatre director-playwright Bhanu Bharti who has created a number of theatrical milestones like “Pashu Gayatri”, “Chandrama Singh urf Chamku”, “Andha Yug” and “Tughlaq” in his more than four-decade-long creative life.

Most of the plays staged at the festival painted realistic picture of the existing social life and a few captured mythological imagery and recreated folk themes. The thematic variety and impressive presentational styles stimulated, moved and entertained the audience. One of the plays “Saadhu Aur Sundari”, presented by the Department Drama And Theatre, Raja Man Singh Tomar Music and Arts University, Gwalior, explored farcical elements against the backdrop of rural landscape of Bundelkhand .

Fillip to folk

Adapted by Dr. Himanshu Dwivedi from Mahakavi Bodhayana's “Bhagavadajjukam”, “Saadhu Aur Sundari” is a farce which is frequently staged by a number of directors in different versions. In English, the play is popularly known as “The Hermit and the Harlot”. The Bundelkhandi version under the direction of Dr. Dwivedi is set in Swang style, a folk theatre form, which imparted fluidity to the action, enhancing the pace of the production. The director has also synthesised other elements of the folk theatre of the region like Badhai, Raee, Naurat and Jhijhiya. An array of folk musical instruments accompanied the vocalists.

The main characters include a hermit, a disciple, a courtesan and her lady attendant, messenger of Lord Yama and a hopelessly misfit rural physician invited to cure a snake-bite patient. All these caricatures interact in a way that creates farcical situations which evoke laughter long and loud. The hermit is more concerned with his own spiritual upliftment, ignoring what is happening around him. His disciple, seemingly a simpleton, became a monk simply to get enough food and at one stage had an infatuation for a courtesan. However, the device of transmigration of the hermit’s soul into the body of the courtesan and courtesan’s soul into the body of hermit create hilarious moments. The blending of Bundelkhandi traditional art forms makes the production visually and aurally fascinating. Rahul Shaaky as the disciple, Narendra Singh Chauhan as the hermit and Seema Soni as the courtesan with mischievous charm, are eminently comic.

From Chittorgarh, director Narain Sharma brought Turra Kalangi which is a popular form to convey earthy humour and the message of social harmony. Two rival groups of performers, one representing Lord Shiva and another female figure which is the embodiment of invincible power. Through their full-throated musical rendering in a form derived from Khyala to the accompaniment of vigorous dances try to establish the superiority of their respective divine image. In fact, Turra and Kalangi are two ornaments which are attached to royal turban to add splendour. Using aggressive gestures, high-pitched rendering of dialogue at places, the performers establish a lively rapport with the audience. The verbal acrobatics of rivals are as much retaliatory as these are replete with wit and humour. In its original form, the show lasts for hours, regaling hundreds of spectators, frequently indulging in unsavoury dialogues, insulting rival parties.

Communal harmony

In the production under review, the rivals finally reconcile and accept the need for gender equality and convey the message of communal harmony.

Kalandar, Jaipur presented “Bhanwarya Kalet”, which is written and directed by Sikandar Khan. The play depicts Mirasi people of Rajasthan languishing in misery because their traditional occupation of ballad singing and entertainment has almost sunk into oblivion. The play opens on a note of suspense but it is not sustained long enough. The production hardly acquires dramatic momentum and the pace is slow.

However, the director has created the right ambience in which Mirasi family is condemned to survive as a scrap dealer and forced to allow anti-social elements to use their dingy room as a dumping place for their useless material.

Since Mirasi culture is rich in music, the director could have used background music to reinforce the stark pessimism that permeates the production. The narrative is too straightforward to create dramatic conflict. The stage is too cluttered to allow performers to move unhindered.

Sikandar Khan as the scrap dealer deeply attached to his dumb brother and desperately trying to salvage family's sinking fortunes and Moin Khan as the brother give impressive performances.

Vijay Kumar Travelling Box Theatre, Goa staged “Thank You, Dadaji” which is written and directed by Vijay Kumar Naik. The play unfolds in the centre of a hall with audience on four sides which could be described as an arena stage. The production is remarkable for its sensitive treatment of the world of a lonely aged widower.

An austere production, it is rich in suggestion. The element of suspense holds the interest of the audience. The action moves forward rhythmically to a climax that has happy ending, affirming that man is essentially good at heart. Vijay Nayak as the lonely old man and Sagar Pednekar as the thief masquerading as a grandson give brilliant performances with intense concentration on the delineation of their characters with subtle touches.

Written by Manish Joshi, directed by Suvojit Bandhopdhay and presented by Theatre Shine, Kolkata, “Thirsty Crow Returns” is one of the fine productions of the festival. School Children know about the story of a thirsty crow who managed to quench its thirst by picking pebbles one by one and dropping them into a pitcher half-filled with water. In the play under review, the new generation crow has a wider vision of life and is desperate to get a respected place in the community of forest animals and birds. With the help of its friend, a little girl, it succeeds in his bitter struggle.

It has captivating music, colourful costumes and choreographic patterns that exude vitality. The outlandish masks are harmonised into an artistic whole.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/vy8qab/article31109851.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thumbnailDSC1734-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/celebration-of-theatre/article31109852.ece
373,2020/03/19,This beauty studio is the first in India to use AR to customise lipstick shades,"LipHue in Hyderabad, run by Avni and Dyuti Waghray, also wants makeup-lovers to know what ingredients are going into their lipsticks

Dyuti and Avni Waghray love their lipsticks; the former wearing a dusky nude, while the latter dons a flamingo pink. Their Banjara Hills studio, LipHue, is aflood with natural light courtesy the floor-to-ceiling windows. “When it comes to makeup, we refuse to use yellow lighting as that does not give the accurate perception of how makeup looks on a person in everyday surroundings, so our studio mimics that,” says Avni. The mostly-white space has pops of colour from the various lip art on the walls and the giant lip sofa for customers.

LipHue’s USP is its two-step custom lipstick experience, the first being sit in front of an Augmented Reality facility to clock a shade of the customer’s choice and the second being a crafting session where one can make marginal adjustments along with add-ons like essential oils. Ingredients matter big time to the Waghray sisters as the country has long faced an issue with this. “Your lips are an indicator of good health and you have to treat them just as you would any organ in your body,” insists Avni, “so we made sure our products are cruelty-free and totally transparent in their making.”

To get to this point required an arduous journey. “We conceptualised LipHue in 2017,” explains Dyuti, “and our research and training along with the rigorous certification were a collective non-stop process since then. Given that what we offer at LipHue is the first of its kind in India, our experience with the government was very satisfying and we found them to be very supportive and encouraging during the certification process.”

Beyond lip service

The decision to integrate an AR facility into the process was always on the forefront of their minds. “We always wanted to use technology to help enhance customer experience. We use AR to help our customers in the decision-making process. It’s never easy to choose that one lip colour especially when you’re creating your own, right? The technology and knowhow came from within the family. It took us about eight months to conceptualise, build, test and deploy the same.”

AR can be intimidating to first-time users. Would it be accurate? What about privacy? “In the era of personalisation and customisation where customers increasingly want choices tailored to their desiderata and life style, we want to pioneer this transmutation in cosmetics in India. At LipHue, it is not just buying a lipstick, it’s about the experience of creating your own lipstick.” Dyuti also adds that expansion is in the books. The same goes for upgrading technology.

But what of privacy? After all, the AR model uses some form of facial recognition. “Our systems are fully secured, the software and data resides within our premises with only the approved administrator having access to the same. We respect the privacy of each of our customers’ data/information and have policies defined with a clear view to safeguard the customer information and in line with industry best practices. The customer information is collected solely for the purpose of storing the details pertaining to the customer’s lip shade for any future reference, share invoices and receipts, respond to customer requests and to comply with laws and regulations as mandated by regulators.”

Step by step

The mixing of colours is probably the most satisfying to watch, understanding the elemental hues which make up a final shade. Then the mixture is blended and melted into a sterilised mould and cooled down to a solid form. The resulting bullet is then fed into the glitzy lipstick pop-out tube for the customer.

The sisters kicked off LipHue officially last September and have made quite the name for themselves. “We get a lot of kitty parties and girls’ day outings, so we recommend always calling ahead to book an appointment,” Dyuti says.

Avni concludes that given LipHue presents an intimate customer experience, with all the try-ons, one should avoid coming to the studio if they are feeling unwell on any level. She adds, “We’ll still be here, don’t worry!”

374,2020/03/19,Woman seeks death certificate of ‘missing’ husband,"The fisherman went missing when a boat sank in the sea in 2005

MADURAI

After a woman who lost her fisherman husband in 2005 moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday seeking compensation and issuance of the death certificate of her husband, the court directed the State to respond in the case.

Justice C.V. Karthikeyan directed the State government to present details of similar cases. The case was adjourned for filing of the report. The petitioner, T. Malliga of Rameswaram, said that she was in dire need of money to run her family.

Ms. Malliga said that in 2005, her husband and three others went into the sea for fishing, and their boat sank into the sea.

While the other three men were rescued from Katchatheevu later, the woman said, her husband could not be traced. She said that she had registered a missing complaint with the local police and also approached the government for help, but to no avail.

Pointing out that she was finding it hard to make ends meet, the woman said that under Section 108 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, a person missing for long and not heard of for over seven years could be presumed to have died. It was 15 years since her husband went missing, she said.

The woman said that the families of fishermen who lost their lives in cyclones had received compensation from the State. But, no such monetary benefit had been given to her so far.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/woman-seeks-death-certificate-of-missing-husband-madurai/article31111216.ece

382,2020/03/19,All tourist hubs in Madurai are under lock and key,"‘Sorry, we are closed’

Acting on the orders of the State government, popular tourist destinations in Madurai have closed their gates to visitors in the wake of COVID-19.

On Wednesday, staff members of Gandhi Museum displayed a board outside stating that the premises was closed to visitors.

Administrative Officer K.R. Nanda Rao said that although between 500 and 1,000 people visited the museum every day, they were taking all precautions to ensure that tourists steered clear of the premises. “Only the staff are present and we are practising social distancing.”

Weekly classes and the library on the premises too were off limits, he added.

Curator of Tirumalai Nayak Palace K. Sakthivel said the government’s instructions came on March 16, when the second sound and light show was taking place. “We tried to wrap it up early and closed the premises immediately.”

S. Shanmugarajan said tourists, who were led by tour guides like him, were aware of the shut down. “Occasionally, north Indian tourists come and seek permission to be allowed inside the palace. But they are denied entry.”

An official from the Tamil Nadu Archaeological Department said Keeladi was off limits to tourists. “The excavation work will continue for now, but tourists are not allowed to visit now. Many seem to think that this is a holiday and want to engage their children. It is not safe to bring them to tourist spots,” he cautioned.

Security personnel at World Tamil Sangam said students studying for competitive examinations were asked to leave the campus. “A large number of students come here to study. We have been asking them to vacate,” said a security guard.

Since the closure of several public places, many students without study material were having a hard time, S. Prem Kumar, a civil service aspirant, rued.

“We try to study on Corporation ground, but the guards just told us that we cannot sit there any more. Those of us who share study material or do group study no longer have space. We understand the importance of isolation but it is a difficult time for us,” Mr. Prem Kumar said.

All tourist spots and 53 parks under the Corporation are expected to stay closed until March 31.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/x2sg6v/article31105160.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA19-MUSEUM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/all-tourist-hubs-in-madurai-are-under-lock-and-key/article31105161.ece
383,2020/03/19,About 25 million jobs could be lost worldwide due to coronavirus: UN,"It also proposes fiscal and monetary policy measures, and lending and financial support for specific economic sectors.

Nearly 25 million jobs could be lost worldwide due to the coronavirus pandemic, but an internationally coordinated policy response can help lower the impact on global unemployment, according to a UN agency.

In its preliminary assessment report titled “COVID-19 and world of work: Impacts and responses”, the International Labour Organization (ILO) calls for urgent, large-scale and coordinated measures across three pillars — protecting workers in the workplace, stimulating the economy and employment, and supporting jobs and incomes.

The ILO said these measures include extending social protection, supporting employment retention (i.e short-time work, paid leave, other subsidies), and financial and tax relief, including for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.

It also proposes fiscal and monetary policy measures, and lending and financial support for specific economic sectors.

The economic and labour crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic could increase global unemployment by almost 25 million, the ILO said.

“However, if we see an internationally coordinated policy response, as happened in the global financial crisis of 2008/9, then the impact on global unemployment could be significantly lower,” it added.

The report provides different scenarios of how unemployment and underemployment will be impacted due to the coronavirus.

Based on different scenarios for the impact of COVID-19 on global GDP growth, the ILO estimates indicate a rise in global unemployment of between 5.3 million (“low” scenario) and 24.7 million (“high” scenario) from a base level of 188 million in 2019. By comparison, the 2008-09 global financial crisis increased global unemployment by 22 million.

Underemployment is also expected to increase on a large scale, as the economic consequences of the virus outbreak translate into reductions in working hours and wages.

Self-employment in developing countries, which often serves to cushion the impact of changes, may not do so this time because of restrictions on the movement of people (e.g. service providers) and goods, it said.

The note said that falls in employment also meant large income losses for workers to the tune of between $860 billion and $3.4 trillion by the end of 2020. This will translate into falls in consumption of goods and services, in turn affecting the prospects for businesses and economies.

Working poverty is expected to increase significantly too, as “the strain on incomes resulting from the decline in economic activity will devastate workers close to or below the poverty line,” the ILO said.

It estimates that between 8.8 and 35 million additional people will be in working poverty worldwide, compared to the original estimate for 2020 (which projected a decline of 14 million worldwide).

Underscoring the need for swift and coordinated policy responses, ILO Director-General Guy Ryder said “this is no longer only a global health crisis, it is also a major labour market and economic crisis that is having a huge impact on people.”

“In 2008, the world presented a united front to address the consequences of the global financial crisis, and the worst was averted. We need that kind of leadership and resolve now,” he added.

The ILO note warns that certain groups will be disproportionately affected by the jobs crisis, which could increase inequality.

These include people in less protected and low-paid jobs, particularly youth and older workers and women and migrants too, who are vulnerable due to the lack of social protection and rights, and women tend to be over-represented in low-paid jobs and affected sectors.

“In times of crisis like the current one, we have two key tools that can help mitigate the damage and restore public confidence. Firstly, social dialogue, engaging with workers and employers and their representatives, is vital for building public trust and support for the measures that we need to overcome this crisis.

“Secondly, international labour standards provide a tried-and-trusted foundation for policy responses that focus on a recovery that is sustainable and equitable. Everything needs to be done to minimise the damage to people at this difficult time,” Ryder said.

The rupee continued its downward spiral and plunged 84 paise to a new record low of 75.10 (provisional) against the dollar on Thursday, as investors braced for a coronavirus-led economic recession.

Traders said there is a sense of anxiety among investors as they see the global as well as domestic economy plunging into a deep crisis due to the coronavirus pandemic that has killed over 9,000 and sickened lakhs of people around the globe.

The steep decline in domestic equities and sustained foreign fund outflows further dampened the sentiment, they said.

At the inter-bank foreign exchange market, the local currency opened at 74.96. During the day, it saw a high of 74.70 and a low of 75.30 against the American currency.

The domestic unit finally settled at 75.10 against the greenback, down 84 paise over its previous close.

The local unit had settled at 74.26 against the greenback on Wednesday.

“India’s rupee weakened to a new record low on foreign fund outflows from domestic equity and debt market. Global meltdown in risk assets seen with rising number of coronavirus cases is adding to anxiety,” said V.K. Sharma, Head PCG and Capital Markets Strategy, HDFC Securities.

BSE metal, capital goods, auto, energy and industrials indices cracked up to 7.17%, while telecom was the only gainer.

Broader midcap and smallcap indices plunged up to 4.53%.

Stimulus packages by global central banks and governments failed to lift investor sentiment in Asia, stoking the already-peaking fears of an economic recession.

South Korea’s Kospi was the worst-hit index in the continent, plunging over 8%, followed by Hang Seng, Nikkei and Shanghai Compositive Index.

Bourses in Europe, however, turned positive after the European Central Bank (ECB) announced a surprise EUR 750-billion stimulus package.

390,2020/03/19,An SC verdict violative of minority rights,"The recent decision by a two-judge bench takes away autonomy of madrasas in W. Bengal

Protection of minorities is the hallmark of a civilisation. Lord Acton added another dimension to this when he said: “The most certain test by which we judge whether a country is really free is the amount of security enjoyed by minorities.” The minorities in general, and Muslims in particular, accepted the pledge of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel that “our mission is to satisfy every interest and safeguard the interests of all the minorities to their satisfaction”. Accordingly, special safeguards were guaranteed to the minorities and incorporated under Article 30 with a view to instil in them a sense of confidence and security. However, due to recent developments in Delhi and elsewhere, this confidence stands eroded even though, in the Kesavananda Bharati case (1973), minority rights were held to be the part of basic structure of the Constitution.

In the last one year, a new trend has emerged in the Supreme Court. Smaller benches now do not hesitate to overrule larger benches’ decisions. Increasingly, judicial discipline is losing its charm. In the latest judgment on minority rights, a two-judge bench of Justice U.U. Lalit and Justice Arun Mishra upheld the West Bengal Board of Madrasah Education Act, 1994, and the West Bengal Madrasah Service Commission Act, 2008, both of which take away the autonomy of madrasas in the State. The appointment of teachers in these theological institutions shall now be made by a board nominated by the government.

Rights under Article 30

What is the importance of minority rights? Why is the judgment per incuriam, i.e. contrary to law?

As per Section 10 of the West Bengal Madrasah Service Commission Act, 2008, all appointments of teachers to the religious schools are to be recommended by the commission and the management committee shall be bound by such recommendations. Section 11 says that anyone appointed in contravention of this Act shall not be considered a teacher and such an appointment shall be invalid. Section 12 empowers the government to deny grants to the schools that refuse to make appointments in accordance with such recommendations. Further, government recognition and affiliation of such schools can be withdrawn.

A single judge of Calcutta High Court in March 2014 struck down the above provisions as violative of Article 30 that guarantees religious and linguistic minorities the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. In December 2015, a Division Bench of the High Court upheld that decision.

Interestingly, the latest judgment notes that in Chandana Das (2019), a three-judge bench gave the Sikh minority institutions of West Bengal the right to appoint teachers. In less than four months, a right given to Sikh minority institutions by the apex court has been denied to Muslim minority religious institutions.

Framers of the Constitution in their wisdom did not include any restrictions under Article 30 (unlike in the case of other fundamental rights). Hence, the Article 30 right is absolute though minority institutions are very much subject to health, sanitary and municipal regulations.

The expression ‘administer’ in Article 30 has been interpreted by the larger benches of the court such as those of judges in Ahmedabad St. Xaviers College (1974) and 11 judges in T.M.A. Pai Foundation (2003). The apex court has been consistent in holding that the term includes rights of minority institutions to select their governing bodies, teachers and staff and exercise disciplinary control over them and a right to fix reasonable fees and admit students in a fair and transparent manner.

The dual test criterion

In Rev. Sidharjbhai (1963), a six-judge bench of the Supreme Court observed that every government regulation in respect of a minority institution shall be valid only when it satisfies the dual test, i.e., it is regulative and not destructive of the organisation’s minority character and it makes the minority institution an effective vehicle of minority education.

Justice Lalit, who authored the latest judgment, did refer to the Kerala Education Bill case (1957) of the Supreme Court but he overlooked the fact that a seven-judge bench headed by Chief Justice S.R. Das had held that “the dominant word in Article 30 is ‘choice’ and the content of the right under that Article is as wide as the choice of a particular minority community will make it.” Every minority community can thus make a choice in respect of its relationship with the government, the courses taught and the day today administration, including the right to select its teachers. The government, under reasonable restrictions, can certainly prescribe the minimum qualifications. Thus UGC regulations prescribing qualifications and experience are very much applicable. But the government cannot impose its own selection of teachers on the minority institutions.

Justice Lalit himself noted several judgments on the right to choose teachers such as Rev. Father W. Proost (1969), where a five-judge bench had struck down Section 48-A of Bihar State Universities Act, 1960 that had provided that no appointment, dismissal or reduction in the rank of any teacher could be made by any governing body of a minority institution without the recommendation of University Service Commission. Similarly, in Very Rev. Mother Provincial (1969), appointment of a principal was held to be a component of a minority group’s right to administer the institution.

In Ahmedabad St. Xaviers (1974), Section 33A(1) (b) of Gujarat University Act, 1949 that required that a nominee of the affiliating university must be part of the selection committee of principal and teachers was also struck down. A nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court explicitly held that minority institutions have the right to choose their teachers. In T.M.A. Pai (2003), an 11-judge bench reiterated that the management of minority institutions should have freedom in day-to-day affairs of the institutions, for example, in appointment of teaching and non-teaching staff and administrative control. However, minimum qualifications, experience and other conditions may be fixed by the government.

Justice Lalit overlooked the striking down of provisions where State governments had tried to take over or interfere with the selection of teachers and based his judgment on the broad and general observations in the earlier verdicts where the court had said government regulations are permissible. It would have been much better if the learned judge had relied on Bihar State Madrasa Education Board (1990), which he did cite, and where the court had observed that “under the guise of regulating educational standards to secure efficiency in institution, the state is not entitled to frame rules or regulations compelling the management to surrender its right to administration”.

The Chief Justice of India has now referred this judgment to a larger bench and one hopes that the apex court will restore the confidence of the minorities.

391,2020/03/19,Over the cliff,"The next U.S. President must take cues from Sanders’s Green New Deal while formulating climate policy

The next U.S. President will decide whether the planet goes over the climate cliff or pulls back from the brink. The gravity of this moment is not reflected sufficiently in most public conversations on who should be the Democratic Party nominee.

Within the next decade, the world must reduce its annual greenhouse gas emissions by 55% to have a chance at curbing warming to within 1.5°C, or by 25% to have a chance at staying below 2°C, compared with average pre-industrial temperatures. Both these temperature guardrails have implications for adverse effects from warming, though the stricter threshold is expected to cause less harm.

Currently, we do not exactly know where the planet is headed with regard to rising temperatures, as greenhouse gas emissions are still rising annually at around 1% -3% and financial pledges lie unfulfilled. The Paris Agreement commitments made in 2015, even if achieved, are inadequate to attain climate stability.

The Obama years

The last Democratic Presidency (2008-2016) was during a time when the second commitment period of the Kyoto Agreement began and the Copenhagen Accord was forged. Neither the Kyoto nor Copenhagen pledges were fulfilled by the U.S. The world’s biggest contributor to anthropogenic greenhouse gases accumulated in the atmosphere made weak promises and did not keep them.

And, as if to thumb its nose at the world even more, under President Donald Trump, the U.S. withdrew from the Paris Agreement and its voluntary commitment to reduce emissions.

Currently, the second biggest emitter after China, the U.S. is responsible for between one-third to one-fourth of all the anthropogenic carbon dioxide that was discharged into the atmosphere from 1750 to the present. It is doing the least in leading the way, although some of its rich potential is being harnessed through State and local action. Yet, it must, and can, do much more and provide finance and leadership along with deep decarbonisation domestically, while making technological and financial reparations to the rest of the world.

The role of the U.S. in sharply reducing its emissions, accepting responsibility and leadership, and persuading other countries to follow suit is indeed vital. The next President, even if he is Democratic, cannot go back to old habits on global climate change policy. Far more is urgently needed for the planet even to have a chance at survival, and the U.S. is directly positioned to act as a planetary steward for climate action.

Efforts merely intended to improve the efficiency of transport or some other common practice, without demanding personal consideration and public discussion of choices in consumption patterns, will lead to window-dressing rather than deep cuts in emissions. Transformations that call for fundamental changes in energy use, lifestyles, transport, housing and values are pivotal. The Democratic nominee and future President cannot take the world back to the old ways of addressing the climate crisis, but needs to be a galvanising force within the country and then use that moral leadership to spur change elsewhere.

Going beyond Paris

The ‘Green New Deal’ is a good beginning for measures within the U.S., but details have to be spelt out on what kind of support will be given to the poorest countries, which have emitted almost zero greenhouse gases but will suffer the most. Even the fulfillment of national pledges in the Paris Agreement relies on support from the U.S. and Europe. Unfortunately, since the atmosphere is one of the largest shared commons, countries do not have a choice but to work together. What each one of us does affects everyone.

The bold ideas proposed by Senator Bernie Sanders and his team are especially promising in this regard. They call for transformative changes within the country and collaborative, responsible action with the rest of the world. His rival and current leader in the race to the Democratic Convention in July, Joe Biden, is nowhere close to having as sensible a climate call to action, but it is at least incremental. The faint hope is that he and his team can be persuaded to take full moral accountability for lost time and inaction and engage in swift effort for a sustainable planet.

The American and world public must speak loudly. Unless the next President can build on an ambitious platform, a planetary cataclysm is imminent. The current debates within the Democratic Party are no longer just domestic quarrels; they have potentially harmful global consequences.

That mass gatherings, especially in enclosed spaces, provide the perfect conditions for novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to easily spread became amply clear early on during the COVID-19 outbreak. The number of cases reported from the Diamond Princess cruise ship kept increasing before reaching 712; half-a-dozen jails in China reported over 500 cases. Both in Singapore and South Korea, large clusters of cases have had their origin in churches.

Countries across the world, from China to Italy, have been taking the World Health Organization (WHO)’s advice of quarantining and social distancing seriously to contain the spread of the virus. Taking a cue from these, many sporting events, from Formula 1 racing events to tennis, basketball, football and cricket championships, including the Indian Premier League, have been put off or cancelled.

Coronavirus | Social distancing key to containing COVID-19, say experts

Government advisory

On March 6, when the number of cases crossed 1,00,000 globally and stood at 31 in India, the Union government advised all States to avoid or postpone mass gatherings till the COVID-19 outbreak was contained. It wanted States to take precautions in case mass gatherings were held. Earlier, taking the advice of experts to avoid mass gatherings to cut the transmission chain, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that he was not going to celebrate Holi. Making a similar announcement, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also appealed to people of his State to “refrain from attending social functions”. Soon after the March 6 advisory, educational institutions, malls, theatres, to name a few, were shut in many States. Mumbai ordered private companies to work with 50% staff capacity.

But, just a couple of weeks later, at a time when even mass gatherings involving a few hundred people are being discouraged, the U.P. government has said that the Ayodhya Ram Navami Mela will be held as planned from March 25 to April 2. The mela, which attracts lakhs of tourists every year, will be of special significance this time as it will be the first such function after the apex court’s Ayodhya verdict. At a time when the virus seems to have gained renewed vigour and is marching across countries, infecting thousands and killing hundreds each day, a congregation of such magnitude could have serious consequences and shift the trajectory of the outbreak in India.

Tradition cannot be allowed to override public health, especially when it cannot be guaranteed that the number of people congregating can be reduced or precautions instituted. More so when the virus in question is highly infectious, while India’s healthcare system is weak and cannot take a frontal assault by the virus if hundreds of people manifest serious symptoms. There have been several recent instances when large gatherings have had disastrous consequences.

On International Women’s Day on March 8, over 1,20,000 people marched through Madrid. The same day, over 60,000 fans gathered at the city’s largest stadiums and 9,000 supporters of Vox party assembled inside a sports centre. Less than a week later, the number of cases shot up from a few hundred to 4,200. Today, with more than 13,700 cases, Spain has the third highest number of cases outside China.

Examples of Malaysia and Iran

In Malaysia, over 16,000 people gathered in late-February in a mosque complex in the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur for a four-day meeting. Of the 790+ cases in Malaysia so far, nearly two-thirds are linked to the event. The city of Qom in Iran, where the first case and death were reported, is full of holy sites that people touch and kiss. Qom soon turned into a hotspot and played a role in the virus’s spread to the rest of Iran. While in South Korea, a day after cases soared by 833 in a single day, the church halted masses at more than 1,700 locations across the country.

It is time we learn from the experiences of other countries and act wisely and not allow religious fervour cloud our discretion.

393,2020/03/19,Time for a powerful display of humanity,"In a pandemic it is easy to apportion blame, but this is a moment for the world to be standing together

As the COVID-19 pandemic fells country after country, many in India are wondering if we are somehow different. Globally, it took roughly 45 days for the first 100,000 cases. It is likely to take nine days for the next 100,000. The global death count is now doubling every nine days and stands at 8,248, with 207,518 confirmed cases. That is how epidemics work — they gather steam as infected individuals go on to infect even more people. Confirmed cases in India, as of today stand at 169, much lower than small countries such as Iceland (around 250). Could this really be the case that we have fared better than everyone else?

Probably not. Testing in India remains abysmally low. Only about 10 in a million people in India have been tested, compared to say nearly 120 in a million in Thailand or 40 per million in Vietnam. The stated explanation is that the limited number of test kits are being conserved for when they are truly needed but when is the need greater than right now? There are probably shortages even in being able to procure adequate supplies given that many countries are seeking to buy the limited stocks. Testing is the most important thing we could be doing right now. As the Director General of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus, said recently about the need for more testing, “You cannot fight a fire blindfolded.”

Data | India's coronavirus testing rates are among the lowest in the world

Prevent undercounting

We need to identify coronavirus-infected patients in a timely manner in order to increase our chances of preventing secondary infections. There is no shame in saying that we have far more cases than what we have detected so far. Even the United Kingdom, which has a far better health system than India, has admitted that it is probably undercounting its true infections by a factor of 12, and is likely have about 10,000 cases. Is it possible that India with 20 times their population has only 169 cases?

If widespread testing were to commence in India, the number of confirmed cases would likely climb to the thousands very quickly. This is something we have to be prepared for without panic or fear-mongering. This is how epidemics move and the real numbers should spur us into positive action. At some stage, it is possible that the government may have to put in place very strict measures on quarantining and closures, much like what China had to do to control the epidemic in Wuhan.

From a disease perspective, I often get asked how bad things could get. There is no easy answer. If we escape the worst, either because this virus mutates to a less virulent form or because there is something about its temperature or geographical sensitivity that we know nothing about, then we should count our blessings. Viruses do mutate and generally to be less lethal. If the projections from Europe are applicable in India, our ‘namastes’ and clean hands notwithstanding, the prevalence in India would be upwards of 20%. In other words, we should expect to see about 200-300 million cases of COVID-19 infections and about four and eight million severe cases of the kind that are flooding hospitals in Italy and Spain at the moment. More importantly, these cases are projected to appear in just a two to four-month window.

Coronavirus | India does not have the numbers to participate in WHO clinical trial, says ICMR

In the current scenario, we are not ready. India has somewhere between 70,000 and 100,000 intensive care unit beds and probably a smaller number of ventilators. That is simply inadequate. The next two weeks should be spent on planning for large, temporary hospitals that can accommodate such numbers. If we are lucky, we will not need them but as Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director, U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said, “we should get criticized for over-reacting” rather than being under-prepared.

Unprepared for pandemics

This all sounds doomsday-like. But we have known for decades now that of all catastrophic events to befall humanity, between an asteroid hit and a nuclear war, a disease pandemic has always been the highest on our list of impact and probability. My community of infectious disease epidemiologists have spent years warning governments to prepare for such an eventuality, and have written countless articles and hosted many meetings on this subject. There were some changes after the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) but not nearly enough. Pandemic preparedness always took a backseat to the crisis of the moment. And in fairness, there is truly no amount of preparation that can fully mitigate such an occurrence.

Coronavirus | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

In a time of crisis, it is easy to blame government or China or someone else. But this is really a time to stand together, keep an eye on our neighbours, friends, families, co-workers and indeed anyone who has less than we do. That includes your household help, security guards, vendors and indeed anyone who touches your life. It is a time to see how we show the best of our human values while facing a crisis of a proportion none of us has ever witnessed in our lifetime.

Things are about to get a lot worse. Let us hope that this brings out the best in us, and not the worst. Whether we know this or not, these events are just a dress rehearsal for the more challenging events such as climate change that are likely to be with us this century. And if we take care of each other, we will survive both these challenges with our humanity intact.

394,2020/03/19,Democratic heft: On Joe Biden’s surge,"Biden’s seeming electability needs message of socio-economic equality voiced by Sanders

Well into the middle of the U.S. Democratic primaries, the party’s prospective nomination is tipping in favour of former Vice-President Joe Biden, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is fast falling behind. Barring the possibility of dramatic victories in the 27 remaining States that are holding primaries and caucuses between now and June 23, the odds of Mr. Sanders staging a comeback in terms of the 1,991 delegates required to secure the nomination are increasingly insurmountable. At the present juncture, Mr. Biden has at least 1,147 of the 2,176 delegates declared; Mr. Sanders has won at least 861. Others out of the race include Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg. Mr. Sanders, the self-declared “democratic socialist” candidate and outsider to the party mainstream, stood apart from the pack early on, with solid performances in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. Analysts surmised that his message of economic equality and improving American middle class welfare were resonating strongly. Yet it was Mr. Biden, with his political pedigree of serving in the Obama administration and long service as a U.S. Senator from Delaware, who snatched the momentum on March 3, Super Tuesday, when 14 States went to the polls for the nomination.

A key consideration in assessing the Democratic nomination is how much does electability matter as opposed to ideological coherence, given the nature of the party’s formidable opponent, President Trump? In a sense it is Mr. Sanders’ policies that purport to take the Democratic Party’s fight for the betterment of the middle class’s welfare to its logical conclusion: toward the government providing a safety net to those who do not organically bubble to the top in the U.S.’s ruggedly individualistic model of capitalism. However, does the U.S.’s fiscal politics allow this expansionary approach, given the deficit size, and the mood for smaller government that is focused on bringing jobs back to the U.S.? Further, on the electability count, Mr. Biden has already emerged as a foil to Mr. Trump owing to the latter’s shenanigans with Ukraine last year, and which led to his being impeached. However, despite the broad support that Mr. Biden now commands, his party may stand a decent chance of besting Mr. Trump in November only if it blends Mr. Biden’s apparent electability with the powerful message of socio-economic equality underpinning Mr. Sanders’s campaign. This hope, that Mr. Biden could build a bridge to the policy agenda of his Democratic rival, could bring all those youth and minority voters who backed Mr. Sanders over two campaigns into the tent and out to the hustings on election day.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/democratic-heft-the-hindu-editorial-on-joe-bidens-surge/article31101939.ece
395,2020/03/19,Competitive impropriety: On Ranjan Gogoi’s Rajya Sabha nomination,"Retired judges should not accept a Parliament seat lest it be seen as a political reward

The President’s nomination of former Chief Justice of India, Ranjan Gogoi, as a Rajya Sabha member so soon after his retirement will be seen as a crass example of a regime rewarding a member of the judiciary for meeting its expectations during his tenure. It will be futile to argue that it is a well-deserved recognition for an eminent jurist. The gap of four months between his retirement and nomination, and the fact that a series of decisions in his court were in seeming conformity with the present government’s expectations militate against such a justification. The second argument, that there have been instances of retired Chief Justices being nominated to the Upper House or appointed Governors, does not cut ice either, as it is nothing more than a dubious claim to the same level of impropriety. In fact, references to the late CJI Ranganath Mishra and Justice Baharul Islam as valid precedents reflect quite poorly on the executive, and amount to competitive impropriety. There continues to be a perception that these were lapses in propriety. Justice Mishra’s commission of inquiry absolved the Congress from any organisational responsibility for the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Justice Islam exonerated a Congress Chief Minister of wrong-doing in a financial scandal in Bihar. The party had helped Justice Islam move both ways between Parliament and the judiciary. He quit the Upper House in 1972 to take office as a High Court judge. In 1983, he quit as a Supreme Court judge to contest an election.

Mr. Gogoi’s appointment cannot be seen, as he has sought to project, as a way of ensuring cohesion between the judiciary and the legislature. He no longer represents the judiciary, and his contribution will be limited to the expertise and knowledge he can bring to debates in Parliament. Any attempt to create ‘cohesion’ between the two wings would necessarily encroach on the judiciary’s role as a restraining force on the executive and legislature. He should have rejected the offer, considering not only the nature of the judgments that Benches headed by him had delivered in the Ayodhya dispute and Rafale investigation, and the administrative decisions he had made in prioritising some cases above matters such as the validity of electoral bonds and Kashmir’s altered status. These will be coloured, in retrospect. Also, he ought to have followed the example of his former colleagues who had declared that they would not accept any post-retirement work from the government. And one cannot forget that his tenure was clouded by an employee’s complaint of sexual harassment, which acquired greater credibility after she was reinstated following his exoneration by a committee of judges. As for the government, making such an offer to a just-retired CJI is not mere brazenness. It indicates an alarming intention to undermine judicial authority so that the elected executive is seen as all-powerful.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/competitive-impropriety-the-hindu-editorial-on-ranjan-gogois-rajya-sabha-nomination/article31101933.ece
396,2020/03/19,Paying guests find ‘work from home’ a struggle,"Lack of computers, poor Internet, overcrowded rooms, and frequent power cuts affect their productivity level

Young working professionals living in paying guest accommodations are finding it difficult to sustain the usual level of productivity after an increasing number of companies have asked them to work from home. Most employees have instructed them not to leave the city.

Their problems range from lack of computers and high speed Internet to the fact that not all of them enjoy the luxury of having an entire room to themselves, which defeats the purpose of self-isolation. Others are reportedly facing pressure from paying guest accommodation owners to vacate over fears that the COVID-19 virus would spread.

A video of a paying guest being taken in an ambulance started doing rounds on social media on Thursday, sparking fears that the person was being tested for COVID19. This created panic. “As most of them are working professionals and have travelled or been in contact with people from other countries, we are worried,” a PG owner in Nagavarapalya said.

PG owners and residents admit that overcrowding is becoming a problem. Many residents pointed out that self-isolation is not possible in a PG, as rooms are shared by three to four people, if not more.

On Thursday, BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar tweeted that PGs should ensure that living space for two people, excluding the kitchen, toilet/bathroom, must be 110 sq ft. However, most PGs do not follow this rule.

There have been reports of PG owners insisting that residents vacate their premises claiming that it had been ordered by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). In response, the civic body issued a stern warning asking owners not to do so. “Our advisory is for maintaining sanitation, cleanliness and prevention of overcrowding in a limited space. We have not asked IT professionals or any working persons to vacate hostels or PGs,” said Ravi Kumar Surpur, Special Commissioner (Projects and Health).

Productivity drops

Both residents and owners of PGs admit that access to high-speed Internet is a problem. “As so many of us are now working out of the same accommodation and using the Internet, the speed has dropped. It is affecting my work,” said Nagesh N., an engineer who lives in a PG near Tin Factory. Many have also asked their employees to buy dongles.

Another drawback is power cut. Residents in some neighbourhoods like K.R. Puram and Mahadevapura say they cannot work when power supply is constantly interrupted. A mechanical engineer working in an MNC said that he cannot use his office or personal laptop as they are not compatible with the systems at work. “My company has decided to install an office desktop at people’s homes, but that is not possible in the PG,” the engineer said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/gipqly/article31111828.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/paying-guests-find-work-from-home-a-struggle/article31111829.ece

398,2020/03/19,Bengaluru club owner booked for branding staff with camphor,"The incident took place within the club premises on Balepete road in Bengaluru.

The City Market police are on the hunt for the owner of a recreation club who allegedly branded three employees with burning camphor to punish them for a mistake they had made. The incident took place within the club premises on Balepete road last Tuesday.

Based on the complaint filed by one of the victims, Divakar, 20, who hails from Chitradurga, the police registered an FIR against the owner, Sharath R., on Sunday.

In his complaint, Divakar said he along with his colleagues Sharath and Gopal had been working in the club for the last seven months. “Last Tuesday, the owner discovered that the pipe attached to the washbasin in the washroom had been burnt and questioned Divakar, who replied he knew nothing of the incident,” said a police officer.

Sharath, who was furious, summoned all three of them to his office and allegedly beat them up badly under the pretext of questioning them. According to Divakar, they pleaded that they knew nothing about the incident following which, Sharath R. took out pieces of camphor. “He placed them on the palm of their hands and lit them, stating that the camphor had special powers to extract the truth,” the officer added. He told them that camphor would not burn the palms of those who were truthful and threatened them to stand still.

The trio sustained burns and started crying out in pain following which Sharath accused them of burning the pipe and threw them out of the club. He allegedly refused to pay their salary.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/f0ivp1/article31105218.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bengalurujpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bengaluru-club-owner-booked-for-branding-staff-with-camphor/article31105196.ece

Pathirivedu Police in Thiruvallur district on Thursday arrested a 27-year-old man on charges of murder after it was found that he conducted a botched-up surgery to remove the foetus from the womb of his 19-year-old girlfriend.

Police said the suspect is S. Soundar, 27, a native of Kammarpalayam near Gummidipoodi who was employed as an LPG cylinder delivery boy in the area. He and the young woman had reportedly been in love with each other for two years. The young woman was a second-year B. Com student in a college. The woman became pregnant but the couple could not get married as Soundar’s family was opposed to the match.

Police said the duo decided to remove the foetus since they believed it would be a hurdle to their marriage. The woman was seven months pregnant After watching a few YouTube videos on childbirth and delivery procedures, Soundar decided to conduct the surgery on his girlfriend and remove the foetus. She agreed to this, police added.

On Wednesday afternoon, Soundar took her in his bike to a cashew farm where he performed the surgery on her, guided by YouTube videos. In the botched up attempt, he broke the arm of the foetus, and the mother started bleeding, badly. He took her in his motorbike to the Government General Hospital, Ponneri, which is 25 km away from the village. She was then rushed in an ambulance to Government Raja Sir Ramaswamy Mudaliar Lying-in Hospital, Royapuram where she delivered a still-born child.

The youth who accompanied her was handed over to the police station inside the hospital premises. The young woman is said to be critically ill. A case has been registered and the parents of the two were also interrogated.

401,2020/03/19,"Builder, contractor jointly liable for projects, says TN Real Estate Appellate Tribunal","The Tribunal was hearing a case with regard to 40 allottees against Lakshmi Builders for non-delivery of flats in Kundrathur

The Tamil Nadu Real Estate Appellate Tribunal has ruled that the person who constructs any building or apartments for sale and the person who sells apartments, even though different persons, shall be considered promoters and shall be jointly liable under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA).

A person who acts as a builder or claims to act as a holder of Power of Attorney, from the owners of the land, on which the buildings or apartments is constructed for sale is also a promoter under the RERA Act, it added.

In 2019, 40 allottees had moved the Tamil Nadu Real Estate Regulatory Authority against Lakshmi Builders for non-delivery of flats in Kundrathur. The construction agreements were executed with most of the allottees in July 2012 and the scheduled completion date was 18 months. However, the project was not completed and must be registered under RERA, the complaint added.

S. Jayalakshmi is a proprietor of Lakshmi Builders and all approvals had been obtained in the name of her husband, V.T. Selvam, who administers the affairs of the firm. He had acted as power of attorney for the owner of the land for the project.

Tamil Nadu Real Estate Regulatory Authority had directed the developer to register the project, against which it moved the Appellate Tribunal. The developer said it is only a contractor to construct the flats.

S. Jayalakshmi even though designated as a builder, is doing construction work through her power agent/contractor construction of sale.

404,2020/03/19,Coronavirus | Railways to de-train passengers with ‘Home Quarantined’ stamping,"Further decline likely in number of international flights

In a bid to curb the scare and spread of COVID-19, railway authorities have decided not to allow passengers with ‘Home Quarantined’ stamping on hand to travel in trains.

A decision to this effect was taken after passengers in the Mumbai-Delhi Garibrath Express objected to a few others having the stamping made on their arrival from Germany at the Mumbai International Airport on Wednesday.

“After the incident in Western Railway, the instructions are that passengers with ‘Home Quarantined’ stamping on hand should not be allowed to travel with other passengers. TTEs have been authorised to de-board them,” a senior official in the Southern Railway told The Hindu.

As part of precautionary measures, the Ministry of Railways issued detailed instructions to the acting staff at major railway stations and onboard long distance train on the necessity for upkeep of personal hygiene. Catering staff with fever, cough or cold irrespective of the reasons would not be allowed to work, official sources said.

Sources at the Chennai airport said ‘Home Quarantined’ was being done in Mumbai by health officials as of now depending on the travel history and health parameters. There was a steady fall in the number of passengers arriving here. The deadline for Indian nationals to board flights from the United Kingdom, European Union, Turkey and European Free Trade Association (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland) ended at 5.30 p.m Indian time.

“India nationals cannot board flights home from these countries till March 31. They will be prevented from entering India from any of the Land/Air/Sea Ports. This is a temporary measure in addition to the already existing visa restrictions and shall be in force till the end of this month.

406,2020/03/19,Coronavirus | Life in the slow lane for cab drivers in Chennai,"From 15-20 trips a day, they are now engaged for only 2 or 3 rides a day

COVID-19 has put a sudden brake in the lives of cab drivers in the city.

With thousands of IT employees working from home, cab drivers are finding it hard to meet their daily expenses. From 15-20 trips a day, ridership has now fallen to 2-3 trips a day.

G. Pandurangan, 51, became a car driver six years ago after his business failed to take off. Every day, he would get bookings from a number of working professionals or airport passengers, but now all of that is gone.

“I would earn nearly ₹3,000 every day. Of that, I would have to give ₹1,300 as rent for the vehicle and another ₹1,000 for diesel. Now, I earn only ₹800-1,000 a day. I don’t know whether to pay the rent or fill diesel with it. I barely have anything to take home these days. If this continues for a month, I will be debt-ridden,” he said. He has two children, for whom he has to pay fees in a month.

Vasanth (name changed) from Tondiarpet, who has been with Ola for two years now, said that he picked up only three customers in the last 48 hours. “One customer cancelled the trip when she was about to board the cab, saying that I was not wearing a mask,” he lamented. “There is a scarcity of masks and sanitisers in the city. And its expensive too,” he said, adding that he was the sole breadwinner for his family of four.

Cab drivers are also worried about not getting incentives if daily targets are not met. Drivers are parking cars on roadsides and waiting for their mobiles to buzz. “I usually work in and around the airport. With air traffic crashing, I have moved my base to Guindy near the Olympia Tech Park. But I have got no bookings so far,” said Riyas, who has been in the industry for a year.

Like Mr. Riyas, several drivers who have purchased cars through loans are worried about paying their monthly loan instalments if they don’t get any commuters.

Financial aid

When contacted, Ola and Uber did not comment on the monetary part, but said that they were taking measures for workers’ safety.

The spokesperson for Uber said that any driver or delivery person who was diagnosed with COVID-19 or was asked to self isolate by a public health authority would receive financial assistance for up to 14 days, while their account was on hold.

408,2020/03/19,CJ points to violation of medical norms,"Chief Justice of Madras High Court Amreshwar Pratap Sahi on Wednesday impressed upon the need to ensure that a distance of at least one metre is maintained between two persons, as per medical advice, inside court halls, to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Pointing at the lawyers who had gathered inside court hall number 1, the Chief Justice said: “We are in violation of medical norms.” He requested the advocates not to insist upon hearing of regular cases and said only urgent cases, requiring immediate intervention of the court, would be taken up for hearing. “We have to be a bit careful because every day, newspapers are recording an increase in COVID-19 cases and not a decrease,” he told the lawyers and expressed concern over the President of the United States, Donald Trump, having made a statement that the COVID-19 crisis could stretch till August. He advised lawyers against undertaking travel.

When a mention was made about hearing of cases filed by 21 DMK legislators who were subjected to privilege proceedings for displaying the banned gutkha packets in the Assembly in 2017, the Bench, comprising the Chief Justice and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, directed the Registry to list it on April 27, tentatively.

When advocate R. Neelakandan stated that a senior counsel from Delhi had to come down to argue the cases, Chief Justice Sahi said: “Ask them to stay in Delhi, no need to travel.” He also recalled how badly the seats in an aircraft were maintained when he had to fly to Madurai on Monday to convene a meeting regarding measures to be taken against the spread of COVID-19.

“When I tapped the seat beside me, it was full of dust and water. I told aircraft personnel that there was a threat of COVID-19 and that they were maintaining the seats like this,” said the Chief Justice, and sought for cooperation from lawyers to deal with the situation. He, however, made it clear that the court would not avoid hearing cases of extreme importance.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/47hmr9/article31103359.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THCHIEFJUSTICEAPSAHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/cj-points-to-violation-of-medical-norms/article31103360.ece
409,2020/03/19,South Chennai to get water from alternative sources,"Supply will be drawn from Chembarambakkam

Chennai Metrowater is drawing additional water from Chembarambakkam reservoir to maintain piped water supply in south Chennai to offset the gap in distribution following the shutdown of the desalination plant in Nemmeli.

The water agency stopped supply from the desalination plant since Tuesday.

The plant has a capacity to supply 100 million litres a day to various parts of south Chennai. It has, however, resumed piped water supply with alternative sources from waterbodies in Chembarambakkam and Veeranam.

Metrowater officials said an additional quantity of 100 million litres (mld) is being drawn daily from Chembarambakkam reservoir to bridge the gap in supply. The reservoir currently has 1,990 million cubic feet of water against its capacity of 3,231 mcft. As Chennai is continuing to receive nearly 706 cusecs (cubic feet per second) of Krishna water from Andhra Pradesh, there would be adequate water in the reservoirs this summer, officials said.

Additional water drawn from the Chembarambakkam reservoir is being fed into the distribution network to provide water to south Chennai areas such as Thiruvanmiyur, Adyar, Velachery and Mylapore.

Diverted to south Chennai

Similarly, about 30 mld of the 180 mld of water brought through a giant pipeline from Veeranam tank in Cuddalore district is being diverted near Kelambakkam to south Chennai areas such as Sholinganallur, Perungudi and Injambakkam, officials added. This would be continued till completion of work in Nemmeli plant.

For assistance on water supply, residents may contact Area Engineer- Area IX (8144930909); Area Engineer- Area XIII – (8144930913); Area Engineer- Area XIV (8144930914) and Area Engineer- Area XV (8144930915).",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/south-chennai-to-get-water-from-alternative-sources/article31103357.ece
410,2020/03/19,Police gear up to fight virus,"Personnel undergo training to make hand sanitisers

To help provide hand sanitisers to police stations across the city, police personnel on Wednesday underwent training on how to make the disinfectant at the College of Pharmacy on the Madras Medical College premises.

According to police sources, ten personnel, including those from the Armed Reserve battalion, underwent training.

“Those who attended the workshop have done a certificate course related to pharmacy or chemical engineering. They were chosen as they could absorb the lessons better,” said a senior police officer.

The personnel were taught about the kind of infrastructure and precautions that have to be taken to make the sanitisers in large quantities. “We were also informed about places to purchase the raw materials from. We are now planning to make them on the premises of the police hospital, and it will be distributed to all stations in the city,” the police officer added.

He said that at a time when a bottle of hand sanitiser was being sold at double the price, they could make the sanitisers at very low prices.

“We have instructed police stations to clean the premises regularly and use disinfectants. Those who come to lodge complaints should also apply sanitisers kept at the station. All personnel have been asked to use masks as well, in case they show any symptoms,” said a police officer.

B. Shamoondeswari, Superintendent of Police, Kancheepuram district, said that personnel in the district too have been taught how to make sanitisers and they would distribute it to all stations. “We have also got some supply from the Health Department. Besides, we are providing training to all our personnel and their families on social distancing and precautions that needs to be taken,” she added.

P. Aravindan, Superintendent of Police, Tiruvallur, said similar measures were taken in his jurisdiction.

Police constables also want courts to postpone court hearings and conduct important ones through video-conferencing. “We escort 50-60 prisoners at a time. This puts us at great risk, and if a prisoner contracts the virus, he will spread it to other prisoners and police personnel,” said a constable.

Many wanted the police to temporarily suspend parades and well-being classes. “A large number of people come together for the sessions,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/police-gear-up-to-fight-virus/article31103351.ece
411,2020/03/19,Coronavirus | Film industry comes to a standstill,"Shoots suspended; stakeholders doubtful of audience returning to theatres soon

The closure of theatres and malls in the State as part of measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 has affected the film industry, which is now hoping that its most lucrative summer months, April and May, are not wasted.

While the Film Employees’ Federation of South India, an umbrella union of all 24 film crafts, has decided to suspend film shoots, members of the film industry are taking ‘social distancing’ seriously and refusing to hold meetings too, preferring to start working when the situation is back to normal.

With film shoots and other work coming to a standstill, several stakeholders are raising doubts as to whether the audience, who are now being asked to avoid large gatherings and public places, will be returning to theatres any time soon.

Will normalcy return?

Tiruppur Subramaniam, noted film distributor, financier and exhibitor, said he was confident that normalcy would return soon.

“I don’t think people are going to stay away from attending weddings, gyms swimming pools and watching films in theatres forever. Once the State government removes its restrictions, I am sure it will be business as usual for us in the movie business,” Mr. Subramaniam said.

There are also concerns over whether big-budget movies, slated for release this summer, will be ready on time, if and when the State government removes the restrictions.

Before Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami announced the closure of malls and movie theatres, three Tamil films — actor Harish Kalyan’s Dhaarala Prabhu, Vikram Prabhu’s Asura Guru and Sibiraj’s Walter — were running in theatres.

‘A fair run’

Raju Mahalingam, whose Kites Studios distributed Dhaarala Prabhu, a remake of the Bollywood superhit film Vicky Donor, in Coimbatore area, said that he was planning to reach out to the distributors’ union and the producers’ council, to give the film a fair run at the box office, once the theatres reopen.

“Dhaarala Prabhu got good reviews and it was doing well for two days. Friday’s collections doubled on Saturday and it dropped from Sunday evening…I expect the film to be given at least two weeks’ run, starting from April 1, until the release of a big movie,” added Mr. Mahalingam.

The film’s lead, Harish Kalyan, also released a statement on social media, thanking people for positive reviews and requesting the same support when the theatres reopen.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/98478g/article31103346.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THCORONA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/film-industry-comes-to-a-standstill/article31103347.ece

Rajesh who claimed that he could not get hand sanitisers and masks either a pharmacy near his residence in Adyar nor at the one near the High Court campus. He also claimed no helpline had been created to lodge a complaint in that regard.

According to the petitioner, the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution had issued a notification on March 13 declaring surgical masks and hand sanitizers as essential commodities. The notification stated that those goods should not be hoarded or sold beyond the maximum retail price printed on the cartons.

An advisory issued on the same day to all State governments insisted upon creating helplines for registering complaints regarding the newly added essential commodities.

413,2020/03/19,24x7 fever OP ward at RGGGH for screening,"On day one, 137 visitors turn up

People can now walk into a 24x7 fever outpatient (OP) ward at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) to get screened for symptoms of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or to get their doubts clarified.

RGGGH has put in place a fever OP, with an exclusive team of medical and paramedical personnel. Working in two shifts, there will be six medical officers from Internal Medicine, two assistant professors/postgraduates of Community Medicine, two counsellors, one microbiologist and an X-ray technician, on each shift, at the OP, according to R. Jayanthi, dean of RGGGH.

The OP is functioning at ward 210, first floor of Tower 2, she said, adding: “Persons who have doubts, have a travel history or symptoms of COVID-19 can come to the OP. The ward is well-ventilated and has spacious seating arrangements. Assistant professors or PGs from the Department of Community Medicine will take their epidemiological history, meaning details of travel and contact history. Next, doctors of general medicine will conduct a clinical examination on the person and check temperature, blood pressure, pulse and oxygen saturation.”

A complete blood count will be done. “If there are lung signs and cough, an X-ray will be taken. But the person should fall into the criteria for testing, as outlined by the ICMR. Samples for testing for COVID-19 will be lifted only if absolutely indicative,” she said.

On Tuesday, the OP ward saw a total of 137 persons. Of this, 62 samples were lifted for testing for COVID-19. Till 8 p.m. on Wednesday, there were 120 persons and 27 samples were taken for testing, she said.

“About 30-40% of these persons are approaching the OP out of panic and fear. This is why we have posted counsellors to talk to them,” she said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/yw6n5/article31103336.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THCORONOVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/24x7-fever-op-ward-at-rgggh-for-screening/article31103337.ece
414,2020/03/19,Coronavirus | Koyambedu market to function as usual,"CMDA scotches rumours and warns of stern action against those spreading them

The Koyambedu wholesale market will be functioning as usual in the city. The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), which manages the wholesale market, has denied rumours of the market having been closed.

In a press statement, CMDA Member-Secretary D. Karthikeyan assured the public that the Koyambedu market would be functioning regularly. Requesting the public and traders not to believe rumours that the market has been closed in view of the COVID 19 threat, Mr. Karthikeyan warned that stern action would be taken against those spreading such false news among the public.

Meanwhile, the Koyambedu wholesale market saw a dip in sales by nearly 30% since Tuesday following rumours that the market would be closed.

However, officials of the Koyambedu Market Management Committee (MMC) and Greater Chennai Corporation clarified that the market would continue to function normally.

Officials of Koyambedu MMC said vehicles entering the market, particularly from the other States, were disinfected. Visitors and labourers were distributed with masks and soaps.

Following traders’ demand, the MMC is considering setting up screening facilities near the entry points of the market. On an average, the market receives nearly one lakh visitors to the three sections — flowers, fruits and vegetable markets — daily.

But, this dropped to about 60,000 visitors on Wednesday. While this could be partly because of good yields in other States, rumours that the market was shut down also led to decrease in footfall, said P. Sukumar of Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchant Association.

Even those who visited the market bought more than usual quantity to stock up supplies. Small traders from neighbouring places such as Arakkonam, Chengalpattu and Arani have also stopped visiting the market as they source vegetables from the nearby farmers due to good yields, he said.

Though prices of many vegetables such as tomatoes and cabbage remained low within ₹15-₹20 per kg in the wholesale market, there was a drop in sales. However, traders note that the prices may begin to escalate after two weeks.

Similarly, sales in the fruits market too saw a drop by 20%-30% due to rumours on social media. S. Srinivasan, president, Chennai Fruits Commission Agents Association, said prices of fruits such as sapota and watermelons have dropped to ₹25 and ₹15 a kg respectively due to increase in arrivals and less takers. The cost of many fruits has dropped by 20%. “We conducted an awareness programme on COVID-19 for labourers and distributed pamphlets and soaps. We have requested the MMC authorities to increase timing of garbage clearance and set up screening facilities,” he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mqromn/article31104999.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THKMARKET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/coronavirus-koyambedu-market-to-function-as-usual/article31103329.ece
415,2020/03/19,"Feasible to extend Marina loop road till Besant Nagar, Corporation Commissioner tells HC","The Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash on Wednesday told the Madras High Court that it is feasible to lay a road connecting the Marina beach loop road with Besant Nagar after obtaining Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ) clearance and evicting encroachments at Srinivasapuram and Urur Kuppam.

In a status report filed before Justices Vineet Kothari and R. Suresh Kumar, the Commissioner said, a study carried out, as per the earlier directions of the court, found that it was feasible to lay a road from Pattinambakkam to Besant Nagar along the alignment of a broken bridge that had got damaged a few decades ago.

The Commissioner however said, it would not be “purposeful” to construct two foot overbridges on the existing loop road as suggested by the court to ensure that crossing of fishermen does not hinder free movement of vehicular traffic. The official said, the width of the road was just 60 metres and hence the bridges may not be necessary.

Further, pointing out that only two fishermen, at a time, carry around 40 to 50kg of their catch from the sea to the other side of the loop road, Mr. Prakash said, it prima facie appeared that the bridges need not be constructed though a feasibility report on them was still awaited. He added that work on constructing a temporary fish market on the loop road was afoot.

Stating that the tenders received for construction of the market were opened on March 5, he said, the letter of acceptance to the successful tenderer would be issued on Saturday and the construction work would be completed by June this year. This arrangement would prevent the fish sellers from squatting on the loop road.

In so far as regulating the vendors on the beach was concerned, the Commissioner said, the corporation had decided to follow the court’s advice to grant 60% (540) of licences to existing vendors on the beach and the rest (360) to those who fall under the general pool. Accordingly, it had issued identity cards to those falling under the first category.

Applications had been called for from those who want to get licences under the general pool and the process was under way. After the report was filed on Wednesday, the judges decided to hear the case on Thursday to accommodate a request made on behalf of Additional Advocate General S.R. Rajagopal.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/feasible-to-extend-marina-loop-road-till-besant-nagar-corporation-commissioner-tells-hc/article31102505.ece
416,2020/03/19,"In Upper House nomination, a fall for ‘aloofness’","The nomination of a former Chief Justice of India to the Rajya Sabha is a blow against the judiciary’s independence

Within five months of his retirement as Chief Justice of India, Justice Ranjan Gogoi has been nominated to the Rajya Sabha by the government. Shortly before his retirement from the Supreme Court of India, he delivered several important verdicts with far-reaching political consequences that left the government pleased, including the Ayodhya judgment. Before that, Justice Gogoi dismissed a review of the Rafale fighter aircraft deal without substantially dealing with the grounds on which the original judgment, negating an independent investigation, had been challenged. The original judgment relied upon several pieces of false and misleading information, conveyed to the Supreme Court by the government, in an unsigned note and handed over in a sealed cover.

Key judgments handled

During his tenure, Justice Gogoi also presided over and pushed through the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam, an exercise that has excluded more than 19 lakh people from the final version of the citizenship register, and which has been widely criticised on several grounds. In short, the exercise presided over by him led to a huge humanitarian crisis, but fed into the government’s narrative and methods by which it now seeks to undertake a nation-wide NRC exercise, and further a divisive politics.

Then there was the Sabarimala temple review. A Constitution Bench judgment of the Supreme Court held that excluding menstruating women from entering the temple was discriminatory, and therefore against “constitutional morality”. A Bench headed by Justice Gogoi gratuitously referred these issues to a larger Bench, much to the delight of the government.

One could multiply the cases which Justice Gogoi decided during his tenure as the Chief Justice of India or in the run-up to it, and it would be safe to say that his judgments left the government pleased, with scarcely any politically-sensitive case being decided against the government’s wishes. His tenure, especially as the Chief Justice of India, only left many observers puzzled about him — he was a judge who had participated in a press conference held on January 2018, criticising the then Chief Justice of India (and his predecessor), Dipak Misra, and accusing him of abusing his powers as master of roster to fix politically-sensitive cases before convenient benches.

There was also the occasion when he delivered the Ramnath Goenka lecture, in 2018, just before his elevation as the Chief Justice of India, where he eloquently declared that the country needs not only noisy journalists and independent judges but even independent journalists and noisy judges. One expected thus as the Chief Justice of India, that he would be robustly independent in the interests of justice and equity and uphold the rule of law.

A turning point

So what led to the virtual collapse of his independence after becoming the Chief Justice of India? Allegations of sexual harassment against him give us a good insight into this. A female staffer who was asked by him to work at his residence, accused him in an affidavit of detail, of harassment soon after he became the Chief Justice of India. The action taken against her was astounding. Not only was she dismissed from service in an ex-parte hearing on frivolous grounds, but her brother-in-law, who was inducted to the Supreme Court staff under Justice Gogoi’s discretionary quota, was also terminated without assigning any reasons. Soon after, the Delhi Police suspended her husband and his brother — again on baseless charges. A fabricated case was registered against the staffer by a complainant who was thereafter untraceable; she was harassed by the police on the basis of this. She was then taken by the station house officer of the Tilak Marg police station to the Gogoi residence and made to apologise; she submitted herself to this only because of the terror of her harrowing experience at the hands of the Delhi police.

Immediately after her ordeal (that was detailed in the affidavit to the judges) was published by news portals, Justice Gogoi called for an extraordinary hearing, on Saturday (along with Justice Arun Mishra), where he accused the woman staffer of being a criminal. Justice Gogoi sat as a judge in his own cause in a case he titled “In Re: A Matter of Great Public Importance Touching Upon the Independence of the Judiciary”. However, the disrepute that this brought upon India’s highest judiciary and the furore caused by the hearing, forced him to appoint an in-house committee headed by the present Chief Justice of India, which quickly absolved Justice Gogoi in extraordinary ex-parte hearings. In these hearings, the woman’s request for being allowed a lawyer, cross-examination of witnesses and recording of proceedings were all refused, forcing her to walk out.

The report absolving Justice Gogoi, was put out by the Supreme Court registry as a press release, but a copy of and substance of the report has not been made available even to the complainant.

It is not possible for the Delhi police to have embarked upon acts of malafide harassment of the woman staffer and her family, without the influence of Justice Gogoi himself. In fact, one of the complaints on the basis on which her husband was suspended and disciplinary proceedings initiated against him was a complaint by Justice Gogoi’s Secretary.

I am privy to the fact that just before his retirement, Justice Gogoi used several channels to get the woman to withdraw her complaint against him. These channels included staffers of the Supreme Court registry as well as senior government officials. In the end, the staffer’s termination was withdrawn by the Supreme Court on the orders of the present Chief Justice of India with retrospective effect and with payment of full back wages, after Justice Gogoi retired. She was also given her due of maternity leave for six months. This is truly extraordinary given that Justice Gogoi had accused her of being a criminal in open court and the present Chief Justice of India who restored her job and benefits, had disbelieved her complaint in the in-house committee.

It is against this background that we need to look at Justice Gogoi’s nomination to the Upper House, on March 16.

A forgotten code

The 16-point code of conduct for judges or as it was called the “Restatement of Values of Judicial Life” (adopted at a Chief Justices Conference in May 1997) states: “6. A judge should practice a degree of aloofness consistent with the dignity of his office”; 7. A judge shall not hear and decide a matter in which a member of his family, a close relation or a friend is concerned”.

Explained | How is a Supreme Court judge to be probed?

Obviously this “aloofness” is a most essential trait needed from politicians or functionaries of the government. Unfortunately these values seem to have been forgotten by judges who invite politicians to their personal functions, eulogise them in public or call them for personal favours. One can understand that there could be some in the political class who may be long-standing personal friends of judges, but then it is incumbent on such judges not to hear and decide cases of those politicians who are their personal friends. Judges can also interact with functionaries of the government in their official capacity for official work. But we now see the repeated spectre of judges hearing and deciding cases of politicians with whom they have a personal camaraderie.

This code of conduct also lays the basis of how post-retirement conduct ought to be. For example if a judge after deciding politically sensitive cases involving particular political parties or politicians, soon after retirement seeks and gets a plum post such as a Rajya Sabha nomination by those very politicians or parties, it would obviously raise serious questions about his or her independence as a judge when he or she had decided those cases.

Justice Gogoi and the government’s actions in the sexual harassment case and the offer of a Rajya Sabha seat by the government, raise serious doubts about the fairness of many critical judgments, including the ones mentioned above that were under Justice Gogoi’s watch. The precedent that he has set strikes a blow against the independence of the judiciary. I hope that this shameful act will lead to public opprobrium which will deter other judges from emulating such conduct.

However, the government of the day, by nominating the former Chief Justice of India, Ranjan Gogoi, to the Rajya Sabha, and so soon after his retirement, has only made a mockery of this system. India boasts of having one of the strongest judicial systems in the world and where there are checks and balances to keep away any influence or pressure on the judges. Justice Gogoi’s nomination, though it does not defy the principle of separation of powers, is one that undermines the credibility of the judge. The post of Chief Justice of India is the highest judicial office one can hold in India and Justice Gogoi, as a former CJI, should have recused himself from this nomination.

There are examples of retired judges accepting jobs that are of a political and administrative nature. However in Justice Gogoi’s case, his nomination covers many issues such as those of propriety. Ethics demand that no retired judge of the highest court accepts a post that will room to criticism and controversy. In India, the pension and perks and government servant gets is normally sufficient for them to lead a life with dignity, comfort and without financial worries. Justice Gogoi should have thought about all this.

The nomination is both questionable and debatable. Judgeship is all about erudition and uprightness when in office and aloofness after retirement; it is all the more so when the person is a retired Chief Justice of India. When nomination is offered and accepted, it gets invariably tagged with the judgments he had pronounced. It is seen as a reward for favouring a political party when issues of national importance were decided by him. Justice Gogoi, in his discharge of duties as a judge, may not have favoured anyone by going out of the way but the public perception is clear that he has been duly rewarded. This casts doubts on his integrity. Moreover, participation in parliamentary proceedings involves high decibel verbal exchanges and questioning. Justice Gogoi may have to deal with noisy opponents. Two great Indian retired Supreme Court judges, Justice H.R. Khanna and Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer mindlessly contested for the post of President of India as Opposition candidates. Both polled almost identical percentage of votes (around 23%) and lost the election. Non-involvement in political activities by retired High Court and Supreme Court judges only enhances the dignity of the office they once held.

While post-retirement political appointments of judges are nothing new, the nomination of Justice Gogoi assumes greater significance for two reasons. He along with three other judges expressed concern over “perceived political encroachment” and openly too, in a press conference in 2018. Further, he has headed a Constitution Bench that has delivered a “historic judgment”. There is a creeping worry that post-retirement jobs are a result of pre-retirement judgments. Above all, public confidence in the judiciary cannot be shaken through such appointments. The issue needs to be resolved convincingly.

B. Gurumurthy,

Madurai

There is dismay and shock and the strong perception that a Chief Justice of India has fallen for a ‘gift from the government’ within months of his retirement. If judges fall prey to the temptations of power, who will save the pluralistic roots of our democracy? It is time we stand up for our values and not join the rat race bartering our honour for personal short-term gains.

R.D. Singh,

Ambala, Haryana

Although the Rajya Sabha is called the ‘House of Elders’ and has much to gain with the presence of a luminary such as a former Chief Justice of India, an appointment such as Justice Gogoi’s, is bound to cast aspersions on the appointee as well as the government, and rightly so. On the one hand lies the connotation and fear of judges being rewarded for toeing the government’s line, while on the other lies the benefit of harnessing the country’s best judicial minds in other sectors of the polity after their retirement. The Supreme Court of India should work out comprehensive guidelines that include a “cooling-off period” and independent evaluation so that retired judges can unabashedly contribute to non-judicial posts without disturbing judicial independence.

Pandemic response

With every disaster we have seen in the past such as the tsunami, earthquake and floods, we have seen humankind coming together to face the adversity. But the pandemic now has created a chasm. There seems to be mutual distrust fuelled by social and the conventional media. There should not be panic but social collaboration. Let a virus not create disharmony in the face of adversity.

418,2020/03/19,Proficiency on display,"Bharati Shivaji’s Mohiniyattam performance in Thrissur stood out for its aesthetic appeal

Two solo numbers that Bharati Shivaji staged at Kerala Kalamandalam recently exhibited the intrinsic charm of Mohiniyattam. She began the performance with ‘Ganapathy’, the first among the several compositions on the deity by Kavalam Narayana Panicker with whom she has had a long association.

The number in Arabhi and Adi opened with extended vaytharis. The hallmark of Kavalam’s composition is the abundance of vaytharis sandwiched between the charanams, which the dancer could exploit, thereby enriching the nritta elements. That they are rendered in the same raga is another feature.

Nuanced performance

Adavus, noted for their flowing style, and chuzhippus enhanced the nritta. The poetic beauty of the description of Ganapathy and his seat along with the mooshika (the mouse) were vivid, with Bharati paying attention to minute details. One could virtually feel the presence of Ganapathy on the seat as she folded her hands in obeisance, standing from a distance. She could create the ambience of waking up Ganapathy through her histrionics. Invocation to Siva and Saraswathy was also well portrayed.

The sixth Ashtapathi seemed an index of her choreographic ingenuity. The virutham, beginning with ‘Nibrutha nikunja gruham’, was followed by vaytharis. ‘Sakhi hey, Kesimadhana mudaram’ received an alluring portrayal in which Radha explained to Sakhi the romantic overtures she had with Krishna.

A break with beats of edakka for nritta appeared enticing. The dynamic movements of the head to both sides (dhuta asthira sira) added to the grace of the performance. The number gave enough scope for abhinaya as well. She presented all the eight padams, ending with ‘Sree Jayadeva bhanithamida’. While the first part was in Kamboji, the latter in Dwijavanthi was rendered in the typical Sopana style as sung in the Guruvayur temple.

Bharati’s disciple Vinaya Narayanan performed the Swathi padam in Kedaram, ‘Ramyanayoru purushan’. The dancer narrated the dream in which the heroine had an unknown visitor. In her attempt to identify him, she is finally convinced that it was none other than Padmanabha. She effectively portrayed the different characters that she had mistaken for Padmanabha.

Manjula Murthy, also a disciple of Bharati, joined Vinaya in presenting ‘Thourathrika’, a combination of geetha, vadya and nritta, which was choreographed as a string of indigenous rhythms (sopana) coined by the late percussion maestro Pallavur Appu Marar. Composed in Bilahari and Bhoopalam, the dancers demonstrated the beauty of the myriad adavus, jointly and separately, peculiar to the Bharati school. An abrupt stop of the beats of edakka in between heightened the grace of the number.

The performance was organised by Kalamandalam in connection with the release of Bharati’s latest book, Mohiniyattam: Its Aesthetics and Art.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/6ndb8e/article31107226.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20tvfdance2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/bharati-shivajis-mohiniyattam-recital-at-kalamandalam/article31107227.ece
419,2020/03/19,Cancer awareness umbrellas from Sri Ramakrishna Institute of Oncology and Research,"Sri Ramakrishna Institute of Oncology and Research introduces a novel cancer awareness campaign to reach out to the public

An umbrella that bears QR codes on cancer awareness is the latest initiative from Dr. P Guhan, director of Sri Ramakrishna Institute of Oncology and Research. “Umbrellas need not necessarily protect you from rain or shine, it can also save your life by making you aware of cancer,” he says. The awareness campaign gave away over 100 free umbrellas to NGOs and students.“We have done several online campaigns using apps, e-books, animated videos, and websites. Now, we have something unique that is offline. But, this will eventually direct people to the online space where we have consolidated information on all types of cancers.”

Each panel of the umbrella has images of colour ribbons accompanied by a QR code. For example, the code next to the pink ribbon image leads to information on breast cancer, its symptoms, and diagnosis. It also informs about the relevant apps, online videos and other resources. There are specific codes for cancer of the lungs, head and neck, prostrate glands, and so on. Anyone with an android phone has to simply scan with a QR code scanner to access the data. “NGOs can display the umbrella at their meetings to get the attention of the public that in turn can scan and learn all about cancer. It serves our purpose of reaching out in a big way.”

Dr. Guhan admits that there is still great fear associated with cancer. “People are hesitant to approach medical help. We have to constantly remind them that cancer is curable if detected early. More than 50 per cent of cancer cases in India are detected in advanced stage III or stage IV levels. In western countries more than 80 per cent are detected in the early stages. Unfortunately, there is still not much change in this percentage.”

People still seek medical help when the disease has already advanced, he says. “There is so much misinformation related to the side affects of chemotherapy. Many think that radiation leads to mouth ulcers, and that it affects skin colour. They try alternative therapies to avoid any side effects. When they finally come to us when everything fails, it is often at an incurable stage. Early diagnosis ensures cure is the message that needs to reach out.”

The videos and websites also highlight stories of cancer survivors. “Most men and women postpone diagnosis citing other commitments. A missed or neglected diagnosis can have serious consequences. When they come for treatment at an advanced stage, sometimes it is too late. Cancer cure becomes a reality only when detected early,” he reiterates.

For women, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed. Recently, they launched specially designed mobile phone covers with a pink logo accompanied by a QR code. On scanning, it redirects users to cancer survivor stories, apps, ebooks and films on breast cancer “There is a two per cent increase, especially among the younger women group of 30 to 40 years. Women above 40 should go for an annual pap smear and mammogram to rule out cervical cancer and breast cancer respectively. A routine annual screening helps in early detection and the treatment may not require radiation or chemotherapy. But in most cases, this is not happening,” says Dr. Guhan.

Watch out For unusual lumps anywhere in the body

Unexplained fever for more than two weeks

Hoarseness in voice that refuses to settle down

Unexplained weight loss

Sudden increase in size of a mole or lump

Unusual bleeding or discharge

Difficulty in swallowing

Changes in bowel and bladder habits

Sometimes the symptoms may not be cancerous but one has to rule that out by taking medical help

To know more, call: 0422-4389797 or 94428-44775 (open on all days (except Sundays) between 9.00 am to 6.00 pm)

Even the educated have an emotional and psychological fear of cancer. “They have to overcome this. It’s a social responsibility to spread awareness. We are seeing an increase in the number of breast cancer cases, lung, head and neck cancers too. A cancer diagnosis doesn’t mean the end of life. We have so many success stories of cancer survivors who are sports persons, doctors, engineers and others like us leading a normal life.” To follow a healthy lifestyle, one should avoid alcohol and tobacco. And, consume freshly cooked food and avoid foods with preservatives. A moderate exercise regimen and annual cancer screening is important.

The need to spread awareness about cancer is especially urgent at the school and college level, says the doctor. “Teens have easy access to alcohol and tobacco. Once they develop a liking at an early stage in life, it usually leads to addiction. They become long-term tobacco users. They must know how it affects their health. All the information they need is uploaded. We have animated videos and feel good stories of breast cancer survivors that can be a motivating factor for someone diagnosed with breast cancer.”",fitness,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/v2c3kx/article31107459.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CANCERAWARENESSUMBRELLA,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/cancer-awareness-umbrellas-from-sri-ramakrishna-institute-of-oncology-and-research/article31107465.ece
420,2020/03/19,Amar Jyoti has stuck to its USP of Punjabi home-style food since 1955,"At this Delhi restaurant, everything is refreshingly old-fashioned including business ethics and ambience

A friend once told me about a humble Punjabi eatery in Delhi’s Sarojini Nagar, where she has been eating since her childhood days. I decided to visit it, thankfully in the days before social distancing. Called Amar Jyoti, it is located close to Gate No: 3 of Sarojini Nagar market. Since GPS can play tricks sometimes, I walked through the crowded market to get there. It is a small space that accommodates 43 people, and their kitchen is right behind the dining area.

As I settled down, I noticed a family of four, who at a table loaded with dishes, were talking about how they had been craving the mutton masala, seekh kebab and dal tadka. So naturally, I ordered the same with tandoori rotis. I spotted gurde kapoore at yet another table, and ordered that as well. Everything is rustic, and yet refined in terms of flavours.

It is this rustic nature, and the presence of such old-fashioned dishes like gurde kapoore and magaz masala along with the roadside dhaba-style dal tadka, that defines this place. Amar Jyoti is in its third generation; more than six decades old. Their Punjabi menu has not changed since the beginning. They did expand twice, and the menu was tweaked a couple of years ago to include a few Indo-Chinese dishes to cater to the present-day Sarojini Nagar shoppers, but their USP has always been Punjabi home-style food. In fact, some of the offal-based dishes on the menu have become so rare to find in other places, that it’s worth doing the trek to the market just for these: there are juicy kebabs, mutton masala, butter chicken, and tandoori fish tikka to choose from.

I meet Tanmeet Singh Arora, the third generation proprietor of the restaurant. According to him, the restaurant was started by his grandfather, the late Sardar Mohinder Singh and his grandmother Sardarni Swarn Kaur. The couple set up a brazier and tawa counter in 1955, and the restaurant was established on the same spot a decade later.

Swarn Kaur is over 90 now; back then, she was the one who cooked, while her husband served the guests and handled the cash counter. Her husband worked at a big hotel in Pakistan before Partition and they got into the food business once they came to Delhi. They soon earned enough money to own the whole space and open a restaurant with 30 seats. Government employees living in colonies around the market were their regular customers, and would pay for meals on a monthly basis. This arrangement went on till the mid-1980s. Tanmeet’s father, Sardar Surjit Singh Arora, tells me that Amar Jyoti is the only restaurant that has been there from the early days of the market.

The restaurant has maintained consistency in quality and affordability, and in the mid-1990s, added 13 more seats and a more efficient kitchen. More staff members were also added and most of them have worked here for a long time.

The matriarch

In fact, all their recipes have been perfected by Swarn Kaur, who used to cook and supervise actively until three decades ago. She has trained the cooks herself. Sardar Surjit Singh says Swarn Kaur was a purist in terms of recipes and cooking methods. The family still procures the spices, lentils and grains from the same vendor, as they have grown to trust him over the years. This old-fashioned business ethic is evident in the way the food tastes and how it is served at Amar Jyoti. The rotis and parathas are still made with stone-milled whole wheat flour, the spice blends are freshly made at home in bulk and then brought to the kitchen.

Now, the next time you go to Delhi and want a real good Punjabi meal of dal tadka, tandoori rotis and botis, do step into Amar Jyoti, and be sure to be transported to a different era.

421,2020/03/19,From bean to cube: S Arulkumar of Dhaanya Tofu talks about the making of ‘soya paneer’,"Tofu is not as well known as paneer, says S Arulkumar, who manufactures the Dhaanya brand and is also trying to create awareness about its health benefits

“I have seen people in stores pick up the packet and then put it back, not knowing what it was. I strike up a conversation and explain what tofu is and how it can be used.” S Arulkumar is the Director of Creasion Products Pvt Ltd, which manufactures the Dhaanya brand of tofu. Awareness of tofu, Arul says, is not as widespread as one would think. “Among a certain class, yes,” he acknowledges, “but they are too few in number.” This is one of the reasons that Arul has given his number as the customer care contact. Laughingly he explains how he has received complaints that the product “smells too strong”, “does not taste like paneer” and “falls apart easily”.

Arul’s entry into tofu making was pure happenstance. He was a partner in a software company in Chennai, “but was very interested in food, especially in food processing. So I sold my shares and came back to Coimbatore, my home town.” He wanted to produce only what was healthy; “too many doctors in my family to think of doing otherwise,” he smiles. The suggestion to manufacture tofu came from his brother-in-law in the US. “We started in a small way in 2014 and even had our own distribution set up,” he recalls. “From 2016, we began some aggressive marketing and reached out to more cities and stores.”

Arul sources the soyabeans from Indore, Madhya Pradesh. “Maharasthra, Madhya Pradesh and parts of Rajasthan grow large volumes of soyabeans and the Indore market is huge,” he explains, adding that though there are small pockets in Tamil Nadu, the volume and quality are not enough to extract the milk. “Our consideration is the quantity and thickness of milk we get from the beans.”

The ratio of milk to tofu, according to Arul, is 6:1; i.e. it takes six litres to produce one kilogram. While the production process is similar to making paneer, the main difference here is that soya milk needs to be first extracted. “It’s a continuous process,” says Arul. “Extract the fresh milk — this is mechanised — and immediately convert to tofu.” Soya milk, he explains, has a higher rate of oxidisation than dairy milk. “So it goes bad quickly. That’s why we cannot afford to wait too long.”

While Dhaanya Tofu has a one-month shelf life, Arul says that their experiments show that it actually lasts much longer. “But the taste and flavour changes as it ages and we have enough trouble convincing customers to accept this as it is,” he says wryly.

Where it’s available We have a decent market in Chennai, says Arul, reeling off the other cities where the brand is available: Coimbatore. Tiruppur, Puduchery. In Madurai, Tirunelveli, Theni, Karaikudi, Pollachi, and Kodaikanal, it can be found in a few stores. Outside Tamil Nadu, we supply only to Bangalore and Mysore.

For now, Arul is sticking with firm tofu. “There’s no demand for silken tofu,” he says. “Even in Chennai, it’s quite low.” Compared to paneer, the market share for tofu is only 2-4% and it is sold only in modern retail stores, not in the smaller ones. “Even though we label it as ‘soya paneer’, people still wonder what it is. I have known cases where people have opened the packet and thrown it away because they thought it had gone bad… the smell, you see.” When he gets such complaints, Arul tries to visit the customer, replace the packet and give them tips on what they can do with it.

With more people identifying as lactose intolerant and an increasing interest in veganism, there is a slow growth of awareness. It’s still too slow for Arul, who explains that he hasn’t “even achieved 50% of our existing capacity. We are operating only at 25-30% and there are days when we don’t even manufacture. Since the stock has to be fresh, we operate the plant, manufacture and sell on the same day. We don’t store any.” He’s planning to host an awareness campaign on health benefits and get chefs to create new recipes, and work on road shows, samplings and cooking contest. As a first step to all this, he’s also begun to build a website and is also planning to get onto social media. “Even though we are almost six years old, we are still a start-up,” smiles Arul. He’s also planning to introduce other soy products, “at least soy milk. Other products are still in the R&D stage.”",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/g6jllp/article31108256.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Tofu,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/s-arulkumar-of-dhaanya-tofu-talks-about-the-making-of-soya-paneer/article31108257.ece
422,2020/03/19,"Mandi@36, Hyderabad: big portions, and for the meat-lovers","The highlights in this Hyderabad restaurant are the mandis and the kebabs

With all the talk about social distancing, I stepped into Mandi@36 in Jubilee Hills, expecting it to be less crowded. The scene there took me by surprise. At 1 pm, the restaurant was full and there were many in the waiting hall as well. After much debate as to what would be a good option to eat out of the mandi thaal we decided to go for the floor seating.

As we seated and paid attention to the menu, it seemed to us that the place sells everything from shawarma to soups and kebabs, apart from mandi. The portion sizes, we were told, were big. So instead of ordering some meaty kebabs or grilled meats, we decided to try a mutton shorba. As we sat and watched orders fly out from the kitchen, it became evident that the grilled chicken, roast lamb and a boti kebabs were the most ordered dishes. So obviously we had to wait a bit for our lamb soup to arrive.

Mandi@36

Address: Sami Complex, Road Number 36, above Cream Stone, Jubilee Hills



Hits: Mandi

Miss: The untidy space



Table for two: ₹1000

And when it came, it was a runny, yellow soup with generous dressing of finely chopped coriander. We dive without soup spoons and as the soup hits the palate there was no guesses about the ingredients. There was a good amount of minced lamb meat, the soup had saffron flavoured milk. I cannot judge this soup as there might be some dish somewhere in the world that makes use of saffron milk. It wasn’t bad but I’d say if you are not a soup fan then you can skip this one without a second thought. Instead, look at ordering one of the many meat starters.

Specials all round

Post the soup session we decided to try Mandi@36’s weekend special Mandi — mutton madfoon mandi. It’s a baked lamb mandi. As we waited for our thaal to come, we looked at mandi thaals that were getting polished off within no time and made wild guesses as to how our mandi might taste. We were sure our lamb will not come with any colour but not sure what the flavour of the rice would be.

The meat came wrapped in a silver foil on a plate of rice which was aromatic from the rich garnish of golden fried onions and well tossed nuts. The garnish is so well adjusted that every morsel had some nuts and fried onions in it.

Coming to the lamb; it was moist, cooked to fall off the bone at the slightest touch. It was made to cook in its own juices and fat, making the meat most tender and flavourful. The dips that come with it add to the taste. I loved the tomato-onion hotchpotch dip, whereas the others loved the garlic mayo.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/ypdn2m/article31108193.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Mandi-2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/the-mandis-and-kebabs-are-the-highlight-at-mandi36-hyderabad/article31108194.ece
423,2020/03/19,Coronavirus | Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation orders shops to down shutters on alternate days,"Only grocers, chemists will keep stores open

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has ordered the closure of all shops except groceries and medicine shops on alternate days of the week to reduce crowding.

The order comes in the wake of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday declaring a staggered closure of shops among a number of measures after a rise in COVID-19 cases in the State.

On Thursday, assistant commissioners notified important roads in their areas where all shops, except grocery shops, pharmacies and those selling other essentials, will remain shut. These include JSS Road, Walkeshwar Road, Bhulabhai Desai Road, Dr. B Ambedkar Road, Sion Station Road, Bhandarkar Road, Veer Nariman Road, areas around Crawford Market, G.D. Somani Marg, D.N. Road, Dr. Annie Besant Marg, E. Moses Road, Tilak Road, M.G. Road, Vidyavihar Station Road and Gaondevi Road.

The Dadar Vyapari Sangh, which represents 900 shops including 600 in Dadar, declared that its shops will be shut till Tuesday, after which it will review the move. The Dadar Imitation and Cutlery Welfare Association has supported the closure of shops, while the Akhil Ghatkopar Vyapari Mandal has asked all its members to shut their shops till Sunday, following which they will be open on alternate days.

With every ward notifying such roads, Mumbaikars expressed anxiety about not being able to buy goods.

Smita Jekate, a Matunga resident working from home, said, “We are a little worried that everything is going to be shut on certain days of the week. Right now, we have enough stock of household items, but it is only when we will start running out of things that we will face an issue. Hopefully, nobody will feel the pinch.”

Shop owners agree that this is a necessary measure, but fear that they are staring at heavy losses.

“Business had anyway been slow for several months due to the economic slowdown. And now, we will only be able to operate a few days a week,” said Dhanesh Valechha, who runs a stationery shop in Malad. “People are so scared they are not even stepping out. Schools and colleges are shut. This is going to hit us heavily,” he said.

KDMC orders closure too

The Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation, too, on Thursday ordered all commercial establishments barring essential services to stay shut from 11 a.m. on Friday till March 31. “Establishments selling essential goods, like bakeries, dairies and pharmacies, are exempt from the order.

424,2020/03/19,Coronavirus: Mumbai’s dabbawalas to suspend services till month-end,"Two associations said that the decision was taken in keeping with the Maharashtra government's instructions to suspend services across sectors

Hundreds of dabbawalas delivering lunches to Mumbaikars will suspend their services from Friday till the end of the month owing to the novel coronavirus pandemic. The dabbawalas will also be foregoing their annual five-day leave to compensate for the suspension of services.

In a joint statement released on Thursday, Ulhas Muke and Ramdas Karwande, who head the two major dabbawala associations, said the decision was in keeping with the State government’s instructions to suspend services across sectors. Between them, the two associations — Nutan Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers Charity Trust and Mumbai Food Tiffin Supply Service — deliver lunchboxes to close to two lakh Mumbaikars on a daily basis.

“Tiffin services will be unavailable from March 20 to March 31, and will resume as per usual routine from April 1. We appeal to everyone to avoid stepping out and to not believe in rumours,” the statement said.

Mr. Muke, president of the Nutan Charity Trust, said, “Individual efforts go a long way in contributing to collective public welfare and we are only doing what we can. Based on the situation by the end of March, we will decide whether or not to resume on April 1.”

He said, “We take a five to six day holiday every April to visit our homeowns. To make up for the suspension of service, we have decided to not take that leave. None of us will visit our hometowns this year.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/g4ks5h/article31106795.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/dabbawala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/coronavirus-mumbais-dabbawalas-to-suspend-services-till-month-end/article31106797.ece

The Bombay High Court has come to the aid of a 19-year-old woman stranded in Dubai in view of the Centre’s coronavirus travel advisory by directing the Indian Bureau of Immigration to grant her a visa to travel to Mumbai.

The woman has been stuck in Dubai since she was prevented from boarding her connecting flight to Mumbai from the U.S. due to the advisory.

A Division Bench of Justices S.J. Kathawala and R.I. Chagla was on Tuesday heard a petition filed by the woman’s mother seeking a direction to the authorities concerned to grant her daughter a visa to travel to Mumbai.

While the petitioner is an Indian citizen, her daughter was born in the U.S. and hence is an American citizen.

While directing the authorities to grant the woman the visa, the Bench referred to her young age and the fact that she was stranded in Dubai without any family member accompanying her.

The petitioner claimed that her daughter had boarded a flight from Boston in the U.S. on March 12. However, she was refused permission by the airline authorities in Dubai to board her connecting flight to Mumbai on the ground that it was past midnight of March 13, and that the consolidated travel advisory issued by the Indian government keeping all visas in abeyance till April 15 had come into effect.

The Bench on Tuesday took up the petition for urgent hearing and in its order noted that as per the travel advisory issued by the government what needs to be seen was the time of departure from the original port and not the time of arrival.

“The petitioner’s daughter could not have been denied boarding her onward flight to Mumbai on the strength of these circulars, nor can the respondents deny her a visa and leave her stranded at Dubai away from her family and permanent place of residence in India,” the court said in its order.

The Bench noted that the petitioner’s daughter was wrongly detained and refused permission to board her flight from Dubai to Mumbai. “She (the petitioner’s daughter) is 19 years old and is stranded in Dubai with no family member with her,” the court said.

It said a compelling case has been made out for granting her the visa.

“This in fact ought to have been done by the Indian Diplomatic Commission itself, but unfortunately, they did not accede to the request made by the petitioner,” the court said, and directed the Bureau of Immigration to grant the visa.

The court, however, added that its order shall not be considered as a precedent and that it has ordered for a visa to be granted in this case considering the facts and circumstances.

The petitioner’s counsel, Dinyar Madon, argued that the Bureau of Immigration and the Indian Diplomatic Mission in Dubai had acted in a high-handed, arbitrary and wrongful manner.

As per the plea, the petitioner’s daughter completed her graduation in Mumbai and later went back to America to pursue further studies.

The Indian government on March 11 announced suspension of all visas from midnight of March 13 till April 15. The travel advisory further provided that if any foreigners intended to travel to India, they could apply to the nearest Indian Mission making out compelling reasons.

Following the advisory, the petitioner modified her daughter’s travel plans and advanced her flight to March 12.

The petitioner said she had requested the Indian Diplomatic Mission in Dubai to consider her daughter’s situation, but they refused to provide assistance, following which she approached the High Court.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/vshs31/article31105822.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BMAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hc-asks-immigration-bureau-to-grant-visa-to-19-year-old-stranded-in-dubai/article31105823.ece
427,2020/03/19,COVID-19: Around 90% learner’s licence tests deferred,"RTOs to only provide essential services like vehicle registration till March 31

In the face of the threat of the novel coronavirus, the transport department has deferred nearly 90% of all scheduled learner’s licence tests across all all regional transport offices (RTO) in the State. It has also deferred the final driving exams of several applicants.

Moreover, the few learner’s licence tests would be taken orally as opposed to the computer test until March 31.

State transport Commissioner Shekhar Channe, said, “RTOs will provide essential services such as registration of vehicles and renewal of permits through the coming few weeks, services such as transfer of old vehicles will be deferred to after March 31,” he said.

Mr. Channe said they will also be taking learner’s tests one candidate at a time and it would be an oral exam. Learner’s licence tests typically are taken in batches of ten on a computer. Mr. Channe said the final road test taken by drivers before they get a licence will also be deferred for all applicants whose learner’s licence is not expiring before March 31. According to the rules, people need to take their final driving exam before their learner’s licence expires.

The series of measures were issued as a directive to to reduce the number of people coming to the RTOs. There are 50 RTOs in the state and RTO officials said on an average 350 people visit them every day for various licence-related work.

RTO officials said ideally even fitness tests for various commercial and personal vehicles should be postponed. “Registration, however, can’t be postponed as there are Supreme Court orders that state that we need to register all vehicles on BS IV standard. There will be many who will severely affected if registrations stop now,” an official said.

The State transport department has also issued directives to all private and public buses and taxis to remove any curtains as a preventive measure. Transport Minister Anil Parab in a statement also said private bus services found overcharging will be severely penalised.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/covid-19-around-90-learners-licence-tests-deferred/article31103649.ece

While my road trip from Borivali to Sahar was completed in around 20 minutes, the next leg to Churchgate was in completed in less than 30 minutes,” a commuter said.

429,2020/03/19,Man held for cheating people of ₹48 lakh,"Accused promised jobs, claimed he was senior official in excise department

The Economic Offences Wing of Unit II of the Navi Mumbai Police has arrested one man for cheating people of around ₹48 lakh promising them jobs with the customs department.

Santosh Patil (50) was arrested from Nevali village in Panvel on Monday, where he had been staying for the last four months by changing his identity. A complaint filed against Mr. Patil with the Kharghar Police in November 2019 says he cheated close to 140 people by promising them jobs.

In February 2018, Mr. Patil had approached a 39-year-old Kharghar woman by dressing up in a crisp white uniform with stars on his shoulder and claimed to be a senior officer in the Central Customs and Excise department. He told her that he wanted to provide jobs to people in the customs department as constables, security guards and customs officers and if there was anyone she knew who was in need of a job, he could help.

The complainant then suggested names of a few people who were in need of a job, including her own nephew and a few other family members.

“The accused approached the victims and said the registration fee for the constable level was ₹3,500, that for a guard was ₹10,500 and it was ₹35,000 for the post of a customs officer. However, after the victims paid this fee, he kept delaying sending an appointment letter and made excuses that the department was extremely busy as it was filling 14,000 spots for candidates,” a police officer said.

“Mr. Patil was arrested and produced before the court and has been remanded in police custody till March 20,” senior police inspector Vijay Waghmare, EOW Unit II, said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/man-held-for-cheating-people-of-48-lakh/article31103608.ece

431,2020/03/19,"Situation grave, need Centre’s help: federation of exporters","‘Many factories across sectors will be forced to slow down’

The Federation of Indian Export Organisations, Southern Region (FIEO-SR), has said the situation arising from the COVID-19 pandemic for exporters is grave and many factories across sectors will be forced to slow down or stop production.

Seeking urgent intervention of State and Central governments, FIEO-SR chairman Israr Ahmed there is possibility of large-scale cancellation of orders, supply chain disturbance, delayed or even non-payment by buyers, which will seriously affect exporters’ cash flow.

This put the export sector, especially micro, small and medium enterprises, in a very serious spot, he said. On their part, industries are trying to provide help to employees and co-operate with the government for containing this serious issue.

Mr. Ahmed said this while urging the government to initiate a number of measures for the benefit of exporters, including relaxation of non-performing asset (NPA) norms to accommodate delay in getting payment. “Lack of business coupled with fixed cost will force units to close if NPA norms are not relaxed,” he said.

Figuring in the list of measures sought by FIEO-SR are instructions to banks to facilitate faster clearance of credit applications and extend up to 25% automatically the existing credit; extension of the export realisation period from 270 to 360 days; all input tax credit/integrated goods and service tax refunds may be provided to exporters instantly; and deferring employees' state insurance payments for three months as well as advance tax payment till at least September 30.

The umbrella organisation of exporters also urged the government to consider extending the Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana incentive of 8.33% for all old and new employees for six months till the exporters tide over the crisis.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/situation-grave-need-centres-help-federation-of-exporters/article31103581.ece

433,2020/03/19,Filipino remains critical at Kasturba,"BMC allows nine private hospitals to admit patients who will have to pay for using isolation facilities

A 59-year-old Islamic scholar from the Philippines, who had tested positive for novel coronavirus (COVID-19), continues to be in a critical condition at Kasturba Hospital. Doctors say he has many underlying conditions and he remains on ventilator support.

The patient, who had come to India along with nine others, was on a visit to several mosques. Two others from his group have also tested positive.

The group had reached Mumbai on March 3 and had then left for Delhi. They returned to Mumbai on March 10, and were staying at a mosque in Navi Mumbai. Sources said after the patient first developed symptoms he consulted a private doctor, who referred him to Kasturba Hospital. All the others in the group have also been placed under isolation.

Signboards directing patients to coronavirus OPD put up at the entrance to Kasturba Hospital on Wednesday.

Senior citizens and those with co-morbid conditions have been found to be at a great risk if infected by COVID-19. On Tuesday, the State recorded its first death in Mumbai. The 64-year-old victim with a travel history to Dubai also had multiple co-morbid conditions, including hypertension and heart ailment. His death has triggered a debate on whether the civic-run Kasturba Hospital is equipped to handle serious complications developing in positive patients.

“We have good honorary doctors who are looking after the patients,” civic health officer Dr. Daksha Shah said.

The possibility of a surge in positive cases has pushed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to get private players to admit patients. Nine private hospitals in the city will have isolation facilities where patients who are willing to pay can be admitted.

“Patients can opt for admission at these private hospitals, who will have to collect the samples and send them for testing at the laboratory in Kasturba Hospital,” Dr. Shah said.

The hospitals are Jaslok (5 beds), HN Reliance (2 beds), Hinduja (20 beds), Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani (17 beds), Raheja (12 beds), Gurunanak (2 beds), St. Elizabeth (2 beds), Bombay (4 beds), and Lilavati (15 beds). Jagjivan Ram Western Railway Hospital has also set aside 10 beds for isolation.

434,2020/03/19,Woman cheated of ₹9.77 lakh on promise of marriage,"Retired policewoman’s daughter befriended accused on FB

A retired policewoman’s daughter filed a complaint with the Koparkhairane police after she fell for a proposal on Facebook and was cheated of ₹9.77 lakh.

The victim, a 30-year-old private tutor, was approached by a man, who introduced himself as Benson Morgan from London, via Facebook on February 2. He sent her a friend request, which she accepted, and after chatting for a while they exchanged phone numbers.

Less than three weeks into their friendship, the accused told the woman that he wanted to marry her and would be coming to meet her. On March 2, she received a call from a woman named Indira, who claimed to be calling from the customs department at New Delhi international airport. Ms. Indira told the complainant that Mr. Morgan had been detained by the customs department. She also made the victim speak to a man who claimed to be the airport manager.

According to the complaint, the ‘airport manager’ told her that Mr. Morgan was travelling with £50,000 without a ‘money laundering certificate’. He further asked her to pay ₹65,000 for the certificate and to get him released.

The next day, the complainant received another call from someone who claimed to be from the Reserve Bank of India and asked her to open a bank account for Mr. Morgan to deposit the U.K. currency. For this, she was asked to pay ₹1.25 lakh and later another ₹2.4 lakh which the fraudster said was for the ‘C.O.T. code’.

“Between March 2 and 6, the fraudsters called the complainant several times and made her pay money under various claims. She paid a total of ₹9.77 lakh in the name of ‘tax code’, for upgrading the bank account to deposit the money and various other reasons. She only realised that she was being cheated when someone called and asked her to pay ₹2.5 lakh to access the PIN for upgrading the account. She then refused to pay,” a police officer from Koparkhairane police station said.

After the refusal, Mr. Morgan video called the victim on Saturday and told her that he is being deported to London as she refused to pay the additional amount. He abruptly disconnected the call saying he would return the money.

On Sunday, she registered a case with the Koparkhairane police for cheating under the Indian Penal Code and provisions of the IT Act.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/woman-cheated-of-977-lakh-on-promise-of-marriage/article31103509.ece
435,2020/03/19,Fear factor: police keep eye out for symptoms among accused,"Those showing signs undergo test for virus during check-up

With cases of novel coronavirus on the rise in the city, the Mumbai Police have started looking for symptoms in the arrested accused.

As per procedure, every accused arrested in any offence has to be produced before a metropolitan magistrate’s court within 24 hours. A prerequisite for this appearance is that the accused undergoes a check-up at a government hospital, so that any health conditions can be made part of the official record to be presented before the court.

“If the accused displays symptoms, or if we find they have a travel history that could have put them at risk, we get the accused tested for the virus as well,” Mumbai Police spokesperson DCP Pranaya Ashok said.

Ground level officers said the move was necessary, and is being enforced on a priority basis because any arrested accused comes into contact with a high number of people.

“If the accused is remanded in police custody, they will come into contact with the investigating team, which in turn will come into contact with hundreds. Being in judicial custody means being sent into a large compound full of people and being granted bail lifts all limits altogether. If an option to get examined at a government hospital is available, it is essential that this opportunity be taken,” an officer said. The police have also started providing face masks to accused as an additional precautionary measure.

On Wednesday, three people arrested by the Crime Branch Unit II in a cheating case were seen wearing surgical masks while being taken to court. The masks also serve as a replacement for the traditional black cowl placed over the faces while producing them in court.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/l40fsc/article31103502.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BM-police-accused,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/fear-factor-police-keep-eye-outfor-symptoms-among-accused/article31103489.ece

He said that currently, Pune has eight positive cases and 22 suspected cases, all of whom are being treated at Naidu Hospital. YCM Hospital has 11 positive and 10 suspected cases, a total 21 admissions.

The minister said that while there have been problems owing to shortage of testing kits, the Centre has procured 10 lakh new kits and the shortfall will be addressed soon.

Mr. Tope said the country is in ‘Phase 2’ of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the government has no intention of entering ‘Phase 3. “We hope that that the ‘work from home’ directive issued by the district administration will be followed by IT companies and other private concerns. We are also looking at ways to ensure that government offices function at 50% of their capacity so as to preclude mass gatherings at work places,” he said.

He noted that of the 40-odd patients who had tested positive, more than 50% “imported” the virus in their foreign travels, and nine are relatives or first contacts of those who had originally contracted the virus.

Meanwhile, in the wake of surging positive cases in Pune, the district administration has directed all establishments to ensure that no more than five people are working at one time in offices.

441,2020/03/19,FIR against furniture manufacturer for advertising ‘anti-corona mattress’,"Newspaper ad had gone viral

The Narpoli police in Bhiwandi have registered an FIR against the proprietor of a furniture manufacturing company for allegedly trying to capitalise on the novel coronavirus pandemic through an advertisement.

According to the police, the advertisement was placed in the March 13 edition of a regional daily newspaper, and immediately came under heavy fire on social media. The half-page ad was titled, “Anti Corona VirusMattress pe soyega India toh badhega India (India will progress if it sleeps on this anti-coronavirus mattress)”. It displayed a “corona-resistant mattress” priced at ₹15,000 and with a five-year warranty, and the address of the furniture gallery in Kasheli, Bhiwandi.

A picture of the advertisement went viral on the same day on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Users were quick to draw parallels with other supposed remedies like cow urine, joking that all such cures could take a back seat now that there is a miracle mattress. The ad also came to the notice of the police and local health officers into the matter.

“Based on a complaint received from Dr. Balasaheb Davkhar, Kharbhav Primary Healthcare Centre, Bhiwandi, we have registered an offence against Amar Parekh, the proprietor of the company, who placed the ad in the newspaper. He has been booked for making statements amounting to public mischief under the Indian Penal Code, and sections of the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act,” Deputy Commissioner of Police Rajkumar Shinde, Zone II, Thane Police, said.

Mr. Parekh has not been arrested yet, as in cases where the penalty is imprisonment of less than seven years, the law requires the police to first issue a notice to the accused under the CrPC, seeking an explanation as to why he should not be arrested immediately.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/sxw4r3/article31102836.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BM-mattress-ad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/fir-against-furniture-manufacturer-for-advertising-anti-corona-mattress/article31102837.ece

443,2020/03/19,Beethoven-Haus in Bonn is a reflection of the composer’s genius,"Ode to Joy: Much like his most beloved symphony, Beethoven-Haus in Bonn, is a reflection of the composer’s genius

Ludwig van Beethoven, the 18th-Century musical genius, left an indelible mark that forever changed the landscape of Western Classical music. His compositions were considered avant-garde because he broke with all traditional forms; it was different from everything people had listened to before. From his early years in Bonn, Germany, to his legendary achievements in Vienna, Austria, the music world celebrates Beethoven at every stage.

As one of the most frequently visited museums dedicated to a musician, Beethoven-Haus, his birthplace in Bonn, attracts over 1,00,000 visitors per year. On the occasion of Beethoven’s 250th anniversary in 2020, the house where he was born shines in renewed splendour, with a new permanent exhibition and an exceptional anniversary programme lasting one year starting from December 2019.

Notes to remember The house where Ludwig van Beethoven was born; a statue of the composer

Information and emotional access to more than 200 original exhibits like manuscripts, instruments, items from his daily life and Beethoven’s ear trumpets as well as portraits give an insight into the music composer’s known and unknown life.

“Beethoven’s birthplace is a magnet for Beethoven friends from around the globe,” says Malte Boecker, director of Beethoven-Haus, Bonn. “For the new exhibition, we focussed on a harmonious interaction between the historic architecture and a modern perspective on Beethoven and his time,” explains architect Barbara Holzer.

According to Christian Lorenz, artistic director of the Beethoven Anniversary Society, “His musical expression of Utopia where people live together in peace is appealing.” Lorenz explains in Beethoven’s own words: “Freedom and progress is the purpose in the art world as in universal creation.”

Monika Grütters, German Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media, adds: “Until today, he is one of the most important ambassadors of German culture. There is one thing that holds for all of Beethoven’s music: The more we deal with it, the more interesting and emotional it gets.”

The concept for the new permanent exhibition was developed by museum director Nicole Kämpken and her team.

“The power of the exhibits and the way they are categorised lets visitors get in close contact with Beethoven as a human being and artist. Selected compositions demonstrate the new standards he set in music. The exhibition gives an insight into both his daily life as well as the circle of friends and patrons.”

Three special rooms located above each other in the rear of the house, where the Beethoven family lived, are designed in a rather unconventional style. A diorama on the ground floor shows the city of Bonn in Beethoven’s time. In the sound room located above, five important early compositions prove the composer’s musical uniqueness; and in the attic, the bedroom of Beethoven’s parents, so far referred to as his birth room, can now be entered — something that was not possible in the past. Using a mirror surface and media fade-ins, a dream-like state and a feeling of hovering is created, and a poetic location established to sensually connect to the Beethoven phenomenon.

The basement vault of the historic neighbouring house features a treasure chamber where original manuscripts from Beethoven are on display. The ground floor accommodates a music room where visitors can listen to concerts on historic keyboard instruments. For the first time, the museum also has an area dedicated to temporary exhibitions. The first is about the most famous Beethoven portrait painted by Joseph Stieler. The modern reception area in the opposite building now contains the new museum shop with an admission desk and a small cafeteria. The upper floor houses a seminar room for educational events organised by Beethoven-Haus.

There, visitors can access the Digital Archive of Beethoven-Haus on tablets to take a virtual look at other collections. The letters in the anniversary year’s logo BTHVN2020 stand for the German words for five key aspects, of the composer’s character: Beethoven as citizen, composer, humanist, visionary and Nature lover. The planned events will correspond to these five pillars.

Today, after almost two centuries, ‘Fur Elise’ is a favourite mobile ring tone for many.

444,2020/03/19,Clamour for one more ring road grows,"Increasing density of traffic putting pressure on road infrastructure, says industry body

With the density of vehicles rising by the day in the city, the clamour for a second ring road has been growing. Many feel that this is necessary to ease traffic congestion and a viable alternative to widening arterial roads or constructing flyovers.

According to an official in the Transport Department, the number of vehicles registered in Puducherry region was 68,208 in 2017 and 65,626 in 2018. Although the number of registration of vehicles came down to 58,380 in 2019 because of slowdown, there has been steady increase in the number till 2016, said the official.

A survey conducted by the traffic police in association with Sri Manakula Vinayagar Engineering College on a Friday and a Saturday three years ago revealed that around 3 lakh vehicles enter and leave the town every day. The survey was conducted at five entry points of Ajantha Signal, 45 Feet Road, Raja Theatre junction, Odiansalai and Sonanpalayam revealed that around 2.6 lakh two-wheelers, 17,000 cars, 3,200 light commercial vehicles, 13,000 autorickshaws, 3,500 load carriages, 2,200 buses and 1,500 vans enter and leave the Boulevard area. Of the 17,000 cars, more than 50% are from the neighbouring States.

“Yes, it is absolutely necessary that the government starts planning another ring road. We should learn from Chennai and Bengaluru. It will be wise to have a ring road to divert traffic coming from outside. A ring road will open up new areas of economic growth,” M. Nandakumar, secretary, Sedarapet Industry Association, said.

Steady increase in the number of vehicles has put pressure on road infrastructure, said Arun Menon, an industrialist. “The present road infrastructure is unable to handle the volume of traffic. Traffic jams have become a routine affair and the number of road accidents, especially those involving two-wheeler riders, are on the rise. Creation of an outer ring road will ease pressure on the existing four roads that connect Puducherry,” said Mr. Menon.

The former Member of Parliament M. Ramadass said the key component for having such a huge infrastructure was funding. “How and where will the government find finance is a million dollar question. If the construction of a bridge over Uppanar, which is yet to be completed even after 13 years is any indication, a ring road proposal is a long shot,” he said.

Meticulous planning

The government had to be careful about planning, cost estimation, appointment of contractors and coordination with local population. “The increasing traffic in future and the associated environmental issues will have to be factored in now itself. The government may do well to consider the Comprehensive Mobility Plan prepared by Delhi Integrated Multi Model Transit System Ltd. to ease traffic congestion in Puducherry besides having a ring road,” Mr. Ramadass said.

An outer ring road, rather than building an expressway, is the only solution to ameliorate the chaotic conditions in many sectors in the city, said Babu, a resident of Natesan Nagar. Vehicles coming from Cuddalore and from Chennai could be diverted to outer ring roads. This would help Puducherry preserve its old-world charm, he said.

Priority should be to divert vehicles going towards Cuddalore from entering Puducherry via JIPMER. Similarly, there a large number of vehicles from Cuddalore proceeding to Chennai or other districts of Tamil Nadu pass through the city to enter the Tindivanam highway.

According to Mr. Babu, vehicles that pass through the city have to go via several busy junctions in the city such as Ariyankuppam, Marappalam, Indira Gandhi Square, Rajiv Gandhi Square and Shivaji statue. This caused huge traffic jams, not to speak of the air pollution.

“It's the need of the hour to move the bus stand and general hospital to a larger space. Government must build a mofussil bus terminus as had been done in Chennai by having a terminus at Koya mbedu,” Mr. Babu said.

Fund shortage

A senior engineer with the Public Works Department told The Hindu that there was a proposal for a second ring road connecting Puducherry-Tindivanam stretch of NH 66 with the Puducherry-Cuddalore stretch of NH 45, after passing through Puducherry-Villupuram stretch of NH 45. As per the plan, the ring road would connect Gorimedu, Mettupalayam, Moolakulam, Thakkakuttai, Kompakkam and Nonankuppam.

“The government has approached the Union Ministry of Highways for funding. It will be impossible for us to fund the project. Land acquisition will itself run to several crores of rupees,” the official said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/xjivw6/article31111889.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THPONDYUTMATTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/clamour-for-one-more-ring-road-grows/article31111890.ece

After the first COVID- 19 case was reported in the Union Territory, the Health Department has identified 12 people who were in primary contact with the patient in the enclave of Mahe.

The condition of the 68-year-old woman who tested positive for novel coronavirus is reported to be stable. She is being treated at the Mahe Government Hospital by a team of doctors.

The woman tested positive after her return from Umrah in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, on March 13.

Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy and Health Minister Malladi Krishna Rao visited Mahe on Thursday to assess the preparedness to combat novel coronavirus. He told reporters at Mahe that the government had allotted ₹1 crore to the Mahe administration to procure ventilators, personal protection equipment for doctors and paramedical staff and essential medicines.

Mr. Narayanasamy said he had written to his Kerala counterpart Pinarayi Vijayan to advice authorities at Calicut and Kannur airports to inform the Mahe Regional Administration about any arrivals from foreign countries.

District Collector T. Arun on Monday issued an order directing all departments to avoid routine meetings/gatherings unless they were related to the maintenance of essential services such as COVID-19 prevention measures and law and order issues.

Mr. Arun also issued an order on Wednesday declaring no holidays to Medical Colleges, Dental Colleges, Nursing Colleges, Physiotherapy and other Paramedical Institutions within Puducherry region.

The order has been issued as part of measures to deal with the outbreak in the country, the order said.

“The services of all students (undergraduates and post-graduates) and the faculty of these medical institutions would be drafted for strengthening the healthcare delivery system, awareness programmes, screening and testing,” the order said.

The Director of Health and Family Services would work out a roster/strategy to depute the available manpower and resources of these institutions at suitable/required locations immediately, the order said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/covid-19-12-people-under-observation-in-mahe/article31107603.ece
447,2020/03/19,‘Opportunities abound in medical tourism industry’,"Cheaper surgical care makes the country a hub for medical tourists: experts

India’s thriving medical tourism industry, which attracted patients from 65 countries, throws up entreprenurial opportunities, according to experts who addressed a recent workshop at Pondicherry University.

The workshop on “Medical Tourism in India: Entrepreneurial Opportunities” was held by the Department of Tourism Studies under School of Management, Pondicherry University and sought to enlighten students of tourism management about current trends in medical tourism and entrepreneurial opportunities.

Speakers pointed out that India as a medical tourism destination was set to generate business worth $9 billion by 2020.

Foreign tourists visited India for the purpose of medical treatment from 65 countries, in which 90 per cent of tourists flow was from 10 countries. In fact, medical tourists from the UAE, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Sudan, Yemen and Oman constituted around 75% share of the total medical tourism in India.

India has become a hub for medical tourists as the cost of quality medical and surgical care in India is cheaper when compared to Western Europe, North America and some South East Asian countries.

Higher growth

As one of the fastest growing medical destinations around the world, India is predicted to drive higher growth in the coming years. According to experts, medical tourism in India is popular for a variety of procedures, especially ones related to cosmetic, orthopedic, cardiac, neurology, and organ transplant surgery.

449,2020/03/19,COVID-19 scare: TNSTC cuts bus services by 10%,"‘Drop in passenger traffic has been particularly noticeable in mofussil services’

With a conspicuous drop in passenger traffic owing to COVID-19 scare, the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC), Tiruchi region, has cut down its services, mostly mofussil services, by 10%.

“The TNSTC, Tiruchi region, has a fleet of 940 buses transporting about 6.94 lakh passengers a day on an average normally. However, over the past few days, the passenger traffic has dropped to about 6-6.02 lakh a day. The drop has been particularly noticeable in mofussil services, especially on long distance buses. Hence we have cut down about 10% of our scheduled services, mostly mofussil services,” S. S. Rajmohan, General Manager, TNSTC, Tiruchi region, told The Hindu on Thursday.

Mr. Rajmohan indicated that about 400 trips of about 100 buses have been curtailed in view of the prevailing situation.

Most of the trips cut were long distance ones.

“However, we are operating on need basis and depending on the situation, services are being run,” he said.

According to sources, some of the long distance services to Chennai, Salem and other places were operating with very few passengers over the past few days. While, town buses on most routes were drawing passengers as usual, they said.

Meanwhile, the TNSTC has launched a hygiene and sensitisation drive for both its employees and the public. “All buses are cleaned using disinfectants right at the bus stands. We have deployed special teams to carry out the task at the bus stands in Tiruchi and other towns in our region,” Mr. Rajamohan said.

Besides, wash basins with soaps have been provided in all bus stands so that the bus crew could wash their hands frequently. This apart, each of the crew members are being supplied with soaps individually. “We have also started distributing masks to conductors,” Mr. Rajmohan said.

Importantly, conductors have been provided with wet sponges for use while dispensing tickets to passengers.

Normally, many conductors use saliva to pull out tickets to be handed over to passengers and they have been asked to desist from the practice.

All TNSTC offices and depots, especially toilets, were being cleaned thrice using disinfectants.

Staff members are provided nilavembu kashayam to help improve immunity.

Besides, hot water mixed with turmeric is kept at the offices for employees to wash their hands.

As per the directions of Transport Minister M. R. Vijayabhaskar crew members have been instructed to extend proper care for passengers displaying symptoms of being affected by COVID-19 virus or emergencies while travelling on the buses.

Crew members have been asked to immediately drive down to the nearest government hospital or primary health centre to provide immediate medical attention to such passengers, Mr. Rajmohan said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/1hzt4v/article31111182.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY20TNSTCTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/covid-19-scare-tnstc-cuts-bus-services-by-10/article31111183.ece

S.

The Centre has declared it as a national disaster and precautionary measures are being taken on a massive scale. All citizens are duty bound to adhere to the precautions and individual passengers have no control over the situation. Hence the Railways should waive the cancellation fee as many airlines have already done so, Mr. Pushpavanam said.

The Thanjavur District Rail Users Association too has sought full refund for the tickets cancelled in view of the government’s advisory to avoid travelling in view of the COVID-19 epidemic.

A. Giri, advisor and media-coordinator, TDRUA, said many passengers who have booked train tickets earlier were cancelling or postponing their tours or visits in view of the widespread warning on the impact of the COVID-19 virus attack.

While cancelling the tickets they lose huge amount as cancellation fee. Since the avoidance of such travel during this crucial period will help the governments control the spread of the disease, the Association called upon the Railway Ministry to waive the cancellation fee on train tickets booked for the journey up to April 15, 2020. Likewise, the refund of the convenience fee levied by IRCTC on these tickets was also sought by the Association.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/waive-train-cancellation-fee/article31111146.ece

The Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Aquaculture (RGCA) at Sirkazhi has demonstrated to fishermen that culturing of export quality asian seabass (koduva) fish in fresh or brackish water for a year will yield better returns than shrimps.

A collective yield of up to 15 tonnes is expected in the two one-hectare ponds at the Karaikal demonstration farm of RGCA, which is a society under Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India.

On an average, the money spent towards electricity, imported pellet food, labour and probiotics does not exceed ₹ 250 per fish that weighs up to one kg when fully grown. The fish that fetches a farm rate up to ₹440 per kg is sold upwards of ₹ 650 at the retail points, according to RGCA officials.

Accompanied by the District Collector of Karaikal, Arjun Sharma, the Chairman of MPEDA, K.S. Srinivas, who is the president of RGCA, took stock of the robust growth of the fish variety over a 11-month duration. The complete harvest of the fish, which weighed just 1.2 grams at the time of release in the ponds, is expected to be carried out after a month.

The visiting team that also included Project Director of RGCA, Sirkazhi, S. Kandan; MPEDA Director M. Karthikeyan; and Marketing Director Dola Shankar determined the successful culturing of as many as 8,500 fish seedlings in one of the two one-hectare ponds.

The RGCA has been prompting farmers involved in shrimp culture to diversify into culturing of asian seabass, mudcrab and other species. Though the shrimps are harvested once in 120 days, the farm owners face tough times as it is prone to white-spot disease. It is for this reason that they had to switch over to culturing ‘L.vannamei’ shrimp from the native monodon variety. Yet, the yield diminishes in the subsequent cycles resulting in a substantial drop in revenue generation, Assistant Project Manager of RGCA, Karaikal, G.K. Dinakaran, said.

There has been expectations from the farming community involved in inland fishing that the Tamil Nadu Government must start hatcheries for ensuring adequate availability of asian seabass fish seedlings, in consonance with the rising demand.

At present, the fish seedlings are available only at the RGCA's seabass hatchery at Thoduvai, located about 14 km away from Sirkazhi.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/h6uop9/article31110111.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY20FISHTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/it-is-profitable-to-culture-asian-seabass-fish/article31110112.ece
456,2020/03/19,27 quarantined at Kallikudi,"Those spreading false rumours to face action

Collector S. Sivarasu on Thursday inspected the isolation wards at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital and dispelled rumours of positive cases of COVID-19 being reported in Tiruchi.

All samples sent for tests from Tiruchi have returned with negative results so far, he said. “The rumours being spread online about there being two positive cases of COVID-19 in Tiruchi are false and baseless. Following a discussion with the city police commissioner, we have decided that stringent action will be taken on those spreading these false rumours, both online and offline,” Mr. Sivarasu said. Two students, both hailing from Thuvakudi had returned from Kerala with fever and were tested for COVID-19 following fear mongering, and the tests results were negative, he said.

At the newly set up isolation facility at Kallikudi, 27 people have been quarantined, Mr. Sivarasu said. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) had instructed the state and district administration to screen travellers arriving from countries in the European Union, Europe Free Trade Association Countries, Turkey, UK, Afghanistan, Philippines. Malaysia. “At the Kallikudi facility, 12 travellers from Dubai, 6 from Malaysia, one from Germany and eight from the countries mentioned by the MOHFW have been quarantined,” Mr. Sivarasu said. They were among 109 travellers who arrived in a flight from Sharjah and 177 from Dubai on Wednesday night at 10:30 pm and 11:30 pm respectively,” he said.

The quarantined individuals are all people with travel history to the affected countries. Mr. Sivarasu said that all basic facilities, including rest rooms, personal protective equipment (PPE) have been provided for the travellers and they will likely be sent home on Thursday night. “The Department of Public Health will keep in touch with them and has requested them to visit the MGMGH in case they experience fever, cough or cold symptoms,” he said.

Later on in the day, Mr. Sivarasu along with City Corporation Commissioner S. Sivasubramanian met workers at private travels offices at the Omni Bus Stand where they requested them to display awareness messages on maintaining personal hygiene in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/olg832/article31109594.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY20POSTERTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/27-quarantined-at-kallikudi/article31109596.ece

458,2020/03/19,Engineer lodged in quarantine ward following rumours in social media,"A resident of Peravurani, he had returned from Italy after two weeks of quarantine there

An engineer, who returned from Italy with a health certificate, has been lodged in the COVID-19 quarantine ward at Thanjavur Medical College Hospital on the second day of his return to the country, following rumours spread about his health condition on a social messaging platform.

The engineer, hailing from Peravurani in Thanjavur district, was employed in a firm in Italy and had planned to visit his native this month. In the meantime, following the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, he was subjected to quarantine at a government hospital there for two weeks before his journey to India.

During his quarantine period, blood and phlegm samples were taken and the test turned negative enabling him to receive a health certificate from the Italian government health department.

Subsequently, he landed at Mumbai on March 18 morning utilising the assistance extended to him from the Indian Embassy in Italy. From Mumbai, he took a flight to Madurai and from there travelled by road in a separate taxi to reach Peravurani on March 18 evening. He was subjected to screening for the high body temperature at both the airports and Mumbai and Madurai.

On reaching his native place, he approached the Government hospital at Peravurani and subjected himself to the medical screening once again before reaching his residence.

However, some people spread messages in the social messaging platforms stating that the engineer who returned from Italy had slipped from the Government hospital, Peravurani against medical advice. As this post went viral, panic gripped the Peravurani area, sources said.

On Thursday morning, a team of Health officials visited his house and took him to the Thanjavur Medical College hospital, Thanjavur, where he was lodged at the COVID-19 observation ward. The decision to put him under observation was taken since he had travelled long distance to reach his home, officials maintained.

Meanwhile, the engineer’s father had lodged a complaint with the Peravurani Tahsildar, who is heading the Taluk-level COVID-19 complaints redressal team formed by the district administration, stating that the fake news spread by some persons in the social messaging platform had put his son once again under the surveillance at the hospital, causing mental agony to the family.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/engineer-lodged-in-quarantine-ward-following-rumours-in-social-media/article31108093.ece

460,2020/03/19,COVID-19: Man arrested for spreading rumours in Mayiladuthurai,"The history-sheeter spread a rumour that a man who had recently returned from London had contracted COVID-19

A history-sheeter was arrested in Mayiladuthurai Town in Nagapattinam district on Wednesday, on charges of spreading rumours saying that a man from Kuthalam, who had recently returned from London, had COVID-19.

The arrest of the accused ‘Gilly’ Prakash alias G. Prakash (35) was made based on a complaint lodged by V. Anand (36) of Mela Chetty Street in Kuthalam near Mayiladuthurai.

Police sources said Mr. Anand, a software engineer in Bengaluru, came from London on March 8 to his father-in-law’s house in Kuthalam. He went for a medical examination at the Mayiladuthurai Government Hospital in view of the COVID-19 scare. Health Department officials from Konerirajapuram examined him and later certified that he was not affected by the virus, said the police.

The accused, who came to know about the incident, allegedly spread a rumour on Whatsapp that Mr. Anand was affected by COVID-19 thereby creating panic among the public. The accused was later remanded.

The Mayiladuthurai Police registered a case against Prakash under IPC section 505 (1) (b) (whoever makes, publishes or circulates any statement, rumour or report with intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public) read with section 67 of the Information Technology Act.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/covid-19-man-arrested-for-spreading-rumours-in-mayiladuthurai/article31106794.ece
461,2020/03/19,First veto by U.S. in UNSC,"For the first time in its 25 year history, the United Nations last night [March 17] witnessed the unprecedented event of the United States, as a permanent member of the Security Council, exercising its privilege of veto to prevent the passage of an Afro-Asian resolution aimed at the white minority Government of Rhodesia. The resolution would have condemned Britain for not using force to overthrow the breakaway rebel Government of Mr. Ian Smith which declared itself a Republic recently. It would also have required all member governments to isolate Rhodesia completely, and sever all remaining links with it, including postal, radio and telecommunications connections.

The motion, sponsored by the Afro-Asian members (and supported by Russia and China), had overwhelming support — it received nine affirmative votes (the number needed for passage in the 15-member Council) with two against and four abstentions (including that of France). The U.S. could have maintained its veto-free record by also abstaining, because the negative vote cast by Britain (its fourth) alone was enough to defeat the motion. But the Nixon administration apparently felt that it had to show more positive support for Britain with which it has always had a “special relationship.”

Explaining its vote the U.S. representative said his country had voted against a resolution which had so much support, only after the most serious consideration. All the other four permanent members of the Council have exercised their veto more than once in the past, the Soviet Union holding the record with 105 negative votes. Afro-Asian sentiment against the U.S. for its action was apparently running high, because when the U.S. sought a half-hour recess in the meeting last night to explore the possibility of a compromise resolution, the request was voted down by the majority which felt that it was merely a stalling move.

Earlier, a British bid to have a mild resolution, which would have merely asked the members to enforce past economic sanctions and refrain from recognising the new Republican Government in Rhodesia (which most of them already do not) was also defeated.",archives,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/archives/first-veto-by-us-in-unsc/article31101572.ece
462,2020/03/19,The Horniman Affair.,"There was no issue on March 19, 1920 due to Khilafat Day

(From an editorial)

Replying in the Imperial Council to the Hon’ble Mr. Patel, Sir Vincent said: “His Excellency the Governor-General does not propose to cancel the order of deportation from India passed against Mr. Horniman in April 1919, because concurring with the Bombay Government His Excellency does not consider that it would be compatible with the public safety to extend him at present the benefits of the amnesty under the Royal Proclamation.” We are not surprised at the nature of the answer. It has long ago been made clear that the King-Emperor’s appeal for harmony has made about as much impression on the bureaucracy as water on a duck’s back. The only change so far as we can see in its attitude is on occasional willingness to speak softly and to overflow with cheap sentiment on every occasion where sentiment does not imply any corresponding action. That, we believe, is what in the dictionary of certain of our leaders is spelt “co-operation.” It has at any rate sufficed to hugely delight certain of the Imperial Councillors to whom a little gentle tickling in the ribs from bureaucratic fingers is the most convincing of all arguments. So lost are they in the ecstatic enjoyment of this idyll that they are too often inclined to forget that they are there to serve their country — according to their more or less fitful lights-and not to carry on a violent flirtation with the bureaucracy.",archives,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/archives/the-horniman-affair/article31101598.ece
463,2020/03/19,Meet the translator who gave the novel to Kannada,"Kannada

In 1876, the first novel translated by Bindiganavile Venkatacharya from Bengali into Kannada was published. The novel was Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar’s ‘Bhrantivilasa,’ a novelised adaptation of Shakespeare’s Comedy of Errors.

The novelty of Bhrantivilasa immediately caught the attention of the Kannada reading public and it was soon prescribed as a textbook by the Madras and Mysore Universities. Encouraged by this recognition, Venkatacharya translated two more of Vidyasagar’s novels — Shakuntala (1882) and Sitavanavasa (1884).

Venkatacharya came in contact with the Bengali language by chance. In an essay on Venkatacharya, Venkatesha Sangli says, “Venkatacharya had arranged for some medicines to be sent from Calcutta and they came wrapped in an old Bengali newspaper. The Bengali script attracted his attention and the desire to learn Bengali was awakened in him.”

In another essay, B Garudacharya adds to this story, saying that when Venkatacharya was head munshi in Shimoga during 1874-75, a colleague noticed Venkatacharya’s interest in Bengali and procured some Bengali books for him. Venkatacharya subsequently wrote to Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, who began to teach him Bengali. This ‘correspondence course’ helped Venkatacharya learn Bengali in six months. Pleased with his student’s efforts, Vidyasagar sent him a copy of his novel Bhrantivilasa.

Venkatacharya’s entire corpus of translated works can be considered to constitute a single body of literature solely on the basis of the number of novels he translated. According to available evidence, Venkatacharya wrote about 80 books in his lifetime. Of these, a staggering 40 books are translations from Bengali.

He translated most of the novels of Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay and other contemporary Bengali authors from a variety of genres like essays, religious-spiritual stories, histories, historical and social novels and even detective novels.

In the mid-19th century, the novel as a genre, was largely absent in Kannada till translations of a few English novels came out. When Venkatacharya entered the scene in 1876 with Bhrantivilasa, the conditions were fertile for the growth of Kannada novels. By that time, the Bengali novel had established itself as a popular genre and provided a template. Features like use of spoken language, prose narrative, depiction of lives and activities of common people, colloquialisms, humour, adventure, and suspense were introduced through Venkatacharya’s translations.

Perhaps the most important novel that Venkatacharya translated was Bankimchandra’s Durgeshanandini, in 1885.

In spite of the huge popularity they enjoyed, neither Venkatacharya nor his novels are known to the larger Kannada literary world today. The Internet Archive project has managed to salvage and digitise some of his novels from the Osmania University library in Hyderabad, of which 13 are available for free download on their website.",books,https://www.thehindu.com/books/p25mjg/article31108025.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FR20Forgot1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/meet-the-translator-who-gave-the-novel-to-kannada/article31108026.ece
464,2020/03/19,How Ameerunissa Saheba broke the shackles,"Lack of proper education did not stop Ameerunissa Saheba from becoming a prominent writer

Anjuman Danishmandan-e-Urdu, Chennai, brought to the fore little known facts about Ameerunissa Saheba, the first woman Urdu novelist of Tamil Nadu, during the release of Kirdaar Saaz Shakhsiya, a book on her life and works.

Ameerunissa’s writings proved that there is more to Urdu literature than just nazm and ghazals. “She developed an interest in writing from a young age and wrote many short stories, essays, travelogue and novels,” said her brother and publisher A.Md. Ashraff.

Born in Gudiyattam in a conservative family, Ammerunissa broke gender barriers that prevented girls from indulging in literary pursuits.

Ashraff spotted her talent for writing and helped her develop it by hiring tutors. Later, her husband and educationist, S. Ziauddin also encouraged her. She conveyed social messages through her writings, especially about the plight of women working in match and beedi factories.

The convener of the event, Dr. Md. Ubaidur Rahman, former Head, Department of Urdu, New College, while listing her works such as Ambareen; Band Kitaab, Arz-e-Muquaddas Mein Chand Rooz, Sarhad Kay Us Par, Lamhey Fikriya, Purday Hamari Shanaquath, Khutbath and Mash Ale Raah, spoke about how they extolled the traditional values.

He added that two of her afsanas — Dard ka Ehsaas and Dil-e-Naadan were prescribed in the syllabus by the University of Madras. Elias Sait, treasurer, Muslim Educational Association of South India, released the book and the first copy was received by S. Ziauddin, correspondent, C. Abdul Hakeem Trust.

“We only talk about famous literary personalities, my mother penned her works quietly, much before the onset of the technological era when information is just a click away,” said Z. Ifthikar, Ameerunissa son.

An emotional Ifthikar spoke about how his mother despite lack of education went on to become a leading writer. Her social messages were a result of her ability to understand the problems of the disadvantaged sections of the society.

Her intuitive writing, engaging style and the right balance of spiritual and social issues make the works a must read. Even in her travelogue, she describes what she saw in Pakistan without any bias.

Ameerunissa carved a niche for herself, even while being counted among prominent women Urdu writers.",books,https://www.thehindu.com/books/ocbmbe/article31106980.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20frAmmerunissaJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/books/how-ameerunissa-saheba-broke-the-shackles/article31106981.ece
465,2020/03/19,Between note and tempo,"The re-publication of Vaman Hari Deshpande’s seminal study of the Hindustani classical music is a major event in the field of musicology

Music lovers will enthusiastically welcome the re-publication in Hindi of a seminal study of the various singing styles of Hindustani classical music represented by different, well-established gharanas. The book has been unavailable for a long time and when one searched on amazon.in, one found that only two used copies of its English version were available for ₹10,241 and ₹ 16,241 respectively. Here, we are referring to Vaman Hari Deshpande’s book, originally published in Marathi as “Gharandaj Gayaki” in May 1961. In 1973, Popular Prakashan, Bombay brought out its English translation as “Indian Musical Traditions”. Soon after this, Orient Longman came out with its Hindi version done by Rahul Barpute who was for many years the chief editor of the prominent Hindi daily Nai Duniya and enjoyed a close and abiding friendship with Kumar Gandharva.

However, the book has remained largely unavailable for nearly 45 years. Now, Rajkamal Prakashan has republished it as “Gharanedar Gayaki” under the Raza Pustakmala Series of the Raza Foundation, including material that Deshpande had added to the second edition of his original Marathi book. Dr. Gorakh Thorat has translated the additional sections.

The republication of this book is a major event, especially for Hindi readers, in the field of musicology and one hopes that its English version too will soon be made available. Prof. B. R. Deodhar, the first guru of Kumar Gandharva and a direct disciple of the legendary Vishnu Digambar Paluskar, has a written an erudite introduction to the book. Deodhar stood out among his contemporaries on account of his enlightened, modern views on music and a completely catholic, all-inclusive attitude that was innocent of any petty gharana rivalry or partisanship. This helped Deshpande fend off criticism that he had written the book to establish the superiority of Jaipur gharana as Deodhar, a blue blood representative of the Gwalior gharana, had supported his attempt as it was a completely novel way of understanding, analysing and explaining the intricacies of Hindustani classical vocal music.

Deshpande (1907-1990) was a chartered account by profession. He was initially trained in the Gwalior tradition but later went to learn from great singers like Sureshbabu Mane, the wayward genius son of the Kiranan gharana founder Abdul Karim Khan, and also from Natthan Khan, nephew of the Jaipur gharana founder Alladiya Khan. For many years, he also learnt from Jaipur gharana diva Mogubai Kurdikar and her daughter Kishori Amonkar. His highly interesting profiles of twelve musicians and musicologists in Marathi – Sureshbabu Mane, Natthan Khan, Govindrao Tembe, Mogubai Kurdikar, Bhaskarbua Bakhale, Alladiya Khan, Kumar Gandharva, Jagannathbuwa Purohit, Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande, B. R. Deodhar and Bhimsen Joshi– were put together in a book titled “Alapini” and was later translated into English as “Between Two Tanpuras”.

As Deodhar has pointed out, Deshpande combines the practical knowledge of a vocalist with the analytical acumen of a musicologist and thus is most suitable to study and explain the nature and structure of Hindustani music. In my view, he was the first person who used concepts of classicism and romanticism – both are very much in vogue in literary and musical discussions in the West but almost entirely absent in the Indian context – to bring out the aesthetic essence of Hindustani music after making a deep study of its grammatical appearance.

For Deshpande, swara (note) and laya (tempo) are the two basic units of music and a singing style that combines them in the most balanced and judicious manner (preeti-sangam) should be placed at the top of the gharana hierarchy. He underlines the distinguishing features of the Kirana gharana and Agra gharana by describing them as two extremities in the world of Hindustani classical vocal music. While the Kirana gharana places exclusive emphasis on swara and remains indifferent to layakarai, the Agra gharana is solely concerned with laya and taal and fails to pay much attention to swara. All other styles would come in between these two and would differ from one another on account of the way they combine swara with laya and taal. In other words, the proportion of the two in relation with each other in the final version would determine their aesthetic merit. So, their permutations and combinations would offer a glimpse into the process of the formation of a particular vocal style or a gharana, if that style is widely appreciated and gains acceptability.

Although Bonnie C. Wade in his book titled “Khyal: Creativity Within North India’s Classical Music Tradition” claims that Deshpande for his book drew heavily from Deodhar’s multi-volume work “Raga-Bodh”, published in 1947 in Marathi, Deodhar does not say anything like this in his Introduction. In fact, in the foreword to the second edition, Deshpande tries to answer some of the critical points raised by Deodhar. In the world of Hindustani classical music, such openness, intellectual rigour and honesty is not easy to come by.

Deshpande frankly states that all the gharanas are different paths to take the musician to the summit of his creativity. At the same time, he also cautions against gharana orthodoxy or rigidity. His views remain as relevant today as they were when his books were published.",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/ktvhxc/article31109330.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Cover-of-Gharanedar-Gayaki,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/between-note-and-tempo/article31109331.ece
466,2020/03/19,COVID-19: How residents of Karakunnu in Kozhikode set an example to stop the spread of the virus,"They have set up stainless steel wash basins at a bus shelter in the neighbourhood and are encouraging others to follow suit

Washing your hands with soap and water or a hand sanitiser is the best way to break the chain to stop the spread of Coronavirus. And a group of residents at Karakunnu, Nanmanda, about 22 kilometres from Kozhikode in Kerala, have set an example by installing two stainless steel wash basins with three taps each at a bus shelter in their neighbourhood, this week. Passengers alighting from buses or waiting to board buses and pedestrians and passers-by are encouraged to wash their hands here.

Pathayoram Koottayma (which translates to roadside gathering) is a group of 40 families, residents at Karakunnu, who came together about six months ago to clean up their neighbourhood. Their first project was to clean the sides of the road to Karakunnu, which was littered with garbage and hotel waste dumped by passers-by. The unkempt bushes and undergrowth narrowed the road and made it unsafe for pedestrians.

SOAP IT AWAY Taps and sanitisers have been put up in many places in Thiruvananthapuram city. Political organisations and non-governmental organisations have installed taps at several busy junctions and markets. The busy Manaveeyam Veedhi has two such facilities for people to wash their hands. One has been set up by a network of artistes and musicians who hold shows at Manaveeyam Veedhi, while the other has been installed by the Manaveeyam Theruvorakoottam. “The Thiruvananthapuram Corporation has been kind enough to ﬁll the tanks with water and both the facilities are used by pedestrians and people who come to buy milk and other essentials from the Milma booth at the junction,” says Prakash Gopinath, Bicycle Mayor of the city. Netizens have been praising the eﬀorts of volunteers who have supplied water and sanitisers at these places. In a post Harshit Agrawal writes: “Saw a container-jar of water and liquid soap stationed at Kuravankonam Jn this morning just for citizens to keep washing their hands.... and people using it generously, while coming back from oﬃce in evening.. such a noble job whoever has done.... Hats oﬀ to the people of Kerala....” Similarly the busy Eenchakkal junction too has such a tap put in by the youth organisation of a political party. Several shops in the city also insist on customers using ahand sanitiser before stepping into their outlet.

“Instead of waiting for the Government, we tried to help ourselves. As soon as the Government of Kerala came up with the campaign ‘Break the chain’, we came up with the idea of installing taps on both sides of the waiting shed of a bus stop at Karakunnu. We collected money and put it up four days ago. Water is pumped into the tank from the houses of V Balan and Abdul Aziz. On our morning walk, some of us ensure that the tanks are full, wash the bottles of sanitisers and fill it,” says Sasi, aka E Sasindran, a retired Senior Superintendent of the Kerala State Electricity Board.

A video taken later was shared by AK Jayadeesh, secretary of the Koottayma, on Facebook and it went viral. Actors Sunny Wayne and Krishna Shankar later shared the video. Jayadeesh says at last count, the video had been viewed by more than 4 lakh people. Soon many more such taps were installed in different places in Kerala, says Sasi proudly. Balussery, less than four kilometres from Nanmanda, was the next place that had a group of volunteers installing taps near the bus stop.

When the Koottayma was originally formed, the residents also stopped people from dumping rubbish on the roadside by putting up CCTV cameras at their own expense. After taking permission from the Public Works Department, the residents removed huge stones piled on the road and increased its carriage width, making it safer for traffic as well as pedestrians.

The next project is to plant fruit trees such as mango, sapota and guava to beautify the road to Karakunnu. Sasi says they have the spirit and the will to make their surroundings a model for Kerala to follow. “We lack finances and we have roped in some sponsors but it would be great if the Government also helped us with grants for our projects ,” says Sasi.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/mms6te/article31108627.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19mppicfortapsjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/how-residents-of-karakunnu-near-kozhikode-have-set-an-example-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus/article31108628.ece

As the capital city turns into the nerve centre of the State government’s efforts to stem the outbreak of COVID-19, many people and organisations are reaching out in several ways to strengthen the authorities’ efforts to break the chain and stop the spread of the virus. MetroPlus takes a look at how various sectors and people in Kerala are pitching in to help...

It’s all chemistry

The Coronavirus outbreak has led to a severe shortage of hand sanitisers with bottles flying off shelves from medical stores and supermarkets. That’s when several institutions chipped in with guidelines about making sanitisers at home and also manufacturing them in limited quantities. Among them are the Departments of Chemistry at St Xavier’s College, Government College for Women and All Saints’ College in the capital city and research scholars of the Department of Applied Chemistry, Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT), Kochi. The faculty of St Xavier’s released a two-minute video last week on how to make sanitisers at home. On March 17, the college distributed five litres of the solution free of cost to 200 families in Fathimapuram near the college, a village that has been adopted by the institution for its extension activities. The teachers also plan to give training to more people.

The CUSAT team has already distributed the sanitisers across different departments and to the residents of a colony near the campus for free. Initially they made 1,000 bottles of 100 ml each and another 1,000 bottles is getting ready. “Sanitisers have to be prepared as per the guidelines of the World Health Organisation. The alcohol content should be at least 60%. And one has to scrub your hands with the hand sanitiser for at least 20 seconds to get the desired result,” explains Dr N Sulphi, vice-president, Indian Medical Association Kerala. The alcohol destroys the protein that envelopes the virus thereby destroying it, adds K Girish Kumar, professor and head, Department of Applied Chemistry, CUSAT.

Although the components can vary, an integral component is isopropyl alcohol (IPA). Glycerine/glycerol, hydrogen peroxide, any essential oil and aloe vera gel are among other ingredients. “Hydrogen peroxide kills the germs in the bottle in which the sanitiser is packed. Glycerine helps to prevent the alcohol from evaporating easily,” explains Girish Kumar.

Divya Thomas, assistant professor at St Xavier’s, adds that the aloe vera gel is used for moisturising. Vitamin E tablet is an optional component in their sanitiser that has IPA, aloe vera gel, glycerine, essential oil and Vitamin E. “The video was first shared in the staff group of the college that has 53 members. From there it was shared by the teachers to their personal contacts. We were surprised by the reach of the video,” Divya says. At CUSAT, 60 research scholars worked in shifts to prepare the solution and pack it in bottles.

Food from home

Concerns over the spread of COVID-19 have forced several hotels and restaurants to shut down temporarily and people are now turning to home cooks in the city. Although they admit that business has been dull with regular customers backing out and cancellation of bulk orders, they are also getting new clients.

“I now have customers who ask for only curries for lunch, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. I am also getting orders for snacks and cakes, especially from small groups in offices. Also, most customers now want to come and collect the food instead of depending on our delivery boys because they are wary about the precautions taken by them,” says Priya Kolassery.

Swapna Rakesh, another home cook, has made it mandatory for customers to collect the food. “I have done away with delivery boys who used to hand over the food to several offices in the Secretariat and a few banks. Now, if the employees in these offices place a bulk order, one person would have to come and take the food from my place,” says Swapna.

Home cooks Deepika NK, Nisha Kiran and Najiya Ershad, however, have not done away with the home delivery service. “We ensure that the staff wear masks and take necessary precautions. I have closed our takeaway counter and the food is supplied from my home at Kuravankonam so that I can ensure that the food is served hygienically,” says Deepika. Nisha points out that her tiffin service that caters to senior citizens has not been affected. “I haven’t stopped the home delivery because many of the senior citizens may not be in a position to come and collect the food,” she says.

According to Najiya, many of her customers want home delivery as they are reluctant to step out. “I have also extended the time to take orders from 9 am to 11 am to accommodate new clients. My delivery staffers have their hands full. But they say that they don’t have to deal with traffic blocks as there aren’t many vehicles on the road now,” she adds.

At your doorsteps

With people opting to shop from home, supermarkets and grocery shops have upped their home delivery service and online shopping portals are running in full steam. Big Bazaar, Spencers, Ramachandran, More and Kunnil are among the stores that are offering home delivery service. “We have gone all out in promoting our home delivery services. There has been a surge in demand since people are worried whether the items would run out in the coming days,” says Padmakumar G manager of home delivery section at Ramachandran. Small-scale enterprises and wholesale shops have also announced home delivery options. Mohammed Fazi of MKS Store in Palayam market says that even though they used to supply goods to homes earlier that was never done on a big scale. “Business has been dull and so this is an option to keep it afloat,” he says.

As for online shopping portals, there has been 100% growth in business with the expansion of their customer base. Shaman Hanif of kada.in says that the orders have gone up by several folds over the last one week. “Normally we get 40-50 orders a day. It crossed 150 recently and we were forced to close the service for a day. Our skeletal delivery staff is finding it difficult to manage the rush. Since people are stocking rice, sugar and other grocery items in bulk we have to ensure that there is adequate quantity with us,” he says.

Sujith Sudhakaran, founder of AM Needs, which deliver essentials in the morning, says that since they are supplying perishable goods such as milk and dairy products, vegetables and bread there is a steady clientèle on all days. “Customers have no direct contact with our delivery staff who take precautions when they are out on the field. We have 70 staff in the city. Also, many customers now opt for subscription mode in our app so that they get a steady supply of the products,” he adds. Meanwhile, they also have plans to include masks and hand sanitisers in the product list as soon as they are able to procure the same.

Help at hand

“Can I get a cup of tea?” That was the first thing a woman asked when Mathew Jacob and his team got in touch with her. She hadn’t stepped out of her house since she returned from Europe and was all alone in her house. Supplies had run out and she had no clue how to go about it. That was when she came across a Facebook post from Mathew saying that if ‘any elderly people, family with kids or anyone in quarantine need help with groceries, medications etc can reach out to us @ 9846422220’. “As soon as we got her message, we provided her food and essential commodities. Since she sounded depressed, we informed the District Collectorate about her condition. Later, we learnt that she was provided vegetables by the Medical College police as well,” says Mathew, who runs Seed Holidays and Events, a travel and event management company at Pattoor. “Since our business has slumped because of the outbreak, we thought of doing something useful for society,” he says.

Mathew adds that ever since he put up the post, people have been coming forward to volunteer as well. “Our aim was to create a network of volunteers and we are getting a lot of support. However, we also want them to take necessary precautions, such as using sanitisers and avoiding contact with the people they are helping,” he says.

Alive, the ageing solutions company for the elderly, has opened a helpline number to help senior citizens. “Since they are forced to stay indoors because of the current situation, they can call us for assistance. We can arrange medical assistance and can even help them with bank transactions,” says TK Rekha, director, Alive store at Kowdiar.

468,2020/03/19,Fitness in the time of Coronavirus : Run... but keep your distance,"Solo running gradually replaces group runs in Hyderabad

Sunday long distance runs usually attract 200 to 300 members of the Hyderabad Runners group. The location for the run is posted on their website (hyderabadrunners.com) or on social media pages and members turn up, cheering and motivating each other to run better and for longer duration.

Last Sunday when members gathered for a run from Indira Park to Charminar, Dr Murali Nannapaneni, physician and president of Hyderabad Runners (HR), briefed them on the changes that will come into force in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak. There will be no more large group runs. The annual awards night for runners, scheduled to be held in March end, has also been postponed.

The running and training calendar has now been tweaked, to comply with the increased emphasis on social distancing. For the 6000+ active members of HR in 30+ running groups across the city, ‘run on your own’ has replaced group sessions.

“We take pride in promoting health and wellness. It would be ironical if we ignore guidelines of the World Health Organisation and the government. I’m a risk taker, but not this time. We all need to be responsible,” says Murali.

Sunder Nagesh, a runner and marathon pacer from LB Nagar, says it’s ideal to run on your own or with a known friend or two who have no recent travel history and are preferably working from home: “All official training programmes have been put on hold. Mentors in different areas of Hyderabad, who train other runners, have been issued guidelines for social distancing.”

Until a later date

The Boston Marathon, London Marathon, Antarctica Marathon and the Big Sur International Marathon are among the international running events that have been put on hold

Running groups have risen to the occasion and are responding with ideas. Sunder mentions how the KBR group shared online workout videos while the Alwal WhatsApp group came up with guidelines for runners in the locality. As the days of uncertainty continue, online videos for strength training and yoga are likely to come up.

Jacqueline Babitha Xavier who trains runners and non-runners in Secunderabad has taken a stance to not meet anyone she coaches and encourages them to work out in their residences. Apart from runners, she conducts training sessions for women during pre and postnatal stages, cancer survivors and the elderly. “I’ve shared videos and advised them to work out on their own, with caution. Unknowingly, any of us could be carriers of the virus and it’s best to avoid contact, so that we don’t make those with low immunity vulnerable,” she says.

Earlier, her group sessions for strength training for runners would entail the use of props such as resistance bands and kettlebells that were shared. Now, even if small groups meet, bodyweight workouts are encouraged and a double arm distance is maintained. “We run or train for health. So we should follow safety guidelines and not put others and ourselves at risk,” she says.

International marathons that were scheduled for April and May have been put on hold and the immediate running calendar is not a busy one. Runners understand the need to stay fit and keep their immunity strong, and at the same exercise caution.

Sunita Tummalapalli was to take part in the Antarctica marathon, scheduled for March 28, which was now been called off. She takes a pragmatic approach and says, “It won’t hurt if you don’t run for a week or two, or just run alone. You can do strength training workouts, yoga and cardio at home. There’s enough time to practice for the annual Hyderabad Marathon in August.” Her usual running zone, the Gachibowli stadium, remains closed. Elaborating on guidelines that runners have to follow, she says, “As it is, when we meet other runners during a session, we don’t do handshakes because we are sweaty. It’s usually a fist thump. Now we avoid that as well.”

If you’re wondering if all this is an overreaction, not really. It’s better to be safe than sorry and maybe guilty, says Murali: “A few weeks down the line maybe things would settle down and we might look back and think we panicked more than necessary. But if there’s community transmission like in the case of other countries, given our population density, it could be disastrous. So all the steps that we take, as individuals, can help curb the spread of COVID-19.”",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/n48opd/article31108108.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYM20RUNNING1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/covid-19-solo-runs-gradually-replace-group-runs-in-hyderabad/article31108109.ece
469,2020/03/19,Kerala Police ‘hand washing’ video has gone viral,"The video educates on the safe method of washing hand as prescribed by World Health Organisation (WHO)

Six Kerala Police personnel, in full uniform, wearing masks dance to Nanjamma’s ‘Kalakatha...’ song from the film Ayyappanum Koshiyum. Posted on the State Police Media Centre Facebook page, it is the Kerala Police version of the ‘handwashing’ song.

The video has gone viral and has already been shared (at the time of writing) more than 37,000 times after it was posted on March 17. The 1 minute 24 second video shows how to wash one’s hands, even as the personnel move to the very popular song.

Cautioning against panicking, the post informs people that they have the support of the police force. Earlier, the State government posted a scene from the film Baahubali, showing the lead character breaking a chain. As it breaks ‘Break The Chain’ flashes across the screen.

The Kerala Police has been actively participating in the campaign against the Novel Coronavirus.

“We knew that this was going to be something big when it got 400 shares in the initial three minutes alone. But we never imagined the kind of response it evoked in the hours since then and it has even attracted the attention of international media agencies like BBC, Reuters, AFP etc. Our nine-member team conceived and executed it in just over three hours. The collective brainstorming over something different to attract public attention led us to the idea of a dance video though none of the six who eventually performed the number had ever danced before even during their campus lives. The song was selected since it was easier to choreograph the steps. We plan to bring out more such informative videos in the days to come but it will be tough to best the response this video has evoked. Everyone from the chief minister and the finance minister to the State Police Chief has appreciated our efforts,” said V.P.

470,2020/03/19,World Sparrow Day: How to make your home a haven,"As World Sparrow Day nears, here’s how you can fight their declining population by welcoming them into your homes

For A Sadhana Rajkumar, today is not particularly special. “Everyday has to be Sparrow Day, till I see them again in Chennai,” says the bird enthusiast who has done her doctorate on house sparrows.

“Of all the bird species, this is one that is heavily dependent on humans. There is a reason they have been named ‘house sparrows’,” she says. With sparrow population still on a decline in the city, Sadhana says there are a number of steps Chennaiites can take to make their homes and gardens more sparrow-friendly.

“When I was a child, sparrows would keep coming in and out of our house in Perambur. They would build nests in the corner of a room, and we would have to go without a fan for days,” she recalls with a laugh. She acknowledges, “Our homes these days are not built for such a situation. But if you have a balcony on an upper floor, there is plenty you can do.”

Birdhouses, for instance, can be made of sturdy cardboard, terracotta or discarded wood. These birds don’t need elaborate ones, she says. In fact they prefer small spaces. “Give them a foot of space, and keep a two-inch opening. That is just enough for them to flit in and out, without letting in predators.”

After housing, comes food. “Small sparrows can’t eat grains like other birds. They need worms, for their protein,” says Sadhana.

To attract the right kind of birds, all you have to do is plant the right kind of saplings. Which are the right ones? Any that is indigenous to this part of the country. Small insects or worms are drawn to them and sparrows love pecking off them.

“Make sure you have water nearby too. You can make little water bowls from discarded bottles. There are plenty of websites to show you how,” she says.

While house sparrows prefer living in and around sturdy human dwellings “to feel safe,” says Sadhana, they also need trees. The makeshift nest — or any nest — is used only for breeding, feeding and keeping the young ones safe. Sparrows are a very social species, and they need trees like the mango or neem to socialise on. They also prefer sleeping on trees, and keep the nest only for feeding,” she says.

A place called home

There are also a few precautions to be kept in mind. For instance, nests or birdhouses should be at least 10 feet above the ground, to keep predators (think: your domestic cat) at bay. The nests should also be facing either the West or the South, says Sadhana, “The idea is that it should not be directly exposed to the harsh sun.”

Once you have all these physical needs covered, you need to grant them one last thing: privacy. “Don’t keep hovering around the nest to take photos; let them fly in and out in peace. You don’t even have to line the birdhouse with nesting material — in fact, they prefer it if you don’t. They will collect twigs and other things and do it themselves.”

If you are wondering why should one go through all this trouble, Sadhana reminds us of just how much we, as a species, need sparrows too.

“Sparrows also feed on mosquitos, and are particularly good at keeping them away, since both sparrows and mosquitos have tended to grow around humans over time. They keep us safe from vector-borne diseases,” she emphasises.

If you want a simpler reason, she has that too. “Sparrows make for great company. You will be sitting at home anyway, why not sit at home with a sparrow chirping nearby?”

471,2020/03/19,When a yellow-legged buttonquail came calling on the outskirts of Thiruvananthapuram,"The rarely-seen bird, endemic to the Indian sub-continent, was found in Bharathannur

A surprise visitor of the avian kind wandered into the home of Ajikumar V in Bharathannur, on the outskirts of the city, a couple of days ago. Although not a birder himself, Ajikumar, a cooperative inspector in the Nedumangad, was curious enough about the tiny bird, to call in a few local birding enthusiasts to help take care of it.

Bird aboard

“Much to our delight, it turned out to be the rarely-seen Yellow-legged buttonquail!” says birder Biju P B, who along with fellow enthusiasts, Anoop Palod and Reji Chandran, identified the buttonquail. “We are especially excited because there have only been a handful of sightings of the bird from Thiruvananthapuram district and this is, perhaps, one of the first sightings caught on camera. Even ebird.org, a free database of bird observations from all over the world, managed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology at Cornell University in the United States, does not report any listing pertaining to this particular bird from the district,” explains Biju, assistant director, ESI Hospital, Ezhukone, over the phone.

Yellow-legged buttonquails (T. tanki), which resemble quails but are unrelated to them, are endemic to the Indian subcontinent, East Asia and South East Asia. They are categorised among the least threatened species, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. That said the birds are masters of hiding in plain sight.

“Buttonquails are only the size of newborn chicks and they live in the undergrowth in sparsely populated areas. Their reddish-brown colour with muted orange highlights gives them the perfect camouflage for the undergrowth and therefore it’s almost always impossible to spot them,” says the birder.

“I have actually gone on a few expeditions to spot the buttonquails to no avail and lo! This one just turns up just like that. Our lucky day!” he adds.

The birders believe that the buttonquail in question was flushed out of the undergrowth into the house by some predator, maybe a cat or an owl. “They are ground-dwelling and usually run in times of trouble rather than flying,” says Biju.

The trio inspected the bird for injuries and when it was found not to have any, they released it back into the wooded area from whence it came.",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/14d61a/article31107680.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20tvmyellowleggedbuttonquail,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/when-a-rarely-seen-yellow-legged-buttonquail-came-calling-on-the-outskirts-of-thiruvananthapuram-city/article31107681.ece
472,2020/03/19,This native shrub is adding a touch of brightness to Delhi right now,"The star of Delhi

With the onset of spring, the birds and other animals are delighted at the smorgasbord of delicious fruits, making their breeding season a walk in the park, quite literally!

One large bush that sometimes grows to a medium-sized tree standing anywhere between 9 m to 12 m, is Chamrod, also called desi papdi, chambal, geen, darar, sakar, datranga. It is deciduous, and nearly always crooked, with a yellowish or grey smooth bark. The leaves are broad with either blunt or pointy tips, and quite smooth and shiny on the surface.

Pradip Krishen’s Trees of Delhi tells us that it is a part of our native flora and has the capability to brave extreme drought conditions, making it an impressive survivalist in the dry deciduous forests of Northern India, like the Shivalik and lower Himalayas, particularly common in the Aravalli range. Unlike most trees from the Aravalli landscape though, the Chamrod is thornless.

Its genus Ehretia is dedicated to the German botanist, illustrator, and fellow of the Royal Society, Georg Dionysius Ehret (1708-1770) and the species laevis has been derived from the Latin word levis meaning ‘smooth’ or ‘delicate’, referring to the wood of the tree. Surprisingly, this tree has not been given an English name and is often called by its scientific name, Ehretia laevis, outside of the Indian Subcontinent, but it may have a few other local names, depending on the country.

Seasons play an extremely important role in the life of flora. The leaves on the tree shed late in January and the tree sees new leaves beginning March. “The Chamrod fascinates me with its remarkable ability to flower every time it rains. You have a shower any time of the year, and you cannot miss it smiling with flowers within a week,” says Vijay Dhasmana, a friend and curator of the Aravalli Biodiversity Park, Gurugram.

It blooms with small clusters of fragrant white, star-shaped flowers that tend to fall fast and form a pleasant mat of white on the ground. Soon, small berry-like fruits are seen in bunches. They are green, and turn orange later usually towards the end of March and April, with a sweet taste to them. Several birds like Bulbuls, the Indian Robin, and animals like squirrels relish them and help in the shrub’s pollination across the landscape. The fast-growing nature of the tree does compliment the efforts of these animals.

“Ecologically, it is a pioneer species and colonises wastelands and degraded lands very happily. In the Aravalli Biodiversity Park, we are seeing some fabulous recruitment of its young saplings dispersed especially by birds,” says Dhasmana.

The bark is often chewed by people like pan and thus stains their teeth red, which gives it its other popular common name ‘Datranga’ (dat - teeth; ranga - colouring). Even though the Latin term Levis points to its bark being smooth and fine-textured, the tree does not hold much timber value, and only contributes towards making brush-bodies and matchsticks.

These trees were never planted along avenues in the city, but one may see them in large numbers in areas like Delhi Golf Course, Buddha Jayanti Park, Lodhi Gardens, apart from the Aravalli Biodiversity Park. They are also fairly common on the Ridge with several specimens in areas of North Delhi like Civil Lines, where backyards are lined with several of these.

473,2020/03/19,Unsure what herd immunity or social distancing is? Here’s a coronavirus dictionary,"Overwhelmed by the constant updates? Here is a quick explainer to make following news on the pandemic easier

It is on everyone’s minds. The coronavirus is the topic of conversation on long-distance video calls, in text groups, on social media and at office water coolers (ask your bosses to let you work from home!). To follow the constantly moving news about it, we need to understand the terms most frequently used. Because better understanding means lesser panic.

Pandemic

First, the basics. The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. What does that mean?

This classification refers to the level of occurence of an infectious disease. The amount of a particular disease usually present in a community, is called the baseline or ‘endemic’ level. Occasionally, the amount rises above this level. ‘Epidemic’ refers to that sudden increase. ‘Outbreak’ is for a more limited geographic area. When the epidemic spreads over several countries or continents, affecting a large number of people, it is declared a ‘pandemic’.

Asymptomatic/incubatory/convalescent

A communicable disease spreads through a chain of infection through an interaction of agent (the virus), host and environment.

The hosts — human carriers — may or may not show effects of illness. ‘Asymptomatic’ carriers seem healthy and do not experience symptoms despite being infected. ‘Incubatory’ carriers are those who can transmit the agent during incubation period, before clinical illness begins. ‘Convalescent’ carriers are those who have recovered but remain capable of transmission.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, these carriers transmit disease because they do not realise they are infected, and take no special precautions.

Community transmission

The term refers to the spread of an infection within a community, in such a way that the source is not identifiable. These cases, where you are not able to trace how the infection spread, are Stage 3 — something India has not seen yet.

Herd immunity

When a significant proportion of the population is immune to the virus, the remaining portion is also indirectly protected, through ‘herd immunity’. For this to happen, a large number of people need to be exposed to the disease first, and develop antibodies — a natural process of protection. So technically, if a major number of people are immune, the disease won’t circulate in the community.

However, the coronavirus is a new strain of which we do not know enough. We are not sure how many of us have baseline immunity against it. Moreover, in this scenario, when there is a significant mortality rate, talking about herd immunity would be controversial at best.

Flattening the curve

If you mark the daily number of cases in a geographical area on the Y-axis, and the number of days since the first case in that area on the X-axis, you will get a theoretical rate of spread — an upside down V-curve that peaks and ebbs. Steeper the curve, faster the rate of spread, and faster the rate of drop as everyone develops immunity.

The catch is that there is only a certain number of cases that your public health system will be able to handle on a daily basis. We have heard cases in which isolation wards are full, doctors are forced to choose which patient to try and save, hospitals running out of basic supplies.

‘Flattening the curve’ then means preventing the number of daily cases from peaking over the numbers we can treat. This will minimise burden on medical staff. For this, we need to practise interventions, mainly social distancing.

Social distancing

This is the act of keeping social contact to a minimum to pre-emptively minimise the spread of the disease, by staying home as much as possible, and avoiding crowds, public places, transport. This is not the same as being in quarantine or isolation.

Quarantine vs Isolation

Quarantine is needed in a situation where you may be infected, because you have been exposed to high-risk people, but have not been tested yet. You are put into a facility, where only certain people will come to see you, in protective gear. Once you are tested positive, however, you are put into an isolation facility. It has a strict criteria for the type of air filters, flooring and walls.

If you are self-quarantining, you must do it for a period of 14 days, and keep as far away from as many people as possible.

Emotional distancing

It is being talked about as an unwanted side-effect of social distancing. It is not easy to keep to yourself for extended periods of time. Try and make sure that being alone is not the same as being lonely. If the constant updates get overwhelming, you can also practise mental distancing for a while, to give yourself a break and recentre.

474,2020/03/19,‘Main prevention method is to frequently wash your hands’: Your COVID-19 queries answered,"Coronavirus has nothing to do with food and people can eat whatever they want and how much ever they want

Will wearing masks prevent the spreading of COVID-19?

If you are travelling to places where the probability of catching the infection is high, say hospitals, you need to wear masks. If you are using public transport system, where you cannot know if somebody will sneeze or cough, you can use a mask. But the main prevention mechanism is to frequently wash your hands and refrain from shaking other people’s hands or hugging them. Follow cough etiquette when you are travelling or outside.

Dr. P. Kuganantham, founder-chairman, Indian Public Health Foundation, and former Chennai City Health Officer

Should people avoid eating meat-based food to prevent transmission?

Coronavirus has nothing to do with food or pet animals or eating chicken and mutton. People can eat whatever they want and how much ever they want.

Dr. V. Ramasubramanian, consultant, Infectious Diseases, Apollo Hospitals

How soon can a vaccine be developed?

Novel viruses happen due to reassortment. They remain for a short period and mutate depending on factors like geography. A vaccine for COVID-19 is likely to be developed in another three to six months because the trials are on at the moment. Like H1N1, a vaccine can be developed for COVID-19 too.

Dr. P. Kuganantham

In the case of a hit-and-run virus like SARS, no vaccine was developed because after six months it did not come back. If COVID-19 too disappears, then there wouldn’t be a need for one.

Dr. K.K. Aggarwal, president, Confederation of Medical Associations of Asia and Oceania, and former president of Indian Medical Association

Is there a link between a person’s immunity and COVID-19 transmission?

Coronavirus is one of the weakest family of viruses. People affected so far could have been ones with less immunity like children or the elderly. It does not affect everybody. Yes, 100% immuno-compromised people like those with HIV, people with cancer, those who have undergone transplant surgeries or people with diabetes are at risk. Children and elderly are at risk as well. If you take the history of all who died in China or Iran, 90% of them would have been suffering from an illness that compromises their immunity.

Dr. P. Kuganantham

The average age of virus death is 59. The mortality rate for people aged 60 and above after contracting a viral infection is 3.4%; above 70 years is 8% and 80 and above is 15%. Generally, if the immunity is good, you can tolerate any viral infection but there is no specific evidence as it pertains to COVID-19.

If I have symptoms of COVID-19, should I approach the hospital directly?

You are not supposed to visit a hospital directly. In Delhi, you must call a hospital or doctor. There are designated centres to give your samples. Depending on your symptoms, a call will be made on what needs to be done, and they will come and collect a sample at your home. You cannot go to a hospital and infect others.

Dr. K.K. Aggarwal

There are helpline numbers to contact. At the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) in Chennai, there is a separate outpatient section for coronavirus cases.

You can visit here and consult a doctor and leave samples for testing. No other patient will be permitted to access this entrance. RGGGH is the only place in Chennai where samples will be collected for testing.

Are there any home remedies?

Home remedies and treatment other than allopathy is not proven science. The best thing is precaution only. You must keep away from a patient who coughs and sneezes. If you are coughing, you need to cover your face with a mask and not spread the droplets around. COVID-19 spreads through droplets.

Is India equipped to battle coronavirus?

We have started late. There are two steps in case of a viral outbreak — preparedness and containment. If you cannot contain, you delay and if you cannot delay, you research and mitigate the circumstances. Preparedness phased cannot be considered now when there already is infection. After 43 cases, now we are going through preparedness. It is a bit of a delayed response. You need both preparedness and containment tactics at the moment. At least, in India, community spread has not happened so far.

Dr. K.K. Aggarwal

We must change the focus of our battle to personal hygiene. For example, during the Ebola outbreak in Africa, the governments there were was able to contain not because of drugs and treatment but by improving personal hygiene. They mandated hand-washing frequently at schools and industries, which helped bring down the cases. For COVID-19, the management is only by handling patients with travel history. They need to be isolated for the incubation period and kept under observation.

475,2020/03/19,Coronavirus deals a death blow to U.S. economic expansion,"The vast changes required to defeat the outbreak have brought daily business to a halt

No one knows how long it will last or how much it will hurt. But the U.S. economy is either sliding into a recession for the first time since 2009 or is already in one — a sudden victim of the coronavirus outbreak.

The vast changes deemed necessary to defeat the virus — people and companies no longer engaging with each other — are bringing everyday business to a halt and likely delivering a death blow to the longest economic expansion on record.

The interplay between the outbreak and the steps meant to vanquish it reveals a cruel paradox: The faster and more painfully that ordinary economic life shuts down, the faster the health crisis can be solved and the faster people and businesses may gain the confidence to return to normal life.

Conversely, a prolonged period of fighting the virus would delay an economic rebound and imperil many small businesses.

Much, too, will depend on how swiftly and aggressively the Federal Reserve, Congress and the Trump administration deliver financial aid to tens of millions of economic victims — from hourly workers with no more income to suddenly furloughed employees to businesses with loans to pay but no customers.

Solving the health crisis by shutting down the economy, though, will have to come first.

Financial markets sank again Wednesday on fears about the economic damage. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down nearly 1,000 points in mid-morning trading. In another sign that the outbreak is severely disrupting business, Honda said it would shut down its North America plants for a week starting Monday.

Experts say the economy has deteriorated with stunning speed. And the United States is hardly alone: By all estimations, Europe is enduring its own recession, accelerated by the coronavirus’ epicentre in Italy.

In the U.S., waves of layoffs seem inevitable, especially in industries most vulnerable to an economic standstill: Travel, entertainment, hotels, restaurants, retail stores — the heart of the service sector, which makes up most of the economy.

476,2020/03/19,Coronavirus | Are diabetics more prone to COVID-19?,"Precautions a must as they have immuno-compromised state

Because of the present scare due to the COVID-19 infection, many people with diabetes have been contacting us asking whether people with diabetes are more prone to COVID-19. It is true that the people with diabetes are prone to all infections.

There are some emerging data to suggest that people with diabetes are also more prone to COVID-19. Moreover, even in those with infections such as COVID-19, which leads to pneumonia, the chances of a secondary bacterial infection complicating the viral pneumonia is there.

Hence, people with diabetes should take particular precautions with respect to COVID-19, as they already have a slightly immuno- compromised state.

What can be done?

As with everyone else, it is important to maintain good hygiene, especially frequent washing of hands with soap and water and also with a sanitizer, especially in a health care setting. If you know someone has cough, cold or fever, it is better to avoid contact with them.

Also read: Data | COVID-19 is deadliest for the elderly

The spread of the virus is known to be through droplet infection. Hence, if somebody with COVID-19 coughs or sneezes, you are likely to catch the infection. It is not necessary to wear a mask unless you already have an infection. However, if you have the infection you should wear a mask to prevent infecting others.

Special precaution

It is important to keep your blood sugar under good control. Any infection is likely to increase blood sugar levels and uncontrolled diabetes can further lead to worsening of the infection. Increased testing of the blood glucose levels with a glucometer or Continuous Glucose Monitoring may be necessary. If blood sugar levels are found to be very high, consult your doctor and bring your sugar levels under good control as quickly as possible.

Watch | Soap or sanitiser? Which works better?

Unless you have type 1 diabetes or severe insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes, wherein the sugar levels tend to go very high and signs of ketosis or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) develop, it is not necessary to get admitted to hospital.

Follow all the usual precautions like washing your hands with soap and water regularly and ‘social distancing’, i.e., keeping a distance from people who are likely to be infected.

Although spreading of the infection through a needle used for blood glucose testing or insulin injections is highly unlikely, it is better not to share your blood testing lancet or insulin needles with anybody else.

To summarise, all people with diabetes should be aware of the COVID-19 infection and avoid coming into contact with an infected person. If by chance, you have already developed the infection, please see that you keep yourself isolated and don’t infect other family members or people whom you may be in contact with. Most importantly, keep your diabetes under good control and seek medical attention as soon as possible.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/snr6tx/article31104976.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19MOHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-are-diabetics-more-prone-to-covid-19/article31104977.ece
477,2020/03/19,Coronavirus | FDA urges virtual patient visits,"COVID-19 disrupts clinical trials

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on March 18 recommended switching to virtual patient visits instead of in-person monitoring for clinical studies, as signs emerge that the rapid spread of the coronavirus outbreak is disrupting trials.

U.S.-based Iveric bio, Inc delayed enrolment in a trial of its eye disease drug on Wednesday, two days after Provention Bio paused a study of its diabetes drug but allowed trial patients to complete their course.

The companies said these measures were taken to ensure the safety of the patients being tested and the medical staff.

The FDA said the outbreak may impact clinical trials of products including drugs and devices, as travel limitations and other considerations cause protocol deviations.

The restrictions have begun to disrupt the global pharmaceutical industry, as companies cancel public meetings.

The Boston-based research group Institute for Clinical and Economic Review said on Wednesday it was postponing two public meetings to discuss therapies for sickle cell diseases and cystic fibrosis.

“Trials that are fully recruited and those involving the critically ill seem likely to go on without too much disruption,” UBS analyst Laura Sutcliffe said in a client note. “The situation is less clear for other trials, and several companies told us it is too early to tell if there will be any impact.”

478,2020/03/19,Coronavirus | The importance of ‘contact tracing’,"From the second phase, when local transmission takes place, it is an integral part of fighting the epidemic on the ground

With the Hyderabad techie reportedly spreading his infection to a large number of people that he came into contact with, the issue of tracing contacts becomes very crucial.

Beginning from the second phase of the epidemic — local transmission — which Indian Council of Medical Research Director-General (ICMR) Balram Bargava claims the nation is currently couched in, contact tracing is an integral part of fighting the epidemic on the ground.

Also read | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India | State Helpline numbers for COVID-19

Properly done, contact tracing and follow-up health interventions will ensure that the infection spread is limited and retard or stop the pace of the epidemic to the third stage — community transmission.

What is contact tracing?

Contact tracing is the process of identifying, assessing, and managing people who have been exposed to a disease to prevent transmission. As per ICMR guidelines, which are also directions that have sound public health sense behind them, people who may have been exposed to the virus are to be followed for 28 days from the date of the probable last exposure/arrival from affected countries.

Also Read All about COVID-19

Any person who has had contact with the index patient under investigation/treatment for suspected, probable or confirmed case of SARS-COV-2, should be monitored for the appearance of symptoms.

Who is a contact?

Anyone who provided care for the suspect or confirmed case, including a health care worker (including those involved in cleaning, waste management, laboratory technicians, doctors) or family member, or any one who had close physical contact; anyone who stayed at the same place (lived with, or visited) while the index patient was symptomatic.

If symptoms appear within the first 28 days following the contact, the individual should be considered a ‘probable’ case and reported through the Integrated Diseases Surveillance Programme network to the National Centre for Disease Control.

Tracing contacts

As soon as the single event (confirmed SARS-CoV-2) is detected, contact tracing must be aggressively implemented, and preferably to be completed within 48 hours.

The contact tracing shall preferably be done by visiting the local residence of the contact(s) by a member of the health services team. In certain circumstances or for follow-up, phone calls may be made too, as per the rules.

On meeting the ‘contact person’, the visiting health worker should explain the purpose of contact tracing and collect data in a prescribed format. It is important to identify the social networks of the first patient and travel history during the 28 days after the onset of illness.

Also read: Data | COVID-19 is deadliest for the elderly

The patient, his or her family members, colleagues, school or college mates are sources of information about the contacts, as are others with knowledge of the patient’s recent travel and activities.

Contacts should be traced and monitored for at least 28 days after the last exposure to the case patient for evidence of COVID-19 symptoms to emerge. Case-wise line listing of all exposed contacts will be maintained, with the following information: demographic information, date of last exposure or date of contact with the case patient, and date of onset of fever or other symptoms, if any.

Symptomatic contacts

Persons who have fever and cough and a history of contact with a confirmed case within the last 28 days should be referwred for isolation for strict infection control.

Also read: Are diabetics more prone to COVID-19?

Samples must be collected and sent to the designated laboratory for testing, and appropriate wmedical management must begin. If contacts show symptoms, they may be isolated at a health care facility or at home until the results come in. Once confirmed as positive for SARS-CoV-2, they must be shifted to a proper health facility.

Asymptomatic contacts

They must remain at home (home quarantine) for at least 28 days after the last exposure with the patient. The contacts should start monitoring their health and watch for symptoms of fever and cough, within 28 days of the last exposure to the patient, and maintain a list of people they are in contact with, on a daily basis.

If he or she develops symptoms, as defined, the contact must wear a mask, self-isolate at home, and inform the local health authority. For 28 days after this, health officials will do an active monitoring of these people.

Health workers

The rules also require the health officials to follow certain precautions while they meet contacts. They are required to maintain a distance of at least two metres from the contact, wear masks, and maintain standard infection prevention and control measures, especially hand-washing.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/j9nldp/article31104905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHENNAIAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-the-importance-of-contact-tracing/article31104907.ece
479,2020/03/19,COVID-19 pandemic could make another 25 million jobless,"It will slash incomes, says UN

The COVID-19 pandemic will significantly increase global unemployment, leaving up to 25 million more people out of work, and will dramatically slash workers’ incomes, the United Nations said Wednesday.

The International Labour Organization warned that the economic and labour crisis sparked by the coronavirus will have “far-reaching impacts on labour market outcomes”. “This is no longer a global health crisis, it is also a major labour market and economic crisis that is having a huge impact on people,” ILO chief Guy Ryder said in a statement.

The UN agency’s study suggested the world should prepare to see a “significant rise in unemployment and underemployment in the wake of the virus”.

Presenting different scenarios depending on how quickly and with what level of coordination governments react, it found that even in the best-case scenario, 5.3 million more people will be pushed into unemployment. At the high end meanwhile, 24.7 million more will become jobless, on top of the 188 million registered as unemployed in 2019.

Also read: Data | COVID-19 is deadliest for the elderly

“By comparison, the 2008-9 global financial crisis increased global unemployment by 22 million,” the ILO said.

It warned that “underemployment is also expected to increase on a large scale, as the economic consequences of the virus outbreak translate into reductions in working hours and wages.”

$3.4 trillion in lost income?

Self-employment in developing countries, which often serves to cushion the impact of economic shifts, might not do so this time due to the severe restrictions being placed on the movement of people and goods.

Reductions in access to work will also mean “large income losses for workers,” ILO said.

“The study estimates these as being between $860 billion and $3.4 trillion by the end of 2020,” it said, warning that “this will translate into falls in consumption of goods and services, in turn affecting the prospects for businesses and economies.”

The number of people who live in poverty despite holding one or more jobs will also increase significantly, the study said, estimating that between 8.8 and 35 million more people will be added to the ranks of the working poor.

“The strain on incomes resulting from the decline in economic activity will devastate workers close to or below the poverty line,” it said.

The ILO called for urgent, large-scale and coordinated measures to protect workers in the workplace, stimulate the economy and employment and support jobs and income, including through social protections, paid leave and other subsidies.

The agency pointed out that some groups will be disproportionately impacted by the jobs crisis, including youth, older workers, women and migrants, in a way that could increase already soaring inequality.

“In 2008, the world presented a united front to address the consequences of the global financial crisis, and the worst was averted,” Mr. Ryder pointed out.

“We need that kind of leadership and resolve now.”",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/5sqyk2/article31104434.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRUSOUTBREAKUNEMPLOYMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-could-make-another-25-million-jobless/article31104436.ece
480,2020/03/19,Coronavirus: WHO does not recommend against the use of ibuprofen,"We are not aware of reports of any negative effects, says the global body

In two tweets on March 19, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that based on scientific information currently available, the WHO “does not recommend against the use of ibuprofen” to bring down a fever in people. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The global body also said: “WHO is aware of concerns on the use of ibuprofen for the treatment of fever for people with COVID-19. We are consulting with physicians treating the patients and are not aware of reports of any negative effects, beyond the usual ones that limit its use in certain populations.”







According to a letter published on March 11 in the journal The Lancet, the authors had claimed without providing any data that certain drugs, including ibuprofen, increase the number of ACE2 receptors on human cells that novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) use to gain entry into epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidney, and blood vessels. The letter also said that diabetes increases the number of ACE2 receptors.

Since in theory, ibuprofen increases the number of ACE2 receptors on human cells. So patients taking the drug might be more vulnerable to infection with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The letter also said ACE-2-stimulating drugs “increase the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19”.

Letters published in any journal, The Lancet included, are not peer-reviewed. Hence, any claims made in a letter should be treated with abundant caution.

“It’s all anecdote, and fake news off the anecdotes,” Dr. Garret FitzGerald, chair of the department of pharmacology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania told The New York Times. “Until there is evidence, there is no reason at all to be issuing public health guidance” about non-sterooidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the coronavirus.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/j8upiz/article31107181.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE12MED,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/coronavirus-who-does-not-recommend-against-the-use-of-ibuprofen-to-bring-down-a-fever/article31107093.ece
