0,['10/01/2020'],I am inspired by CM Jagan Mohan Reddy: Veerandra Chowdhary,"Actor, producer and Namitha ’s husband Veerandra Chowdhary has made his television debut with Uyire, in which he is playing the lead. “I really wasn’t keen on working in television serials. But, when I heard the script of Uyire, I was fascinated and watched all the episodes of its Hindi version (Choti Sarrdaarni), which was quite impressive. So, I decided to take this up,” he says.Veera plays Sezhiyan , a politician, in the serial. He elaborates, “Sezhiyan is different from other politicians we see in films or television. More than a politician, he is someone who lives for his family. He is kind, well-behaved and cares for people around him. The character I play in this serial is 80 per cent similar to me in real life. I’m inspired by CM of Andhra Pradesh, Jagan Mohan Reddy. In fact, he is a role model for me for this particular role. I watch his speeches.”So, how has the experience been like? “I hail from a political background. I can say that politics is in my blood. I’ve seen people discussing politics every day. From day one of shoot, I adapted the characteristics of Sezhiyan. So, it is not tough for me to work on it,” he says.Meanwhile, the actor is also doing a Telugu show and two films in Tamil, directed by T Rajhendherr and Yezhumalai respectively. Ask him how he plans to juggle both TV and films, and Veera says, “Television is a long-term commitment. The audience will see you on a daily basis and you will become one among them. But I’ll continue to do films and also take up serials. I don’t feel it’s a burden because I enjoy balancing both.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73173127,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-287219/73173127.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/tamil/i-am-inspired-by-cm-jagan-mohan-reddy/articleshow/73173127.cms
1,['10/01/2020'],I was worried I’d fall and push Vijay to the ground: Bhumika Chawla,"My tryst with modelling began when I’d done a print ad for a computer brand. I used to go for auditions and soon landed the opportunity to do a few TVCs — including a beauty brand and a jewellery brand. I think people started noticing me, and I was cast in the music video, Masoom Tera Chehra. It was by Kumar Sanu , and we’d shot at a farm in Panvel, Mumbai. In the interim, I continued to do more ads. One of them — for a toffee brand — was shot by Priyadarshan in Switzerland. I was both nervous and excited about travelling abroad alone for the first time. In a way, that ad was also a life-changer because the makers of Yuvakudu saw me in that and called me for a screen test. They held a test twice in Mumbai and I missed it both the times. So, I was called to Annapurna Studios.It was September 6, 1996, and I was on my first trip alone to Hyderabad. I didn’t know what to expect, and went with the attitude that ‘If the movie clicks, good, and if not, I at least get to travel to Hyderabad’. But I guess that film was in my destiny. One thing led to another, and the makers of Badri saw me in my Telugu film and signed me on. It was a wonderful experience, working with Vijay and director Arun. I don’t exactly remember my first shot for the film, but I do remember this particular shot I gave for the song Kadhal Solvadhu.We were shooting in Switzerland, and for a particular shot, I had to climb on Vijay’s back. I was nervous and worried that I would fall and also push him to the ground. But luckily, no such thing happened (laughs)! Vijay is a good co-star to work with, very humble and always willing to help. During that schedule, he was talking to me about his film, Kushi, and how he liked the way it had turned out, but was also nervous about its release. Little did I think then that in the time to come, I would be a part of its Telugu remake! Like I said, one good thing led to another, the makers of Tere Naam (Hindi remake of Sethu) had seen me in Kushi and cast me in the Hindi film. The production house was the one I worked with for the toffee ad I shot with Priyadarshan. Life had come a full circle at that point, and I can’t stop thinking how kind God has been to me!",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73172892,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-766806/73172892.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/i-was-worried-id-fall-and-push-vijay-to-the-ground-bhumika-chawla/articleshow/73172892.cms

3,['10/01/2020'],"With Sharanya opting out, Airaa girl Gabrella bags the lead role in N4","Director Lokesh Kumar ’s independent film N4 has been seeing a lot of changes, especially when it comes to its lead heroine. First, it was Vani Bhojan who was supposed to play the lead. Later, she had to opt out and Sharanya Turadi stepped in. And now, the filmmaker, who made the acclaimed My Son Is Gay, has roped in Airaa girl Gabrella Sellus to play the lead in this thriller, which is set in Kasimedu.Ask him about these frequent changes and Lokesh says, “When it is an independent film, the actors need to give a considerable amount of time for the film. Like Vani, Sharanya, too, had to opt out owing to date issues. We eventually roped in Gabrella, who played young Nayanthara in Airaa. She is a mime artiste and I have seen one of her short films. I thought I should launch her as a lead actor after seeing her acting prowess. She also does a lot of social awareness videos through her social media account.”However, his other principal cast — Michael Thangadurai, Pragya Nagra and Anupama Kumar — are very much part of the film, adds Lokesh, who has finished shooting for the film. The filmmaker has also roped in YouTuber Subhalaxmi Parida, who plays a comical role as a fisherwoman. Akshay Kamal, who is acting in the TV serial Rettai Roja, will also be seen in a crucial role. “Akshay plays Pragya’s pair in the film, while Michael and Gabrella play another couple. There are over 10 new faces in this film,” says the director.The team is currently busy with the post production work and Lokesh says he is hopeful of getting the film released by mid-2020.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73172562,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-141534/73172562.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/with-sharanya-opting-out-airaa-girl-gabrella-bags-the-lead-role-in-nh4/articleshow/73172562.cms
4,['10/01/2020'],The Amithias Project to debut in Bengaluru this month,"A decade-long Indo-German friendship has translated into a musical collaboration, called The Amithias Project. The ensemble — led by Indian flautist Amith Nadig and Germany’s Matthias Schriefl, who plays the trumpet and flugal horn — is ready for its first-ever concert in Bengaluru later this month. The other members of the band are Vinod Shyam Anoor (on mridangam ), Sunaad Anoor (on kanjira ) and Bharatanatyam dancer Nivedita Sharma. Amith first met Matthias in Bengaluru, in 2009. The latter used to visit India annually to learn the nuances of Carnatic music. Eventually, the two artistes connected over their passion for Indian classical music. “I was happy to meet a person who understood our country’s music so well. Matthias also made an effort to know me as a musician. This bond, in turn, helped us work together. From being inspired by Indian classical music to working on German folk music and jazz elements, we felt like we were breaking barriers through our music,” says Amith.The duo worked together for a long time before deciding to collaborate. “Most of our original compositions are based on the kind of experiences we share. For example, we have a song, titled Roaming Bangalore, which was conceived when Matthias and I were enjoying some local street food in the city. The spicy food, walking around the city streets and interacting with local people inspired Matthias to write the song,” says Amith.Explaining about the Bharatanatyam element in the collaboration, Amith says, “It all began when my wife Niveditha danced along when we were jamming. The way her dance steps matched our tunes without any practice enabled us to add this new dimension to our project. And the rest of the elements fell in place almost immediately. We both agree that percussion played a big role in bringing our music together,” Amith sums up.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73171305,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-288498/73171305.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/music/the-amithias-project-to-debut-in-bengaluru-this-month/articleshow/73171281.cms
5,['10/01/2020'],We’ve been asked not to leave campus: Jyothi Nivas College students,"This story is from January 10, 2020



Armed with pro-CAA banners and petitions that they wanted students of Jyothi Nivas College (JNC), Bengaluru, to sign, a group of CAA supporters from Bengaluru featured in a video in which they were seen arguing with the girls from the college. The students wanted them to pull down the banners, and refused to be forced to sign the said petition. The video, which went viral on social media by the evening of January 8, 2020, shows the girls also being questioned on their patriotism, and threatened for speaking up — and allegedly even stating that the college will see a recap of what happened at Delhi’s JNU and Jamia Milia. Bengaluru’s student population, which has until now been restrained from voicing out political opinions, took to social media to protest this latest development.

A day later, on January 9, 2020, when the students of JNC set out to hold a protest against the incidents of the day before, they were forced to stop two minutes after they began their peaceful protest. A student from the college informed us, “I do not know what is happening. We have been asked not to leave the campus; authorities have asked all students to remain indoors.” Teachers and college authorities refrained from commenting at the time of going to press. “We have been asked not to divulge any details until further notice,” said a teacher on condition of anonymity.

6,['10/01/2020'],"I do not want to be a politician, I will never stand for elections: Upendra","On day 1 of January 2020, while everybody was sending out Happy New Year wishes, Kannada star Upendra uploaded a video in which he wished his followers for Karnataka Rajyotsava. While the day is celebrated on November 1 every year, Upendra firmly believes that Kannadigas, and everyone who lives in Karnataka, should start the year with Kannada. Meanwhile, the actor, who has been the founder of a political party over the last few years, tells us as a matter of fact, “I do not want to be a politician, I will not contest elections, and I am not interested in any kind of position in the government.” What then is this concept that he has been propagating so passionately in all his free time? Excerpts…It was a sincere attempt to see if we can begin the new year with Kannada. November 1 is when we celebrate Karnataka Rajyotsava, but rather than restricting celebrations to just that day, we should aim at becoming number 1 Kannadigas. Keeping that in mind, I wished people for a year full of Kannada — whether it is speaking the language or teaching others to speak it, or just celebrating our culture. There are a lot of people around who know the language, but hesitate to speak it, probably because they worry they might make grammatical mistakes. If we refrain from poking fun at their attempts, and encourage them, instead, a lot more may start speaking Kannada.I floated this party for a different purpose. Once someone floats a political party, it is assumed that the person intends to pursue a career as a politician. We need to break that mindset. I am not interested in contesting elections or being a politician. I am a citizen of this country, and in my capacity, I am doing my bit to bring about a change. What I have done is to create a platform — something that not everybody can do. The intention is to inculcate the ideology behind this concept.The main purpose is to hand over power, of change, and to bring in change, to people. For instance, if I have the power, there are more chances of me becoming corrupt. I should not have that kind of power. With the technology that we have today, we can bring about progressive and positive changes at the micro level. For instance, we have introduced a process called the Standard Operating Procedure — by which those who join the party are introduced to the process of connecting with people and understanding their needs and demands. After that, they have to work out how to meet those demands in the best way possible through discussions with experts in the areas concerned, put out this plan to the people and explain the way forward. People should be able to see and decide which of these solutions work best for them. The solutions must then be executed according to set timelines with complete transparency of the system. Today, we have the block-chain technology, which assures you of transparency at all levels. In the end, a poll should be conducted on whether the job was done well or not. If it was good, then the person should be allowed to continue functioning and, if not, he/she must resign. If this procedure is followed in every aspect of governance, the city is bound to grow. Earlier, people used vote for a particular political party, which then changed and became about the individual contesting elections. What I am asking for here is for people to go a step further — look at the issues they are facing and see who has the best ideas and the process to fix them; and then, vote for them.People have this need to follow a leader; someone who will take charge and fix their lives. This expectation is based on a myth. It is wrong to wait for someone to bring in change. You should be the change; get involved. The issue is also that politics is a business. If I have spent crores of rupees on election campaigns and won, I will look at earning more out of it. Why will I bother about bringing in transparency in the way I function after that? I want people to not treat this like a business. The government allots about `10,000 crores as a budget for the 198 wards that we have here. So, one ward gets approximately `50 crore. In five years, each ward, therefore, gets `250 crore. Imagine the changes you can bring about with that kind of money. But if we make that a personal business, where you need to recover money spent on getting yourself elected, then, where is the scope for development or change? Unfortunately, it is a situational issue, because people believe they cannot win an election without investing money. I’m not blaming anyone here. I am looking at accountability. If my film is not good, it is thrown out of the theatres. In any other profession too, if you do not do your job well, you are fired. That does not hold good for politicians.I have great faith in the youngsters of our country — they are demanding change. Politicians give people a manifesto — a list of promises of changes they will bring about. But they don’t do anything. If there is no legal binding for a manifesto, there is no accountability. If I have given a manifesto, it should be registered in a court of law; and if I have not delivered, I should not remain in that position. That does not happen. So, let’s not have a manifesto at all. Let the manifesto be based on what people need. For instance, if I am a leader, I decide what the people around me need. But what I think may not be what they need. An individual gets involved in what concerns him, be it his immediate environment, his kid’s school or traffic jams around his place. Similarly, if an individual gets involved with what concerns society, then he can bring in a difference. In that sense, I think there has been a change. We may not be able to see it right now, because there is no ‘show and tell’ that people are used to seeing. But it is taking place at micro levels. I am trying and people are supporting this with a certain amount of honesty. When I visit colleges, and speak about these ideas to students, they tell me, ‘If you contest elections, we will vote for you’. That is not the point here; it is not up to me to be a leader. It is up to each individual to bring in change. I see the change taking place, a future in which elections are not about a political party, but are based on issues and solutions. It will happen.This is not about success of failure. I am doing this for my own satisfaction. Many people have advised me to change my strategy, to collect funds and go on processions across the state. Now, if I start travelling all over the state, I will only have people taking selfies with me. There will be no real impact and people will not understand the concept that I am trying to drive. See, when you are offered a drink, you welcome it. When you are offered medicine, you don’t like it much. In such a scenario, what I am advising here is ayurvedic medicine, which takes time before one can see results. One day, when the issues are way too much to handle, you will have to get back here and attend to the root cause of the problem.Education and health are two areas that are extremely important — there is a definite need for attention here. Apart from these, take the example of how drip irrigation was introduced in areas that have water scarcity – each plant gets the right amount of water, while ensuring no water goes waste. Right now, despite the burgeoning population in our country, the budgets allocated for these numbers are on the decline. We need ways to address the needs of people, in spite of the economic challenges that we are faced with.Electing the wrong person and protesting after that is foolish. Do not let corruption get the better of you on the voting day and do not look at who is giving you more money, or which caste or religion a candidate belongs to. If you are swayed by factors that do not matter, where is democracy? Vote for ideology. What is government service all about? Should they not work towards ensuring that people do not have to protest? Everybody knows what is happening is wrong, but that does not mean we accept it like helpless people. When you know something is wrong, change it. There is no point in cribbing about which leader is to blame for what went wrong. There are issues, and they will keep cropping up. One issue crops up, people hold protests and polls, and try to change that. By the time you highlight one issue, there is already another that you need to address and hold protests about. That is the difference in ‘Prajakeeya’ and ‘Rajakeeya’. Rajakeeya is one person saying, ‘I know everything, except what people want’. Prajakeeya is about knowing only that what people say they want.People have asked me why I make appearances on the political front only during elections. But that is how it should be. I have my job, which I need to attend to. And there are politicians who have been elected, who have a job as well. They need to be answerable to all the promises they have made. It’s like hiring a driver and paying him for his job, but still asking another driver to come in and have him do the same job to see if I should hire the second one or not.Irrespective of which party makes up the government, people have always had issues with the way it functions. The bigger issue here is that we, as individuals, need to correct ourselves. Take, for the Swachh Bharat Mission. Do we, as individuals, keep our surroundings clean? We don’t follow the basic step, but don’t think twice about commenting on whether the government is doing its bit about it or not. What someone else does is secondary; first we need to look at whether you and I, as individuals, are doing the right thing. There is so much hatred. If I hate another religion, someone else will hate my religion too. But is that what we are as a country? The beauty of India is the unity we have in diversity, isn’t it?",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73173413,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-276615/73173413.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/i-do-not-want-to-be-a-politician-i-will-never-stand-for-elections-upendra/articleshow/73173413.cms

CHENNAI: Internet shutdowns in India are not just disruptions in routine and individual freedom, but are also having an economic impact on the country. Around 4,196 hours of internet blackouts in India cost the economy close to $1.3 billion in 2019, finds a study by UK-based tech research firm Top10Vpn.India was the third worst-hit economy worldwide after crisis-hit Iraq and Sudan thanks to state-imposed shut downs across Jammu & Kashmir, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Rajasthan, UP and other regions, shows the report. An average of 8.4 million internet users were impacted across the multiple incidents, it said.The economic impact is likely to be higher, the study adds, given that the study only assessed large region-wide blackouts and India's smaller and more localised shutdowns weren't included.""There were more internet shutdowns in 2019 than ever before,"" Samuel Woodhams and Simon Migliano, authors of the report by Top10Vpn told TOI in an email. ""As for India, the frequency of disruptions still far surpasses any other country we analysed and, unless swift action is taken to reduce the number and duration of disruptions, the economic impact is likely to continue to rise,"" they added.The vast majority of internet shutdowns in India in 2019 were highly localised and short-lived, but the costliest disruption occurred in Kashmir, where the shutdown remains ongoing.""The shutdown in Kashmir is one of the longest internet shutdowns to have ever occurred and cost the Indian economy nearly $1.1 billion in 2019,"" Woodhams and Migliano said. It has hurt the economy, impacted local healthcare services, freedom of the press and education in the region.The clampdown of internet services in the northeast in relation to the Citizenship Amendment Act resulted in around $102 million of economic impact, and the restrictions in Uttar Pradesh led to a $63 million hit.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73179331,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-71776,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-lost-1-3bn-due-to-4196-hours-of-no-internet/articleshow/73179287.cms

(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: Reliance Infrastructure (RInfra) has got in-principle nod from the National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) for sale of Delhi-Agra toll road to Cube Highways and Infrastructure for Rs 3,600 crore, an RInfra official said on Thursday.

RInfra will utilise the proceeds to reduce debt.

""Reliance Infrastructure has received the in-principle approval for Harmonious Substitution in the Delhi-Agra (DA) toll road project on January 7 from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI)... Reliance Infrastructure will receive an enterprise value of Rs 3,600 crore including equity of up to Rs 1,700 crore,"" the RInfra official said.

This approval paves the way to close the sale of the 180-km 6-lane Delhi-Agra toll road to Cube Highways and Infrastructure III Pte Ltd, which is owned by a Singapore-based Global Infrastructure Fund, I Squared Capital, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the official said.

The entire proceeds will be used by Reliance Infrastructure to pay lenders and reduce the debt of the company, the official said.

This is in line with the commitment made by Reliance Infrastructure to its 16 lenders on July 6, 2019, when lenders signed an inter-creditor agreement for resolution of debt and granted moratorium to the company on the interest and principal payments.

Reliance Infrastructure, which has a total debt of Rs 6,000 crore, is on track to reduce leverage even further as it focuses to be an asset- and capital-light entity, the company had said in September last year.

Addressing the shareholders at the company's annual general meeting, its chairman Anil Ambani had said, ""Our intent is to reduce the debt further. At present, we have around Rs 6,000 crore of debt but with a large networth,"" adding that the company will focus on the domestic market and take up more complex infrastructure and transportation projects.

16,['10/01/2020'],CCI probes complaint against Maruti,"This story is from January 10, 2020

NEW DELHI: India's antitrust regulator is looking into allegations that Maruti Suzuki pushes buyers to purchase insurance policies offered by the company, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) in June last year received an anonymous complaint alleging insurance plans recommended by Maruti while selling cars resulted in customers paying more compared with other options in the market. Based on the complaint, the CCI is assessing whether Maruti has engaged in so-called ""tie-in arrangements"", in which a car maker promotes preferred suppliers of complementary goods such as lubricants or insurance, the sources said.

Indian law says such practices are anti-competitive if they end up stifling competition and limiting consumer choices. The Commission is looking into the complaint and ""it will take a while"", said one of the two sources, who declined to be named as the case details are private.

In response to Reuters questions, a Maruti spokesman said, ""We are not aware of any such alleged complaint that is being investigated by CCI and therefore cannot comment on the same.""

The CCI did not respond to a request for comment.

17,['10/01/2020'],'Sterling &amp; Wilson must offer small investors exit',"This story is from January 10, 2020

(Representative image)

BENGALURU: Proxy advisory firm InGovern Research has come out with a report on Sterling & Wilson Solar. It has asked promoters Shapoorji Pallonji Group to provide an exit option for minority shareholders, citing the change in schedule debt repayments from the proceeds of the IPO, which was an offer for sale by the promoters.

InGovern said minority shareholders have lost Rs 1,700 crore as the share price has slipped from Rs 780 to Rs 310 as of January 6 this year. It added that the company's board and audit committee should be held liable for failure to protect the public shareholders.

Sterling and Wilson hit back at the report, calling it ""malicious, misleading, defamatory"" and adding that ""sensationalism in this report is more an attempt to further erode investor wealth"".

The development comes at a time when SP Group's Cyrus Mistry has questioned corporate governance at Tata Sons after an NCLAT ruling came in his favour last month.

Sterling and Wilson was listed in August 2019 as the largest public offering last year, fetching SP Group promoters Rs 2,850 crore. According to the prospectus, of the total amount, Rs 2,563 crore was to be used to pay inter-corporate debt by November 18 to make the company debt-free. But the SP Group missed the payments due to the liquidity crisis and has now come up with a new schedule to pay the amount in three more tranches by September 2020. It paid Rs 1,000 crore by December 31, with the remaining amount yet to be paid.

""In this case, where shareholders have suffered significant erosion in value of their holdings solely due to non-utilisation of funds as per the objects of offer of the IPO, Sebi must force the promoters to provide an exit offer to shareholders at a price as per Sebi (ICDR) Regulations,"" InGovern said. It added that minority shareholders have a strong case in their hands if they file a class-action suit.

Sterling and Wilson has countered by saying that the promoters were under ""no obligation to mention the utilisation of proceeds"" and there is no legal default. The company board ""levied additional interest of 100 basis points"" because of rescheduling in payments and ""it is illogical to link the stock price reduction"" just to the delay in payment. Sterling and Wilson share price closed at Rs 322, up by about 5% on NSE on Thursday.

20,['10/01/2020'],Credit flows to commercial sector dip to 8.1% in July-September,"This story is from January 10, 2020

(Representative image)

MUMBAI: Credit to the commercial sector slowed to 8.1% for the quarter ended September 2019, which is half the 16.2% growth rate recorded for the period December 2017 to December 2018. It is also significantly lower than the 14.8% year-on-year growth in June 2019 over the corresponding period last year.

According to a report brought out by TransUnion Cibil and SIDBI, commercial credit, which has been steadily growing over the past few years, has slowed down in the past few quarters. The total on-balance sheet commercial lending exposure in India is Rs 65 lakh crore in September 2019.

The MSME segment (loans up to Rs 50 crore), constitutes Rs 18.3 lakh crore outstanding (28% of commercial credit). Large firms with aggregated credit exposure of over Rs 50 crore account for Rs 46.7 lakh crore (72% of commercial credit outstanding). Micro (less than Rs 1 crore), small (Rs 1-15 crore) and medium (Rs 15-50 crore) segments showed a YoY growth of 7.7%, 4.6%, 1.9% respectively for the period September 2018 to September 2019.

On the positive side, the overall non-performing assets (NPAs) of commercial lending fell marginally to 16.8% in September 2019, from 17% in September 2018. Gross NPA amount increased from Rs 10.2 lakh crore in September 2018 to Rs 10.9 lakh crore in September 2019. Gross NPAs in commercial lending hit a peak of 17.5% in June 2018, but because of reform measures, fell to 16.8%. In MSMEs, NPAs increased from 11.7% in September 2018 to 12.2% in September 2019.

23,['10/01/2020'],He/she are not enough.‘They’ becomes word of the decade,"They won the year. And the decade. Literally. Last week, the American Dialect Society crowned the singular pronoun ‘they’ as the word of the decade. The word, which is increasingly becoming popular as the pronoun of choice among those who don’t conform to the he/she binary, has become a “vital indicator of social trends”. Ben Zimmer, chair of the American Dialect Society’s new words committee, said, “When a basic part of speech like pronouns becomes a vital indicator of social trends, linguists pay attention. The selection of ‘(my) pronouns’ as word of the year speaks to how the personal expression of gender identity has become an increasing part of our shared discourse. The same trend is also reflected in singular ‘they’ being chosen as word of the decade.” However, this is not the first time that ‘they’ popped up as the most popular word. Last month, Merriam-Webster also chose ‘they’ as the word of the year. While the growing recognition of the word is a step towards gender inclusivity, when and how did this four-letter word end up being the word of the decade? And how did it go from being a pronoun to being an indicator of social trends?While the focus on gender inclusivity is still not in the mainstream discourse in several parts of the world, gender inclusivity has become a focus for multiple brands. In 2019, both Apple and Google launched gender ambiguous emojis. Another company launched a virtual assistant, who unlike Siri or Alexa, has an ambiguous voice. Many scholars credit this trend of being ‘gender woke’ to social media, which has provided a platform for people to openly talk about their gender identities and for the discourse to pick up pace.Merriam-Webster chose ‘they’ as their word of the year based on data that showed searches for the definition of “they” on the publisher’s website and apps increased by 313% in 2019 over the previous year. “With the word’s non-binary usage, people are sensing that it means something new or different, and they are going to the dictionary. When you see look-ups for it triple, you know that they is a word that is in flux,” said Peter Sokolowski, an editor-at-large at Merriam-Webster.In an interview with an entertainment magazine, Fantastic Beasts’ Ezra Miller said, ""I don’t identify as a man. I don’t identify as a woman. I barely identify as a human.""In an interview with an LGBTQIA+ entertainment and lifestyle magazine, Jonathan Van Ness from Queer Eye, said, “The older I get, the more I think that I’m non-binary – I’m gender nonconforming. Some days I feel like a man, other days I feel like a woman. Any opportunity I have to break down stereotypes of the binary, I’m here for it.”After sharing that they/them makes them comfortable, The Hunger Games’ Amandla Stenberg said that they were fine with she/her since people wouldn't understand their choice. She also shared that they’d like to begin using they/them pronouns, saying. “I’m allowed to explore myself and how I see myself in the world however the f*** I want.”In September 2019, singer-songwriter Sam Smith announced on social media, “After a lifetime of being at war with my gender, I’ve decided to embrace myself for who I am, inside and out. I’m so excited and privileged to be surrounded by people that support me.” Smith continued, “I am at no stage just yet to eloquently speak at length about what it means to be non-binary but I can’t wait for the day that I am.”While she goes by she, Ruby Rose refers to herself as gender fluid. “For the most part, I definitely don’t identify as any gender. I’m not a guy; I don’t really feel like a woman, but obviously I was born one. So, I’m somewhere in the middle, which is like having the best of both sexes,” she said in an interview with a fashion magazine.This expression refers to the protests over increasing police brutality against African Americans in the USA. The movement gained momentum after innocent black teenagers were fatally shot by white police officers.While it didn’t win word of the decade, climate emergency won oxford dictionaries’ word of the year title. 2019 saw worldwide protests against the climate crisis, which were primarily inspired by Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg. while 2019 saw wild fires ravage across the amazon forest and California, the rest of the decade witnessed extreme temperatures, melting icebergs and consequent rising sea levels.Founded by Tarana Burke in 2006, the MeToo movement began as a social phenomenon in October 2017 as a hashtag started by Alyssa Milano who shared her story of sexual assault against Harvey Weinstein.From Mark Zuckerberg and people eating detergent to salt bae, Harambe and Ok boomer, the decade saw a meme for almost everything that happened around the world.When out of words, use an emoji! From being limited as a small, yellow coloured icon, the decade saw emojis getting creative, racially diverse and gender inclusive.There are even songs about it. Whether in front of the Mona Lisa at the Louvre, the pyramids in Egypt or while chillin’ with exotic animals, in the age of social media, selfies have shown no signs of slowing down.The word refers to someone who is socially aware, especially about issues of racial and social injustice. The word woke became entwined with the Black Lives Matter movement; instead of just being a word that signaled awareness of injustice, it became a word of action.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73172523,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-772043/73172523.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/he/she-are-not-enough-they-becomes-word-of-the-decade/articleshow/73172569.cms

Pallavi Gupta, Siddharth Arora and Aastha Chaudhary (BCCL/ Arvind Kumar)

Three is a company, that too a great one, was proved by actor Siddharth Arora of Mukti Bandhan fame, who hosted Aastha Chaudhary , seen in teleshows like Kesari Nandan, and Sufiyana Pyaar Mera actor Pallavi Gupta on their recent trip to Varanasi, his hometown. The trio had a great time roaming about in the city.“Both Pallavi and I wanted to come to Banaras for quite some time as I had heard a lot about the place but somehow the plan was not materialising and we had to cancel our visit several times. When Siddharth, who hails from the city, heard about it he suggested that why don’t we celebrate Pallavi’s birthday in Banaras. So this is how we eventually managed to come here and I must say it has been an amazing experience,” said Aastha, for whom it was her first time in Banaras.For Pallavi, it was her second trip but that too a decade ago. “I had come to Banaras in 2009 for the shooting of teleshow Hum Ladakiyan during which we had shot on all the ghats and also in Banaras Hindu University for two months. So this trip had a lot of nostalgia of the time spent here ten years back. The memories of my earlier trip came rushing back, especially when I went to Assi Ghat where our major shooting happened. Not much has changed in the city except that it has become much more cleaner,” she said.Pallavi Gupta, Siddharth Arora and Aastha Chaudhary (BCCL/ Arvind Kumar)Really touched by the gesture of Siddharth who had arranged for the celebration of her birthday on a boat in the midst of river Ganga, Pallavi said, “It was the most ethereal experience. Siddharth is my rakhi brother, we played brother and sister in the show Na Bole Tum Na Maine Kuch Kaha, and since then we have a brother –sister bonding. I don’t have a brother in real life so Siddharth is like my brother. I cannot describe how I was feeling while cutting the cake on a boat, it was just amazing. There are certain things which money cannot buy and this was exactly was one of them.”Siddharth made sure that his guests did not miss out on anything for which Banaras is famous for. “We went to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple , had a magical boat ride and also did everything the Banarasis loves doing. I even took them for a midnight malai toast and chai treat at Lakshmi Chai in Chowk,” said Siddharth .“That too in my night dress,” chipped in Aastha with a laugh. “We also enjoyed the Banarasi street food like kachori sabzi, jalebi, lassi, tamatar chaat and even paan. Everything was so yummy,” she added.Self-proclaimed shopaholics both Aastha and Pallavi went back with bags full of Banarasi saris, dupatta, achar and papad among other things.Aastha said, “Wherever I go, I make it a point to buy a sari for my mother. She has saris from all the places I have visited so far. A Banarasi sari will now add to her collection as I have bought some for her while for myself I have bought some beautiful Banarasi duppattas.”Even Pallavi made sure that she bought a good collection of Banarasi duppatas. “Since I don’t wear saris neither does my mother, so I have bought a variety of duppattas.

All this while I had been praying for a grand start on TV and thankfully Shubharambh happened,” says Akshit who was in Lucknow, recently. Ask him about his modelling experience, and Akshit says he was not quite happy with it. “I was earlier into print modelling for several brands. I knew ki long run mein modelling can not be a career option. Modelling has a very short shelf life. Jab tak shakal hai tab tak only you can be a model but acting has nothing to do with shakal. The moment models start getting wrinkles on their face, their career is over. Male models ka toh industry mein aur bhi bura haal hai but main zyada depth mein iss topic pe toh nahi jana chahunga. Work wise also, the industry is still more female dominated. My modelling experience has not been that great, especially in Delhi. Bahut time waste kiya hai mera logon ne kaam dilane ke naame pe.”But modelling has given Akshit a memorable experience. “I remember when the class XII results were announced, jahaan mere school ke toppers ki chhoti-chhoti picture newspaper mein aayi thi, my print ad was there in the newspapers with a huge picture of mine. So that was a really memorable experience for me, which made my dream of becoming an actor one day more sure,” he says.Akshit recently promoted his debut show on Bigg Boss with Salman Khan . “Meeting Salman sir was a really big deal for a newcomer like me. Backstage, I was nervous. And the moment I shared the stage with him, I was told my blazer is shinning on the camera and so it had to be removed. And Salman sir was like ki isko meri jacket de do.

And now, the film’s first song, which releases today, promises to take their on-screen vibe a notch higher. Titled ' Chal Ghar Chalen ', the track brings together director Mohit Suri and composer Mithoon once again. The two have delivered quite a few hits earlier, including 'Tum Hi Ho' ('Aashiqui 2') and 'Phir Bhi Tumko Chaahunga' ('Half Girlfriend'). 'Chal Ghar Chalen' has been written by Sayeed Quadri and Arijit Singh has lent his voice to the melody.Mithoon shares, “Every single person wants to return home in the end. Home is a feeling — it could be a place, a room, or even a person. 'Chal Ghar Chalen' reflects this thought, which everyone will connect with. Mohit’s concept and Sayeed Quadri’s poetry make this track special for me. It is pivotal to the storyline. We chose Arijit to sing it because we go back a long way and he understands the true meaning of what it means to return home. His voice has the capability to capture the emotional essence of the song.”Mohit adds, “Four walls make a house, but your soulmate makes it a home. A place you can come back to, a place that embraces and loves you, and tells you that no matter what, this is where you’ll find your peace. Home is not about four walls and a roof, it’s the embrace of your soulmate.

30,['10/01/2020'],Why Sinhagad fort is a popular site with trekkers and picnickers,"This week, the audience will get a glimpse of the life of the Maratha warrior Tanhaji Malusare in Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior, a historical war drama. And while facets of his life and valour will be explored on the big screen, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s military leader has been eulogised and immortalised due to his association to one of the noted forts of Maharashtra — Sinhagad fort located in Pune.Sinhagad fort is located around 35kms from Pune. Rohini Shah, an avid trekker, says, “The trek to Sinhagad is not that diffcult and is easily accessible even by road. That’s why it is equally popular with trekkers as well as families, who come here for a picnic. Ideally, if you are heading there from Mumbai, it makes sense to plan a trek over the weekend. Start early in the morning to reach the base and then make your way up there. It can get tiring, so staying overnight at one of the many places available enroute is advisable.” Besides the scenic view, the fort is popular for its historical significance.Sinhagad has been eulogised in many historical accounts. Prateek Deo, who has organised several trekking expeditions to the fort, says, “It has a strong historical significance because Maratha warrior Tanhaji fought and died here in the Battle of Sinhagad in 1670. Hearing the tragic news, Shivaji Maharaj expressed his grief with the famous words, ‘Gad ala pan sinh gela’ (We captured the fort, but lost the lion).” While Punekars generally drive down to the fort, tourists from Mumbai and around, either trek to the top or make their way up by using private vehicles or state transport buses.The best time to visit the place is in the monsoons, however, tourists who want to learn more about the history of the fort can also make their way there during winters. Akshay Jain, who organises weekend treks to Sinhagad, informs, “The fort has two entry gates — Kalyan Darwaza (on the south-east end) and Pune Gate (on the north-east end). There’s also a memorial built commemorating Tanhaji Malusare, who fought against the Mughals to capture the fort. It also has a mural that depicts the story of the fort.” People also visit the Khadakwasla Dam closeby. Ritu Darve recollects spending many weekends at the fort. “This fort is seeped in Maratha history. Apart from Tanhaji’s memorial, there is also a samadhi of Chhatrapati Rajaram, Shivaji Maharaj’s son, who died here in 1700.”The treaty of Purandar was signed between the Rajput commander of the Mughal army, Mirza Raja Jai Singh I and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on June 1665. The Marathas had to surrender 23 forts, including Kondhana to the Mughals. When Shivaji Maharaj embarked on a mission to reconquer the forts, one of the first forts he targetted was Kondhana. The win at Kondhana enabled his armies to win back most of his territory within four months. Tanhaji Malusare played a significant role in the battle and lost his life in it. Shivaji Maharaj renamed Kondhana as Sinhagad a tribute to Tanhaji.Sinhagad fort is said to be around 2,000 years old. After recapturing the Kondhana fort, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj renamed it as Sinhagad in memory of his friend and general Tanhaji Malusare",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73171669,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-105824/73171669.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/why-sinhagad-fort-is-a-popular-site-with-trekkers-and-picnickers/articleshow/73171672.cms

35,['10/01/2020'],Fashion goes dreamy with tulle,"Tulle is versatile and can be worn on everything from a dress to a top or even an outfit in another fabric with just tulle sleeves.

It looks just as great on off-shoulder dresses as on a retro, high-necked, long-sleeved style.

The fabric makes for a fresh, preppy look, so wear a tulle dress or skirt with your white trainers or your heels and ballerinas.

You will never go a frill too far, so the more layers and ruches on a tulle outfit, the better.

For a formal occasion, go with a tiara or a jewelled brooch on the tulle dress. For an edgy vibe, wear a leather jacket and T-shirt over your tulle skirt.

Go for a ruffled tulle skirt with boots this winter.

Wear sequins on your tulle skirt to add drama to it.

Avoid large and busy prints with tulle.

It’s the fabric that can transform you into a princess. Remember Elsa of Andrelle, who wore that gorgeous floaty blue gown in the film Frozen? That frothy, dreamy-like fabric is tulle. And it’s been hot on fashion’s go-to list with a growing list of celebrities choosing to wear it. Priyanka Chopra Jonas made her Cannes debut as a newlywed with Nick Jonas in an ivory layered tulle skirt and strapless bodice, Huma Qureshi opted for tulle in her black gown with heavy ruffled sleeves at the French festival and can one forget Deepika Padukone’s lime green tulle dress that created huge sartorial buzz? With its soft, dreamy-like texture and pastel hues, tulle just received another glamourous stamp of approval, at the recently held Golden Globes Awards with a number of celebs seen in tulle gowns and dresses.The fabric made for some head-turning fashion at the Golden Globes. Dakota Fanning exuded a princess-like vibe in her mauve gown with voluminous tulle sleeves and braided detailing, Gwyneth Paltrow looked stunning in her ‘naked’ caramel coloured ruched tulle gown and Alison Brie went for an embellished bralette underneath the light blue tulle gown and Molly Sims chose an icy-blue sheer bustier dress with a tulle skirt.Tulle-laden dresses have been a hot fad with Bollywood actresses. In November last year, Malaika Arora oozed glam in her red tulle party dress with a plunging neckline, Deepika Padukone redefined black with her tuxedo gown and multilayered tulle skirt for the Filmfare Awards 2019 and also wore tulle to the Cannes festival. Ananya Panday made for a dramatic picture in her tiered two-tone black tulle dress and it was a multilayer tulle skirt for Elli AvrRam. With neon being a trend, Mouni Roy wore the hue in her mint-hued ruffled strapless gown at an awards night in September.Tulle has a romantic, dressy feel to it. It’s sheer,has an ethereal appeal and the transparent quality of this fabric adds elegance to the look. It also gives depth to any colourThe best thing about tulle is that it can be moulded and twisted easily. It is also easy to maintain. Since it’s lightweight, it can have layers and layers, and still look the way it is",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73171442,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-25557/73171442.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/fashion/style-guide/fashion-goes-dreamy-with-tulle/articleshow/73171294.cms

Ask him about his modelling experience, and Akshit says he was not quite happy with it. “I was earlier into print modelling for several brands. I knew ki long run mein modelling can not be a career option. Modelling has a very short shelf life. Jab tak shakal hai tab tak only you can be a model but acting has nothing to do with shakal. The moment models start getting wrinkles on their face, their career is over. Male models ka toh industry mein aur bhi bura haal hai but main zyada depth mein iss topic pe toh nahi jana chahunga. Work wise also, the industry is still more female dominated. My modelling experience has not been that great, especially in Delhi. Bahut time waste kiya hai mera logon ne kaam dilane ke naame pe.”

But modelling has given Akshit a memorable experience. “I remember when the class XII results were announced, jahaan mere school ke toppers ki chhoti-chhoti picture newspaper mein aayi thi, my print ad was there in the newspapers with a huge picture of mine. So that was a really memorable experience for me, which made my dream of becoming an actor one day more sure,” he says.

Akshit recently promoted his debut show on Bigg Boss with Salman Khan . “Meeting Salman sir was a really big deal for a newcomer like me. Backstage, I was nervous. And the moment I shared the stage with him, I was told my blazer is shinning on the camera and so it had to be removed. And Salman sir was like ki isko meri jacket de do. My day was made as I wore ‘Salman Khan’s’ jacket that day! He made me really comfortable and all my nervousness went away within minutes as I started interacting with him,” he says.

You can make your own eco-friendly cleaners at home, using some basic and natural ingredients that you can find in your house.From Anne Hathaway opening up about the amount of waste that is generated on film sets to Dia Mirza's constant efforts to spread awareness about living a sustainable life, efforts to encourage discussions on being eco-friendly has taken centre stage in the last couple of years. However, it's not just a celeb thing anymore. People are increasingly finding ways to go eco-friendly on a daily basis. One of the growing sustainable trends has been that of sustainable cleaning – using all-natural cleaning products for clothes, utensils and more. This means that people are slowly saying goodbye to their tubs of chemical detergents and using homemade cleaners, or buying those that are sustainable and don't harm the environment.Bio enzyme is a cleaning solution made from fruit peels (especially citrus), which are mixed with jaggery and water, and fermented for three months. This solution, once ready, is strained and used diluted for cleaning counter tops, glass windows, clothes etc. The 'good' bacteria in these enzymes break down dirt and soil as 'food' and digest them.Jyoti Raghavan Khanduja, a 43-year-old freelance writer and Gurgaon resident, says, ""In my house, bio enzymes have replaced phenyl and toilet cleaners. They are excellent stain removers and also clean ceramic dishes really well."" Sameera Satija, a 46-year-old auditor, adds, ""I realised that by using cleaning products made with chemicals, we are polluting the underground water, rivers and the surrounding ecosystem. So, I started to look for organic options, and I came to know about bio-enzymes. Since then, I’ve been making it and using it for cleaning purposes. It is also an excellent nutrient for plants.""However, not everyone has had success in making and using bio-enzymes. Ranchi resident Preeti Singh tells us, ""Since I travel a lot, I couldn’t make bio enzymes at home. Unfortunately, I use detergent to wash my clothes, but I'm looking for alternatives to the same."" Puneeta Chadha Khanna, a 52-year-old marketing consultant says she doesn't like the smell of bio enzymes, which is why she doesn't use them for washing clothes. ""I use bio enzymes for my bathroom, and at times for pochchha, but since I don't like its smell, I avoid using for clothes.""One of the alternatives that people use to clean clothes include soap nuts, i.e. reetha. Says Jyoti, ""I use reetha instead of detergent. I boil reetha balls and I put two caps of bio-enzymes in it. My clothes come out very fresh. Reetha can be used for up to three times, after which they can be thrown in the compost, but some people grind them and use it to clean their dishes as well.""Puneeta adds, ""I use boiled reetha water to wash my clothes. Sometimes, for heavy stains, I use some detergent. I clean dishes with soap nuts, and at times, mix the leftover liquid with water to clean my windows.""Baking soda has a mild abrasive effect, while vinegar is effective in removing stains and deodourising. The ingredients can be used on various surfaces to clean and remove stains. For example, sprinkling carpets with baking soda, and then vacuuming it after 15 minutes to an hour,removes odour. A paste of baking soda and vinegar can be used to remove stains from carpets.Vinegar can also be mixed with water to remove wax from furniture, and a mixture of vinegar, water, baking soda and diluted liquid castile makes for a great bathroom cleaner.Making bio enzymes at home is actually a very easy process, though it may take a few tries to get it right. Here’s all you need:Citrus/fruit peels or flowersWaterJaggery (cut in small pieces)Plastic bottle, barrel or drumMethodPut water and jaggery in a vessel. Heat slowly and stir until the jaggery is dissolved. This step can be done without heat as well.Let the mixture cool. Put the peels in a plastic bottle or barrel that has a lid, and pour the cooled mixture in it.Now, all you have to do is wait for the mixture to ferment. If your chosen container has a small opening, open the lid twice a day for the first month or so to release the gases formed during the fermentation process – for containers with a bigger opening, you can open the lid less frequently.The bio enzyme will be ready in about 90 days.Tip: Use a plastic container since it allows much more flexibility than glass or metal for the gases to expand and the fermentationprocess to happen naturally.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73170456,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-227827/73170456.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/home-garden/from-citrus-peels-to-the-humble-baking-soda-ditch-chemicals-and-go-eco-friendly-with-natural-cleaners/articleshow/73170446.cms

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday said the country was going through a difficult period due to violent protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and requested all concerned to desist from aggravating the situation.When advocate Vineet Dhanda requested a bench of CJI SA Bobde and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant to list a PIL by Puneet K Dhanda seeking to declare CAA constitutional and make it mandatory for all states to implement it, the CJI said, ""As it is, there is a lot of violence. You (Dhanda) may create more trouble (with your plea). We are going through a difficult period. These are difficult times. Suggest methods to create peace.""The CJI said, ""Your petition is different. This is the first time we are hearing of a petition which tells the SC to declare a law constitutional."" Ordinarily, the SC scrutinises the validity of a law and declares it either constitutional or unconstitutional.However, the bench posted the petition for hearing on Friday though it has scheduled hearing on 60 other petitions challenging the validity of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on January 22.On December 18, the SC had entertained a large number of petitions seeking quashing of changes in the Citizenship Act designed to fast-track citizenship for Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Parsis and Jains from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. The petitioners said the non-inclusion of Muslims in the CAA provisions rendered it anti-secular and also violated the right to equality. On December 16, the SC had refused to be ""bullied"" by activist lawyers into taking up petitions alleging police excesses against students at Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University.CJI SA Bobde-led bench had said, ""We are not saying who is responsible, police or students. We are saying rioting must stop. We have enough experience as judges to know how rioting starts and what are protesters' rights. We cannot decide in this kind of atmosphere. All the rioting must stop. What is this vandalising of public property? We will take cognisance in a cool frame of mind. We are not going to be bullied like this to hear the matter.

NEW DELHI: For the first time since 2008, India's busiest airports - Delhi and Mumbai - have seen a year-on-year dip in passengers in 2019 compared with 2018. While Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport saw fewer domestic passengers, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) registered a fall in both domestic and international carriage.Amid an overall slowing economy , the biggest reason for decline was Jet Airways' collapse last April. IndiGo and GoAir's Pratt & Whitney (PW) engine troubles for their Airbus A320 Neos and SpiceJet's grounded Boeing 737 Max too contributed to fewer flyers last year. Closure of Pakistan airspace for 138 days led to airlines cancelling flights to and from Delhi and Mumbai for varying durations. As a result, Delhi and Mumbai were deprived of the records they were hoping to achieve in 2019.IGI, India's busiest airport, was just 2 lakh short of the magic 7-crore annual passenger (domestic-cum-international) mark in 2018 when it registered 6.98 crore flyers. DIAL's provisional data for 2019 shows it handled 6.8 crore passengers - down 2.6%.Delhi airport saw 1.9 crore international flyers in 2019 , up 0.6% from 1.8 crore in 2018. Domestic flyers, however, fell 6% from almost 5.2 crore in 2018 to 4.9 crore in 2019. Similarly, CSMIA had ended 2018 two lakh short of the 5-crore (domestic-cum-international) flyer mark at 4.98 crore. But Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) data for 2019 shows it handled 4.7 crore passengers - down 5.6%.Mumbai airport saw 3.38 crore domestic flyers in 2019, down 3.4% from 3.5 crore in 2018. And international flyers fell 7% from 1.4 crore in 2018 to 1.3 crore in 2019. The last time domestic air travel had dipped across India, say airline officials, was in 2008 when the global slowdown started but thanks to low cost carriers quickly spreading their wings in India, that issue was overcome from 2009 onwards.While IGIA and CSMIA were Jet's twin hubs in India and suffered the most from the airline's collapse, India as a whole did not see a fall in number of air travellers. DGCA data for the full year 2019 is awaited. Its January-November data shows the country saw 13.1 crore domestic flyers in 11 months of 2019, up almost 4% from 12.6 crore in the same period of the previous year. DGCA's January-June data shows India saw 3.19 crore international passengers in the first six months of 2019, up 1.2% from 3.15 crore in the first six months of the previous year.AAI saw a modest 5% growth to 14.8 crore domestic-cum-international passengers in January-November 2019 at its airports (not JV metro ones) over 14.1 crore in the same period of the previous year. However, these are a far cry from the double digit growths seen in past few years. Bengaluru and Hyderabad are yet to share their 2019 passenger numbers.DIAL said in a statement: ""….technical issues in aircraft engines (referring to PW engine trouble of A320 Neos)/newer aircrafts (referring to B737 max) impacted supply side of air traffic . During CY 2019, Indigo, SpiceJet, and GoAir faced issues on grounding of their aircrafts by the regulator due to technical issues leading to cancellation or lower operations impacting air traffic.""",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73180247,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1028682,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/1st-in-11-years-no-of-passengers-falls-at-igi-mumbai-airports/articleshow/73180222.cms

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday held that a ""gross mistake"" had been committed by framers of the Juvenile Justice Act that allows a juvenile to evade being treated as an adult in grave offences such as homicide not amounting to murder, as these crimes do not carry a minimum sentence.The court's observations came in the context of the JJ Act terming offences with minimum punishment of seven years imprisonment as ""heinous"", for prosecuting a minor above 16 years and less than 18, as an adult. In cases where there is no minimum sentence, a juvenile could not be treated as an adult till Parliament changed the law.A bench of Justices Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose passed the verdict while granting relief to a minor accused in the 2016 Mercedes hit-and-run case in the capital in which a person lost his life. The court held that the minor would not be treated as an adult because of an ""unfortunate gap"" in the law.The bench directed that the order be sent to authorities concerned at the Centre to ensure that it was addressed by Parliament or issuance of an ordinance. It said the SC's directions shall remain in force till such action was taken.Under the JJ Act, offences have been put into three categories - petty offences for which maximum punishment is imprisonment up to three years, serious offences involving a jail term of 3-7 years and heinous offences for which minimum punishment is seven years.The court said there was a fourth category where no minimum sentence was prescribed but where the maximum sentence was more than seven years - like homicide not amounting to murder or abetment to suicide .In case of a heinous offence committed by a minor above 16, the person could be tried as an adult after his mental and physical capacity to commit such a crime and ability to understand its consequences were established.""We hold that an offence which does not provide a minimum sentence of seven years cannot be treated to be a heinous offence. However, in view of what we have held, the Act does not deal with the fourth category of offences - where the maximum sentence is more than seven years imprisonment but no minimum sentence or minimum sentence of less than seven years is provided,"" the bench said.""How and in what manner a juvenile who commits such offences should be dealt with is something that the legislature should have clearly spelt out in the Act. There is an unfortunate gap. We cannot fill the gap by saying that these offences should be treated as heinous offences,"" the court added. Here again, a differentiation needs to be made as some offences will not fall in the heinous category.""We also have to keep in mind the fact that the scheme of the Juvenile Justice Act is that children should be protected. Treating children as adults is an exception to the rule,"" the court said. In this case, the juvenile at the time of offence was above 16 years but below 18 years.The Juvenile Justice Board in 2016 held that he had committed a heinous offence, and, therefore should be tried as an adult. The Delhi HC in May 2019 held that since no minimum sentence was prescribed for the offence in question, it did not fall within the ambit of the JJ Act and quashed the board's decision.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73180319,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-753561,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/minor-old-enough-to-drive-kill-but-too-young-to-be-tried/articleshow/73180300.cms

PDP expels leaders for going against the will of the people. #PressRelease https://t.co/E10RcGvNwI — J&K PDP (@jkpdp) 1578571365000

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) found itself in the middle of a crisis on Thursday after it expelled eight former MLAs for ""engaging with the government"", and its founder member Muzaffar Hussain Baig hit out at former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti for her ""provocative"" remarks, which, he said, resulted in the downgrading of Jammu & Kashmir into two Union territories.The partymen were expelled after they met the 15 foreign envoys who were taken to Srinagar to assess the situation in the Valley on Thursday.""PDP expels leaders for going against the will of the people,"" the party said in a press release posted on its official Twitter handle.All eight - Dilawar Mir, Rafi Ahmad Mir, Zaffar Iqbal, Abdul Majeed Padroo, Raja Manzoor Khan, Javaid Hussain Baig, Qamar Hussain and Abdul Rahim Rather - are former MLAs.""In view of the development post August 5 and the unilateral move of the government of India which has violated the will and hurt the sentiments of people, it has come to the attention of the party that certain party leaders have been part of the parleys which go against the interests of the state, official position and core beliefs of the party,"" the release said. The expelled functionaries have thrown their weight behind former PDP leader Syed Altaf Bukhari and were part of a delegation that met lieutenant governor GC Murmu on Tuesday.Meanwhile, senior PDP functionary and former deputy CM Muzaffar Hussain Baig on Thursday told reporters that party chief Mehbooba Mufti's remark that no one would be left to hold the tricolour in J&K if Article 370 was tampered with resulted in the state's bifurcation. Baig said, ""I was not personally present when she (Mehbooba Mufti) made these remarks but they were provocative and her remarks resulted in downgrading of the state into Union territories. That did not help us… The statement should not have been made."" Baig said one cannot ""threaten"" the top leadership in New Delhi to see one's grievances being heard.

47,['10/01/2020'],"Time to calculate value of a tree by volume of oxygen it gives, suggests SC","This story is from January 10, 2020

NEW DELHI: Redefining the valuation of trees , often felled to make way for road, rail and other projects, the Supreme Court on Thursday said the time had come to calculate environmental cost of trees by taking into account the volume of oxygen they contribute to the atmosphere in their lifetime.

A bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant said, ""Why do authorities, while computing environmental compensation, not take into account the volume of oxygen a tree would release into the atmosphere in its lifetime? Look at the amount of oxygen generated by a single tree in its lifetime. Value of oxygen generated by a tree in its lifetime should be taken into account in determining damage to environment caused by its felling.""

The CJI-led bench made this observation while dealing with a petition filed by the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights, which has challenged a Calcutta HC decision permitting the West Bengal government to cut 356 trees for construction of five railway overbridges (ROBs) at Kazipara, Ashok Nagar, Habra-I, Habra-II and Bongaon and expansion of NH-112, or Jessore Road.

Appearing for the petitioner NGO, advocate Prashant Bhushan said many of these 356 trees identified for felling were heritage trees and were over 80 years old.

According to scientists, global warming will lead to increase of temperature by seven degrees Celsius in 50 years, which will wipe out the human race on earth. Trees and increase in green cover are the only means to combat global warming. The state government must consider alternatives, including underpasses and changing alignment of roads, to avoid felling of precious heritage trees,"" he said.

For the Mamata Banerjee government, senior advocate AM Singhvi said ROBs were a necessity as these five stretches had witnessed 700-odd deaths in the last four years.

""The government, mandated under law to plant twice the number of trees it fells for a project, is planting five times the number of trees. Against a requirement of 700-odd trees, the government is planting 1,780 trees. Human lives are more precious than trees. Look at the huge number of human lives the ROBs will save,"" he added.

CJI Bobde said, ""Our experience is that though project proponents and governments undertake afforestation by planting saplings, most die because of neglect. You (state government) either change the alignment or construct underpasses.""

Panel have been asked to give its report on alternatives to felling of trees for ROBs within five weeks.

NEW DELHI: The Centre has notified 31 fields of information to be sought during the Houselisting and housing census phase of Census 2021, which include a new field relating to main cereal consumed in the household. However, field number 33 in the earlier Houselisting schedule approved for Census 2021 - 'number of household members availing banking services' - has been dropped.

Sources said information on main cereal consumed in the household, being sought for the first time as part of Census exercise , has been included in the Houselisting and Housing Census schedule as it would give a crucial insight into food habits of a household.

The mapped data in this regard may help in designing future food policy and initiatives.

Sources were however tightlipped on why the information on number of household members availing banking services is not being sought as done during the pretest and also mentioned in the houselisting schedule for Census 2021. Houselisting phase is scheduled between April and September this year.

As per the notification issued by the Registrar General of India and Census Commissioner Vivek Joshi on January 7, the central government has instructed census officers to ask questions from all persons on a total 31 items for collecting information - census house number; predominant material of floor, wall and roof of the house; use of census house; condition of house; household number; number of persons residing; name of head of household, sex of head; whether head is SC/ST; ownership status of house; no. of dwelling rooms; no. of married couple in household; main source of drinking water; availability of drinking water source; main source of lighting; access to latrine; type of latrine; waste water outlet; availability of bathing facility; main fuel used for cooking; radio/transistor; TV; access to internet; laptop/computer; telephone/mobile/smartphone; two-wheeler owned; four-wheeler owned; main cereal consumed; and mobile number.

NEW DELHI: Over 100 retired civil servants have written an open letter to the government asserting the ""constitutional and moral untenability"" of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and urging it to repeal the legislation. The letter, which asks the government to withdraw all instructions to construct detention camps , also calls for the repeal of all sections of the Citizenship Act 1955 that pertain to the issue of national identity cards .

Writing under the aegis of the Constitutional Conduct Group, a collective of the retired civil servants, the group referred to the NRC and NPR as ""wasteful exercises"" constituting the invasion of a citizens' right to privacy , especially because a bulk of the information, including Aadhaar , mobile numbers and voter IDs, will be listed in a document.

The civil servants, three former foreign secretaries Shyam Saran, Shiv Shankar Menon and Sujatha Singh among them, have attributed the ""grave apprehensions about the intentions of the Government of India"" to a ""rash of statements"" made by Union ministers in which they linked NRC and CAA.

""The PM's statement that the CAA and the NRC are not linked contradicts the averments of his home minister on repeated occasions. In such a welter of conflicting and confusing utterances, it is hardly surprising that the ordinary citizen is left bewildered and is overcome by unknown fears, more so when government has not entered into any dialogue on this issue,"" the letter said.

Other signatories of the letter on Thursday includes former cabinet secretary KM Chandrashekhar, former Delhi LG Najeeb Jung, former Indian ambassador to the UK Shiv Shankar Mukherjee, former telecom regulator Rahul Khullar, former top cops Meeran C Borwankar and Julio Ribeiro, former Asian Development Bank executive director PK Lahiri, Harsh Mander, Sujatha Rao and former chief secretary of Rajasthan, Salahuddin Ahmed, among others.

MUMBAI: Pilots of GoAir aircraft that veered off the Bengaluru runway during a low visibility landing in November last year, had lost visual reference of the runway when the aircraft was barely 50 feet from ground, according to preliminary inquiry. Under such circumstances, the pilots should have aborted the landing and carried out a go-around instead.

On November 11, a GoAir aircraft, operating the Nagpur-Bengaluru flight G8-11, with 180 passengers on board, veered off the runway strip and onto the grass upon touch down at Kempegowda International Airport , Bengaluru, due to low visiblity. After landing on the strip of grass, the flight took off and later landed in Hyderabad safely.

The DGCA has suspended the foreign licence authorisation of the expat commander for six months and the co-pilot's licence has been suspended for three months, said a DGCA note. Citing the causes that led to the incident, it said the crew considered wrong visual reference as runway centreline and maneuvered the aircraft to the left of runway09.

With inputs from Delhi

SRINAGAR: Fifteen envoys, including the US ambassador, on Thursday visited Srinagar in what marked the first trip by diplomats to the state after the August 5 repeal of J&K's special status and bifurcation of the state into Union territories.The trip was organised by the Modi government to showcase what it calls the return of normalcy to the state which was put under extraordinary curbs to deal with any law and order contingency in the wake of the Centre's contentious move. Rejecting criticism that the visit was a ""guided tour"", the government said more such visits could take place if there was ""progressive normalisation"" of the situation.European Union diplomats were not part of the group and said this was due to scheduling issues and not because these envoys were wary about a ""guided tour"". They wanted to travel as a group and that was not possible because it was felt that the composition of the group had to be representative.The first meeting the diplomats had in Srinagar was with security officials which was intended to help them understand the challenges of maintaining security, including the threat of terrorism sourced from Pakistan, said the foreign ministry, which facilitated the visit. This was followed by an interaction with members of civil society. The group also interacted with local media as well as a group of politicians, including ones recently released from detention. ""They will have more meetings on Friday in Jammu before returning to Delhi,'' MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said.Though meetings with the J&K administration were not part of the diplomats' visit, top foreign ministry officials anchored the programme as part of protocol. The envoys included those from Norway, South Korea, Vietnam, Philippines, Maldives, Morocco, Argentina, Niger, Nigeria, Guyana, Fiji and Bangladesh.Among the politicians who met the diplomats were former ministers Altaf Bukhari and Majid Padder (both PDP), and Shoaib Lone and Hilal Shah (both Congress). The decision of former and current PDP members to meet the envoys went down poorly with the party leadership which said it will initiate disciplinary proceedings. Congress also asked two of its leaders to explain being part of the group. They had neither informed the party nor sought permission as Congress had no invitation from any quarter, party spokesperson Ravinder Sharma said.Meanwhile, National Conference expressed disappointment over the manner in which the envoys were brought to the Valley ""to endorse the Centre's claims of normalcy"".

It accused the government of adopting double standards and leading ""guided tours"" to claim normalcy when three former chief ministers are under house arrest and one - Congress MP Ghulam Nabi Azad - was compelled to approach Supreme Court for permission to visit. ""We demand that the government allow unfettered access to J&K to all politicians and not resort to guided tours for envoys,"" senior Congress MP Jairam Ramesh said.

He also demanded ""positive political activity"" in J&K, lacking in the past five months.

60,['10/01/2020'],India a top geopolitical risk for 2020: US consultancy,"This story is from January 10, 2020

NEW DELHI: India is one of the world's top geopolitical risks for 2020, according to the Eurasia Group , one of US' most influential risk assessment companies.

In their most recent report, the Eurasia Group said PM Narendra Modi has spent ""much of his second term promoting controversial social policies at the expense of an economic agenda .

The impacts will be felt in 2020, with intensified communal and sectarian instability, as well as foreign policy and economic setbacks.""

For the first time, the group had the US and its broken domestic politics as the ""top"" global geopolitical risk of this year. ""We face risks of a US election that many will view as illegitimate, uncertainty in its aftermath, and a foreign policy environment made less stable by the resulting vacuum. ... a broken impeachment mechanism, questions of electoral illegitimacy, and a series of court challenges will make this the most volatile year of politics the US has experienced in generations.""

On India, the Group observes, the perception could grow that the Modi government's focus on its social agenda would have an economic spillover. ""Modi has less room to manoeuvre on structural reforms, just as the economy is starting to sputter, with quarterly growth falling to a six-year low of 4.5% and forward-looking indicators looking softer still. ... A weakened economy will in turn feed further economic nationalism and protectionism, weighing on India's troubled course in 2020.""

The top risks include the technological ""decoupling"" between the US and China and the challenges that it poses to the world besides the enduring US-China tensions, which, the Group says will lead to ""more explicit clash over security, influence and values.""

Countries and governments, the Group observed, will push back more and more against multinational corporations, with tougher nationalism-based regulatory frameworks. The EU, the group predicts, may increasingly push back against the unilateralism displayed by the US and China. Climate change will challenge companies and countries equally, creating conflicts between controlling emissions and bottomlines.

The Shia world, Eurasia Group predicts, may rise creating greater regional instability. Related, Turkey, it says, may be unravelling, which could be dangerous to others in the region. Latin American volatility and instability would be another source of risk.

Every such case should be pursued similarly. Political protests lose their meaning when they degenerate into vandalism. TiomesView

KOLKATA: The Hastings police have arrested a bandh supporter who allegedly threw stones at a government bus near Hastings crossing on Wednesday morning. The cops said they have slapped a stringent section of the Prevention of Damage to Property Act. However, what has made this case unique in Kolkata is that cops have sought legal opinion on whether the amended sections of the West Bengal Maintenance of Public Order (Amendment) Bill, 2017, can be used against the accused, which will compel him to pay for the damage.Police said the accused has been identified as Rajan Das, a 50-year-old resident of Hospital Lane in the Hastings area. “He claimed he was a CPM supporter and was only extending his support to the bandh. But we caught him red-handed and he was trying to flee. He managed to get bail on Thursday. However, our legal proceedings will continue against him,” said an officer.The FIR said the case was registered on the basis of a letter of complaint by Asish Dutta, 52, the driver of a government bus from Thakurpukur depot that plies on route S3A — between Thakurpukur and Sealdah. He alleged that around 10.30am on January 8, the accused threw a brick at the windshield when it reached Hastings crossing. A case under Section 3 of the PDPP Act and IPC Section 427 has been lodged against Das.In a bid to curb the tendency to destroy public and private properties during riots, unrest or violent political movements, the government had passed the West Bengal Maintenance of Public Order (Amendment) Bill, 2017, which stipulates that those who commit incidents of burning, looting and damage of properties will be liable for punishment and payment of compensation.The Jadavpur police have also lodged two FIRs against unknown persons for creating “mischief” on Wednesday. “We have certain footage from which we are trying to ascertain the identities of these people. These two cases, too, are fit for asking for damages,” said an officer. The Bhowanipore police, too, lodged an FIR against SUCI activists and 36 people were arrested.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73180996,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-766540,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-seek-legal-opinion-on-bandh-bus-attack-payout/articleshow/73179138.cms

Delhi deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi

PATNA: Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi , who also holds the finance portfolio, on Thursday said government departments at district level would procure goods through government e-marketplace (GeM) portal from next financial year.

Modi, who was addressing a conference on GeM portal at Adhiveshan Bhavan here, said the target of procuring goods worth Rs 1,000 crore through the portal would be achieved in this financial year.

The deputy CM asked the finance department to ensure that at least Rs 300 crore purchase is made in the next three months. The state has so far purchased goods and availed services worth Rs 704.31 crore from GeM portal, thus standing fourth in the country in terms of using the portal. The finance minister also hailed formation of state gem portal account (SGPA). Any department can put money in this account before making purchases and if they fail to pay to the dealer within 15 days, the latter will automatically get the money from SGPA.

Modi suggested that a filtering process should be introduced in the GeM software for the vendors from Bihar . “Of the Rs 704 crore business done in this financial year through the portal, Rs 124 crore transactions were made by the dealers,” he said.

Praising this e-Marketplace, Modi said it’s more transparent and less tedious with no scope of commission. He said the departments which are not using GeM portal would be identified soon. So far, state urban development and housing department (UDHD) has done maximum purchase from GeM amounting to Rs 305 crore, followed by social welfare department Rs 137 crore, home department Rs 118 crore, health department Rs 26 crore, science and technology department Rs 24 crore and education department Rs 21 crore.

He said the Centre was also devising ways to make the portal available to private entities for bulk purchases.

On booming online business which is hampering retailers, Modi said the Centre is in the process of introducing measures to help retail as well as online businesses.

MUZAFFARPUR: Superintendent of Shahid Khudi Ram Bose Central Jail, Muzaffarpur, Rajiv Kumar Singh on Thursday suspended three jail employees, including the chief warden for dereliction of duty .

Two of the three suspended employees have been directed to join the Darbhanga divisional jail, while one has been asked to go to Samastipur divisional jail during their suspension period.

Singh said that all the three jail employees were earlier issued show-cause notices after recovery of some objectionable items during a raid carried out by Muzaffarpur district magistrate Alok Ranjan Ghosh and senior superintendent of police Jayant Kant on Sunday.

“The three jail employees were asked to submit their reply in 48 hours but they failed to comply with the order. Their responses, submitted even after stipulated time, were not found satisfactory. Hence they have been put under suspension with immediate effect from Thursday. I have also recommended senior officials at the prison headquarters in Patna for initiating departmental proceedings against them,” the superintendent said.

He added that the chief head warden of the prison, Ramesh Kumar Singh, was asked to report to the Samastipur division jail till his suspension period. “The head warden, Vidyapati Singh, and warden Droni Prakash have been sent to the Darbhanga jail till further decision on their suspension,” the superintendent said.

Notably, a joint raid was carried out in the central jail on Sunday after the killing of an undertrial prisoner Mukesh Kumar aka Mukesh Telia in Hajipur district jail on January 5. The raiding team recovered knives, cash, mobile phones, chargers, and narcotics from the wards.

66,['10/01/2020'],Gaya tilkut may get GI tag soon: Minister,"This story is from January 10, 2020

GAYA: State agriculture minister Prem Kumar said on Thursday that a proposal to award the prestigious Geographical Indication (GI) tag to Gaya tilkut is under consideration of the Central government and a final decision in the regard will be taken soon. “Gaya tilkut fulfills all the criteria for awarding GI tag. A proposal in this regard is awaiting a nod from the Centre and we are expecting to get it soon,” the minister said.

Tilkut is manufactured by mixing sesame seeds, sugar or jaggery in the right proportion heated at an optimum temperature in cold, dry weather, skilfully hammered and then moulded into biscuit like shape. ‘Magahi paan’, another Gaya speciality has already got the GI tag, so has the ‘khaja’ of Silao and Shahi litchi. “Besides Gaya tilkut, the GI tag for makhana is also under consideration,” said the agriculture minister said.

GI tag certifies the quality of the product that possesses certain qualities, is made according to traditional methods and enjoys reputation due to its geographical origin. “The proposal for the GI tag to tilkut is pending at government level for more than two years now,” said Lalji Prasad, president of ‘Gaya Misthan (confectionery) Nirmata Sangh’.

Trade bodies said that the GI tag will provide the much-needed impetus to Gaya tilkut. “Tilkut business, on account of the prevailing market conditions including high input cost, pollution control, skill deficiency and a host of other reasons, has been facing problems for the last several years and as such tilkut makers pinned hope on the award of GI tag to get some impetus,” said Anup Kedia, former president of the Central Bihar Chamber of Commerce.

Meanwhile, Gaya Municipal Corporation has already imposed a ban on use of coal stoves, which have been traditionally been used for making tilkut. Bihar State Pollution Control Board has also cracked the whip to ensure total discard of coal stove. Tilkut makers of Gaya, according to market watchers have by and large switched to LPG and obtained commercial connections of eco-friendly fuel.

Nevertheless, market experts say that there is a big market available for tilkut in the Middle East and even Europe and America as the NRIs relate to tilkut as something native. According to Dr Rita Ambastha, an ayurveda practitioner, tilkut has medicinal value too and taken into a moderate quantity it ends problems like chronic constipation.

Surat: At least six armed robbers with their faces covered targeted the office of a gold finance company and escaped with Rs3 lakh cash and gold jewellery worth Rs6.56 crore at Chanod of Vapi in Valsad district on Thursday morning. Police have registered an offence of dacoity at Dungra police station and started investigation in the loot that created shock waves in south Gujarat. Police sources claim they have got specific leads about the suspects.

Police and officials of India Infoline Finance Limited (IIFL) were examining records to find out the exact value of the gold jewellery looted from the company’s office of gold loan at Chandralok Apartment on Vapi-Silvassa Road along with Rs3 lakh cash. The robbers had their faces covered with monkey caps and handkerchieves while targeting the office at around 10am. The robbers were carrying a gun and sharp-edged weapons. They pointed the weapons at the employees and tied seven of them and pasted adhesive tape on their mouths.

The robbers later forced the manager to enter password for opening the strongroom’s door and later the lock of the safe deposit vault inside it.

“Despite having high value gold jewellery and cash, the office did not have a security guard. The robbers threatened the manager to enter password to open the safe deposit vault. It is not easy to break the vault otherwise,” said a police officer.

The complaint was registered by Dipak Harshwal, 31, an employee of IIFL gold loan. Harshwal was hit on back of his ear and Dhiraj Shah, his colleague, on waist with the blunt side of a knife by a robber.

“Six robbers had entered the office. There is possibility of some more persons’ involvement in it. We have got some clues and are hopeful of cracking the case soon,” said a senior police officer.

Police suspect that the robbers had carried out a detailed recce of the spot before committing the crime for which they came in a car. However, police have not yet got any clue about the car which has disappeared.

A similar loot of Rs2 crore worth of gold jewellery was carried out in September 2017 in Chikhli of Navsari district from IIFL gold loan office.

Chemical and pharmaceutical companies make up the industrial base of Gujarat and we need to promote them, he said at the 10th Mega Industrial Exhibition organized by Ankleshwar Industries Association on Thursday.

The NDA government at the Centre headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not only pro-farmer but industry friendly too. We can’t neglect businessmen because they are key contributors of wealth, which helps uplift the deprived sections of society, he said, defending demonetization and implementation of Goods and Services Tax. The minister also referred to improvement in ease of doing business, digital initiatives and “Make in India’ campaign of the government. Five years ago, mobiles were not being manufactured in India but now over 100 companies under 'Make in India' initiative are either manufacturing mobiles here or selling them worldwide with base in our country. This has created endless opportunities for local businessmen, Mandaviya added.

69,['10/01/2020'],"About 4,196 hours of internet shutdown costs India $1.3 billion in 2019, finds study","This story is from January 10, 2020

Chennai: Internet shutdowns in India are not just disruptions in routine and individual freedom, but are also having an economic impact on the country.

Around 4,196 hours of internet black-outs in India cost the economy close to $1.3 billion in 2019, finds a latest study by UK-based tech research firm Top10Vpn.

India was the third worst-hit economy worldwide after crisis-hit Iraq and Sudan thanks to state-imposed shut downs across Jammu and Kashmir, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Rajasthan, UP and other regions, shows the report. An average of 8.4 million internet users were impacted across the mutliple incidents, it said.

The economic impact is likely to be higher, the study adds, given that the study only assessed large region-wide blackouts and India's smaller and more localised shut-downs weren't included. “There were more internet shutdowns in 2019 than ever before,” Samuel Woodhams and Simon Migliano, authors of the report by Top10Vpn told TOI in an email.

As for India, the frequency of disruptions still far surpasses any other country we analysed and, unless swift action is taken to reduce the number and duration of disruptions, the economic impact is likely to continue to rise, they added.

The vast majority of internet shutdowns in India in 2019 were highly localised and short-lived, but the costliest disruption occurred in Kashmir, where the shutdown remains ongoing. “The shutdown in Kashmir is one of the longest internet shutdowns to have ever occurred and cost the Indian economy nearly $1.1 billion in 2019,” Woodhams and Migliano said. It has hurt the economy, impacted local healthcare services, freedom of the press and education in the region.

The clampdown of internet services in the North East in relation to the Citizenship Amendment Act resulted in around $102 million of economic impact, and the restrictions in Uttar Pradesh led to a $63 million hit.

Besides 122 major shutdowns worldwide, the roughly 90 smaller blackouts in India takes 2019’s tally beyond previous year’s record total of 196 shutdowns, the report said, noting around 10% increase in disruptions globally from previous year. In terms of hours of disruption, Africa’s Chad and Myanmar are the only other countries ranking higher than India with 4,728 and 4,880 hours respectively, but with lesser economic impact. While industry estimates in 2016 put India’s shutdowns at 22 instances at a cost of around $986 million, the cost of 13 incidents in 2019 exceeded $1.3 billion, so we can surmise that the impact is becoming more pronounced over time, the researchers said.

The study arrived at the economic cost based on Netblocks’ and The Internet Society’s cost of shutdown tool, which relies on data from The World Bank, International Telecommunication Union and Eurostat, among others.

PATNA: A new eye bank is likely to become functional at the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) in March. A separate building has been constructed for the purpose and most of the equipment have been purchased.

NMCH superintendent Dr Gopal Krishna told this newspaper on Thursday that the eye bank would prove to be a boon for a large number of patients suffering from vision problems.

“Soon after the eye bank becomes operational, we will start a counselling session to make people aware of eye donation and transplant. We will then prepare lists of eye donors as well as people seeking transplant and act accordingly,” he added.

Approximately 150 patients reportedly visit the outpatient clinic of the eye department at the NMCH every day and many of them enquire about transplants.

Eye department head, Dr Rajesh Tiwari, claimed that the eye bank would make cornea transplant possible now.

“Teams with well-equipped ambulances will work round the clock to collect the eyes of dead people after seeking their families’ permission. They will also visit primary health centres and other nursing homes for the purpose,” Tiwari said.

He added, “There is a misconception that taking out the cornea surgically can lead to disfigurement of the body.”

Repesentative image

(By: V K Tripathi)

PATNA: Patna Medical College and Hospital ( PMCH ) has initiated measures to make free health cover available to more poor patients under the Ayushman Bharat Yojna (ABY), an ambitious scheme of the central government.

Though launched on September 25, 2018, only a sizeable number of patients could benefit under the scheme at PMCH. After a series of meetings with doctors, nurses and health department officials in the last three days, the hospital administration on Thursday asked all the departments to register poor patients in their outpatient departments (OPDs) and initiate treatment.

PMCH superintendent Dr Bimal Karak said though only about 900 patients were registered under ABY in the last 15 months, the new arrangements would now increase the number of beneficiaries.

“There were only two Ayushman Mitras (AMs) in PMCH. However, all the 14 health managers getting additional responsibility, the number of AMs has now gone up to 16,” Dr Karak added.

PMCH principal Dr V P Choudhary said every patient registered under ABY is entitled to get treatment, including clinical investigation, surgery and medicine.

“Four separate counters have been set up near the central emergency, general OPD covering several departments for registration under ABY,” said the principal, adding treatment facilities under the ABY are available in all the departments, such as medicine, surgery, eye, ENT, neurology, gynaecology, paediatrics, cancer and plastic surgery.

“After the verification of entitlement of the beneficiaries at the entry point, that is OPD, the AMs will take up the job and line up further treatment,” Dr Choudhary said, adding that the nursing staff have also been briefed about the scheme.

Ejaz Yusuf Lakdawala

PATNA: The arrest of fugitive gangster Ejaz Yusuf Lakdawala, a Dawood Ibrahim aide, from Patna on Wednesday has once again put the spotlight on the state, which has seen the arrest of several terror operatives in the past.

ADG (law and order) Amit Kumar admitted that some operatives of terror outfits such as Indian Mujahideen (IM) and Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen (J-u-M) have been arrested from Bihar in the past, but denied that the state has become a safe transit hub for terrorists.

“It’s a wrong notion that Bihar is a transit route for terrorists or ganglords from Nepal. We are alert and have taken all precautionary measures on this front,” Kumar said, adding, the state has never been used as shelter by them.

Kumar, who is also officiating as ADG (headquarters), however, admitted that some

The last such case in the state was that of the arrest of Ejaz Ahmad alias Amir, said to be associated with Jamaat-ul-Mujahiden of Bangladesh, who was arrested from Gaya’s Patwa Toli by the Kolkata police STF on August 26, 2019. Ahmad, a resident of West Bengal’s Birbhum district, was living in Gaya with his wife and three children in a rented accommodation under a fake name.

According to the documents available with the Buniyadganj police station in Gaya district, Ejaz was one of the key accused in the October 2014 blast in Khagragarh in West Bengal’s Burdwan district. Police sources said Ahmad was in touch with JMB leaders—Kausar and Salauddin Salahein. “His name had also figured in the low intensity bomb blast at Bodh Gaya in January 2018,” a senior intelligence officer said.

On March 25, 2019, two members of JMB—Khairul Mandal and Abu Sultan, stated to be from Bangladesh, were nabbed near Patna junction. Some incriminating documents, posters and banners of Islamic State (IS) were seized from the accused. Their accomplice Sharaiat Mandal was earlier arrested from Pune.

Police had seized three mobile phones, a memory card, two fake voter IDs, a fake PAN card, railway tickets from Gaya to Patna and New Delhi to Howrah and also a bus ticket from Kolkata to Gaya. The two later revealed that they had entered the country illegally and were tasked by the JMB to lure Muslim youths into the terror outfit.

In August 2013, co-founder of terror outfit Indian Mujahideen (IM) Yasin Bhatkal was arrested by the NIA from Raxaul near India-Nepal border, in East Champaran district. The NIA, which had unearthed the ‘ Darbhanga and Ranchi modules’ of IM, found the involvement of some of its members in both Bodh Gaya and Patna serial bomb explosions in July and October in 2013.

The IM’s Ranchi module was blamed for the October 27, 2013 Patna serial blasts at BJP’s Hunkar Rally, addressed by then PM candidate Narendra Modi, which had left six persons dead and over 90 injured at Gandhi Maidan. Two Buddhist monks were injured in the Bodh Gaya blasts on July 7, 2013. At least nine live bombs were also seized from various locations in Bodh Gaya.

At least half-a-dozen other IM operatives, including Md Asadullah Akhtar alias Haddi, were also nabbed from the border districts of Bihar. “Be it LeT, IM, SIMI or JMB, the state has turned out a safe haven for their operatives in Indian territory,” said a DIG rank officer, who had earlier been associated with a central intelligence agency.

PATNA: Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Public Library (KBOPL) has introduced various language courses for a week’s duration. It has already started with Bangla language course from January 4. Other languages in the list include Marathi, Arabic, Sanskrit, Persian, Urdu, Sindhi, Punjabi and Odia.

These courses will be taught by the experts for a week. Those who pass the examination after completing the course will be given certificates.

Library director Shayesta Bedar said the motive behind introducing such language courses was to promote the culture and also help people in understanding and reading the books available in the library. “One can understand any culture by reading books on the subject. We also realized that the number of people having command over many languages was falling. Hence, this course will be of great help,” she said.

Each language will be taught for a week, after which candidates have to take the examination in order to get the certificate. The library is not charging any fee for that. Library officials further said the languages will be taught in the evening after 5pm for an hour so that even students could attend the classes. There is no test for getting enrolled in the language courses.

“As of now, we have started with Bangla language course. Once it gets over, we will start any other language. We are also exploring the possibility of other languages to be taught here,” said Shayesta.

The library, which is over 128 years’ old, is famous for its rare and precious collections. It has about 21,000 oriental manuscripts and over 2.5 lakh printed books, which include works of Rumi and Firdausi. This library also has four such manuscripts which have been selected by the National Mission of Manuscripts among the Manuscripts Treasure of India. Those manuscripts include Kitab al-Hashaish, Kitab al-Tasrif, Divan-e-Hafiz and Tehreek-e-Khandan-e-Timuriyah.

PATNA: Flight operations at Jayaprakash Narayan International (JPNI) Airport here were partially affected due to poor visibility on Thursday. Altogether nine flights were delayed due to the inclement weather.

Three flights of IndiGo (two Kolkata-bound and one Delhi-bound), four of SpiceJet (one each to Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Ahmedabad) and one each of Air India (Delhi) and GoAir (Bengaluru) were delayed.

Santosh Kumar, assistant general manager (air traffic management) at Patna airport, however, said the flights suffered minor delays.

He added, “The minimum visibility of 1,000m for landing of flights was reached before 9am. The first flight of SpiceJet arrived at Patna airport on its scheduled time at 9am and departed without any delay.”

According to weather scientist at Patna Meteorological Office, the device that measures the runway visual range (RVR) broke down in the morning. “The visibility was measured in the morning through conventional method.

MUZAFFARPUR: Muzaffarpur senior superintendent of police Jayant Kant has set up three investigating teams to probe the murder of a 65-year-old retired senior excise official Ajay Kumar Sharma and his wife Renu.

The duo were found bludgeoned to death in their house at Gyan Lok Colony in Muzaffarpur town on Wednesday afternoon. Sharma had retired as assistant inspector general from the state prohibition and excise department five years ago.

“The teams will be headed by SP (city) PK Mandal, DSP (city) R N Paswan and DSP (west) Krishna Murari Prasad. They will probe the matter from different angles. Even the forensic science laboratory and electronic surveillance cell have been asked to cooperate in getting every detail needed by the investigating teams,” the SSP said.

He added: “We are still waiting for the family members of Sharma to lodge a formal police complaint. This will help us to focus on our line of action. Though some valuables have been stolen from the house, the way the crime was committed tells a different story other than loot or dacoity,” he said.

Meanwhile, a senior police officer and a member of the investigating team told this newspaper on condition of anonymity that some burnt papers have been found from the main entrance of the house. “It shows that they were killed for those papers, considered to be important for the miscreants. Even some circumstantial evidences also hint at some insider,” he said.

Brahmapura police station SHO Bishwanath Ram said, “The postmortem report of Sharma couple suggests that they were killed nearly 14 to 24 hours before from the time of autopsy.”

It may be mentioned here that the SP (city) along with DSP R N Paswan and SHO of Brahmapura police station had reached the spot around 1.30 pm after being informed by the Ajay’s elder brother Saroj Kumar Sharma, who is a lawyer at the local civil court.

PATNA: Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Sunil Kumar made a surprise inspection of the railway hospital at Khagaul on Wednesday and interacted with the patients. He directed chief medical superintendent (CMS) Dr R K Verma to provide better medical facilities to the railway employees and their dependants.

Talking to this newspaper on Thursday, Kumar said he had asked the CMS to take patients’ feedback so that there is transparency in the functioning of the hospital. “I also told him to ensure that all wards of the hospital are kept clean and there is a separate reception counter to help visitors, who want to consult doctors for treatment,” he added.

The DRM claimed that the railways would provide better health care facilities to all patients in the hospital. He said, “I held a prolonged discussion with the CMS and other doctors to get first-hand information about the problems facing the hospital.”

At present, the railway hospital at Khagaul, which is one of the oldest ones, caters to the needs of approximately 14,000 employees and 6,000 pensioners of the Danapur division. It is also fulfilling the medical needs of around 50,000 other patients, including the dependants of railway staff.

Sources pointed out that the capacity of the hospital was reduced to 152 beds from 202, after 50 beds were shifted to the superspecialty hospital at Karbigahiya in Patna. “The hospital has only one ambulance and the pathology department, where about 6,000 routine tests are conducted every month, needs advanced equipment,” a doctor told this reporter and added the hospital had an annual budget of Rs 95 lakh.

Retired railway employees claimed that most of them were unable to visit the railway superspecialty hospital in Patna for treatment or regular check-ups because of old age. Hence, they urged the DRM to provide all facilities at the Danapur railway hospital.

Despite repeated attempts, the CMS could not be contacted for his comments.

Rajkot: Had Ala Rathod , the staffer of cash management company , known about the hooter installed in his bag , he could have saved himself from the robbers.

Rathod was robbed of Rs 11.19 lakh cash near Satya Colony in Jamangar on Thusday, but the police nabbed five accused, including the victim's colleague Bhavin Hedav. Investigation revealed that Hedav had plotted the loot as he was under heavy debt.

The looted bag was traced in the bushes near Kansumara village near Jamangar from the GPS system attached to it.

“There was also a hooter in the bag, but Rathod was unaware. Had he pressed the hooter, a siren would have blared, attracting the attention of the people and cops,” said Sharad Singhal, Jamnagar superintendent of police.

Hedav, who worked in the same company, was fully aware of Rathod's schedule and the amount of cash he could be carrying. Along with Hedav, police arrested his brother-in-law Chirag Pandya (27), Irfan Sandhi (29), Shabbir Sandhi (30) and Faruq Shedha (28). Another accused Anees Khalifa is still on the run.

K K Gohil, inspector with Jamnagar local crime branch, added, “Shabbir, Faruq and Khalifa overtook Rathod on their bike and waylaid him. They flashed a knife and snatched his bag.""

Hedav hatched the loot conspiracy along with Pandya who roped in others.

CAUGHT CONDUCTING RECCEE

Rajkot: The accused were traced on the basis of CCTV footage of the day before the crime when they visited the spot. The CCTV footage on the day of the crime showed that the accused had covered their faces. However, a day before the crime, the accused were caught on the CCTV footage while carrying out a recce. After the crime, the accused gathered at Shabbir’s house in Theba village of Jamnagar taluka and celebrated his birthday.

“We have asked all the financial firms to train their staff to use bags fitted with GPS system and hooters,” added Singhal.

78,['10/01/2020'],Sarthana extortion case accused cops shunted out of city,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Surat: Four accused cops facing investigation in the Sarthana police extortion case have been shunted out of the city. The DGP issued the transfer order on January 2, 2020 following their alleged attempts to hamper the ongoing investigation.

Of the four cops who are currently under suspension, three have been transferred to Dahod district while one has been transferred to Ahmedabad.

N D Chaudhary, police inspector, has been transferred to Ahmedabad city while H M Gohil, police sub inspector, G D Mudhva, and B R Bhadiyadra, both police constables, were transferred to Dahod district.

The accused cops were booked in Sarthana police station on April 5, 2019. They were booked for extortion and other charges under sections of Indian Penal Code. They are under suspension since then however, their posting was in the city.

After the offence was registered against the four cops the case was transferred to the anti-corruption bureau (ACB). Chaudhary had also approached the Supreme Court seeking anticipatory bail but it was rejected and the court asked him to surrender after which all four accused were arrested in July 2019.

“It has come to notice of the investigation officer that the accused have tried to indirectly interfere in investigation. Hence ACB wrote a letter to the DGP office about the attempt and requested transfer of these cops out of Surat,” ACB stated in a press release.

Earlier in March, Suresh and Jayesh Jivani, residents of Varachha, approached the Sarthana police station informing about a racket of changing chassis number of buses that is being run by Irshad Pathan, who owns a garage at Valak village.

Pathan had purchased a bus from a finance company which was earlier owned by the Jivani duo. The bus had been seized following non-payment of loan.

Following information by the Jivanis, Sarthana police detained Pathan and also seized the bus of which the chassis number was changed. Pathan was later freed without registering any offence after which Jivani approached senior police officials.

An inquiry was instituted against the four cops who were posted in Sarthana police station which revealed that they allegedly took Rs 30.5 lakh from Pathan for not registering an offence against him.

Later city police registered two FIRs related to the case in Sarthana police station. In the first offence Pathan, 39, was booked on March 31 for alleged forgery, cheating and tempering with evidences. In the second FIR the four cops were booked. Both the cases were later transferred to the ACB for further investigation following state government’s order since it involved corruption charges.

Fire may have been caused by short-circuit, no casualties

Rajkot: A major fire broke out in the tent city at Rann Utsav, the state government’s annual desert festival , in Dhordo village near Bhuj on Thursday morning. Two fire tenders deployed at the tent city, doused the fire. No casualty was reported in the incident. However, probe has been ordered.

81,['10/01/2020'],"Duo came on foot, fired at cop, ran inside mosque, walked out","This story is from January 10, 2020

Kaliyakkavilai: The two young men were not masked and wore skull caps used by Muslims while offering prayers. They had a close look at the place before firing at special sub inspector (SSI) Y Wilson, 57, who was on duty at the small check post on Market Road at Kaliyakkavilai on the inter-state border. The duo escaped through the gates of the Muslim Jama-ath and made their way to Kerala after committing the crime late on Wednesday.

These details as well as the identity of the accused became known from the CCTV footage recorded in the mosque that connects the check post to the main check post on the highway through the mosque premises. “We know Wilson very well. He used to be a silent man and frequented the mosque often when he is on duty. We are shocked,” Mohammed Siyad, 47, the general secretary of the mosque, told TOI. The incident took place around 9.35 pm when the two accused, now identified as Thoufique and Abdul Shamim, came on foot from the Kaliyakkavilai market, crossed the check post where Wilson was alone and went to the back gate of the mosque less than 20 metres away. After waiting there for a minute, they walked to the check post and fired three to four rounds at Wilson. As he fell down unconscious, the duo ran back to the gate and walked out of the mosque through its front gate onto the Nagercoil - Thiruvananthapuram national highway. This was recorded on three CCTV cameras in the mosque and four more in a hospital, weigh bridge and two shops where the duo is seen walking past the inter-state border into Thiruvananthapuram. IG south zone K P Shanmuga Rajeswaran said there were also stab injuries on the body the nature of which can be confirmed only after obtaining the post mortem report.

“They casually walked for about 400 metres and left in an unsuspected manner before people on the other side of the mosque recovered from the unexpected turn of events. One of the CCTV cameras also shows one of the accused asking for a lift from a vehicle,” Mohammed Siyad said. Meanwhile, Wilson lay in a pool of blood with three bullet injuries near the back gate of the mosque. Locals said that it was two children aged about 10 to 12 years playing on the road who first witnessed the events. Two college-goers rushed in on hearing the gun shots and took Wilson to the hospital in an autorickshaw, where he was declared dead.

Both gates of the mosque are about 20 to 50 metres from the Kerala border. It existed as a shed many decades ago and as a tiled-roof structure before it got its current form in 1965. A total of 16 CCTV cameras were installed in the mosque three years ago but this is the first time they have been of some use. The mosque committee said the gates are open till midnight for traders and highway users to offer prayers. Police said that they initially suspected that the accused could have escaped in an SUV as one such vehicle was speeding past the place close to the time the incident took place.

82,['10/01/2020'],Sensex shoots up 635 points on easing US-Iran tensions,"This story is from January 10, 2020

TNN

Mumbai: Markets across the world rallied on Thursday as there were signs of some easing of tension between the US and Iran , which also led to softening of crude oil and gold prices . As a result, the sensex rallied 635 points, or 1.6% to close at 41,452, while the Nifty gained 191 points, also 1.6%, to close at 12,216. The rupee strengthened by 49 paise to close at 71.22 per dollar, from 71.71 on Wednesday. The rising rupee, however, led to some selling in the stocks of software exporters.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka said market sentiments have revived as oil prices cooled down due to no further escalations in the Middle East. “The US has offered to impose sanctions on Iran instead of military action, which eased off the tensions. On the domestic front, the government has eased laws to fast-track mining at sites and also imposed import duty on copper wire rods,” he wrote in a note.

Going forward, however, corporate earnings will be in focus, which could be another quarter of muted growth. On Friday, Infosys is set to kick off the results season. The upcoming Budget on February 1 will also decide the market’s course. “We expect the Q3 to be another quarter of muted earnings, largely led by BFSI, auto and consumer companies,” Khemka said. “Investors would also be watching out for pre-Budget developments, which would influence the market.”

But from a technical perspective, the rally looks to be on a weak foundation. According to Kotak Securities senior VP (equity technical research) Shrikant Chouhan, the markets are into overbought zones, hence fresh long positions should be avoided at current levels.

The day’s rally was led by banking & financial services and select heavyweights. BSE data showed that ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries, HDFC and HDFC Bank were the top contributors to the index’s rise, while lower closing in TCS and HCL Tech limited the rise.

Interestingly, end of the session data showed that foreign funds were net sellers on Thursday with a net outflow figure of Rs 431 crore, while domestic funds were net buyers at Rs 419 crore.

83,['10/01/2020'],KMDA floats traffic tender for Bypass Metro crossing,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Kolkata: The Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) has finally floated tenders to engage an agency to come up with a complete traffic dispersal plan at Avishikta crossing on EM Bypass for facilitating the completion of the Metro station there. The chief objective of the exercise is to ascertain possible dispersal of vehicles from Bypass and Prince Anwar Shah Road Connector while the station gets connected with the Metro viaduct.

KMDA has not ruled out the possibility of opening up lanes for office-time traffic and removing shops and an auto stand stand for this purpose. The plan will also create space for passengers to smoothly board and alight from public transport.

The authorities have fixed an estimate of Rs 34 lakh to execute the project and the agency that will take up the job will need to come up with the plan within 30 days from the date of starting work. Discussions were earlier held with the Kolkata traffic police, which came up with a rough proposal.

“The agency will help us ensure there is minimum jam at the busy crossing. Since traffic snarls have been a regular feature here ever since the construction began, we need to plan ahead before allowing RVNL to get their desired blocks.

A committee has been formed comprising representatives from KMDA, KMC, traffic police and other stakeholders to figure out how traffic can be managed in a systematic manner around the new Metro stations that are coming up. “The idea is to follow the Delhi model. Pedestrians will have to use the special channels so that traffic is not disrupted,” said an officer.

Sreeparna Roy, an IT executive from Survey Park, said that while the signal at the Bypass-Avishikta crossing might turn red, there was always the risk of vehicles coming from Garia and taking the open left turn. Similarly, when vehicles take the right turn from the Ruby side towards Ajoynagar, the left turn from Avishikta towards Ruby is kept open, making crossing the stretch a difficult exercise.

84,['10/01/2020'],"In a first, RBI allows KYC process on mobile video","This story is from January 10, 2020

MUMBAI: In a move that will enable banks and fintechs onboard customers remotely, the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has amended its norms to allow the ‘ know your customer ’ (KYC) process to be completed through a mobile video conversation. The central bank has also facilitated eKYC and digital KYC by allowing use of Aadhaar or other e-documents in the customer due diligence process.

This makes India one of the rare markets to allow video KYC through an amendment to the RBI rules after the government amended the Prevention of Money Laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules, 2005. “I think this is a world first where the regulator has allowed video KYC. Banks can onboard customers by doing a video KYC through the app and acquiring Aadhaar and PAN. Non-banks, although they don’t have access to eKYC, can complete the process by using the physical Aadhaar or the QR code,” said Naveen Surya, chairman of Fintech Convergence Council, which has been pushing for this.

After eKYC using Aadhaar was discontinued following a Supreme Court decision, mobile wallets found it difficult to onboard new customers. In a circular issued on Thursday, the RBI said, “Digital KYC has been defined as capturing live photo of the customer and officially valid document or the proof of possession of Aadhaar, where offline verification cannot be carried out, along with the latitude and longitude of the location where such live photo is being taken by an authorised officer of the reporting entity (RE).”

Reacting to the circular, NITI Aayog chief Amitabh Kant said in a tweet, “Great initiative by RBI! Circular on video based customer identification process will make presence-less and paperless banking a reality. The circular is a huge positive step towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s goal of Digital Financial Inclusion.”

Once the Aadhaar has been used, the regulated entity must either edit out or blackout the Aadhaar number. The e-document has been defined as an electronic equivalent of an officially valid document with its valid digital signature, including documents issued to the digital locker account of the customer.

The central bank has said that the KYC process cannot be outsourced to any third-party service provider and the audio-visual interaction must be triggered from the domain of the regulated entity itself. Also, the video customer identification has to be done by officials trained for this purpose and the video recordings preserved.

“Regulated entities are encouraged to take assistance of the latest available technology, including artificial intelligence (AI) and face-matching technologies to ensure the integrity of the process as well as the information furnished by the customer. However, the responsibility of customer identification shall rest with the RE,” the RBI said.

Earlier in the day, Nitish unveiled Chandan irrigation project worth around Rs 57 crore in Chandan block of Banka district. He asked water resources department and district administration officials to remove silt from Chandan dam to ensure proper storage of water for irrigation purposes.

From Banka, the CM left for Bhagalpur where he inaugurated the renovated Durga Pokhar (pond), intensive sapling plantation and beautification work at Bhulni panchayat.

Sources said issues related to Bhagalpur, including Bholanath flyover, a bridge proposed to be constructed parallel to Vikramshila Setu , frequent traffic snarls, Aguani ghat bridge and others were discussed by the elected representatives and representatives of other local bodies during the meeting.

Addressing a public meeting later, Nitish deliberated on the importance of safe drinking water, clean air and green vegetation (sapling plantation) for healthy life. “All kinds of pollution are hazardous for humanity. We have endeavoured to restore the groundwater levels by renovating the ponds and rivers in the state. Besides, intensive sapling plantation work is being done for increasing the state’s forest cover in order to check the greenhouse effect due to the pollutants,” he said.

Referring to the seven resolves of the state government, Nitish said his government was committed to making positive changes in the lives of people.

“Liquor prohibition in the state has reduced cases of domestic violence and crime as well,” the CM said. He also spoke on Jeevika initiative as well as steps taken by the government to make villages open defecation free and check stubble burning .

The CM urged the people to join human chain being organized by the state government on January 19 to spread awareness on JJH, liquor prohibition and eradication of social evils like child marriage and dowry.

SURAT: Twenty four schoolchildren had a miraculous escape after their bus collided with truck at a stone’s throw away from a tanker carrying LPG bottles that had gone up in flames on Surat-Olpad road on Thursday.

The bus of Radiant International School located on Ugat-Jahangirpura Canal Road was on way to Surat from Olpad taking the children to school. In the meantime, a tanker of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) loaded with nearly 300 LPG bottles caught fire at around 7:15am. As a result of the fire and thick plumes of smoke, one side of the state highway was closed for vehicles. A truck driver, who had to take a wrong side because of the blockage, failed to see the school bus approaching and both vehicles collided head on close to the tanker.

The children - all aged between 10-12 years- were safely taken out of the bus just in the nick of time as LPG cylinders from the near-by tanker started exploding one after another.

While the truck driver fled from the spot, the bus driver suffered minor injuries. However, all three vehicles were charred as the flames from the tanker spread rapidly. The accident happened near Masma village, some 20 km from Surat city.

The fire in tanker is suspected to have been triggered due to sparks in the battery devise of the vehicle. It spread rapidly and engulfed the whole tanker. Panic gripped the area as the cylinders started exploding one after another.

An eyewitness said that thick plumes of black smoke were visible from long distance and constant explosions of LPG cylinders created a major scare on the highway and near-by areas.

“The explosions were so loud that it looked as if someone had hurled grenades,” said a fire brigade officer who had rused with the team from Mora Bhagal station.

Four fire fighting vehicles from Mora Bhagal, Palanpur and Adajan fire stations of Surat were rushed to the spot. Nearly 30,000 litres of water was used to cool the vehicles and the cylinders.

Basant Pareek, chief fire officer, Surat Municipal Corporation, said, “It was nothing short of a miracle that major tragedy was averted. All the schoolchildren were moved to safety in the nick of time and there were no injuries to anyone. The initial fire started due to sparks in tanker’s battery and spread very quickly. The tanker driver had also fled.”

It took nearly two hours to clear the spot and ensure normal traffic flow.

RAJKOT: If hanging library in Nigala village worked wonders for 190-odd students there, such innovations stayed confined to the realms of the hamlet only. At best, such measures by enterprising teachers may get documented in District Education Training Centre’s (DIET) annual publication, but these too remain within the district only.

But thanks to the efforts of teachers like Jafrabad-based Sanjay Parghi, this ignorance about rural innovators could be erased to a great extent. This English teacher in Rohisa school of Jafrabad taluka provided these innovative teachers at the village levels a much wider platform — through his android-based mobile application. Parghi has documented nearly 300 such innovations done in the last five years in Amreli district alone.

The app was launched on January 2 and has already had 500 downloads in the past one week. This digital platform showcases experiments on tough subjects like mathematics and science were not only made easy for the rural students but also enthused them to go to schools regularly.

“I want to make these innovations available to all the rural primary teachers of the state who are facing similar problems. I have given innovative teachers the username and passwords who themselves now add to their work and also reply queries posed by other interested teachers,” said Parghi

District innovation co-ordinator of Amreli, Bharat Der said, “We now plan to include videos and pictures of the teachers with their innovation in the text description.”

Another innovative teacher in Liliya taluka’s Saldi village, Chandrika Kanani, uses the sports page of an English daily to teach English to her students after noticing their interest in sporting activities. Yet another teacher in Chittal school created mathematics puzzles to make the subject easy, while another used the chessboard to teach mathematics.

Tejas Parmar, district development officer, Amreli, said, “The app will help innovations reach other teachers.”

90,['10/01/2020'],Jamia girl who fought Delhi cops in Kolkata today,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Braving rain, protesters at Park Circus continue their demonstration.

KOLKATA: The image of a hijab-wrapped girl fiercely shielding a male friend from the batons of Delhi Police was the tipping point of the collective consciousness of India, which erupted in protests against CAA and NRC. Ayesha Renna N , the post-graduate history student at Jamia Milia University, will be in Kolkata on Friday to participate in a protest march from Esplanade to Gandhi statue.

Activists Harsh Mandar and other members of civil society and students will also participate in the rally, where Ayesha is expected to raise her voice against the attack on JNU students.

Ayesha, who along with a fellow student, Ladeeda Sakhaloon, has become the symbol of defiance during the ongoing movement, told TOI she was excited to be in Kolkata, which had always fought fascism and turned down communalism and bigotry. “It is a privilege to be invited to a march in Kolkata, which has a long history of defying anti-people regimes and shows little tolerance towards communalism and bigotry. I have never been to Kolkata but have heard stories about how the city raised its voice against injustice to the weak,” she said. “The people here can teach me a thing or two about fighting for one’s rights, but my small message will be to stay united against fake propaganda and to fight CAA and NRC.”

Ayesha was born and brought up in Kondotty, a small town in Kerala’s Mallapuram. The attack on her friends on the university campus on December 15 changed her perspective towards life overnight. Her impassioned way of protecting her friends from the cop batons won her love from people of all communities. She had been flooded with invitations to protests against CAA and NRC from Hyderabad to Kerala. “I am showered with love everywhere I go. Despite all efforts to divide people through fake propaganda I find them united. Protests of such a huge scale would not have been possible had people from only one community participated,” said Ayesha, whose photo was made the display picture of many social media users, who pledged their support for the movement through the image.

“I urge more and more women to come forward to fight for their rights before it is too late,” said Ayesha, pointing out many of the rallies and demonstrations were already being led by women, including the one at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi.

Bihar governor Fagu Chauhan at a meeting with the vice-chancellors of all the universities at Raj Bhavan in Pa... Read More

PATNA: Governor-cum-chancellor Fagu Chauhan on Thursday directed the universities to evolve a mechanism for regular monitoring of the working of all constituent and affiliated colleges besides BEd colleges and help improve the state’s higher education system.

Addressing a high-level review meeting at Raj Bhavan here, the governor said that senior officers of the universities should regularly visit the colleges under their jurisdiction and inspect the various activities. He asked the principal secretary to initiate necessary action in this regard and create a fool-proof system for ensuring regular monitoring of colleges. The meeting was attended by the vice-chancellors of all the universities besides the officials of Raj Bhavan.

Chauhan asked the VCs to take necessary steps for accelerating the process of academic reforms by making an assessment of vacant posts of teachers and also the strength of students in different colleges and university departments. Institution-wise and subject-wise vacancies must be worked out. He directed the VCs to ensure proper rationalization of posts of teachers in the light of students’ demand for the subject.

It is seen that in some subjects which have virtually no takers, there are plenty of teachers and, similarly, in some subjects which are much in demand there are only a few teachers. Such imbalance must be removed by ensuring proper rationalization of posts before expediting the recruitment of fresh teachers.

Referring to the admission of students in BEd course in teachers’ training colleges, the governor pointed out that this year the state-level combined entrance test for BEd course would be conducted by the LN Mithil University.

Candidates’ counselling and their choice of institutions must be coordinated in such a way that genuine students do not face any hardship in securing their admission. No candidate who fails to qualify the entrance test, should be admitted in any institution. Stern action would be taken against the institution which admits such students, warned the chancellor.

Savji Dholakia

RAJKOT: Amreli police have issued summons to Surat diamond baron Savji Dholakia asking him to remain present on January 13 for questioning in the case of fake complaint of Mahatma Gandhi ’s statue desecration in Lathi town of Amreli district on January 4.

Talking to TOI, Amreli superintendent of police (SP) Nirlipt Rai said, “The evidence available with us shows that a fake crime scene was created. We will question Dholakia whether he was aware about this and what was the motive behind misleading the police.”

During preliminary questioning, Kanak Patel, caretaker of the lake and surrounding area developed by Dholakia Foundation, admitted to have fabricated the incident of desecration. However, police are awaiting more evidence, forensic reports and questioning of concerned persons before registered an offence.

“There is motive behind every crime and this needs to be established,” said Rai.

An application was submitted by Dholakia Foundation on January 4 at Lathi police station alleging that some miscreants has vandalized Bapu’s statue. Spot investigation and recovery of audio clips from some labourers revealed that the statue was accidently damaged by a tractor engaged by the Dholakia foundation in it’s premise several days before January 4.

It is suspected that the fake complaint was submitted to ‘fix’ some villagers who have been at loggerheads with the foundation over use of the approach road where the statue has been installed.

PATNA: Academics as well as trade body experts hailed the role of residential or boarding schools in personality development of students in a talk show held on the same topic on the premises of Bihar Industries Association here on Thursday.

Delivering the keynote address, Alokesh Sen, principal of Birla Public School (BPS)-Pilani said boarding school education inculcates deep values of life in students.

“Students become highly disciplined, self-reliant and independent at boarding schools. They become experts in managing time and quickly learn to perform domestic chores themselves, which is extremely important in day-to-day life of youth. As there are fewer distractions at boarding schools, students become more focused in their work and studies and gain maximum knowledge. Boarding school provides a wholesome environment with sports, extra-circular activities and studies which are required to maintain a well-balanced lifestyle,” Sen said.

BPS alumnus (1996 batch) and eminent radiologist Pragati Sinha said brotherhood, team spirit, mutual respect, courage, discipline, self-discipline and self-dependence were few virtues he learned in boarding school.

“Any ship sails as good as its captain sails it,” he said, adding that school culture has gone down, especially in day schools.

P K Agarwal, president, Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries, said personality development depends on the type of school students are going to. He shared his experience how BPS offered food and accommodation to their guests and parents as there were hardly any hotels and restaurants in Pilani. His son Sumit Agarwal graduated from BPS in 1995.

Sanjay Goenka, former vice-president of BIA , shared his experience of student days at BPS and emphasized how residential schools shape the personality of students by providing a platform for all-round development.

Arun Khandelia, president Vidya Niketan Old Boys Association (VINOBA), spoke on how the old boys’ association has created a benevolent fund, which is used for providing help to children of deceased alumnus of BPS.

PATNA: Altogether five teachers and three non-teaching staff, who had retired last year, were feted at a function organized to mark the 158th foundation day of Patna College on Thursday. Four university toppers of the institute were also felicitated on the occasion.

The retired teachers were Ila Sinha, Maya Shankar, Ravi Kiran Sharma, Sufia Nasreen, and P K Poddar, while the staff included Arun Kumar, Ram Shakal Paswan, and Ram Lakhan Mahto. The four students were Tushar (English), Roshan Kumar (ancient Indian history), Somesh Kashyap (Sanskrit), and Rishav (statistics).

Patna College alumnus and Veer Kunwar Singh University’s former vice-chancellor (VC), I C Kumar, who was the chief guest of the event, recalled the glorious tradition of the institute and called upon the present generation to maintain it.

“Although the college was awarded a poor grade by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council, it still commands the respect of a lot of people of Bihar,” Kumar said.

He also unfurled the college flag and released altogether 158 balloons of different colours in the sky.

Addressing the students, PU VC Rash Bihari Prasad claimed, “There was a time when getting admitted here was a matter of pride for the students as well as their parents. Things have changed now, but we are making efforts to restore the lost glory of Patna College.”

Others, who spoke on the occasion, included college principal, Rama Shankar Arya, and his former counterparts, Nawal Kishore Chaudhary, P K Poddar, Ezaj Ali Arshad and R P Singh Rahi.

“Intellectuals should not remain in ivory towers, but come forward to resolve the present crisis, which has gripped the campuses of most premier institutions in the country. They should analyse the real cause of the growing social unrest and show the younger generation the right path,” they said.

Patna College’s sociology department head and Patna University Teachers’ Association president, Randhir Kumar Singh, proposed the vote of thanks.

Established in 1863, Patna College owes its distinct identity to the nature and mode of its response to social issues. Its teachers and students actively participated in the national freedom movement and it was here that Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan first presented his ideas of a ‘total revolution’.

Academics are of the view that the history of Patna College is synonymous with the history of the growth and development of higher education in the region. It has exercised a profoundly significant influence on the lives of its people in many ways.

The college, which provided the backdrop to English novelist E M Forster’s ‘A Passage to India’ and film director Satyajit Ray’s ‘Seemabaddha’, has been the mother of a number of institutions of higher education in Bihar, including the erstwhile Bihar College of Engineering (now NIT-Patna), Patna Law College, Patna Medical College, Patna Science College and Vanijya Mahavidyalaya.

PATNA: Animals, birds, reptiles, trees, medicinal plants and flowers at Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park, commonly known as Patna zoo , will get quick response (QR) codes soon. The facility will help people get all information just by scanning the QR codes tagged near the enclosures and nurseries at the zoo on their smartphones.

The QR facility and several other amenities will be introduced at the zoo with the help of Rs 2.75 crore contributed by the Airport Authority of India (AAI) under its corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative.

Patna zoo director Amit Kumar said a software and mobile application would be prepared to scan the barcodes. “The initiative is aimed at making visitors aware about the species, age, common name, zoological and botanical name and lifespan of animals, birds, reptiles, aquatic animals, trees and flowers,” he said.

A per the CSR proposal, the interpretation centre and educational centre at the zoo will be equipped with interactive kiosks, touch screens and digital games related to forest and environment.

Amit said around Rs 2 crore would be spent on installation of electronic gadgets at a gallery in interpretation-cum-3D centre which will be operational by June. “Some electronic devices, including augmented reality technology, will be installed at educational centres as well. The bidding for the same will start soon,” he said.

Amit added, “Around 10 electronic kiosks will be installed at the gallery of interpretation centre and some touchscreens will be installed at the garden near the centre. Children can learn names of animal and birds and hear sounds they make on touchscreens.”

“All the analogue signage inside zoo premises will be replaced with electronic signage. Electronic signage will also be installed outside the Patna zoo enclosures to display details of animals,” the zoo director said.

As far as the basic amenities is concerned, more sitting kiosks, benches, lamp posts, water kiosks and food kiosks will come up at the zoo by July this year.

Giraffe calf welcomed: A giraffe at Patna zoo gave birth to a calf at 4pm on Wednesday under the care of veterinary doctors from Bihar Veterinary College. With this the giraffe count at the zoo has increased to six. The male calf of six feet was born to ‘Shanti’ and ‘Bhima’.

Patna zoo director Amit Kumar said the mother and the baby were doing fine. “They have been kept in a separate enclosure away from public glare. This will help the new member adapt to the surroundings. The mother is taking care of the calf and nurturing it by herself,” he said. Earlier, a female giraffe ‘Hema’ was born in May to ‘Shristi’.

102,['10/01/2020'],Dawood aide Lakdawala arrested in Patna,"This story is from January 10, 2020

PATNA: Ejaz Yusuf Lakdawala , a close associate of Dawood Ibrahim, was arrested by a joint team of Mumbai police’s crime branch and Bihar STF near Patna railway station on Wednesday morning.

The four-member Mumbai crime branch team led by DCP Shahji Umap took Lakdawala into custody around 10.30 am while he was on his way to Patna airport. Sources said he had hired a cab after arriving at Mithapur bus terminus from Nepal.

ADG (operations) Sushil Mansingh Khopde said senior officials of Mumbai crime branch were in touch with the Bihar STF since Tuesday evening. “They had definite information about the arrival of Lakdawala in Patna as they were tracking him for a while. Our team cooperated with the Mumbai police in the operation,” he told TOI.

Khopde, who was recently promoted to ADG rank, said the visiting team left for Mumbai with the fugitive gangster after completing legal formalities at the Jakkanpur police station in Patna. “We provided security to the members of the visiting team before it left for its destination,” he added.

The SHO of Jakkanpur police station, Mukesh Kumar Verma, said they handed over the wanted criminal around 12.10 pm after completing the legal formalities. “The accused was brought to the police station at 10.35 am. Inspector Sachin Kadam, who was part of the four-member Mumbai team, gave in writing that the accused would be produced in court within 24 hours,” Verma said.

He said the Mumbai police team had sought the cooperation of the local police in the operation, which lasted about 15 minutes. “The Mumbai police team along with officials of the state STF earlier visited the police station around 10 am and sought our cooperation to arrest a fugitive. We sent our team accordingly,” the SHO said.

ADG Khopde said as there was no case pending against Lakdawala in Bihar, the state STF neither detained him nor interrogated him. “The Mumbai crime branch team showed documents of cases in which he (Lakdawala) was evading arrest,” Khopde added.

Sources in the police headquarters said Lakdawala was residing in Nepal’s Pokhara. He used to make extortion calls to several builders and other affluent businessmen of Mumbai from Nepal. Pokhara, a tourist destination, has, of late, become a safe haven for gangsters and terrorists operating in India.

Earlier, Indian Mujahideen (India) co-founder Yasin Bhatkal, was arrested by NIA at Raxual on the India-Nepal border in East Champaran district in August 2013. “Bihar is being used as a safe route by gangsters and terrorists to reach their destinations in different parts of the country from Nepal,” a senior intelligence officer said.

Chennai: Truck and bus maker Ashok Leyland and ABB Power Products and Systems India have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in the electric bus transportation space to improve load sharing and reduce charging efficiency.

The MoU outlines a partnership to develop a pilot electric bus based on ABB’s flash-charge technology, TOSA, which tops up the battery in just seconds while passengers get on and off the bus. This avoids the need to take the vehicle out of service for recharging every few hours or having a replacement bus ready, thus minimizing the size of the fleet while increasing passenger carrying capacity. “We are pushing the boundaries of e-mobility with our flash-charging technology TOSA for buses. The aim is to provide a zero local emission mass public transportation bus system with high passenger capacity. We are pleased to be working with Ashok Leyland in advancing responsible urban mobility,” said N Venu, MD, ABB Power Products and Systems India (ABB Power Grids’ business in India).

Ashok Leyland has already kicked off its electric mobility play with e-buses and for this pilot will develop and manufacture electric buses with ABB’s TOSA flash-charging technology along with operational support and service. “To stay competitive in our domestic and global markets, we are joining hands with ABB to use their world-renowned TOSA technology on our e-buses to take forward our vision of expanding in the EV space,” said N Saravanan, chief technology officer, Ashok Leyland.

Surat is looking for funds worth Rs5,000 crore for construction of Tapi riverfront and Outer Ring Road project. The city administration is exploring the possibility of financial assistance in the form of either grant or loan. Pani told TOI, “World Bank has shown keen interest in some of our projects. We are eager for assistance for Tapi riverfront and Outer Ring Road projects. The World Bank officials during discussions with us today went into micro details of these projects. The discussions are in advanced stage and will continue.” Tapi riverfront is Rs3,900 crore worth project and Outer Ring Road will entail an expense of Rs5,000 crore.

PATNA: Following light to moderate showers at many places in central and south Bihar on Wednesday night, most places in the state witnessed cloudy skies on Thursday. According to weathermen, clouds will start getting clearer by Friday, paving way for plunge in temperature along with dense fog in morning hours for a few days.

India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a warning for cold day conditions at isolated places in the state on Friday and Saturday. Cold day condition is declared when the minimum temperature touches 10 degrees C or low and there is a departure of 4.5-6.4 degrees C in maximum temperature on two consecutive days.

Patna Meteorological Centre, on the other hand, also stated in its daily weather bulletin that night temperatures would gradually fall by three to five notches for three days from Saturday.

The IMD has also issued forecast for dense fog at few places in the state over the next three days.

The daily bulletin issued by Patna Meteorological Centre on Thursday evening stated that Patna, Jehanabad, Bhabhua, Ekangarsarai, Lalbegiya Ghat, Kodawanpur, Garhi, Ramnagar, Bihpur, Rosera and Jamui received showers over the last 24 hours.

Bhagalpur witnessed 3.8mm rainfall between 8.30am and 5.30pm on Thursday. Meteorologists have attributed the showers to a western disturbance and claimed that its impact in Bihar would reduce from Thursday.

“The western disturbance crossed Bihar and moved towards north-eastern districts. Accordingly, the clouds are expected to start getting clearer from Friday evening, which will lead to drop in night temperature over the next two to three days,” said an official at Patna Meteorological Centre.

He added that sharp plunge in minimum temperature is expected in the region owing to snowfall in the Himalayan peaks in north India.

Patna Meteorological Centre has predicted that minimum and maximum temperature in the state capital would hover in the range of 18-20 and 8-10 degrees C, respectively, till Sunday.

At 8 degrees C, lowest minimum temperature in the state was recorded at Sabour in Bhagalpur district on Thursday.

Meanwhile, a fresh western disturbance is likely to affect western Himalayan region from January 11 night onwards. Western disturbances are low pressure area or extratropical storms originating from Mediterranean Sea , Red Sea and Caspian Sea, which cause snow and winter rainfalls in northwestern Indian subcontinent .

Officials at the Patna Meteorological Centre said the upcoming western disturbance would be of low intensity with not much impact on the weather system in Bihar.

109,['10/01/2020'],Over 70% vehicles still without FASTags in Bihar,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Long queue of vehicles at a toll plaza on Patna-Bakhtiyarpur NH on Thursday.

PATNA: Over 70% vehicles arriving at toll plazas on national highways across the state do not carry radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, popularly known as FASTags . In Patna , more than 65% vehicles pass through different toll plazas on national highways without FASTags.

“Only 30% of total vehicles, including trucks, buses and cars, have FASTag stickers pasted on their windscreens. We have allotted two lanes for vehicles without FASTag stickers. Police force has also been deployed for keeping an eye on vehicles without the tags,” said Sanjeev Kumar, manager of a toll plaza on Patna-Bakhtiyarpur NH-30.

The Union ministry of road transport and highways made FASTags mandatory for vehicles from December 1 last year. However, due to less number of vehicles with FAStags, the deadline was extended till December 15. Thereafter, the Centre, through a letter, announced that 25% of all lanes at toll plazas will be earmarked as hybrid lanes, where vehicles without FASTags can cross by paying cash for another 30 days. The remaining 75% of the lanes were dedicated to vehicles with FASTags.

With the deadline of January 15 for electronic clearing of vehicles at toll plazas approaching, sales of FASTags at various toll plazas have picked up. “More than 150 vehicles get FASTag stickers on a daily basis – 60% private vehicles and the remaining public vehicles,” said Kumar, adding that motorists without FASTags will be penalized after January 15.

“Even though we have the provision of taking fines from motorists entering FASTag lanes without the RFID tags pasted on their vehicles, we aren’t fining them. Instead, we make them aware about the procedure of getting the tags,” said an official.

A senior National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) official said, “FASTags are easily available at all the toll plazas on national highways. It hardly takes 30 minutes to get the sticker pasted on windscreen of a vehicle. One can get the FASTags online too,” he said.

The official added, “All NH toll plazas in the state have been converted into FASTag lanes. Only one lane has been allotted to vehicles without FASTags due to which long queues are witnessed at toll plazas. It’s time now for people to get FASTags as it will not just save their time, but also reduce chaos at toll plazas.”

Motorists, on the other hand, are having a tough time crossing through toll plazas on NHs. “I got stuck on Patna-Bakhtiyarpur NH-30 toll plaza for more than an hour. The queue for motorists entering the cash lane was too long,” said Farhan Ahmed.

Another motorist, Sanjay Sinha, said FASTag lanes mostly remain empty.

Madurai/Trichy/Chennai: Under fire from the opposition parties and allies over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Narendra Modi government has gone into firefighting mode deploying ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and Smriti Irani as well as BJP general secretary Ram Madhav to clear the air over the issues in the state.

“When you had so many opportunities to show your sympathy towards Sri Lankan Tamil refugees and other minorities when the UPA government came up with policies which against their welfare why did you not react,” asked Union Minister of Women and Child Development and Textiles, Smriti Irani, while addressing a pro-CAA rally at Sellur on Thursday. Speaking at the ‘Janjagran Abhiyan’, she said they had gathered there because all those who were participating in the rally had put the nation first. “Seventy-two years ago, our motherland was ripped apart in the name of religion to side with those who were against the nation’s welfare, and worked with the British,” she said. She said she remembers poet Subramania Bharathi’s vision for India. ``We recall the sacrifices of the Indians beyond caste and religion, so that they can live in dignity, but the DMK has joined hands with those who shamed those sacrifices,’’ she said. ‘When the November 2007 special commission for rehabilitation did not entertain citizenship for Sri Lankan refugees under the UPA government why did you remain silent?’’ she asked. At Chennai, Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the government will hold talks with allies and take them into confidence. He was responding to a question on Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami’s statement in the assembly that he had told Home Minister Amit Shah that NRC was not acceptable to the AIADMK government. On NRC, he said, “There are provisions that the date for NRC shall be announced, there will be verification, hearing of objections and disposal of objections and appeal against that. Nothing has been decided at all including the date.”

Addressing a meet organized by BJP at Trichy, party national general secretary Ram Madhav said, “Some leaders in Tamil Nadu are opposing the Act. If we ask them reason for their opposition, they do not have answers. Those who opposing the Act really do not know anything about it”, he said. ""I appeal to Muslim brothers not to fall prey to the false propaganda of opposition parties. This bill is not against Muslims or Christians”, he added. Party national executive committee member L Ganesan, actor Gautami and general secretary M Muruganantham too participated.

NAGPUR: An abysmal 38.09% polling was recorded during the by-election for prabhag number 12(D) on Thursday. Of the total 58,162 voters, just 21,151 exercised their franchise.

The counting will be held from 10am at in NMC’s Dharampeth zone office , Gokulpeth on Friday.

Five contestants were in the fray — independent Ashok Dorlikar, Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh’s Praful Ganvir, BJP’s Vikram Gwalbanshi, AAP’s Akash Kawle and Congress’s Pankaj Shukla.

The by-election were necessitated following the death of four-time corporator Jagdish Gwalbanshi, a resident of Sai Nagar. The election passed off peacefully and there were no untoward incident.

During the first two hours, a mere 6% polling was recorded. The later part of the day too saw a similar trend with the percentage not climbing to more than 5% every two hours.

The ward has total 30,235 male and 27,927 female voters. But, only 11,948 male and 10,203 female voters turned up. Officials blamed the poor show on official working day beside low enthusiasm among mass about bypolls. The civic body had set up 50 polling booths in the prabhag.

BJP had fielded Vikram Gwalbanshi, son of the deceased corporator, while Congress picked Pankaj Shukla, whose parents Surendra and Nilima had also represented the ward earlier. NCP and Shiv Sena are not contesting the bypoll.

The dismal turnout of voters was because bypoll as such is not taken seriously by several voters in the city. “From our side too there should have been much better mobilizing of workers and voters,” said BJP office-bearer.

Congress workers, however, pointed out that the turnout could have been better if, like other polls, there would have been a holiday.

113,['10/01/2020'],"Anganwadi workers to get Rs 2,000 raise","This story is from January 10, 2020

UDUPI/MANGALURU: Anganwadi workers will get an increment of Rs 2,000, women and child development minister Shashikala Jolle said on Thursday, adding that the order has been issued and will be implemented in 15 days.

In further relief, she said the workload on anganwadi workers would be eased so that they can focus on their primary responsibilities.

“Within 15 days, anganwadi workers’ monthly aid (salary) will be increased by Rs 2,000. The order has been already issued. In October 2018, the central government said it would pay Rs 1,500 to anganwadi workers. Though the grant was released in the 60:40 ratio, it was not given to them. Now, the state will put in the remaining 40% and provide Rs 2,000 to the workers. Steps will be taken to ensure anganwadi staff receive the honorary aid by the 10th of every month,” she said.

Jolle said her department was among the neglected ones in the state but in the past four months, 60% of the vacancies have been filled and steps taken to expedite promotions.

“Anganwadi workers are being burdened with departmental work and they are unable to pay full attention to the children in their care. We will work towards reducing the work pressure,” she said.

In another move, anganwadi workers may soon get a new name. “A proposal is being sent to address anganwadi workers by a better name which will reflect society’s recognition of their services,” the minister said.

Face-reading equipment, digital books

A biometric attendance system for workers and face-reading equipment for children will be launched soon to check irregularities in anganwadis.

“Currently, though the attendance book shows 50 children, the centre is found to have only 20. So where does the food of 30 children go?” Jolle said.

Anganwadis in Karnataka with own buildings will have uniform interior design. The ceilings of these anganwadis will be painted with images of solar system or any such image that will give children information about their surroundings or that will help improve their knowledge, said Jolle. This will be followed for all new anganawadi buildings that will be constructed, she said.

Reviewing the department’s progress in Dakshina Kannada district, the minister said given the demand for anganwadis in Karnataka Public School in the state, a decision on including the same with these schools will be decided at the level of ministers.

“Principal secretaries of the two departments will first sort out the issue and give their recommendation to the ministers, who in turn will address fears that anganwadi teachers have on the issue,” she said. R Selvamani, CEO, Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat said there is demand from beneficiaries of the scheme that they be provided chikki, egg and milk at their doorsteps rather than make them come to the anganwadis for the same.

The government will take a call on it given there are similar demands from across the state, the minister, however, ruled out transferring the food packet amount to beneficiaries account, fearing its misuse.

NEW DELHI: Hundreds of JNU students , accompanied by their counterparts from Delhi University and Jamia Millia Islamia, marched alongside citizen supporters on Thursday from Mandi House towards Shastri Bhawan to apprise the Union HRD ministry about their 73-day agitation against the hostel fee hike.

The protesters made a strong pitch for sacking JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar for “allowing violence on campus”. The marchers also demonstrated against CAA and NRC. Though the protesters were halted at Shastri Bhawan, some members of JNU Teachers’ Association and JNUSU, including its president Aishe Ghosh, insisted on meeting the HRD ministry officials.

Saket Moon, JNUSU vice-president, declared, “We are not going to move back an inch.” The meeting with ministry officials lasted over two hours.

As the meeting was going on, a number of political leaders addressed the crowd outside. Saying that he “proudly owns the tukde-tukde title” given to him and fellow demonstrators, former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar said, “We will render tukde-tukde the movement to spread hate and vitriol in the country.”

Kumar commended actor Deepika Padukone for standing in support of JNU students and added, “If repression becomes law, then it’s a crime not to speak. So, start speaking... Don’t be silent, don’t be violent.”

The former JNUSU president also said that they were not demanding the VC’s resignation because “he will never resign since his agenda is to destroy the university. So, it is important to remove him.”

CPM’s Sitaram Yechury echoed these sentiments: “The government has to fire this VC and not allow him to tender his resignation. He allowed masked men to attack students on campus.”

Later, as the delegation emerged from the meeting with ministry officials, Ghosh said the negotiations were unsatisfactory and that the students would now march to Rashtrapati Bhavan. But as they proceeded towards the National Archives, they were detained on Rajendra Prasad Road. A few students were injured in the melee with the cops. As the crowd started to disperse, some proceeded to the Mandir Marg police station, where two women students were detained, but were later let off.

The protest was eventually called off a little after 8pm. Delhi Police additional PRO Anil Mittal said the march remained peaceful till the time the JNU delegation was in the HRD ministry office. “However, when the delegation emerged, a student leader provoked the gathering into marching towards Rashtrapati Bhavan. They were prevented from disrupting traffic on Rajendra Prasad Road. In the process, 11 people were detained but subsequently released,” Mittal said.

116,['10/01/2020'],High court notice to Gujarat government over election code violation,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Pradipsinh Jadeja

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Thursday issued notice to the state government in response to a petition filed by the minister of state (home) Pradipsinh Jadeja seeking quashing of a metropolitan court’s decision to conduct a trial against him over allegations of him violating the election model code of conduct in 2007.

The trouble began for Jadeja more than 13 years after the incident. In October 2007, the then city Congress president Pankaj Shah filed a complaint with the election officer, on the basis of a pamphlet distributed in the Asarwa constituency. It displayed a photograph of Jadeja, then the MLA from Asarva, with the slogan ‘Aapnu Asarwa, Aagvu Asarwa’. It also bore a photograph of then chief minister with the slogan ‘Aapnu Gujarat, Aagvu Gujarat’. The pamphlet also contained a prayer – Vishwambhari Stuti — with a picture of the goddess Amba.

The Congress leader complained that the pamphlet was distributed by Jadeja but did not contain the name of the printer, which is a must under Section 127A of the Representation of the People Act. On basis of this complaint, the district election officer filed a complaint with the metropolitan court, seeking action against Jadeja.

The metropolitan court conducted verification in the matter and ordered a police inquiry asking Meghaninagar police to inquire and report on the circulation of the pamphlet. The police filed its report in December 2007 after recording the statements of Shah and a National Student Union of India (NSUI), Vinaysinh Tomar.

Thirteen years after police submitted its inquiry report, the metropolitan court on December 21, 2019 ordered to begin the process against Jadeja and conduct a trial in the case. The law under which Jadeja faces charges is punishable with imprisonment for up to six months.

Madurai: Long queues were witnessed outside all 1,354 ration shops in the district from early in the morning on Thursday to receive the Pongal gift hampers, with more than two lakh beneficiaries receiving their gifts on the first day.

The Tamil Nadu government is distributing gift hampers of one kg of raw rice, cashewnuts, raisins, sugar, and Rs 1,000 cash to all beneficiaries of the rice card in the state for Pongal festival. While the programme was formally launched last Sunday by the ministers in each district, the distribution for public started on Thursday.

Many shops in the city witnessed squabbles between the people in the queues. While the beneficiaries were told that the names of the people would be displayed on the board outside the shops to prevent overcrowding, however confusion prevailed at many places.

In Villapuram, women and elderly people stood in long queues and were given tokens from as early as 6am. “I stood in the queue from 6am but got my gift only at 11am, so I could not go to work,” said Shanthi, a resident.

It was announced that beneficiaries whose names appear on the ration card can come to the shop and receive the cash and gift hamper by producing the card or their Aadhaar as proof, many of them complained that it got delayed due to the serpentine queues.

“Last year, I went on a Sunday before the Pongal festival and was given only Rs 500, as they said cash, rice and other condiments were not available. So, I came on the first day this year, but have lost half my day’s pay waiting for this,” said Rajeswari of Karupayoorani.

Meanwhile, sources from the district administration said that Pongal gift hampers were issued to 2,23,437 rice cards in Madurai district out of the total 85,00,15, which is about 26%.

NEW DELHI: Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari and others flagged off mega motorcycle rally from the party office on Thursday to protest against the violence in JNU and the alleged “misuse” of youth by the opposition parties to push their agenda.The rally, which was kick-started by Tiwari riding a bike with MP Vijay Goel standing behind, was scheduled to cover Mandi House, Kashmere Gate and Britannia Chowk, but police diverted it to bypass Mandi House due to a march by students and teachers. The rally covered Vikas Marg, ISBT, Delhi University, Azadpur and reached Britannia Chowk, where it was joined by MP Pravesh Verma, and finally reached Delhi BJP office via Punjabi Bagh and Dhaula Kuan.“The youth have contributed the most to the development of the country. Congress and AAP are creating an atmosphere of confusion and falsehood on CAA, which can lead to disturbance in the country. In frustration, the opposition parties are trying to push the youth into anarchy for electoral gain,” Tiwari said.Goel said the rally titled ‘Vijay Abhiyan Sankalp Rally’ signalled the political farewell of the Kejriwal government. “I am confident that BJP will form the government in Delhi. Under the leadership of PM Modi, Delhi will progress at double speed,” he said.Meanwhile, on uncertainty over who will be BJP’s CM face for the assembly election, party MP Meenakshi Lekhi has picked an unusual contender — the lotus. “Whether you are the Prime Minister or party president or hold any position, it’s the lotus which is our face and we all work for the same cause.

119,['10/01/2020'],"Crane tagged in Mongolia covers 2,766 kilometers, dies of pesticide in Rajasthan","This story is from January 10, 2020

Crane T-51 that was tagged.

JAIPUR: T-51 died on January 9. It was not supposed to. But it was practically poisoned to death by pesticides easily available and used in India but banned in the US and across Europe.

When on July 27, 2019, it soared into the sky with its flock of about 400 demoiselle cranes -- a small, graceful species with a black head and white ear tufts that breeds in south-eastern Europe and central Asia -- on a three-month journey from Mongolia’s Khurgan Lake to their winter home in state’s Khichan village, scientists who had tagged it ""back home"" were expecting it back. No one thought it would die months after it reached its destination, having survived the July to November 2,766-km flight.

T-51 died along with 15 other sick birds on Thursday. Three had perished earlier. They were among 40 that fell critically ill on December 31. Autopsy of some of the cranes have revealed death came from consuming grains laced with pesticide.

Viscera samples of the birds sent to National Centre for Avian Ecotoxicology at Coimbatore confirmed poisoning and specifically mentioned the pesticide monocrotophos in their report, forest officials said. Farmers in large parts of the world have been asked to stay away from monocrotophos.

T-51 was special as it had been tagged, allowing scientists to know the exact distance the bird had travelled, every halt it had made, its every move. T-51 landed in Jodhpur’s Khichan last November. T-51 was one of two chicks of a family banded at Khurk Valley.

“Rajasthan hosts thousands of migratory birds every year. The state must issue advisories about using harmful pesticides,” said Dau Lal Bohra, senior wildlife researcher in Jaipur. “Researcher Nimbiar Batbayar has confirmed T-51 is one among the 1,000-crane project,” he added. The 1,000-crane project is a multi-country initiative that stretches over years, tracking multiple migrations and crane species and populations, following routes, rest-sites, impact of changing climate and even social structures among the birds.

The small band or tag tied to a bird’s leg yields rich information used in migration studies and conservation efforts. Soaring to altitudes of up to 26,000 feet, the migration route of demoiselle cranes, the smallest of 15 crane species, is considered among the toughest pathways as they fly over the Himalayas, head and neck straight forward and legs straight behind, a formation legend says was used by ancient armies. Ornithologists suggest there’s an easier route over the Khyber Pass but the cranes are hard-wired to follow their known route over hundreds of migrations.

Many die on the journeys to and fro battling extreme weather, hunger, predatory birds and even power lines. To tide over inhospitable habitats on their migration pathway, cranes store fat they use as fuel to sustain themselves and make the longest flights between rest stops.

As disturbing the news was of thousands of migratory birds dying in Sambhar last year — village Khichan alone houses up to 40,000 cranes at a time in various batches and groups — there is little recognition of the disruption avoidable deaths of just one bird can cost scientific studies. The return journey of the demoiselle cranes to summer home in Mongolia will start sometime in March.

“Banding allows easy identification and helps establish connections between two distant sites the tagged bird visited. It helps provide information on lifespan and the bird’s ‘flight tendency’,” said Bohra.

Extremely upset at T-51’s death, Bohra said, “When a tagged bird meets such fate, the entire research is hampered. These deaths are completely avoidable.”

120,['10/01/2020'],‘Hyderabad declaration’ for curbs on money power in politics,"This story is from January 10, 2020

After the two-day deliberations on ‘Money power in politics— Indian democracy at work’ at ISB, a ‘Hyderabad declaration ’ was released enlisting steps to curb money power in politics. The conference organised by Foundation for Democratic Reforms (FDR) along with ISB and University of Hydrabad stressed on the need to disincentivise and deglamourise electoral office.

FDR president Jayaprakash Narayan said: “In recent decades, there has been an enormous increase of funds in political activity amounting to hundreds of crores of rupees. Realtors, land mafia, owners of educational institutions and big contractors make direct entry to gain access to the government. After the two-day deliberations, we came up with the Hyderabad declaration.”

According to the declaration, a concerted campaign should be taken up by civil society groups, Election Commission and citizens concerned on the consequences of money flooding into politics. The declaration also says that there is a need to strengthen and enforce legislations on political party funding and expenditure.

“There is no perfect electoral system. All electoral models have strengths and weaknesses. In the Indian context, elected legislators taking control of the fate of the government and becoming defector executives has led to competitive bidding for votes. Increasingly, a system of gift-giving to voters has developed. This has led to a vicious cycle of corruption, abuse of power and plutocracy,” said the declaration

The conference said a national-level conversation on alternative electoral models is the need of the hour. Election commissioner Ashok Lavasa said that some pending suggestions made to strengthen the Election Commission would help address loopholes. He said at many meetings held by MHA, they did not discuss about electoral offences. He said state governments should investigate and prosecute the cases.

Kolkata: The weeklong annual congregation of Christians of all denominations used to be a routine affair of praying and forgiving. But this year, Unity Octave , slated for January 18 to 25, will see Christians from over 100 churches in the city, praying for “conversion” of dissenting voices and coercive forces into one that speaks of kindness, love and inclusiveness. Community leaders feel that forgetting the divide of church denominations, people should unite in these difficult times and pray for a miracle so that peace returns.

The Roman Catholic , Anglican, Methodist, Baptist, Assembly of God and other protestant churches will take part in Unity Octave. Traditionally here, this programme, popularly called, The Week of Prayer, is celebrated between the feasts of St Peter and St Paul. Though the Vicar General of the Archdiocese of Kolkata (Roman Catholic church), Father Dominic Gomes , is the chief organiser, CNI is also partnering in the activities. “We try to forget all our differences and unite as a community of Christians for peace. This year, we will pray as a community for the country as a whole. Peace is the need of the hour and we need a miracle to happen,” the vicar said.

He insisted that while the Unity prayers will keep in mind the current atmosphere of fear and uncertainty, there is nothing political about the initiative. “We hope all quarrels will end and equality will be upheld…May all those who have hurt others through their words and actions be forgiven, too…” the vicar said.

The holy week will start with a service at Salvation Army on Lenin Sarani on January 18, followed by Ecumenical Sunday at churches across the city. Key services have been kept the whole week at Sacred Heart Church, Dharamtala, AG Church, Park Street, St Thomas Church, Free School Street, Fatima Church, CIT Road, Baptist Missionary Society and will end with a grand service at St Paul’s Cathedral on January 25.

AHMEDABAD: A 38-year-old man from Khokhra was arrested for posing as an officer of the NIA ( National Investigation Agency ) before a local court, when he went there in connection with a case of assault filed by him. He presented himself as an assistant commissioner of police (ACP) in the NIA and pressed his demand that the accused not be released on bail, but landed in legal trouble himself.

Inspector B Z Jhala of Khokhra police said the man, identified as Amit Arya alias Nasirkhan Pathan, was attacked by his neighbour on January 6, over a parking dispute. In connection with that case, the accused was produced before an additional chief metropolitan magistrate.

Arya had then submitted an application pleading that the accused should not be given bail and said that he was an ACP in the NIA. Arya’s friend, Saiyed Gulrez Alam, also submitted an affidavit substantiating Arya’s claim, said Jhala.

When the cops asked for proof of his identity, he could not produce any.

KANYAKUMARI/THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The two young men were not masked and wore skull caps. They had a close look at the place before firing at special sub-inspector (SSI) Y Wilson, 57, who was on duty at the small check post on Market Road at Kaliyakkavila on the inter-state border.

The duo escaped through the gates of the Muslim Jama-ath and made their way to Kerala after committing the crime late on Wednesday. These details and their identities became known from the CCTV footage recorded in the mosque that connects the check post to the main check post on the highway through the mosque premises.

The incident took place around 9.35pm when the two accused, now identified as Thoufique and Abdul Shamim, came on foot from the Kaliyakkavila market, crossed the check post where Wilson was alone and went to the back gate of the mosque less than 20m away. After waiting there for a minute, they walked to the check post and fired three to four rounds at Wilson. As he fell down unconscious, the duo ran back to the gate and walked out of the mosque through its front gate onto the Nagercoil - Thiruvananthapuram national highway. This was recorded on three CCTV cameras at the mosque and four more in a hospital, weigh bridge and two shops where the duo is seen walking past the inter-state border into Thiruvananthapuram.

IG south zone K P Shanmuga Rajeswaran said that there were also stab injuries on the body the nature of which can be confirmed only after obtaining the post mortem report.

Earlier, Tamil Nadu DGP J K Tripathy, IG south zone K P Shanmuga Rajeswaran and DIG Tirunelveli range Praveen Kumar Abhinapu along with senior officers from Kerala visited the scene of the crime for investigation. Five special teams under the superintendent of police of Kanyakumari district N Shreenath are out to nab the accused.

Police sources said the two have suspected terror links and have murder and attempted murder cases separately pending against them. While one of the suspects Shamim was involved in the murder of Hindu Munnani leader K P S Suresh Kumar in Chennai in 2014, the other suspect was involved in a few assault cases including the attempted murder of a BJP functionary, M R Gandhi, in Kanyakumari.

Meanwhile, in a statement issued in Thiruvananthapuram on Thursday, state police chief Loknath Behera said that anybody with valid information about the suspects could share it by contacting the police at state police control room numbers, 0471-2722500 or 9497900999. He also assured that the identity of the informants would be kept confidential to protect them from any harm.

The body of Wilson was laid to rest with full state honours at the burial ground of the CSI church at Marthandam.

Mangaluru: The Dakshina Kannada district police on Wednesday arrested two people in connection with a honeytrap case in Uppinangady .

The arrested are Lohith , a resident of Kushalnagara , and Sharif from Vittal . Jamal, Jeevan and Naushad, who were also involved in the case, are absconding.

Police said they received information that a few people under the guise of being Kerala police , were planning to raid a resort near Uppinangady where two couples were staying. They were informed that they would threaten and try to extort money from them. The police were tipped off about the same by their counterparts in Kerala.

Police said the accused are experts in setting honeytraps, and were involved in similar crimes since a long time. Their modus operandi was to use two women from Mangaluru to lure their intended targets.

Once they trap their target, the woman and victim are sent to resorts.

They then raid the resort posing as police officials, and click pictures in compromising positions of the victim with the woman.

They threaten to release the pictures on social media or TV channels, if they fail to pay up.

Varanasi: Days after being named in an FIR and cash reward being announced on two shooters of his gang, jailed don and BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari is again on the radar of Mau district administration and police in a fresh case of land grabbing.

After registering cases against 60 persons for their involvement in grabbing around 5 acre pond land in Jahagirabad locality under Dakshintola police station on Tuesday, district magistrate Mau Gyan Prakash Tripathi said that reports hint at Mukhtar’s involvement in the case.

“An investigation is still in progress in the case and if his role is confirmed, he would also be booked,” added the DM. A voluntary organisation Ganga Tamsa Seva Samiti had lodged a complaint of land grabbing with the district administration and Mau police. The land, which is a pond, is registered in the name of Hindu deity ‘Thakurji’, in revenue records.

The DM had ordered a probe in the case that revealed that about five acre land of such pond had been transferred in the name of several persons. He said that name of 60 persons became clear in the on-going probe after which an FIR was lodged with the police in this connection while more names are expected to come to light. Mukhtar’s name is also expected in the list.

When contacted Arya on Wednesday to know the reason for increased action against Mukhtar and his gang members in past few days, he said, the action against mafia elements and activities of their gang members is continuing for past several months to put a check on organised crime. Two months ago one more member Saud Abbasi of Mukhtar gang along with nine other persons had also been sent to jail in the cases of extortion.

Before Tripathi disclosed it, SP Mau Anurag Arya on Tuesday afternoon had announced cash rewards of Rs 25,000 on Mukhtar gang shooters — Anuj Kanojia and Ramu Mallah of Ghazipur each. The two were booked under Gangster Act 2010. Hearing in the case is still pending as the duo did not appear in court so far. After initiating the process of confiscating their properties, the process of announcement of reward was followed, he said adding efforts for their arrest has been intensified.

Earlier, on January 5, Mau police had lodged an FIR against six persons including Mukhtar, former station officer Dakshintola police station JK Singh, then lekhpal of area concerned, Israel Ansari, Anwar Shahzad and Salim under various IPC sections and 30 arms act.

Mukhtars recommendation had enable four persons to get arms licenses on fake addresses in 2001 while one of such license holders was eliminated in an encounter with police in Ghazipur in August 2008.

Kozhikode: Wayanad district collector Adeela Abdulla has filed a complaint with the cyber cell of the police against the alleged insulting and misleading social media posts against her after she accepted pro-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) pamphlet from BJP workers.

Adeela told media persons at the collectorate on Thursday that she was facing attacks on social media and she had asked the police to investigate the matter. She said that while there have been attempts to misuse the photograph of her accepting the pro-CAA pamphlet from BJP workers for political purposes, some people, who are opposed to CAA, too were making defamatory comments against her on social media. “I have filed a complaint with the cyber cell asking them to look into the insulting posts on social media as some comments were highly defamatory in nature, even amounting to insulting womanhood,” she said.

Responding to a question she said that she would not like to make personal comments on CAA as she was holding an official position as a bureaucrat. She, however, added that it was a fact that there were concerns among people about National Population Registry (NPR) and that her mother too has been worried about it. tnn

JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar

NEW DELHI: Ruling out the removal of JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar , the human resource development ministry on Thursday said that its priority was addressing academic issues.

Amit Khare, MHRD secretary, met JNU teachers and students even as a huge protest was held demanding removal of the VC. The ministry has asked the VC and other JNU officials to come for a meeting on Friday morning, which will be followed by an interaction with students and teachers in the afternoon.

After the meeting, Khare said, “JNU Teachers’ Association president professor (DK) Lobiyal, JNUSU president elect Aishe Ghosh and her entire team had a lot of grievances about the university administration not following the understanding that had been reached earlier.”

“We will ask the administration to implement the understanding developed earlier in the meeting tomorrow. We told students they can meet us at 3pm to address concerns regarding various fees. They’ve given us in writing that they are open to discussions. We are trying to bring JNU back to normalcy,” Khare added.

Amid growing demands for removal of Kumar, Khare said addressing academic issues was a priority rather than removing anyone. “Students shouldn’t be under pressure of deadline for registration and the ministry has asked the university to extend it,” he added.

The meeting with the MHRD secretary lasted over two hours after which the teachers and students said that issues remained inconclusive and the struggle would continue for now. The protesters then decided to march to Rashtrapati Bhavan. “We appealed with MHRD to remove the VC. However, we were told that we will have a dialogue tomorrow,” Ghosh said. The students said they will appeal with the President to remove Kumar.

“The future course of action will be decided after tomorrow’s meeting. The students placed their points of view and grievances. We were told that the ministry will have a meeting with the JNU administration to discuss the grievances of the students. After that, a meeting has been called with the students. We will wait for the outcome,” said Lobiyal.

After being pulled up by the ministry, the JNU administration at 10.50pm issued a circular stating that service and utility charges won’t be levied in the current registration for the winter semester. “UGC will bear the cost of service and utility charges proposed till further orders,” it added.

Mangaluru: The Mangaluru city police , who are probing violence during anti CAA and NRC protests in the city, that resulted in the death of two people, have started collecting data of people who were present during the protest, by using data from mobile towers.

According to sources, the collection of data through mobile towers will help police identify miscreants who were present during the violence.

Meanwhile, this will also help police to file a watertight case as it has accurate details about a person’s presence in a particular locality during the incident. The probing officers are also checking the presence of people from Kerala on December 19 in and around the Bunder area, where violence happened.

“We have collected data from all the phones that were operating when violence took place in a particular area. The data is huge and it’s a cumbersome task to isolate those who were involved in the violence. The process in going on in full swing, and it is giving us accurate details. We have collected a substantial amount of data. This will help to nail the miscreants easily, since it proves their physical presence when the violence was taking place,” said a source from the police department on condition of anonymity, adding that the police are extra careful to ensure that no innocent people are harassed.

“Usually in a mobile tower network, thousands of phones operate in a day. The place where the incident took place is in a central business district, that has a heavy movement of people throughout the day. We are carefully analysing all mobile phones and calls made in the area on December 19,” the source added.

A team comprising senior police officers from Bengaluru with local police personnel in Mangaluru, are involved in this particular probe area.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi

KOLKATA: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s two-day visit to the city is turning out to be a major security challenge after the Special Protection Group (SPG)’s advance liaison team suggested that he should take the road from the Kolkata airport to the city centre on Saturday and a riverine route to Belur .

While the details are yet to be firmed up, sources said Kolkata Police, on the other hand, had suggested the PM should use an IAF helicopter from the airport to the racecourse helipad, which would cut down on his travel time by an hour. Defence personnel are assisting state and central agencies to plan the security road map for the PM’s itinerary.

According to a source, Modi has three engagements in the city on Saturday. First, he is supposed to visit Currency Building at 5:30pm, then Millennium Park at 7pm and finally, Belur Math at 7.50pm before he returns to Raj Bhawan for the night. He is scheduled to attend a dinner, hosted by governor Jagdeep Dhankhar. The next morning, he will attend a programme at Netaji Indoor Stadium around 11am, where chief minister Mamata Banerjee is an invitee. Modi will leave Kolkata after the function.

Central Kolkata was likely to turn into a fortress , a source said. Police and SPG will take over all places, where the PM is supposed to visit, from Friday night. “While the essential drill, including multiple layers of security and deployment of commandos and combat forces in high-rises and towers, will be carried out, special effort is being made to set up multiple-layer barricades on the entire route. Traffic will be halted before the PM convoy moves. Security agencies are coordinating with Navy on whether Modi would travel to Belur in a special vessel or not,” the source said.

The security will be several notches tighter given the ongoing protests. While the agitation at the airport has been withdrawn, a protest at Kaikhali on VIP Road is still on. Another demonstration has been lined up outside Raj Bhawan, and both Left and Congress have planned to wave black flag. Left legislative leader Sujan Chakraborty has urged citizens to hit the streets. “People of Bengal will show the PM the mood of the state against CAA-NPR-NRC even if Trinamool doesn’t protest that day... He won’t have a smooth entry here,” he said.

NEW DELHI: Shilpa Mittal , the sister of Siddharth Sharma , a business consultant who was mowed down by a speeding Mercedes being driven by a teenager near Civil Lines in April 2016 , is disappointed by the Supreme Court verdict that ordered the accused to be treated as a juvenile in conflict with law.Speaking to TOI, Mittal rued that she now has to go back to Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) for trial. “It is a failure of our justice system when the apex court agrees that there is a loophole in the law, but cannot do anything about it. Because your system is flawed and incapable, you are accepting this. All you can say is sorry, but sorry doesn’t bring a dead man alive,” she said.Mittal said that such a decision coming from Supreme Court was totally unacceptable. “If a person commits a crime, the system grants justice to the victim. When you know the law is faulty and let the culprit go away, who should be held accountable then?” she questioned.“If the court’s decision was the other way round, it would have set an example for others. In this case, no one was being sent to prison for 100 years. It was just to set an example. You should come up and say there is a loophole. I don’t know whom to turn to now,” Mittal said.Talking about how the law had changed post the Nirbhaya case, Mittal said, “You are saying heinous crime, but the word minimum is mentioned too. This is childish and a complete joke. I don’t know whether to laugh or howl or cry. Clearly, the system is promoting the culprit. Who knows if he will again go and kill someone else because before my brother, he had another accident.

147,['10/01/2020'],Draw for devotion: Magh Mela starts today,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Allahabad: Over 3,500 security personnel spread across a 20-bigha area and a huge army of administrative officials would be ready to greet devotees when the Magh Mela kicks off in Allahabad on Friday.

The 43-day Magh Mela will start on Friday with the Paush Purnima snan and would end with the snan on Magha Purnima. The administration expects over 40 lakh pilgrims to visit the event. The estimate includes lakhs of kalpwasis, who would start camping along the banks of Ganga for a month while braving the cold.

During the entire month, kalpwasis camp along the banks and and lead an austere lifestyle to earn ‘punya’ (blessings). “It is believed that a holy dip on Paush Purnima liberates the soul from the cycle of birth and death,” said a local seer.

At the same time, thundershowers since the past two days have created new problems for the Mela administration, which had already been struggling to stem the damage unleashed by September’s floods. The rain has left a large part of the Magh Mela venue marshy and slippery. The authorities are trying to contain some of the damage by laying sand on the slippery ground. On the other hand, many organisations camping on the venue have been protesting at the Mela Adhikari’s office demanding more facilities.

“We are trying our best to provide all the facilities to the devotees and Kalpwasi’s coming to the mela despite adverse weather conditions”, said Mela Adhikari, Rajnish Mishra.

Magh Mela would be another test for both the police and administrative brass in Allahabad, given the praise it earned from various corners for organising the grand Kumbh Mela last year.

During the snan, devotees are expected to take a holy dip in the rivers, perform various rituals and donate to the needy. The Mela attracts devotees not only from UP, but from other states like Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand too.

A local priest camping on the Magh Mela venue said, “Paush Purnima marks the beginning of a month-long period of austerity which is observed during the Hindu month of ‘Magh’.” Local priests said that the ‘muhurat’ (auspicious timing) for a holy dip on Paush Purnima would start from 2.34am on Friday and end at 12.50pm on Saturday.

According to police, traffic restrictions will be introduced to streamline vehicular movement on routes leading up to the Mela venue on Friday. Besides, the entry of vehicles into the Mela ground too has been banned.

The authorities have made separate arrangements for vehicles and pedestrians to avoid chaos and jams on pontoon bridges. Pedestrians would be given the priority and be allowed to pass on pontoon bridges and Sangam area on snan days.

The Mela venue is replete with facilities like hospitals, primary health centres, transportation, sanitation, ghats, security, firefighting services, ration distribution, lost & found camp, potable water, pollution control and other civic amenities .

Teams of STF, ATS, bomb diffusal squads and anti-sabotage squad would be patrolling on ghats to ensure safety of the visitors. Meanwhile, companies of CRPF and PAC personnel along with hundreds of policemen have been deployed on the venue as part of security arrangements.

The administration has constructed temporary ghats stretching along five kilometres for the convenience of devotees wanting to bathe in the rivers. Jal Police personnel will also be deployed to check cases of drowning.

NEW DELHI: Former HRD minster and senior BJP functionary Murli Manohar Joshi on Thursday called for the removal of JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar, saying it is “shocking” that the VC is adamant on not implementing a government proposal to resolve fee-hike crisis in the varsity.

In the tweet, Joshi said: “Reports are, that the HRD ministry had twice advised the JNU VC to implement certain reasonable and working formula for resolving the issue of enhanced fees in JNU. He was also advised to reach out to the teachers and students. It is shocking that the VC is adamant for not implementing the government proposal. This attitude is deplorable and in my opinion such a VC should not be allowed to continue on this post.”

Joshi’s comments add to the clamour for Kumar’s removal. The human resource development ministry has, however, ruled out his removal saying sacking him was not the solution.

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Thursday sought an explanation from the state government over a petition challenging the continued imposition of Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and Section 37 of the Bombay Police Act in the city. The petition has been filed by a faculty member at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, (IIM-A) and four others, terming it suppressive.

The petitioners claimed that the persistent imposition of these sections has made Ahmedabad a war zone indefinitely, as if it is in permanent danger. It takes away the people’s right to get together to express themselves. They approached the HC after police detained students from outside the IIM-A campus on December 16, when they were protesting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

During the hearing, Justice S H Vora suggested that the authorities publish in newspapers the reasons along with the notification imposing Section 144 of the CrPC and Section 37 of the Bombay Police Act, prohibiting gatherings of more than four persons in public.

The petitioners complained that the restrictions have been in place in the city for the last three years. The people protesting did not know about this restriction were hence detained. The repetitive invocation of these provisions is against Article 19(1) of the Constitution.

The court said that the authorities should state why they are apprehensive of a nuisance and it should justify what nuisance is in its their notification. There must be specific purpose and reason for invoking these provisions or the people standing at pan parlours could also be detained.

The state government submitted that the existing notification under Section 144 of CrPC would lapse after two days. The court was also told that the government granted 107 permissions to people who wanted to protest CAA-NRC. Some of the gatherings turned violent as well.

The HC is to hear this matter further on January 22.

Quassim Suleimani

KOZHIKODE: Muslim community in Kerala is divided over the killing of Quassim Suleimani, the commander of Iran’s Quds Force who was murdered by the US forces in Iraq last Friday.

While majority of the Salafis hailed killing of Suleimani, others believes that the murder is an attempt by the US to foment trouble in the Middle East.

In an article published in ‘Vichinthanam’, Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen (KNM) state secretary A I Abdul Majeed Swalahi said the murder is a huge blow to Iran’s attempt to export Shia agenda in other countries.

“Suleimani is Iran’s general but his activities are mainly in other countries,” Swalahi told TOI.

The article says Suleimani is the one who exported Iran-sponsored terrorism to Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen. He was killed while trying to implement the dream project of Iran in Iraq, said Swalahi in the article.

Suleimani was heading the Shia project in the Arab-Islamic world by interfering into internal conflicts of the Arab world. Swalahi accused Suleimani of helping Shia militant groups and exploiting every opportunity for ‘Shiaization.’

“Suleimani’s death will be a blow to the Hezbollah in Lebanon, Houthis in Yemen and al-Ikhwan al-Muslimin (Muslim Brotherhood) in Egypt. Iran has been pumping millions of dollars to pursue the Shia interests in Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen and there was dissent in the country against these attempts,” he said.

“Suleimani’s hands are stained with the blood of infants in Yemen and Syria; he is not to be hailed as a hero,” Swalahi said, adding that with his death Iran’s attempts to interfere in the political affairs of other countries to implement the Shia agenda will be temporarily halted.

P Koya, national executive member of Popular Front of India (PFI), said that the Salafis have taken a stand against Suleimani because of their influence of Saudi Arabia. “Suleimani was a brave fighter. Saudi Arabia and Iran may have their own national interests, but that cannot be a reason for demonizing the general,” he said.

Jama’at-e-Islami thinks that it would be improper to brand Suleimani a terrorist. “He is the general of the army of a country. If he is a terrorist, then the generals of the armies of every country that wages war should be treated so,” said Sheikh Muhammad Karakkunnu, secretary of Jama’at-e-Islami.

“It is baseless to say that Suleimani had some truck with Muslim Brotherhood, which is basically a Sunni organization,” he said.

“The allies of the US, including Israel, have distanced themselves from the attack on Suleimani. They are persuading America to withdraw from a showdown in view of the deteriorating economic situation in the world,” he added.

Pinarayi Vijayan

KOCHI: In an attempt to woo investors and increase job creation in the state, the state government will subsidize new industrial projects, based on the number of employees. While inaugurating ASCEND Kerala 2020, a global investors’ meet, in Kochi on Thursday, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan declared that the government will be offering a five-year subsidy for investors who are going to invest in Kerala from April 2020 onwards.

“This will be applicable to all new projects that are going to be registered from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2025. The registered project will not take off the very next day and hence we are factoring in that and are giving a five-year period for completion of the project,” Vijayan said.

“We might give a substantial amount as a subsidy, but subject to the approval after further discussions. One thing is sure, the subsidy amount for a woman worker will be Rs 2,000 higher than that of a man – we are also aiming women empowerment through this project. Our ultimate aim is to eradicate unemployment in Kerala within the next 20 years,” he said.

However, the subsidy scheme will be offered only to those investors who enrol their employees with ESI and PF schemes. “With this project, we are expecting 37 lakh families to be brought under the social security net,” he said.

The CM also announced a number of other measures to increase ease of doing business. The local self-governments will be asked to create a conducive environment for employment generation, Vijayan said. “We will ask them to help create five new jobs every year for every 1,000 people in their area,” he said.

Another major announcement was the relaxation on the limit of land holdings of companies. “Currently there is a land ceiling of 15 acres a company could hold and this is restricting the operations of industries here. Hence, a company which has Rs 250 crore investments or employee strength of 1,000 will be exempted from this,” Vijayan said.

The ceiling for financial aid from Kerala industrial development corporation (KSIDC), fixed years ago, will be raised from the current Rs 35 crore to Rs 100 crore, chief minister said, adding that in deserving cases, this could even go beyond the limit.

RP Group chairman Ravi Pillai said that the Kerala MSME Facilitation Act 2019 had been hugely beneficial to the majority of industrial units in the state, as they belong to the MSME segment.

M A Yusuffali, chairman, LuLu Group, said that those who complain about the traffic congestion in Kerala should visit other states to understand the comparatively worse situations in those places.

MANGALURU: Customs officers at Mangaluru International Airport (MIA) thwarted attempts by passengers to smuggle gold and seized 1.6kg of gold valued at Rs 63.7 lakh in three separate cases on Monday and Tuesday. Officers arrested passengers in two of these cases since the value of gold seized was in excess of Rs 20 lakh, the department stated in separate tweets on Thursday. The modus operandi of smuggling was the same in two of the three cases.

In the first instance, officers on Monday seized 336.7g (net) gold of 24-karat purity in paste form valued at Rs 13.4 lakh from a passenger who arrived from Dubai. The gold was concealed in socks that the passenger had worn. On Tuesday, gold of 24-karat purity weighing 716g (net) valued at Rs 29.1 lakh was seized from a passenger who arrived from Dubai. The gold was seized in paste form concealed in the body. The passenger was arrested.

Again, on Tuesday, custom officers were back in action, seizing 24K purity gold weighing 523g (net) valued at Rs 21.2 lakh from a passenger who arrived from Dubai.

Kochi: A police force that is unable to provide protection to unload materials from a lorry citing opposition from trade union workers is a shame to the state, the high court said on Thursday. Considering a contempt of court petition against Idukki SP T Narayanan and Kumily CI V K Jayaprakash, justice PB Suresh Kumar asked whether this is the business-friendly atmosphere being projected by Kerala.

The contempt of court case was filed by Cochin Granites after being obstructed by Kumily unit of Head Load and General Workers Union while unloading Kota stones brought to Government Higher Secondary School, Kumily. The stones were brought to the site on a lorry on December 7, 2019 and the petitioner firm had unloaded 75% stones using its registered workers. When four workers of the union obstructed, help was sought from Kumily CI. When police failed to provide protection, the firm approached the HC which ordered for providing protection to unload stones on December 12. Alleging contempt of court against police officers, the petitioner has alleged that no protection was granted despite producing the court’s orders. Asking the inspector to inform the steps taken to implement the orders in person, the court has scheduled further hearing on Monday.

Ajay Bhatt

DEHRADUN: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state president Ajay Bhatt on Thursday said Anglo-Indian legislator George Ivan Gregory Mann has the option to approach the government with his demand for a review of the 126th Constitutional Amendment Bill, which seeks to exclude the Anglo-Indian quota in state assemblies and Lok Sabha.

The Union BJP government on January 7 had ratified the 126th constitutional amendment, which extended the SC/ST quota for another 10 years but ignored a similar quota for legislative representation of Anglo-Indians. Upset by the development, Mann had claimed the data used to discontinue the quota was faulty and wanted BJP to review the decision of excluding the community.

Speaking on the issue, BJP state president Ajay Bhatt said, “The (SC/ST) amendment was passed by Parliament. If the MLA thinks it should be reviewed, then he should write to the government. Our party position is very clear that SC/ST reservation must stay, and since the population of Anglo-Indians is in the country is now very low, so the matter of their quota will be decided later."" Bhatt added that according to census data, the total population of Anglo-Indians in India is not more than 500.

“If he [Mann] has any issue with the census data, he can write to the government and seek a review. The decision to not extend the quota was taken on the basis of the low number,” said Bhatt. Regarding the ratification of the 126th amendment, BJP legislator Mahendra Bhatt had recently said that well-off SC/ST community members must not get benefits of reservation. In response, BJP state president Bhatt said, “It was his personal view, and not the party’s position. ”

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Thursday directed Tihar Jail authorities to facilitate medical treatment to jailed Bhim Army chief Chandra Shekhar Azad , who is suffering from a blood-thickening disorder , at AIIMS , where he is already undergoing treatment.

“Since the doctors from AIIMS have reported that the accused is suffering from polycythemia and the fact that the accused has been getting treatment from AIIMS for the last one year, this court hereby directs the jail superintendent concerned at Tihar Jail to ensure that the accused is treated... be given therapeutic phlebotomy and be taken for treatment at AIIMS, where his treatment is already going on.

According to the plea filed by Azad’s lawyers, his condition “requires continuous check-up from the doctors concerned”. The plea further said, “The treatment of the accused is going for a long time under the supervision of the doctor concerned and requires day-to-day check. Medical attention needs to be given for as and when, within a week or maximum 10 days, when the blood turns thick, it can be let out by the procedure of “phlebotomy”, the plea said. “If it is not done, it may become a cause of cardiac attack,” it added.

Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty

Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty’s concert ended at 3am on Thursday, yet at about 11.15am he sang a few notes into the phone to elucidate the concept of vaad-samvaad to TOI. ""Vaad-samvaad is the fifth-note relationship: sa-pa, re-dha...this relationship is harmony,"" Pandit Chakrabarty, the titan of the Patiala-Kasur Gharana, told TOI. Panditji’s sunny explication showed that he is both a maestro and a master at every moment. In fact, Pandit Ravi Shankar had applauded Pandit Chakrabarty’s efforts to teach Indian classical music.

Saptak is commemorating Pandit Ravi Shankar’s 100th birth centenary year. So at the start of his concert on Day 8, on Wednesday, Pandit Chakrabarty played a reminder of the sitar legend’s extraordinary range. ""I chose Kalavati because Pandit Ravi Shankarji played a lot of Carnatic ragas,"" Pandit Chakrabarty said. ""I sang in the North Indian style. Kalavati, Hamsadhvani, Charukeshi, and Saraswati...these are all basically Carnatic ragas, but are appreciated in both styles.""

Pandit Chakrabarty had prefaced his Kalavati essay by questioning those who are dismissive of ragas such as Hamsadhvani. ""Why is Hamsadhvani considered a small raga ? Is it because it has only five notes? Bhoopali also has only five notes,"" Pandit Chakrabarty told TOI. ""But in Bhoopali, there are many instances of samvaad. Ragas are fully elaborated when vaad-samvaad relationships are maximum in number.""

Saptak rasikas were lucky to be part of this spell of art and introspection.

159,['10/01/2020'],Controversies &amp; irregularities mired AU VC’s four-year stint,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Allahabad: The four-year stint of Prof RL Hangloo as the vice-chancellor of Allahabad University ( AU ) was mired with a series of controversies and allegations.

Besides financial and administrative irregularities, he was also accused of favouritism, sexual misconduct and improper handling of complaints of sexual harassment and lack of grievance cell for redressal of complaints.

A three-member team is likely to visit AU campus to probe allegations against Prof Hangloo, who resigned on January 1. Former president of Allahahad University Students’ Union (AUSU) Rohit Mishra said, “We will meet the three-member probe team and hand over to it all the relevant papers, corroborating the allegations levelled by us.” Fingers were raised on teachers’ selection process at AU and its constituent colleges in 2018-19.

Allegations were made that interviews of candidates at constituent colleges lasted 3-4 minutes only.

At CMP Degree College, more than 210 candidates were called for interviews for 14 posts of assistant professors and, on an average, 65-70 candidates were interviewed on first two days between 10am and 5pm. On the third day, however, nearly 60 candidates where interviewed in just three hours.

Candidates claimed that many aspirants who were selected were either related to top-ranking university officials or teachers. Eyebrows were also raised on the selection of two administrative functionaries on “illegally instituted posts” at AU (OSDs to VC and Registrar). The OSD to VC was appointed against the post of semi-professional assistant, a post which is exclusively meant for library for which the essential qualification is BLib (bachelor of library sciences), which he did not possess. Same was the case with a number of other appointments where meritorious candidates, who were pursuing courses at eminent universities of US and UK and had research papers published in reputed journals were not selected.

Names of selection committee members were also out before the commencement of interviews and the worst part was that the selection committee was same for CMP and Shyama Prasad degree college in gross violation of UGC guidelines. In 2018, the campus was rocked by two audio tapes of purported talks between the VC and his Delhi-based female friend.

On September 5, 2018, a student leader leaked an alleged WhatsApp conversation between Prof Hangloo and the said lady which allegedly had some explicit content too. Prof Hangloo was also in news for facilitating plum postings for his close aides. The person appointed as estate officer as well as in charge of legal cell by Prof Hangloo, was the one against whom the UP Government had written several letters to AU (when it was a state university) and four committees appointed by the respective VCs also gave adverse reports against him.

Likewise, the terms of appointment of registrar and finance officer were changed after interview and selection by EC in April 2017, which constrained selected persons to refuse appointment.

Prof Hangloo was also accused of financial irregularities as it was his decision not to pay former teachers of AU as guest faculty. Later in 2018, the teachers got relief from Allahabad high court and were paid Rs 1.5 crore for a period of around two months without taking even a single class. During his tenure, decision to shut down the Institute of Correspondence Course was taken which left more than 100 employees jobless. The decision was challenged in the high court which, in a recent judgment, quashed the decision and directed that the employees be paid their salary of nearly three years. The implementation of the judgment is likely to cost over Rs 40 crore to the university.

AU panel for security: Slammed with allegations of lax security at Women’s Hostel campus, Allahabad University (AU) will now set up a committee to look into hostel inmates’ safety. During a meeting on Thursday, AU officiating vice-chancellor KS Mishra said a legal awareness programme would also be organised in hostels and CCTV cameras would be set up only at WH’s main gate and kitchen area.

CHANDIGARH: Giving no interim relief to street vendors, the Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday directed the municipal corporation (MC) to file a progress report in the case and locate more zones to accommodate them while segregating the cases pertaining to Punjab, Chandigarh and Haryana.

The court also directed the civic body to provide basic amenities to vendors, warning officials not to abuse statutory provisions of the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014, or they would have to pay penalty from their pockets. The court also directed the MC to apprise it about ‘natural markets’ mentioned in the Act.

The matter would come up for hearing on March 26.

The counsel for the vendors argued that they had been shifted to Sector 15 without application of mind and were struggling to make a living. The vendors claimed the authorities had flouted rules by removing them from ‘natural market’. Under the Act, ‘natural markets’ are those established more than 50 years ago, they said. “Sector 22 was established in 1956 and is a natural market. Still, the authorities removed vendors from there against the rules,” the counsel said.

It was argued vendors were facing the wrath of nature, to which the court directed the MC to provide them with basic amenities. Vendors objected to pucca sites, demanding they be shifted to places having more footfalls. The court observed that resource feasibility had to be taken into account and the administration too was grappling with the issue.

Earlier, MC commissioner Kamal Kishore Yadav filed a status report in the court, mentioning that the MC started the process of relocation of registered vendors as per law from December 6, 2019. The MC claimed it scrutinised and forwarded grievances submitted by market association/resident welfare association and others to the sub-committee which held a meeting on December 2, 2019. The report said the MC allotted 1,038 sites on December 4. The total sites allotted in phases 1, 2, 3 and 4 draw of lots were 4,284 under E-ESP category. Till December 12, 2,845 out of the 4,284 registered street vendors had been shifted.

161,['10/01/2020'],Deepika-starrer ‘Chhapaak’ declared tax-free by Nath govt,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Bhopal: Two days after actor Deepika Padukone stood in solidarity with protesters at JNU, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath on Thursday declared her upcoming movie, ‘Chhapaak’, tax-free. On the same day, BJP leader Gopal Bhargava attacked Deepika and suggested she stick to “dancing in Mumbai”.

Chhapaak, the reel biography of an acid attack victim, is due for release on January 10. Nath took to Twitter to announce his decision and said the film gives a positive message to society.

“I declare the Deepika Padukone-starrer ‘Chhapaak’, based on acid attack survivors, and set for release on January 10 in cinema halls all over the country, tax free in Madhya Pradesh,” tweeted the CM on Thursday.

Padukone had visited the JNU campus in Delhi on Tuesday night to express solidarity with students who were protesting against the January 5 mob attack. She did not address the gathering, but her presence was enough to spark a nationwide debate.

Praising the concept of the movie, Nath said, “The film gives a positive message to society about women who are acid attack survivors, by portraying their story of pain, confidence, struggle, hope and their determination to live and gives a message to bring about a change in society’s thinking in such cases.”

Leader of Opposition (LoP) in MP assembly, Gopal Bhargava used rather coarse words to criticise her. “What are actors and actresses supposed to do among students, whose only work is reading and writing? They should let students do their work and the actress should sit in Mumbai, performing her dance,” Bhargava told reporters at a press conference on CAA in MP’s Harda on Thursday. “Heroines’ work is to dance in Bombay. Why should they go to JNU? Those who are interested in politics, should contest elections to test the waters,” he added.

The state BJP questioned the Congress government’s decision to declare ‘Chhapaak’ tax-free. “Instead of making the film tax-free, the government could have supported and treated acid-attack survivors, given them legal aid and arrested those involved in such crimes. Chief minister Kamal Nath's decision is politically motivated, meant to take mileage of the situation that has arisen after Deepika's JNU visit,” said BJP state spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal.

The state Congress strongly objected to Bhargava’s remark. Congress media coordinator Narendra Saluja said, “Bhargava’s statement is shameful. He should then come clear on what he thinks about actresses related to BJP, like Hema Malini, Kiron Kher and Smriti Irani. In fact, the previous BJP government paid lakhs of rupees to Hema Malini and her daughter for their dance performances at state-run events. Where was Bhargava then? His statement is an insult to women.”

NEW DELHI: Hundreds of students gathered at the Arts Faculty on Thursday afternoon to participate in an event organised by the Miranda House Queer Collective. The event was held for students to show solidarity with their counterparts from other colleges in their protest against the recent violent attacks.

Unlike other protests in the city, this was one where students were seen carrying musical instruments, candles, ribbons and posters to showcase their dissent through the medium of art . Students also used sloganeering as well as street plays in a bid to ensure that their voices are heard.

“I have been a part of many protests that have taken place in the city of late. This one stands out because here we are not concentrating on mere sloganeering but on creating art that touches the chord and attracts the attention of people. We want more and more of them to join us in our cause and stand in solidarity with the students who have been attacked,” said Chhavi, a student of KMC.

Her friend Tanvi Sharma said that they cannot let the protests die down. “If we sit silent today, tomorrow we will be the ones who will be attacked. We, till sometime back, used to think that universities were among the safest places for students. But our belief has been shattered now,” she added.

The Miranda House Queer Collective had called upon the student community across the city to join the event in solidarity with the students who became the victims of the recent violent attacks on them.

“We are made to feel safe at least by our teachers who are standing with us through this tough time. This is the age in which we should be gathering the maximum education at the universities. But here we are out on the streets to get justice for the students who have been attacked. What is wrong is wrong and attack on students shall never be accepted in a civilised society like ours,” said Karishma Singh, a student from IP university.

Kochi: Along with political stability and law and order, Kerala needs stronger, skilled labour, industry-friendliness and innovation boost-up - all of which are on a reform mode, ASCEND 2020 Global Investors Meet noted.

A plenary session on ‘Doing Business in Kerala — Key Enablers for Industrial Reforms’, also highlighted the role of MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises), industrial parks and single-window facility in making the state a fast-developing hub for entrepreneurs.

Launched a year ago to position the state as an investment hotspot, the initiative also aims at boosting the Rebuild Kerala mission.

Sanjay Garg, principal secretary (industries and commerce), said Kerala has of late been a haven for MSMEs, which produce almost a third of the country’s industrial products and nearly half of the exports. He said Kerala had seen the emergence of 55,026 medium and small-scale enterprises since 2016, taking their current total to 1,31,925. Of them, the top units are in agro, textiles and general engineering sectors .

The Kerala state industrial development corporation (KSIDC) MD, M G Rajamanickam, speaking on ‘Single-Window Facility and Support to Investors’, threw light on a couple of recent amendments made to secure licences quicker and smoother.

Kinfra managing director Santhosh Koshy Thomas highlighted the role of the industrial infrastructure development corporation, which had 7,000 acres of land bank along with 700 units and provide direct employment to 20,000 people. Having provided an investment of Rs 1,750 crore, the 1993-founded Kinfra is now readying to realize 24 well-defined industrial parks. “We have identified 20-core competency areas,” he revealed.

171,['10/01/2020'],Nagpur: MTDC takes over Ambazari garden for tourism development,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Representative image

NAGPUR: Two-and-a-half years after obtaining lease from the state government, the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation ( MTDC ) took over possession of city’s biggest park — Ambazari garden — from the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) a couple of days ago.

Through its Mumbai-based PPP operator Garuda Amusements Park (Nagpur) Pvt Ltd, the MTDC has planned to continue the garden and add fitness, recreational, amusement, tourism, club house and commercial activities in the sprawling 44-acre land at a cost of Rs80-100 crore.

Vinay Wavdhane, MTDC’s executive engineer, told TOI that the garden will remain open for morning walkers and visitors on the lines of the NMC. “The operator has been directed to continue pass system for morning walkers. Even the entry fees will remain the same for morning walkers,” he said.

MTDC’s commitment towards morning walkers will prevent criticism from the public. In a letter submitted to the NMC, office-bearers of Jan Samasya Nivaram Manch had feared of setback to morning walkers.

Wavdhane said the operator will have to develop the garden as per the conceptual plan, which will be approved by the MTDC within two years followed by operation and maintenance for 28 more years.

“Earlier, the NMC had developed the garden on only 19 acres and the remaining area was in an abandoned condition. Now, the MTDC will bring the entire land to use. The operator is allowed concrete construction of only 0.15 floor space index (FSI) as the entire area is reserved as green zone. Therefore, there will be no multi-level buildings and all activities will be facilitated in a green and eco-friendly manner,” he said.

It will be MTDC’s first ever PPP project and also the first in an urban city in the state. Without any expenditure, the MTDC is likely to earn Rs1.50 crore per annum from the project.

As per the preliminary conceptual master plan, the MTDC will add a cycling track along the existing walking track, green gym and a recreational hut in the garden. The urban hut of 50 commercial shops will be developed followed by amphitheatre, exhibition & art gallery and herbal/botanic arena.

The children play area will be transformed into a state-of-the-art amusement park which will have water park, fish aquarium, food court and souvenir shops.

Left abandoned by the civic body for decades, the operator will develop the community centre with banquet halls, party lawns, resort of 20 rooms and kitchen. A club house with swimming pool, gymnasium, table tennis court, cards room, badminton court, lawn tennis court, squash room, bar-cum-restaurant, jacuzzi, steam bath etc will be also be developed.

West Nagpur MLA Vikas Thakre said the NMC should take over the garden back as people will lose their property once the private operator starts to develop it. “Any private operator will look for its own benefit. Banquet halls, lawns, club house etc will pollute the green zone and water body. Families visit the garden in large numbers due to low fees. The operator will keep high entry fees for all types of activities,” he said.

“People residing in adjoining areas like Verma layout, Ambazari, Pandhrabodi etc are opposing the move. I will talk to people and raise the issue with the government if all wish the NMC to continue taking care of the garden,” he added.

172,['10/01/2020'],"Haridwar: Forest field officers to get salary hike, a month’s additional pay","This story is from January 10, 2020

Representative image

HARIDWAR: In a major relief to forest field officers , the state government has given an ‘in principle’ approval to provide a salary hike , one month’s additional salary and other perks, apart from acceding to their demands of overhauling the promotion structure. The decision was taken on Wednesday although a final go-ahead from the cabinet is still awaited.

Uttarakhand has approximately 3,640 sanctioned posts of forest guards, of which 1,218 are vacant and out of 1,628 sanctioned posts of foresters, 316 are vacant, whereas out of 408 sanctioned posts of deputy ranger, 197 are vacant. Similarly out of 308 sanctioned posts of forest rangers, 61 lie vacant.

The state is home to some of the most magnificent wildlife sanctuaries and national parks of the country, including two tiger reserves – Corbett Tiger Reserve and Rajaji Tiger Reserve.

Forest minister Harak Singh Rawat said that considering the harsh weather conditions and difficult terrain in which the officials have to protect forest and wildlife, the government decided to increase the pay. “Just like our police force, the forest field force has been actively stopping poaching and safeguarding our natural resources in such extreme weather conditions. They have also been saving precious wildlife like snow leopards and tigers from poachers and protecting medicinal plants like keedajadi from mafias. So, they deserve similar perks and motivation for their hard work.” Rawat said.

Meanwhile, the workers of four unions—State President of Forest Reserve Association, Assistant Forest Staff Union, Deputy Ranger Union and Ranger Union—are demanding the government to give more preference to promotion than direct hiring, especially for the post of forest ranger.

“For the post of forest ranger from deputy ranger, the ratio should be enhanced from existing 50:50 to 66.66:34.34 ratio, out of which 66% posts should be through promotion rather than direct entry. We are demanding this because the experience of having worked for so many years should be given more weightage, as a deputy ranger holds experience of around 20-30 years,” said one of the members of four unions, who participated in the meeting on Wednesday.

Thiruvananthapuram: Water supply will be disrupted in the city on Saturday for the third phase of renovation works at 86mld water-treatment plant at Aruvikkara . The water supply will be shut down for six hours.

The renovation work will be from 2pm to 8pm on Saturday, because of which water supply will be partly or completely disrupted in some areas in the city.

The water pumping from the treatment plant will be restarted at 8pm on Saturday and the supply is expected to be normalized at all areas by 6pm on Sunday.

“The renovation work being taken up in four phases will improve water supply by an additional 10 million litres of water per day (mld). The first and second phases of the renovation were completed on December 13, 2019, and on January 4, respectively,” Kerala water aauthority ( KWA ) said.

The water supply is shut down in four phases for replacing pump sets and other equipment. The old pump sets and pumping lines in two pump houses will be removed and their electrical work will be completed in the third phase. The pump sets and electrical equipment at 86mld water treatment plant date back to two decades; this resulted in reduction of their efficiency and led to water shortage.

The areas were water supply will be disrupted are Kowdiar, Peroorkada, Pipinmoodu, Sathamangalam, Kochar Road, Edapazhanji, Kanakanagar, Vellayambalam, Marappalam, Pattom, Medical College, RCC, Sri Chitra Medical Centre, Kumarapuram, Ulloor, Prasanth Nagar, Akkulam, Cheruvaikal, Pongamoodu, Sreekariyam, Chempazhanthi, Kariyam, Parottukonam, Nalanchira, Mannanthala, Kesavadasapuram, Paruthipara, Chalakuzhy, Muttada, Ambalamukku, Vazhayila, Kudappanakunnu, Jawahar Nagar, Nathancode, Devaswom Board Junction, Poudikonam, Kazhakootam, Kariavattom, Technopark, Manvila, Kulatoor, Pallipuram, Alathara and CRPF Junction.

The fourth phase of the renovation will take place on February 1, and the 86mld and 74mld treatment plants will be shut down for 16 hours.

There are three KWA water-treatment plants at Aruvikkara with capacity of 86mld, 74mld and 72mld. The construction of the new water-treatment plant with a capacity of 75mld is in progress.

During shutdown, KWA will arrange partial supply to Medical College. Tankers will supply water to institutions such as RCC and Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology. KWA will also ensure water supply by tanker to hospitals and police personnel. In addition to KWA tankers, city corporation, police and CRPF will deploy tankers for water supply.

175,['10/01/2020'],MP Rape Capital Of India 8th Yr In A Row,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Indore: Registering highest number of rape cases in 2018, Madhya Pradesh retained the dubious distinction of remaining the rape capital of the country for eight consecutive years. But police say — all is well, claiming that women are safe here as numbers don’t depict the ground reality.

In National Crime Record Bureau report 2018 released on Wednesday, MP with fifth highest population in the country accounted for 5,433 rape cases out of 33,356 recorded across the country in 2018. MP is followed by Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh with 4,335 and 3,946 rape cases registered respectively.

DGP VK Singh said that though the state recorded highest number of crimes against women, such incidents have come down to 27,106 from 27,953 in 2017 and 26719 in 2016, according to NCRB data.

“I don’t agree with these figures at all. The ground reality is very different from what the figures show. Women feel much safer in MP as compared to other states. I have seen women walk and drive on streets alone late night which is a testimony in itself of how safe they feel. The figures can always be misleading as there is a difference between number of cases reported and registered. We take crime against women very seriously and so all such cases are given importance. There are more crimes reported in other states but number of cases registered is low,” DGP Singh told TOI.

Of 5,433 girls and women raped in 2018 in state, 2,830 were minors followed by Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh with 1,353 and 1,215 such cases respectively.

While in 2017 there was a 14% increase in rape cases, 2018 saw a decrease of 3% in rape cases from 5562 to 5433.

NCRB figures revealed that MP in 2018 reported maximum cases of rape cases/victims reported in the country. Besides it also had highest number of cases, when it came to rape with girls aged between 6 and 18 years as well as rapes with women aged between 45 and 60 years and those aged 60 or above. Further analysis showed that in cases of rape with minor girls, MP accounted for 30.3% of total such cases nationally in 2018 with 2830 cases.

DGP added that crimes against women are mostly committed by people, who are in their close proximity. “To address this, we have started many awareness campaigns for minor girls, college going girls and women and there has been a positive impact always,” he said.

CHANDIGARH: The UT administration on Wednesday notified the land acquisition, rehabilitation and resettlement authority.

Last week, UT administrator V P Singh Badnore approved the constitution of a one-member authority to be headed by district and sessions judge of Mohali or a representative of his.

A senior UT official said the setting up of the authority would help in timely execution of the government’s projects in the city and ensure compensation, rehabilitation and resettlement of people affected due to land acquisition. The authority will provide speedy disposal of disputes related to land acquisition, compensation, rehabilitation and resettlement. The affected parties will be able to appeal against the order of the land acquisition officer (district collector) with authority, the official said.

After the constitution of the authority, no civil court (other than the high court or the Supreme Court) will have jurisdiction to entertain any dispute related to land acquisition in respect of which the collector or the authority is empowered, and no injunction shall be granted by any court in respect of any such matter.

Cheats using apps to get mobile information

After disconnecting the phone, Deepak realised that while he was busy talking to Rahul, the cheats had diverted Rs 44,980 in four transactions from his bank account linked to Paytm. So, he called his bank and got his account blocked, but the money was already gone.

Both complainants has submitted their complaints to the public window at police headquarters, which forwarded those to the cyber cell for investigation.

Devinder Singh, CCIC incharge of the UT police, said the cell has been flooded with complaints of frauds in the name of Paytm KYC update. They are getting two-three complaints every day, he said.

He said that cheaters generally ask Paytm users to download apps like “Quick Viewer” and “Team Support”. “These apps are actually applications to remotely access your mobile phones. Once users enter their details in the app, fraudsters get full control of their devices. Next they ask customers to make a token payment from their debit or credit card to Paytm (to keep the account alive), which gives them all the required details to do online transactions.”

The cyber cell unit of UT police has also written to Paytm to make their customers aware regarding fraudulent SMSs and calls, so that people do not fall prey to such fraud.

Coimbatore: The chief judicial magistrate court on Thursday dismissed the petition filed by the parents of former Tiruchengode DSP R Vishnupriya, who was found hanging in police quarters on September 18, 2015 , opposing the CBI’s second closure report on the case.

The court accepted the CBI’s report in the death of Vishnupriya that stated it was a suicide case and ruled out any instance of abatement.

The CBI had submitted the first closure report in May 2018, stating there was no foul play behind the death of the DSP and that it was a pure case of suicide. Her parents M Ravi and B Kalaiselvi then filed a petition before the court, saying there were lots of contradictions in the report filed by the CBI, which they said had reproduced the report of the Crime Branch CID.

Following the petition, the CBI’s closure report was dismissed by the chief judicial magistrate and the court ordered the investigation agency to continue further investigation. The agency submitted its second closure report before the court on August 29, 2019, and stuck to its earlier claim that it was a case of suicide. But the late DSP’s parents filed a petition on November 7, 2019 and objected to the report. The proceedings of the case had concluded on January 7 when the court examined five police officers and parents of Vishnupriya. The court on Thursday accepted the second closure report filed by the CBI and dismissed the petition by the late DSP’s parents.

Kochi: Around 22 flat owners will begin a protest against the Supreme Court-appointed compensation committee alleging that they have not received the immediate compensation of Rs 25 lakh as ordered by the apex court. They said that the amount should be given before the demolition happens. Moreover, they alleged that the committee has not started initiatives to assess how the remaining compensation will be paid to each flat owner and the amount each one will get.

“Around 57 flat owners didn’t get the immediate compensation (Rs 25 lakh) until Thursday noon. Several times, we approached the commission seeking a solution and we did not get a proper response. Finally, when we raised this concern in public in front of the media, a GO was issued stating the funds have been sanctioned for 35 more flat owners. But the money is yet to be credited to our accounts. Even now there are 22 flat owners who have not received a confirmation,” said S Jayakumar, a flat owner of Holy Faith H20.

Meanwhile, sources associated with the committee said that the committee sanctioned Rs.62 crore and released Rs.49.36crore. A sum of Rs 8.75 crore has been sanctioned for 35 flat owners on Thursday. With this, the total released sum stands at Rs 58.11 crore (94%).

“All applicants (except builders/their family members) was allotted Rs 25 lakh each and the government was informed of the same. Owing to paucity of funds, government is delaying payment to some claimants. They can approach the government or the Supreme Court. The committee has nothing to do with the disbursal of the amount,” said a source.

Flat owners plan to stage a protest in front of the commission’s office at PWD Rest House in Ernakulam. “A sum of Rs 25 lakh is not enough for the loss we suffered. The assessment of compensation has not started yet and the flats will be demolished within two days. How will the commission assess the deserving compensation for all of us?” asked Biyoj Chennattu, a flat owner of Holy Faith H20.

Tirupur: With the third edition of Alagumalai jallikattu scheduled to be held on February 2, bull owners have been asked to register their bulls to take part in the event.

The district administration directed people to take the bulls to nearby government veterinary clinics, where veterinarians would check the health of the bulls and online registration would be done. Only the bulls that completed registration would be allowed to participate in the event.

“The bulls should be registered separately with our association to take part in the event. The district administration said it was mandatory to register with the veterinary department, but jallikattu bull owners’ associations have opposed it. The bull owners say that there were practical difficulties in registering with the department,” said S Palanisamy, president of the Alagumalai Jallikattu Welfare Association. “For instance, each bull can take part only in four jallikattu events as per the veterinary department. But sometimes, a bull would get registered but would be returning without participating in an event due to time limitation.”

T Rajesh of Jallikattu Paathukaappu Nala Sangam said the forum represented the issue with the sate animal husbandry department. “We were promised that it would not be mandatory this year. In case of fitness tests, it would be done at the venue so that only the fit bulls take part in the event.”

File photo for representation

NEW DELHI: The inclusion of ""gig workers"" in new labour laws, offering millions of informal workers like Uber drivers and Swiggy riders benefits like health insurance and other schemes, is set to be okayed by Parliament's standing committee on labour which concluded its discussions on Thursday.

In its brief to the committee, headed by BJD MP Bhartruhari Mahtab, the government said that new definitions have been included to cater to emerging forms of employment like aggregator, gig worker and platform worker.

""For these workers, schemes can be formulated by the central government with regard to disability cover, health and maternity benefits ,"" it said. The code on social security, one of four codes that are intended to refashion 43 labour laws, seeks to extend coverage of employees state insurance corporation act across India and to all establishments employing 10 or more employees.

Earlier the ESIC Act's applicability was based on the concept of notification for each district or a part of it and the law can be specific to hazardous occupations.

""In such (hazardous) classes of establishment, the threshold can be even one worker,"" the government has said, adding that an employer of a plantation may opt for the ESIC by willingly joining the corporation.

The committee seems in agreement with the view that these measures will go a long way in extending social security for medical services, sickness and maternity benefits as also dependent pension and employee compensation.

Thresholds for provident fund, ESIC, gratuity, maternity benefits and social security can be set or changed through notifications rather than amendments of specific acts.

At present, under the unorganised workers social security act , 2008, there is no provision of electronic registration of workers. It has been proposed that an unorganised worker will submit a self declaration electronically or otherwise in a form to an authority prescribed by government.

A registered unorganised worker will be assigned a unique number based on Aadhaar .

Stiff fines have been proposed, with increases of as much as 10-fold, as earlier the fines were last revised in 1998.

At the same time there is a provision of prior warning for improvement and for complying with the new code. The news codes are likely to be discussed and voted on in the second half of the budget session.

HYDERABAD: In an indication of the tough times ahead for the economy, various banks in Hyderabad have issued e-auction notices to defaulters to recover Rs 18,827 crore in just six months — from July 2019 to January 5, 2020.As many as 226 e-auction notices were issued during the period in a bid to recover loan dues from pledged properties and securities of defaulters. In fact, some auctions have already been conducted while others are in the process.All the defaulting companies are based in Hyderabad.One can gauge the scale of the default from the fact that Rs 18,000 crore is what the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir lost in terms of business since the August 5 clampdown by Centre.TOI analysed bank e-auction notices issued by major banks, including SBI, Andhra Bank , Syndicate Bank , Canara Bank , UCO bank , Bank of Baroda, Indian Bank and Union Bank. Major defaulters were infrastructure projects, along with power projects, cotton and spinning mills, food processing, paper boards and agro-tech firms.Banking experts say businesses failing to repay loans is not new and is a pan-India problem. But the problem seems to be getting alarming in recent days. Bankers are worried as some companies have pledged disputed land and where the government has interests as guarantee for huge sums.In some cases, property prices were inflated. “A major infrastructure company took more than Rs 580 crore and defaulted. Because other properties are in dispute, the banker has put about 475 sq yards in Guttala Beghumpur in Serilingmapally for e-auction. Even if bank auctions the land, it will be able to recover only Rs 5 crore,” a chief general manager of a bank said.Banking expert and former IDBI director K Narsimha Murthy blames both central and state governments for the current situation. Government dues contribute 50% of total non-performing assets (NPAs) of banks.“The governments should stop freebies and clear the dues,” he said. “According to estimations, government owes private firms about Rs 5 lakh crore. This includes power distribution companies and other sectors. When governments don’t pay the dues to contractors and agencies, firms can’t run their offices and pay salaries to their employees. Micro, small and medium scale (MSMEs) sector is badly hit.”Banking officials said with increasing list of defaulters, some banks have stopped honouring guarantees being provided by states government such as Andhra Pradesh where the government’s pending bills have piled up to Rs 30,000 crore. The Telangana government too owes over Rs 10,000 crore to contractors, especially for irrigation project.All India Bank Employees’ Association national secretary B S Rambabu said the main reason for mismatch between loan amount and recovery was because of over-valuation of collateral or pledging disputed properties. “If an individual borrower fails to repay, his properties would be confiscated by banks. Like this if any firm fails, personal properties of directors or persons involved in the management of that firm need to be confiscated. Not only civil proceedings to recover the amount, criminal course should be initiated against them,” Rambabu said.According to the national secretary suggested the government should come up with a law barring major defaulters from being elected to any public representative post. On loans, he said total NPAs in all banks come to about Rs 7.90 lakh crore. SBI alone has written off Rs 76,000 crore. Moreover, banks which have failed to recover the amount from bigwigs and major defaulters have collected about Rs 8,000 crore from common depositors for not maintaining minimum balance.Bank Employees Federation of India vice president P Venkatramaiah said banks have recovered less and written off more in the past five years. “Banking reports clearly say while banks were able to recover Rs 2.32 lakh crore, they wrote off Rs 4.82 lakh crore in the past five years,” he said.In the name of settling cases, a sick textile industry was given to a business group for a song at Rs 5,000 crore while the dues were Rs 23,000 crore. These mistakes are harming the entire banking industry, Vekatramaiah said.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73180960,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1484344,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/banks-scurry-to-get-rs-18k-cr-from-defaulter-firms-in-city/articleshow/73179335.cms

AGRA: In one of its biggest crackdowns, Agra police has arrested nine members of a gang that allegedly committed at least 36 robberies, including 16 over the past three months. The nine men were caught after an encounter on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday. However, three gang members managed to flee. According to police, among those arrested is the son of a gram pradhan and two are jewellers.

The gang was active in Kiraoli , Sikandra, Achenra, Shamshabad , Pinhat, Malpura and Jagner in Agra district and some areas of Morena district in Madhya Pradesh .

The apprehended men were identified as Kartar Singh (38) and his his three brothers -- Ramhet Singh (22), Sahab Singh (20) and Suresh Singh (42). Another gangster was identified as Hariom Singh (20). All the five men originally hail from Naduapura village of Morena district of Madhya Pradesh.

The other members were Rahul alias Shribhagwan (24) of Nibohra and jewellers Akash Verma and Sabir Khan of Pinhat. Police also arrested Virender, son of Vipravali’s gram pradhan Ragunath.

The absconding men were identified as Nona, Majnu and Uttam, who hail from Madhya Pradesh.

Arvind Kumar Nirval, station house officer of Shamshabad, said, “Kartar along with his three brothers, a nephew and three brothers-in-law – two of whom are in jail (Udaybhan and Veerbhan)-- use to execute the robbery, especially at the homes and shops of jewellers. The gang was helped by Vipravali pradhan’s son Virender, who use to provide shelter to the accused men after they committed a robbery. The men than used to sell the stolen booty to local jewellers.”

During interrogation, the accused men claimed that they have lost count of the number of robberies they had executed over the years. The men bought several plots, built luxurious homes, bought SUVs and motorcycles from their ill-gotten gains.

The modus operandi of the gang was simple. Virender used to choose the target and share the details with the gang, who would conduct a recce before executing a robbery in the night hours. On December 28, the gang decamped with silver and gold jewellery from a bullion trader’s outlet in Shamshabad. In November, the gang helped five men to execute the murder-cum- robbery in a garment store owner’s home in Pinhat,” said the SHO.

Police have recovered 30 kg silver, several kilos of gold, Rs 60,000 worth spices and other valuables from them.

“We are now going to attach the properties of the accused men as they have acquired or built them from stolen goods. All the men will be charged with the Gangster Act, too,” he added.

Extension of SCLR set to make east-west drive fast

MUMBAI: Traffic woes in the suburbs, mainly in the west, are likely to reduce this year, with MMRDA, the apex planning body, announcing it will throw open two Metro corridors and complete three road projects.Six years after the city’s first Metro line (Versova-Ghatkopar) was commissioned in June 2014, D N Nagar-Dahisar Metro 2A and Andheri-Dahisar Metro 7 will be inaugurated in October. By 2021, Metro 2A and 7 are expected to carry around 4.1 lakh and 5.3 lakh passengers a day respectively, and help reduce congestion on S V Road, Western Express Highway and over crowding in local trains.Metropolitan commissioner R A Rajeev said, “Besides, SCLR extension till Western Express Highway, BKC-Vakola Junction elevated road and Kalanagar junction improvement will also be completed in this year.” These three road projects are aimed at improving connectivity to BKC and reducing traffic congestion in the commercial hub. The Kalanagar junction work will ensure fast travel to BKC, Sion-Dharavi Link road, airport and Bandra station. At present, vehicles take-20-30 minutes to clear the junction during peak hours. They will be able to save at least 10 minutes.The Kalanagar junction in Bandra east will have two flyovers and a free left turn from T-junction to sea link. MMRDA said it would be thrown open in October.SCLR has not realized its full potential because of bottlenecks in Kurla. Hence, the extension was proposed to ensure quick connectivity between WEH and Eastern Express Highway. SCLR extension will originate from Kapadia Nagar on CST Road near Kurla and terminate at the WEH near Vakola.Once Vakola-BKC elevated road is ready, motorists won’t have to go up to Kalanagar to enter BKC and save 20-30 minutes. Vehicles from Andheri can take the elevated road to directly reach Asian Heart Hospital in BKC’s G Block.Additional metropolitan commissioner Sonia Sethi said, “By 2026, MMR will have Metro length of around 337 km.” Delhi metro has a length of 391 km. She said, “In 2019, 41.1 km length of work had begun on 3 corridors whereas in 2020, 87 km route length of Metro work will begin.”Metropolitan commissioner RA Rajeev said recruitment for the two new Metros will be completed by February. Regarding the progress on Mumbai TransHarbour Link Corridor, Rajeev said, ""Despite heavy rains, 25% work on the project has been completed.” On Monorail, he said, “The beam was designed in such a way that only rakes that were manufactured by erstwhile operator Scomi could fit in. We have gone for re-tendering for 10 rakes as only one firm had shown response in earlier bids floated. There are only limited firms who are keen to participate in bids as they will have to modify the design of their rake to match the specifications.”",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73180657,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-227063,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/2-new-metros-3-road-projects-to-ease-your-commute-in-2020/articleshow/73180394.cms

CHENNAI: With protests continuing against the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam on Thursday asserted that the government would continue to protect the minorities just like late chief ministers M G Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa did. The CM also listed out the various welfare measures initiated for the minority communities in the state.

Replying to the debate on the motion to thank the governor for his address to the assembly, the chief minister sought to reiterate that minorities in the state would not suffer in any way. The AIADMK regime since MGR and Jayalalithaa had stood by the minorities and it would remain supportive. “Don’t believe in rumours spread with political motive. The minority community doesn’t need to be worried or scared,” Palaniswami said. The chief minister had on Tuesday told the assembly that he had informed Union home minister Amit Shah during his recent meeting in Delhi that NRC was not acceptable to Tamil Nadu . The AIADMK had extended crucial support for safe passage of CAB in Parliament.

To drive home the point, Palaniswami listed out various welfare schemes being implemented for Muslims, including the annual Haj subsidy despite Centre withdrawing it. The state extended Rs 215.22 crore benefits through minorities’ economic development corporation in the last eight years. Deputy chief minister Panneerselvam sought to reaffirm that the AIADMK would remain supportive forever. “At any time or under any circumstances, we will be the first to raise our voice if there are even small troubles for you,” the leader said, turning towards IUML MLA Mohammed Abu Backer and MJK MLA Thamimun Ansari, amid loud thumping of desks by members of the treasury benches.

Earlier, representatives of a federation of Muslim organisations and political parties called on Panneerselvam and submitted a memorandum seeking the support of the AIADMK against CAA and NRC. AIADMK minority wing Anwhar Raajhaa said the federation wanted the Muslims, and refugees from Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Bhutan to be brought under the ambit of the CAA. “Under the National Population Register, no new questions should be asked that would harm the community. And the NRC should not be implemented in the state,” said the leader, who was part of the delegation. The delegation will meet the chief minister at his residence on Friday.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu remains one of the most unsafe states for the elderly in the country. According to NCRB data, 152 senior citizens were murdered in Tamil Nadu in 2018, the highest in the country, followed by Maharashtra (135) and Uttar Pardesh (127).

While the numbers are alarming, Tamil Nadu also has a higher percentage of senior citizens, 11.2%, compared to other states. In the overall crime rate against senior citizens, Tamil Nadu is third with 3,162 cases.

Maharashtra, where the elderly population is less than 10%, recorded the maximum number of crimes against senior citizens at 5,961, followed by Madhya Pradesh, which has less than 8% senior citizens, with 3,967 cases.

Tamil Nadu also recorded the highest number of attempt-to-murder cases against senior citizens, 76. There were 182 cases of robbery and 16 extortion cases in which the elderly were targeted.

Activists said the high incidence of robberies, in which 184 senior citizens were targeted, highlighted how criminals found the elderly population an easy target.

Police said they have strengthened patrolling and all city police stations have been directed to collect details of senior citizens living alone.

A senior police officer said personnel on beat patrol have been assigned to enumerate the elderly in their neighbourhoods.

“Those living alone become soft targets of miscreants as they cannot fight back,” said Chandrasekar, a member of Senior Citizens Group Of Besant Nagar and Mylapore.

CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu assembly on Thursday passed a resolution ratifying the amendment to the Constitution, as passed by both Houses of Parliament, extending quota to SC/ST in Lok Sabha and state assembly by another 10 years. While the bill does not extend the reservation for Anglo-Indians by way of nomination, which is set to expire on January 25, the DMK and its allies, Congress and IUML demanded that the nomination should continue.

Lone Anglo-Indian nominee in the House, Nancy Ann Cynthia Francis said the community was a ‘minor minority’ in terms of linguistic, religion and numbers and deprived of privilege in the assembly. “It is really heartbreaking,” she said, pointing to the contributions made by the community in educational institutions, railway and postal services. DMK leader S Durai Murugan, Congress whip S Vijayadharani and IUML MLA Md Abu Backer demanded that the nomination be allowed to continue.

Deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam said during the debate in Parliament, the AIADMK MPs, along with Samajwadi Party, BSP, BJD, JD(U), the DMK, AAP, JD (S), YSR Congress, RJD and the Left parties had demanded that the Centre consider extending reservation to Anglo Indians under the bill, besides meeting the minister in person. “The minister also assured that the request would be considered,” the deputy CM said.

Coimbatore: The rural police have set up a special intelligence cell (SIC) to gather intelligence from Mettupalayam and Pollachi, which are considered communally sensitive.

The unit is headed by inspector N Suseela. The department has appointed one cop each for Karumathampatti, Perur, Pollachi and Valparai sub-divisions and two for the Periyanaickenpalayam sub-division.

The unit will keep an eye on the Hindu and Muslim outfits active in the areas, police sources said. During the Ganesh Chaturthi festival, large number of police personnel are deployed in both the places to prevent any untoward incidents.

The decision to set up the SIC was taken at a review meeting conducted by director general of police (DGP) JK Tripahty at the police guest house here a few months ago. Superintendent of police Sujit Kumar had suggested the need for such a unit.

The Coimbatore city police and the Madurai city police had earlier set up SICs to gather information about terrorism, IS sympathisers and the outfits trying to create communal divide.

The commissioner of police monitors the operation of SICs.

200,['10/01/2020'],Bad roads killed 266 in Chennai,"Roads dug up by different government agencies are mostly left unattended after work and become unmotorable.

CHENNAI: Bad roads in Chennai have killed more motorists than reckless driving, according to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) Accident Report 2018.While 266 died due to lack of proper road infrastructure, 62 lost their lives to careless driving or overtaking.Chennai topped the city-wise comparison chart by accounting for 80% of such deaths across the country followed by Prayagraj (33). Every other city in the list reported single-digit figures.Roads dug up by different government agencies are mostly left unattended after work and become unmotorable. “Roads are being laid overnight which is even more dangerous for motorists as patchworks remain uncovered,” said V S Jayaraman, founder member of T Nagar Residents Welfare Association. “When we talk about good road, it should all be well lit,” he said.Officials from Greater Chennai Corporation claimed they have made ‘adequate efforts’ before every monsoon to ensure roads were safe. The corporation claims to have spent more than Rs 120 crore every year to maintain existing bus route roads and fill around 1,400 potholes. But a ride across most roads tell a different story.“We are happy to see that police are finally recording the correct reason for deaths in FIRs. Earlier, they never mentioned road infra as a reason in order to prevent other government agencies from paying compensation,” said Srinivasan, a high court advocate.But a state transport department official said action has been taken against erring officials in such cases. “Last year, two Tamil Nadu Road Development Corporation officials were suspended for negligence in this aspect,” he said.Sivasubramaniam Jayaraman from Institute for Transportation and Development Policy said along with good roads, proper driving behaviour and strict enforcement of the law can bring down road fatalities. Given the 10% increase in vehicular population, more accidents could happen. So driving behaviour needs to change and should be a subject at school, he saidA senior officer from the Chennai traffic police said that there was very little awareness about rules among motorists. “Just look at the number of vehicles parked in no-parking zones on every street. Do we need anything else to show utter disregard for rules,” he said.The NCRB report shows that 73 people died in 392 accidents caused by vehicles parked illegally on road shoulders — highest in the country.The report suggested that motorists in Chennai cared little about their vehicles.

Hyderabad: Union minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy said that all Union ministers would begin visiting Kashmir from February to quell fears of the Kashmiri people.

Interacting with the media during ‘Meet the Press’ programme on Thursday, he said that there was a general misconception among Kashmiris that outsiders will usurp their land. “The investors’ meet in Kashmir has been deferred for the same reason. The Centre is in the process of identifying government land in the state to set up educational institutions and hospitals, but industrialists from other states are also showing keen interest in investing in the state for the state’s development,” he said.

He said that gram panchayats in the region have started receiving funds from the Centre for the first time. “We are not against any religion, every decision is taken in the interest of the country,” he said.

Ridiculing the statement of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, who said that there would be a war-like situation in Kashmir after Section 144 is lifted, he said nothing of that sort had happened. “The state is peaceful, and the Centre will take all steps to see that Kashmir becomes an integral part of the country,” he said.

The underconstruction aerobridge

BHOPAL: The Raja Bhoj airport will get its third aerobridge by February-end. Installation of aerobridge, which is being imported from China, will start by the end of this month.

At present Bhopal airport has two aerobridges. The need for another aerobridge was felt after a huge surge in footfall and flight movement in 2019.

With the arrival of SpiceJet and IndiGo airlines, traffic has considerably increased at Bhopal. This could be gauged from the fact that last year around 5 lakh more passengers travelled from Bhopal airport. There are now more than 34 regular flights a day operated by Air India, IndiGo and SpiceJet and the number is likely to go up to 40 by this summer.

Airport director Anil Vikram said, “This calls for at least another aerobridge to handle the volume of passengers embarking and alighting.”

About the installation process, director Vikram said, “We are hoping to get the aerobridge by January 25. After that a team of experts will come to install. We will prepare a report to send it to headquarters of Airport Authority of India.” He added that after installation site inspection will be conducted. “We will do the safety assessment of the installed aerobridge. A report will be prepared about it. We will send the report to AAI’s headquarters.”

AAI will send the report to DGCA for its approval. “Once DGCA approves, the aerobridge will start functioning,” Vikram further said.

This one is being imported from China, Vikram said, adding, “It will cost us around Rs 2.5 crore while the complete cost of installing the aerobridge is Rs 8.5 cr.” Existing two aerobridges in operation were installed by an Indonesian firm in 2014. Incidentally, Bhopal airport has also got the nod for installation of fourth aerobridge and installation work will start soon.

Vikram said with the start of new airlines, Bhopal airport is getting more traction on the national map. “Things are moving in the right direction. Infrastructure at Bhopal airport is bigger than Indore’s Devi Ahilya Bai Holkar airport,” he pointed out, adding that with the installation of third aerobridge facilities will definitely be increased.

208,['10/01/2020'],State improves ranking in hydrology project review,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala, which witnessed floods of catastrophic dimensions consecutively in the past two years, seems to have learned some vital lessons. In the latest review of the national hydrology project, the state has improved its ranking from 13 to 8.

In the ranking of around 44 agencies, including states, union territories and river basins, Kerala ranks above states like Andhra Pradesh, which gives a lot of focus on irrigation and farming. The project, fully funded by World Bank, began in 2016 and is expected to be implemented by 2024. The state has secured the satisfactory rating in the mid-term review.

Around Rs 42 crore will be granted to the state for the project. The project involves studying hydro-meteorological data in real time by introducing various instruments such as rain gauge stations, river gauge stations, and monitoring of river data, among other things.

It involves collection of data on the quality of water that flows through the 44 rivers in the state, as well as on annual rainfall, besides improving the quality and the number of data-collection instruments. The World Bank will also provide training for officials.

Water resources department of Gujarat and Damodar Valley Corporation secured the first and second rankings while Rajasthan was ranked in the third position. The Irrigation Design and Research Board (IDRB) under the Water Resources department is co-ordinating the project in the state. K A Johny, chief engineer of IDRB, said the state has taken a slew of measures such as setting up of early flood warning system, which helped in improving its ranking.

The state is planning to introduce a decision-support system at Bharathappuzha river basin system to collect real time data and improve flood management, he said. For example, analysis data of inflow, carrying capacity of river, etc can be used to decide on the need to evacuate people from river banks,” he said. Johny said water resources department’s proactive measures such as room for river programme and the decision to introduce flood-control dams will improve the situation in the state.

“We have sent proposals to the headquarters in Chennai to set up two more AWPS at Karumathampatti and Valparai sub-divisions. Once they become operational, women from these places won’t have to travel far to other stations to lodge complaints,” police superintendent Sujit Kumar said.

Currently, residents of Karumathampatti, Annur, Kovilpalayam and Sulur travel 30 kilometres to lodge complaints at the Perur AWPS.

Of the four sub-divisions in the Coimbatore city, only central, west and east have AWPS. Those staying in the south sub-division travel to RS Puram (AWPS -west) to lodge complaints.

210,['10/01/2020'],PIL for 5% quota for Tamil medium students in MBBS,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Representative image

CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Thursday ordered notice to the state government on a PIL seeking 5% reservation in admission to MBBS courses in all government medical colleges for students who did school education in Tamil medium.

Admitting the plea moved by N Murugesan of Dharmapuri, a division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and Justice R Hemalatha directed the state to file its reply by February 20.

The petitioner, quoting an RTI response, said that of the 5,400 MBBS seats available in Tamil Nadu medical colleges, only less than 5% seats were secured by students who had studied in Tamil medium. The petitioner said in the academic year 2016-17 only 537 Tamil medium students got seats in MBBS course. In 2017-18 this reduced to 52 students.

Similarly, in the academic year 2018-19 only 106 Tamil medium students got admission to MMBS course in state colleges, which constitutes only 2% of the total seats, he said.

Such circumstance has created a false image among students who are pursuing school education in Tamil that they would not be able to secure a MBBS seat in government run medical college, he said.

The petitioner further added that our neighbouring state – Karnataka is already implementing 5% reservation in medical seats for candidates who have completed school education in Kannada medium.

The Tamil Nadu government which takes several steps for the growth and to safeguard Tamil language should also provide such reservation which would encourage more students to opt for Tamil medium in school education, he said.

Since the government has not responded to a representation made by him on November 4, 2019 and the schedule for NEET exam are nearing for the academic year 2019-20 the petition has moved the high court.

Chennai: With tribal dancers from Ooty and Baul singers from Bengal, the Poush Mela or winter festival , hosted by the Bengali associations of Chennai, promises to be an “amalgamation of the cultures of the two states”, says Ravi Shankar Roy, a part of the Chennai Banga Sanskriti Sammelan Samiti which is organising the fair.

The winter mela will be held from January 10 to 12 from noon to 10pm, but will kickstart with a procession on Friday evening through the streets of T Nagar, where singers and dancers and members of the community will herald the beginning of the harvest season. “Bengali communities across the country celebrate the Poush Mela but this is the first time we are hosting it in Chennai,” says Roy. “For the past six years we have been hosting a Banga Mela in April, which is a cultural programme, but we decided to start off the year with these celebrations.”

The mela will feature stalls of sari makers, artisans and ‘pitha makers’, says Roy. Pithas are a dish made from a batter of rice flour or wheat flour, which are stuffed with sweet or savory ingredients. “We are bringing pitha-making specialists from West Bengal.”

Another highlight would be the stall on Krishnanagar’s clay dolls, famed for their realistic depiction of everyday rural life. One will also get to sample the famous ‘nolen gur rosgulla’, made in the winter season from boiling the sap of date palm.

“The idea is to get Chennai to celebrate our winter festival with us in true Bengali style,” says Roy.

Union minister Smriti Irani addresses a pro-CAA rally in Madurai on Thursday

CHENNAI/MADURAI: Under fire from the opposition parties and allies over the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) and National Register of Citizens ( NRC ), the Narendra Modi government has gone into firefighting mode deploying ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and Smriti Irani as well as BJP general secretary Ram Madhav to clear the air over the issues in the state.

“We will hold talks with our allies and take them into confidence,” said Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad in Chennai while responding to a question on chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami’s statement in the assembly that he had told home minister Amit Shah that NRC was not acceptable to the AIADMK government.

Prasad said at a new meet on Thursday that the CAA does not have anything new on grant of citizenship to non-Muslims persecuted in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan government. It was done under Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi regimes decades ago which granted citizenship to Hindus from Uganda and Sri Lanka. “They did not give citizenship to Muslims from these countries,” he noted.

On NRC, he said, “There are provisions that the date for NRC shall be announced, there will be verification, hearing of objections and disposal of objections and appeal against that. Nothing has been decided at all including the date.” Speaking at the ‘Janjagran Abhiyan’ at Sellur in Madurai, Union minister of women and child development and textiles, Smriti Zubin Irani questioned the “double standards” of the DMK on the issue of citizenship for Sri Lankan refugees.

“This is not about the BJP, but about brotherhood and the nation,” she said. When the Nov 2007 special commission for rehabilitation did not entertain citizenship for Sri Lankan refugees under the UPA government why did you remain silent?’’ she asked. This was because the UPA government gave them a free run to loot the treasury of the nation, said Irani. Addressing a meeting organized by the BJP at Trichy, party national general secretary Ram Madhav said, “Some leaders in Tamil Nadu are opposing the Act. If we ask them the reason for their opposition, they do not have answers. Those who opposing the Act really do not know anything about it”, he said. “I appeal to the Muslim brothers not to fall prey to the false propaganda of opposition parties. This bill is not against Muslims or Christians”, he added. Party national executive committee member L Ganesan, actor Gautami and general secretary M Muruganantham also participated.

214,['10/01/2020'],Chorus rises for removal of police barricades from NH-16,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Visakhapatnam: At a time when the city police is placing barricades on the national highway to slow down traffic and reduce accidents, members of the AP Chambers of Commerce have sent a proposal to the Union government to remove all barricades from the NH.

On Thursday, during an interactive session with TG Venkatesh, chairman of parliamentary standing committee on transport, the trade body gave a nine-fold proposal to ease traffic on the busy and accident-prone NH-16 stretch that passes through the city. One of the proposals was to ask the local police and state government to remove barricades from that highway stretch.

“Because of the barricades, bottlenecks are created on the stretch that reduces the traffic speed considerably. Such things should not happen on a national highway,” Sudhir Mulagada, chairman of Visakhapatnam zone of the trade body, told TOI.

MY Danam, regional manager of Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC), too had made a similar request to the police during a recent meeting of the Visakhapatnam road safety committee. But the traffic department made it clear that they won’t remove the barricades from the accident-prone stretch.

The traffic cops have claimed that after the placement of 66 barricades on the stretch, there was a considerable fall in the number of accidents. A senior traffic department official said while 118 accidents were reported on that highway stretch in July 2019, the number came down to 91 in September after the barricades were placed. The number of injuries also reduced to 48 in September from 68 in July, he added.

Though Mulagada did not dismiss the cops’ claims, he said they need to sit down with the cops to find a middle path. “We have to sit down with the police to understand their logic behind putting these barricades. Bottlenecks and slow traffic on the highway is not a good option,” he added.

Another important proposal suggested by the members is removal of toll gates from the city limits to facilitate faster traffic movement. The other suggestions include construction of dedicated parking areas near petrol pumps for trucks, food plazas, washrooms, vehicle repair and servicing centres, and construction of 60-feet-wide service roads on both sides of the highway stretch passing through the city limits. “Now that Visakhapatnam is proposed to become the executive capital, traffic too would increase considerably. But these proposals are the need of the hour and are essential even if the city does not become the capital,” Mulagada added.

215,['10/01/2020'],"Odisha approves NTPC’s Talcher plant expansion, two other projects","This story is from January 10, 2020

Bhubaneswar: The state government on Thursday cleared three investment proposals totalling Rs 17,833 crore, including a Rs 7,698.46-crore expansion of National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC)’s plant in Talcher.

The NTPC expansion will involve the setting up of two new power units of 800 megawatt each at its existing facility in Talcher.

The two other projects approved by the high-level clearance authority chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik are a Rs 8,000-crore, two million tonne per annum (MTPA) alumina refinery by Hindalco in Rayagada district, and a Rs 2,135-crore expansion of Rungta Mines Limited (RML).

Industries minister Dibya Shankar Mishra said, “The three projects will create more than 6,500 jobs.”

The approval of the NTPC project is significant as the state government had in 2018 expressed strong reservations against it, citing the high tariff of the power that will be generated by the new plants. The Centre, however, had tried to push through the project so that Prime Minister Narendra Modi could have laid its foundation on September 22, 2018.

Before last year’s simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly elections, petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan and the Union power minister R K Singh had both written to Naveen for help in clearing the project. As the election campaign intensified, then state energy minister, Susanta Singh, had opposed the project. He had said the power tariff of the proposed plants had been pegged at a high Rs 3.40 per unit.

A senior government officer said the expansion project approved on Thursday was a revised one, which addressed the concerns raised by the state. The power tariff of the revised plan is not known.

As per the earlier plan, NTPC had proposed to invest Rs 9,785 crore in two new units totalling 1,320 megawatts. The existing plant in Talcher — launched by former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1964 — has a capacity of 460 megawatt and will become outdated in 2021.

The Hindalco project in Kansariguda village, which is expected to start running within five years, would create 4,250 new jobs, sources said. The company already has 1,500 acres with it and will need to acquire 600 acres more for the alumina refinery. Running at full capacity, the refinery will need six million tonne of bauxite per year.

The RML plans to expand its integrated steel plant in Sundargarh district from 0.27MTPA to 0.9MTPA, creating 2,289 new jobs.

HARIDWAR: Irked over the state government’s apathy to their demands, scores of anganwadi workers, who have been holding protest for the last 35 days, decided on Thursday to sit on a hunger strike . The workers have been demanding job regularisation and salary hike at par with Delhi and Kerala.

“For the last 35 days, we have been demanding salary hike at par with Delhi and Kerala, where the anganwadi workers are paid more than Rs 10,000 per month. We have also been demanding regularisation of job, but the state government has not paid heed to our demands. Hence, we have decided to launch hunger strike to draw their attention to our plight,” said Rekha Negi, head of anganwadi karyakarti worker employee union. She said two of its workers would be sitting on a hunger strike on Friday.

Notably, on Tuesday after the cabinet meeting, minister of women and child development Rekha Arya had claimed that Uttarakhand is paying its anganwadi workers better than Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh.

Uttrakhand has four registered unions of anganwadi workers and under these different banners, all of them have similar demands. There are around 37, 000 anganwadi workers.

Earlier on Thursday in Haridwar , the general secretary of Uttrakhand anganwadi karmchari sangh, handed a memorandum, addressed to the PM, to the district administration. “When we are proving useful for the system then why are they not including us in the system as their regular part?” Sushila Khatri, president of the sangh said.

CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu assembly on Thursday passed 15 bills, including reverting to indirect elections to heads of urban local bodies, mayors of corporations, chairpersons of municipalities and town panchayats.

While the Congress opposed the indirect polls alleging that the move would lead to horse-trading, the DMK said people were confused over the conduct of the polls itself. DMK MLA and former Greater Chennai Corporation mayor M Subramanian hit out at the government for its frequent flip flops on the polls ever since it took over.

Bills were passed to extend the term of special officers by another six months or until the first meeting of the elected local bodies, use of EVMs in the elections to rural local bodies, suspension of president or vice-president of a registered society under certain circumstances and doing away third grade municipalities in the state.

The House passed a bill to confer the government with the power of inspection and inquiry to monitor the use of government funds in TN Veterinary and Animal Sciences University and TN Dr J Jayalalithaa Fisheries University, and another bill to revise the qualification prescribed for the post of registrar of Dr Ambedkar Law University. A bill sought to repeal 150 laws as they had become obsolete and redundant.

221,['10/01/2020'],"Economy stuck in low gear, pump makers stop storing","This story is from January 10, 2020

Coimbatore: The practice of having additional stock in Coimbatore’s micro and small pump units is declining. Industrialists say around five years ago, small pump manufacturers would maintain extra stock of a few hundred pieces with a hope that they would be sold soon. But now, many of them have reduced the stock to 20% and some have stopped the practice, said industrialists.

The main reason micro and small industrialists cite for this is the economic slowdown which resulted in tightening of cash inflow.

President of Kovai Power Driven Pumps and Spares Manufacturers Association (KOPMA) K Maniraj said around five years ago micro pump units would stock around 100 pieces and medium ones would have around 500 pieces. “This was done in the hope that the orders for these would be there. But it has been decreasing gradually and now many units have decreased their stock to 20%,” he said.

The slowdown and the decrease in orders have created an apprehension among small industrialists to produce extra and maintain stock. “We have to purchase more than 70 spare parts to assemble a pump. This would cost us GST as well. But we are not sure if we could sell them. So, the trend now is to manufacture only when there is a guaranteed order,” Maniraj added. He also cited the decrease in demand for pumps from agriculture and construction sectors as reasons for this.

This trend, as expected, has also hit micro and small spare part manufacturers and job work units in the value chain. With orders for manufacturers shrinking and their practice of hoarding stock declining, the constant orders for spares and job work is also coming down.

Stock was a routine industrial process even in micro and small spare parts units, said J James, president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Micro Enterprises (TACT). “But now as the orders have come down, small job work units also cannot have stock,” he said.

With big companies manufacturing only if they get guaranteed orders, they give job work or spare parts orders only then, he said. “If micro units can’t deliver these sudden orders, big firms split it among several micro units and get the job done. So, micro and small firms having stock is unthinkable today,” he said.

This bill is not against Muslims or Christians”, he added. Party national executive committee member L Ganesan, actor Gautami and general secretary M Muruganantham also participated.

G Kishan Reddy

HYDERABAD: Union minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy on Thursday said the Centre is ready to make changes in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) if it impacts even a single citizen of this country. Allaying the fears of Muslims on CAA , Kishan Reddy said not even a single Muslim individual would be sent away from the country. “PM (Narendra) Modi is with every citizen of this country,” he said at a ‘meet the press’ programme here.

Stating they did not anticipate widespread protests across the country, he blamed the opposition parties for running a vicious campaign on NPR . “I do not know why students, intellectuals and others are coming on to the streets and protesting against it. There is nothing to fear. There is no need to submit any document in NPR. It is a usual process which is taken up along with Census,” he said. Responding to a query, Kishan Reddy said no decision had been taken on NRC. “The issue has not been discussed by the Union cabinet yet. What home minister Amit Shah has spoken about is our party line. When a discussion happens in the government, we will let people know. No citizen will be impacted because of this,” he said.

224,['10/01/2020'],Cyient lays off around 100 techies,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Hyderabad: City-based engineering and technology solutions provider Cyient Limited has handed over pink slips to around 100 employees in multiple locations over the past few days, according to sources.

Most of the layoffs are learnt to have happened in Cyient’s geographic information systems (GIS) department offices at Hyderabad and Noida over last week. The retrenched employees were mid-career techies with work experience of up to 11-12 years in the industry, said sources.

According to sources, the company has been in the process of cutting flab over the past couple of months in the GIS vertical, where the attrition rate has traditionally been very high.

While Cyient refused to state the exact number of people it has laid off, it indicated that the employees were asked to leave because of poor performance.

“Changes are made to every business unit to ensure there is efficiency towards supporting a customer operation. The policy is strictly followed in performance cases as well as those where individuals may have to adapt to newer technologies. In addition, there is training for associates who choose to take on newer certifications. In the event of operational restructuring, the company has a well-established policy to offer redeployment to each individual, which may also include the opportunity to learn new technologies,” said a Cyient spokesperson without elaborating further.

In its investor presentation during the announcement of its Q2FY20 financial results, the homegrown IT major said its total headcount had decreased to 14,869 in the quarter ended September 30, 2019, from 15,043 during the quarter ended June 30, 2019. According to the company, during the October-December 2019 period it hired over 400 new associates.

This week, Cyient also opened its development centre at Warangal where it has plans to hire around 800 people, primarily local youth. This centre will support telecom customers globally with plan and design and engineering services for their mobile and fixed-line networks.

225,['10/01/2020'],"‘Banks may lose up to Rs 1,800cr on zero MDR’","This story is from January 10, 2020

Mayur.Shetty@timesgroup.com

Mumbai: The annual revenue loss caused by zero merchant fees on RuPay cards and UPI is expected to be Rs 1,800 crore going by the present level of transactions. Given that banks can choose between either suffering this loss or pushing Visa and Mastercard transactions, there are suggestions that the RBI should bear this cost.

The government last month did away with merchant discount rate ( MDR ) — the fees that businesses pay banks for transferring money from the cardholders’ accounts to their own. While mandating small businesses to accept digital payments, the finance minister had said “the RBI and banks will absorb these costs from the savings that will accrue to them on account of handling less cash as people move to these digital modes of payment”.

According to a report (discriminatory approach for RuPay debit cards — a corrective approach) by IIT-Bombay professor Ashish Das, this results in induced discrimination between RuPay, on the one hand, and Mastercard & Visa on the other.

The revenue differential for banks between RuPay and Mastercard/Visa, would prompt them to promote that card scheme which generates more revenue for them, the report said. “Therefore, the RBI would need to set a revised cap on debit card MDR, on lines currently set for RuPay debit card by NPCI. Alternatively, if the RBI feels appropriate, it can increase the revenue support for RuPay debit card, in order to maintain parity with extant MDR caps set by the RBI,” Das said. According to the report, the revenue for RuPay debit card is expected to be no more than Rs 1,000 crore for calendar year 2020, while for BHIM-UPI, it is expected to be another Rs 800 crore.

As of December 2019, for BHIM-UPI, NPCI had an MDR cap of 0.3%, subject to a maximum of Rs 100. Additionally, to promote on-boarding of small and medium merchants with less than Rs 1 lakh worth of BHIM-UPI transactions in a month, there are no fees imposed. Also, for merchants other than online ones, there are no transaction fees when the ticket size is within Rs 100. “The MDR pricing structure for BHIM-UPI introduced by NPCI in October 2019 appears quite reasonable as it attempts to encourage small and medium merchants to get on-boarded and be active in acceptance of digital payments. In an attempt to encourage payment service providers, the RBI should provide for the necessary support for the banks’ revenue loss towards BHIM-UPI also,” said Das.

226,['10/01/2020'],‘Odisha has producers but not visionaries’,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Jitendra Mishra with Vikas Khanna

The Neena Gupta-starrer ‘ The Last Colour ’, produced by Titilagarh native Jitendra Mishra , is among films that are in the running for a nomination in the ‘ best picture ’ category at the 92nd Academy Awards . The Delhi-based Mishra, who has emerged as a pioneering ‘alternative producer’ with films like ‘I am Kalam’ on his CV, talks to Amava Bhattacharya over phone about the Oscar nomination list to be announced on Monday, the future of Odia films and working the festival circuit

Did you expect ‘The Last Colour’ to be on the Oscar contention list?

When we made the film, Vikas (Khanna, New York-based Michelin-starred chef and director of ‘The Last Colour’) told me that we should try to ensure that it makes it to the Oscars eligibility list. Otherwise, he said, we would not have done justice to the product. As far as the announcement of the Oscar nomination list on Monday is concerned, we are not in any rat race. The journey matters more than the destination and we are happy to have made it to the contention list.

‘The Last Colour’ deals with the subject of widows of Varanasi and Vrindavan. What was shooting in Varanasi like?

We had a wonderful time there. People were warm and friendly. If you are a good human being, you can really connect to some wonderful people there. It is such a holy place and the people were very hospitable towards us.

The film was screened at the UN headquarters in New York last year. Its first look was revealed at Cannes. Will it get a theatre release in India?

Of course it will. We have travelled with the film across festivals but the ultimate aim is to release it in India. We are waiting to see what happens on Monday before deciding when and how we will take ‘The Last Colour’ forward here. While I can’t ensure that it will get a theatre release in Titilagarh, I do want to release it in Bhubaneswar where I know it will be appreciated.

Regional cinema, especially Malayalam films, are doing so well. What do you think ails the Odia film industry?

I would disagree with the fact that the Odia film industry is ailing. I know of some great filmmakers in Odisha who are doing some really good films. But the problem here is that these films are not being marketed well. I have only one piece of advice for producers in Odisha. If your budget is Rs 1 crore, stretch it to Rs 1.5 crore to include marketing costs. How will people know about a film, especially if the budget is limited and it does not have big stars, if it is not marketed well? In Odisha, we have producers but not visionaries.

Your production model is often described as ‘alternate production’. What does that mean?

I would call myself a technical producer. I am not a money man. Usually we think of producers as pouring money into a film and then taking a step back. I am invested in the technical aspects of production, from sales to marketing to distribution. I believe in supporting a film and taking it to its logical end. I believe every film should be given the best chance it can have of shining. I am very passionate about films.

Have you ever wanted to direct films?

I made some shorts and documentaries but there is the matter of earning a livelihood. I have chosen to focus on the production aspect as of now.

Does your method of production lead to conflicts with the director?

Not at all. I think of a producer as the father of a film and of the director as its mother. Our family didn’t have a lot of money but I saw my mother managing the best she could with the resources my father would provide her with. I think of films like that. The director’s vision is final.

What do you think of films being released on OTT platforms like Netflix?

I do feel that youngsters today are missing out on the magic of watching a film in the hall, but films are doing well on such OTT platforms and I have no problems with them as such. In my personal capacity, I organise a film festival in New Delhi (Siffcy) for youngsters to get an experience of watching films on the big screen.

Do you think film festivals can help small budget films get exposure?

Yes, definitely. I have been going to Cannes for the past eight years and have visited other international and national festivals as well. In them, you meet like-minded people, get honest feedback on your film, and can even strike deals with other producers and broadcasters there. Quantity does not matter to me, quality does; the same holds true for film festivals. One should try to take the films to the credible festivals. Look at ‘Village Rockstars’, for instance. It’s a small Assamese film, but it created a sense of anticipation among the urban audience after doing the rounds of festivals.

The declaration was signed in the Israel city on Wednesday

Vadodara: A twin city declaration was eventually signed between Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) and the municipality of Ashkelon , a city in Israel on Wednesday. The civic bodies had been working towards the declaration for six years now.

The declaration signed by Vadodara mayor Dr Jigeesha Sheth and Ashkelon mayor Tomer Glam aims at developing and deepening the cultural, social, economic and tourism ties between the two cities. The idea of reaching an agreement has been under discussion since 2014.

The idea of the twin city agreement was first floated by city-based organisation, Friends of Israel, and its convenor Nikitin Contractor. In 2014, the then Vadodara mayor Bharat Shah had even visited Ashkelon. The biblically historic town has a population of around 1.5 lakh and an industrial base including one of the largest desalination plants in the world.

In 2015, a delegation from Ashkelon municipality and other representatives from Israel had visited the city. But little was heard of the twin city pact after this visit.

It was only in October last year that things started moving again. Former deputy mayor of Ashkelon Dr Ricky Shay and other representatives met VMC top brass to carry things forward. Sheth and VMC commissioner Nalin Upadhyay are on a tour to Israel since last week. The pact was signed during their visit to Ashkelon.

The areas that are being explored for cooperation have been termed as ‘The Five E’s’. These include education, environment, emergency management, empowering women and exchange of cultural programmes. The delegation from VMC also got an insight into the smart initiatives taken by various cities in Israel including Ashkelon.

Ameenpur Lake (File photo)

HYDERABAD: The National Green Tribunal (Southern Region) on Thursday asked the Telangana government to probe encroachments in 33 lakes in Ameenpur , a rich biodiversity site in the state.

Coming to the rescue of city lakes, the NGT bench at Chennai asked chief secretary Somesh Kumar to constitute a body of experts to find out encroachments and also fix the Full Tank Levels.

The order comes in the wake of complaints lodged by Human Rights and Consumer Protection Cell Trust and others, alleging that builders and realtors have encroached around 13 water bodies in Ameenpur and 20 water bodies in the catchment area. They have alleged that large-scale encroachments have reduced the lakes’ width and, in some cases, its been filled up illegally.

Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA), Hyderabad, in its counter-affidavit mentioned that a joint committee was formed to inspect the lakes which has identified encroachments and now action was being taken.

“In some of the water bodies there are encroachments and request has been made for fixing the FTL. Further action will be taken,” the HMDA said in its petition.

Private parties who were accused of trespass by the Trust contended that it was was a private dispute and members of the Trust also had properties adjacent to the respondents. They also alleged that there was no water body in the properties and construction was done in accordance with the law.

NGT Southern Zone Chennai bench comprising Justice K Ramakrishnan and expert member Saibal Dasgupta in its order asked Somesh Kumar to look into the matter and ascertain whether the water bodies in the state, especially those in Ameenpur, were notified, FTL fixed and encroachments identified and action taken. NGT also asked the committee to check any buffer zone of the water body, which can be declared as non-development zone.

“Whether all the water bodies were inventoried and notified under the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017, shall be looked into by the committee. What are the encroachments and action taken to remove them and steps taken to prevent further encroachments? The committee should also look into any dumping of garbage and discharge of non-treated sewage or effluents into water bodies and action taken,” said the order.

The committee should consist of officials of the Lake Protection Committee, district collectors, Telangana State Pollution Control Board, the State Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Authority, officials of the Telangana Bio-Diversity Board and heads of local bodies, the NGT said.

CHENNAI: Boarding an MTC bus to your destination after travelling the entire metro rail network stretch could soon become easy. Chennai Metro Rail Limited ( CMRL ) has asked city corporation to shift existing bus shelters closer to the entrances of at least eight metro stations including at the airport and proposed new bus stops in at least five stations including Guindy metro. This is to make first mile or last mile connectivity easier for metro rail commuters.

“We have written and discussed about shifting existing bus stops closer to our stations with city corporation officials. We hope to get it done soon,” a CMRL official said.

Metro rail officials said at least eight metro station locations have been proposed for shifting existing bus shelters closer to the entry points of the stations. It includes Thousand Lights, Airport, Pachaiyappa’s College, Government Estate, LIC, Teynampet and Ekattuthangal. At Government Estate metro, CMRL has asked for stopping of MTC buses plying on certain routes closer to the station, and said the existing bus shelter at the airport could be shifted closer to the pedestrian subway linking the suburban services with metro.

Officials said there is also a proposal to set up new bus shelters closer to metro stations at Guindy, Meenambakkam, Nanganallur, Vadapalani and Ekkattuthangal. At Guindy metro, which is already closer to the suburban station from where share auto services ply to Porur, a new shelter has been proposed for mofussil buses.

Both the corridors and the 32 stations along the 45km phase-1 were planned closer to bus shelters and link major transport hubs like CMBT, Central railway station, Egmore railway station and the airport.

At present, bus shelters are a stone’s throw for metro rail commuters at Saidapet, AG-DMS, Central metro and Alandur stations. The buses that stop at these stations ply to far-flung areas in the north and the south.

A senior corporation confirmed the CMRL request. “For shifting a bus shelter, a deposit of Rs 60,000-Rs 80,000 has to be given. We have already sent a letter to CMRL on this. Once the money is deposited, the work will start,” he said.

O Pannerselvam

CHENNAI: The government will shift all households along the Cooum and the Adyar rivers in the city to Perumbakkam and Okkiyam Thoraipakkam, said deputy chief minister and state housing minister O Pannerselvam on Thursday. Replying to a question raised by Harbour MLA P K Sekar Babu in the assembly, Panneerselvam said several households in Satyavanimuthu Nagar and other areas along the rivers have shifted to Perumbakkam.

“There were more than 11,500 families settled along the Cooum in the city. Of this, 10,740 families are to be shifted to Perumbakkam, Okkiyam Thoraipakkam and other areas. During the 2015 floods, 9,000 families on the banks of the Adyar were affected and of this, 4,000 families have been shifted to Perumbakkam,” said Panneerselvam.

In December last year, eviction of families began at Satyavanimuthu Nagar as part of the Cooum River Restoration project taken up by the Chennai Rivers’ Restoration Trust. There were protests from various parties and VCK chief Thol Thirumavalavan visited the area and spoke to Panneerselvam about the eviction.

“More than 2,000 families from Satyavanimuthu Nagar agreed to shift to Perumbakkam and many of them have settled in their new apartments. There are a few more who have asked time due to their children’s exams. Therefore, we have given them time till April,” said Panneerselvam.

Though Sekar Babu said many people who have shifted to Perumbakkam don’t have proper facilities, the deputy CM differed from what the MLA said.

“The people who have settled in Perumbakkam and Okkiyam Thoraipakkam have all facilities. There are schools, colleges, hospitals, parks, playgrounds, primary health centres and Aavin parlours,” said Panneerselvam.

He said the families are to get Rs 2,000 per month for 12 months and also Rs 5,000 when they shift to the new place. “For school children, free buses are provided from the area to the place where schools are situated,” said Panneerselvam.

Representative image

AGRA: The city of Taj has more to cheer now, literally. With the decks cleared and infrastructure ready, the first microbrewery in the state is all set to open at MG Road here on Saturday.

Entrepreneurs Sushil Bhati and his nephew Kunal Bhati, the brains behind UP’s first microbrewery pub ‘Folks’, said that the initiative is aimed at overhauling the experience of drinking beer for local residents and lakhs of tourists who visit the city.

Sushil said, “A craft brewery or microbrewery produces beer in much smaller quantities as compared to a commercial unit. Fresh from the tap, craft beer focuses on the quality of the brew and preferences of the individual customer.”

Kunal said, “Craft brewing makes the experience of drinking beer a rich one. It is fresh, tastier and healthier. Bottled beer is no match to the freshly brewed one as the former has added preservatives. Craft beer also gives more individual freedom to the customer as he/she can choose the preferred variety. Initially, we are planning to offer three varieties — Belgian Wit, India Pale Ale and Munich Helles — at economical prices.” “We will import the malt and hops from Europe and USA to ensure quality. Also, a variety of minerals will be added to the water to give the beer an authentic taste,” he added.

Sushil said, “When the UP government amended its excise rules last year, we decided to tap the growth potential of Agra , which is also a popular tourist destination. That’s why we decided to open our first microbrewery in the state in the Taj city.” He added that he has obtained the licence to produce 66 litres of craft beer daily.

The UP Brewery Rules 2019, announced in June last year, mandates an annual licence fee of Rs 2.5 lakh for microbreweries, up from Rs 25,000 fixed in 1974. A guarantee fee of Rs 1 lakh has also been fixed. According to the rules, a microbrewery can produce only 600 litres of craft beer a day. Similarly, an annual production limit of 2.1 lakh litres has also been fixed for microbreweries.

Kunal quotes a US-based home brewing consultant Jake Baker, “Anyone can make craft beer with just a basic understanding.” “It is just a heady mixture of science and arts,” he adds.

BHUBANESWAR: Women in the state have increasingly become vulnerable to crimes in the cyberspace, if the latest report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) is any indication. The NCRB’s crime in India 2018 report, released on Wednesday, placed Odisha only after Assam for the maximum number of cyber offences against women.

Assam topped the list with a registration of 295 cases, involving women as victims of cybercrimes, in 2018. It was followed by Odisha with 208 cases in the same year, the NCRB data showed.

Odisha has moved up six places from its rank in 2017 when it had recorded 23 cases of cybercrimes against women .

The NCRB said most of the cybercrime cases in the state in 2018 were related to sexual harassment of women on social media. “Of the 208 cases of cybercrimes against women in Odisha, at least 172 were publication or transmission of sexually explicit materials on websites. The remaining 36 cases fell under other forms of cybercrime (extortion/blackmailing, morphing, defamation and creation of fake profile),” the NCRB report said.

Cybercrime experts blame lack of awareness and lack of necessary precautions by the victims for the alarming rise of such crimes against women in the state. “Though it is difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for the spurt in cybercrimes against women, lack of adoption of safety precautions on cyberspace could be a strong factor behind falling prey to cyber crooks. Social media users, especially women, should be extremely careful and extra cautious while befriending strangers on chatting sites,” IT expert Pramod Satpathy said.

The NCRB data said Odisha did not report any case of circulation of fake news on social media in 2018. The matter assumes significance amid Odisha occupying the fourth spot with the registration of 13 such cases in 2017, the NCRB report said.

Significantly, the state government on Monday launched cyber safety and security awareness week where chief secretary Asit Tripathy urged internet and social media users to remain aware and take adequate safety precautions to keep cyber offenders at bay.

KERI: After four tigers, including two cubs, were found dead within a span of four days, forest officials have failed to crack the case. While officials said that two villagers confessed to burying two of the cubs inside the Mhadei wildlife sanctuary in Sattari , they said the suspects didn’t disclose how the four tigers were killed.

Meanwhile, the two-member committee formed by the Centre to probe the deaths is set to arrive in Goa on Friday.

The tigers had reportedly killed a cow and buffalo belonging to Vitho Pavane and Malo Pavane respectively, which led forest officials to claim that the tiger deaths were “revenge killings”. Accordingly, the two were taken into custody. A third suspect, who was also rounded up, didn’t yield during investigations.

“After confessing to burying the tigers, both accused were taken to the spot where two of the cubs had been buried by them. However, they did not tell us how the four tigers died. Today, the postmortem of the fourth carcass that was found on Wednesday was done. Investigation is in progress,” said deputy conservator of forests Vikas Desai.

Forest officials maintain that the tigers were killed after consuming poisoned buffalo meat. But they have no concrete evidence to support this theory so far.

Wildlife conservationists said delayed action by forest officials in providing compensation are usually known to lead to such actions by forest dwellers affected by tigers preying on their cattle. For the two Pavane families, the killed cattle were a crucial source of livelihood.

On Thursday, veterinary doctors Harsh Bathini and Loveleen Vaz conducted a postmortem of the fourth sub-adult female tigress in the presence of inquiry officer Nandkumar Parab. The postmortem found in the abdominal cavity of the tigress the partially digested parts of a porcupine with quills. Remnants of two dead porcupines had earlier been found in the cashew plantation in the neighbouring village of Rive, a few meters away from the killed buffalo.

Out of the four tiger carcasses, only the fourth tigress’ abdominal cavity showed remains of the porcupines.

Confirming it, station house officer of Civil Lines police station, Amit Kumar, said an FIR has been registered against 25-30 unidentified students of AMU under IPC section 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion). He said the case was registered after the video of students shouting slogans was widely circulated on social media. He said the matter is being investigated in detail.

Hyderabad: Several environmentalists from the city on Thursday conducted a meet to discuss environmental issues due to the pollution created by pharma companies in the city and other parts of the state. “Due to ease of doing business, businessmen have hardly considered environmental issues and the government has given an easy pass to companies.

“Issues of granting of license and environment have not been taken into consideration,” said Damodar Reddy, an environmentalist from the city and added that Telangana State Industrial Project and Self-Certification System (TS-iPASS) facilitates speedy processing of applications to issue clearances required for setting up of industries.

“There are institutional mechanisms that come from three main laws that deal with pollution -The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1974, Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1981 and the Environment Protection Act of 1986, but these laws have been diluted by the government under the guise of TS-iPASS and ease of doing business. If one big pharma firm can causes so much pollution, one can only imagine what a 100 industries in pharma city can do,” said environmentalist Prof. K. Purushotham Reddy.

According to Central Pollution Control Board, Telangana has 59 such highly polluting industries of which 45 are in the surrounding areas of Hyderabad. Experts said that Hyderabad, being a major hub of bulk drug production and pharma firms, provides thousands of jobs in Telangana. However, they alleged that these industries are not recruiting more than 0.5% of the total local employees. “As per the Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index (CEPI), due to the pharma industries, the problem of water pollution has worsened in last eight years,” said Dr Narasimha Reddy, an independent policy expert and environmentalist.

Coimbatore: The seed testing laboratory in the city is all set to act as a facilitator to export seeds to the European Union (EU).

Representatives from the EU had visited the facility under the directorate of seed certification recently to review the standard operating procedures and lab equipment. An official, who didn’t want to be named said the EU was looking to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Centre to import seeds from India. As part of it, experts from the EU had visited Haryana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, the official said.

The MoU, she said, would be signed under the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an intergovernmental economic organization that works to build better policies for better lives.

In Tamil Nadu, they had visited the seed testing laboratory in the city last month. “The lab is the only public institution that has world-class equipment for seed testing in the region,” the official said. Three experts from Ireland and Slovenia visited the lab and they were accompanied by as many counterparts from the central Indian institutions, she said.

“They are looking to import paddy, cotton and vegetable seeds from here. If the MoU is finalized, our farmers would produce the seeds. The department of seed certification would oversee the field standards, while the seed testing lab would take care of seed standards. Both wings would work together,” she said.

The experts mainly looked for compliance to standard operating procedure and quality of the systems at the lab. “The lab has imported equipment of high caliber. Right from weighing to seed imaging to testing the moisture and germination of seeds, the lab has all equipment,” the official said.

The lab has equipment such as analytical balances, seed blower, seed imager to study seeds of size less than 1mm, digital moisture meter and cabinet germinator, the official said.

She said the EU experts were taken to fields to show them the farming practices of the region. “They seemed impressed by our facility. We expect a positive feedback from them.”

239,['10/01/2020'],Chorus rises for removal of police barricades from NH-16,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Visakhapatnam: At a time when the city police is placing barricades on the national highway to slow down traffic and reduce accidents, members of the AP Chambers of Commerce have sent a proposal to the Union government to remove all barricades from the NH .

On Thursday, during an interactive session with TG Venkatesh, chairman of parliamentary standing committee on transport, the trade body gave a nine-fold proposal to ease traffic on the busy and accident-prone NH-16 stretch that passes through the city. One of the proposals was to ask the local police and state government to remove barricades from that highway stretch.

“Because of the barricades, bottlenecks are created on the stretch that reduces the traffic speed considerably. Such things should not happen on a national highway,” Sudhir Mulagada, chairman of Visakhapatnam zone of the trade body, told TOI.

MY Danam, regional manager of Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC), too had made a similar request to the police during a recent meeting of the Visakhapatnam road safety committee. But the traffic department made it clear that they won’t remove the barricades from the accident-prone stretch.

The traffic cops have claimed that after the placement of 66 barricades on the stretch, there was a considerable fall in the number of accidents. A senior traffic department official said while 118 accidents were reported on that highway stretch in July 2019, the number came down to 91 in September after the barricades were placed. The number of injuries also reduced to 48 in September from 68 in July, he added.

Though Mulagada did not dismiss the cops’ claims, he said they need to sit down with the cops to find a middle path. “We have to sit down with the police to understand their logic behind putting these barricades. Bottlenecks and slow traffic on the highway is not a good option,” he added.

Another important proposal suggested by the members is removal of toll gates from the city limits to facilitate faster traffic movement. The other suggestions include construction of dedicated parking areas near petrol pumps for trucks, food plazas, washrooms, vehicle repair and servicing centres, and construction of 60-feet-wide service roads on both sides of the highway stretch passing through the city limits. “Now that Visakhapatnam is proposed to become the executive capital, traffic too would increase considerably. But these proposals are the need of the hour and are essential even if the city does not become the capital,” Mulagada added.

Tirupur: More than a month has lapsed since an unidentified man attempted to steal money from the hundials of Thirumuruganatha Swami Temple here, but police are yet to crack the case .

It was on the night of November 29, 2019, that the masked man entered the temple premises by drilling a hole on the giant compound wall and attempted to break open hundials using a crowbar and other tools. He hadn’t, however, succeeded in the attempt.

Subsequently, the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) department, which looks after the daily affairs of the temple that’s controlled by the Archaeological Survey of India (Asi), had a lodged a complaint with the Thirumuruganpoondi police. The HR&CE department HAD also handed over CCTV footages to police, who registered a case and launched a probe.

However, police haven’t made any progress in the case so far. “Identifying the accused is not easy as he had masked his face. We are probing the role of any habitual offenders in the theft attempt,” a police officer said.

Meanwhile, the HR&CE department has been beefing up security in the temple, which is already equipped with 16 CCTV cameras and an anti-burglary alarm. The temple authorities have ensured proper lighting on its premises and appointed one more night watchman based on the directions of police.

“We would soon install another 16 CCTV cameras. We have also written to ASI to replace the compound wall, which is weak in some points,” said an HR&CE official.

Mysuru: A year after the prasadam tragedy , moves are afoot to reopen the Kichguth Maaramma temple in Sulwadi village in Kollegal . State officials have visited the temple and reviewed the conditions and will submit a report for reopening soon, the tahsildar said.

On December 14, 2018, poisoned prasadam killed 17 devotees while more than 117 were taken ill. A seer had confessed to engineering the tragedy to wrest control of the temple trust. Following the deaths, the state endowment department took over the temple and it has been shut since. Locals are demanding that the temple be reopened at the earliest as it has caused anguish among devotees.

Kollegal tahsildar K Kunal said the agamikas of the state endowment department had visited the temple and reviewed the situation recently. “They will submit a report to the endowment department. Based on this, the temple-opening modalities will be taken up on the directions of the department and the Chamarajanagar DC,” he said.

Locals said the delegation from the state endowment department held discussions with them and assured that they would submit a report to the department soon.

However, some locals felt those who suffered in the tragedy should be part of the process. Balan, a grama panchayat member, said, “Those who suffered want relief before the temple doors are reopened. Authorities come and go but our opinion is not taken. Some people want the temple to reopen but others want status quo to prevail.”

Pattada Guruswamy of Saluru mutt, which controlled the temple before the tragedy, said he was not aware of moves for reopening.

MATHURA: A Mathura court has sentenced a man to life imprisonment for kidnapping and killing a minor boy in the district a decade ago.

The convict Omveer and his accomplice, also a minor, kidnapped the 14-year-old boy when he was playing outside his home in Barauth village in February 2010 to settle an old rivalry. They subsequently killed the boy and hid his corpse in a mustard field, 3 kms from the village, according to the prosecution.

After the two were arrested for kidnapping, murder and causing disappearance of evidence, they disclosed the crime and the body was recovered.

Omveer's minor accomplice was sentenced for three years imprisonment by a juvenile court.

Since the statements of a majority of witnesses corroborated the police investigation, Additional District Judge VI Sanjai Kumar Yadav on Wednesday awarded life imprisonment to Omveer and also imposed a fine of Rs 20,000, said Assistant District Government Council Udham Singh Chaudhary.

If Omveer fails to pay the fine, he would have to spend another year in prison, the judge ruled, adding that both the sentences would run concurrently.

BHUBANESWAR: Contrary to the state government’s whitepaper that 2,502 rape cases were registered in Odisha in 2018, the latest report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), released on Wednesday, states that only 918 rape cases were reported during the period.

Amid the data mismatch, opposition Congress alleged that the state government had suppressed data and did not share the correct figure with the national bureau.

“It is extremely shameful and condemnable that the government, instead of addressing the issue of rising criminal cases against women in Odisha, indulged in suppression of crime data,” Congress state president Niranjan Patnaik said.

The state home department’s whitepaper, featuring data on different crimes in 2018, was placed in the assembly in July last year. The data mentioned that at least 2,502 rape cases were registered in the state in 2018.

“We also found under-reporting of crimes towards some other heads, including suicide by farmers in the state in 2018. While we come across farmer suicides regularly, NCRB report said no farmer suicide took place in 2018. The NCRB authorities should seek an explanation from the state government for suppression of data,” Niranjan added.

According to the procedure, the state crime records bureau (SCRB) supplies all requisite crime statistics to the NCRB. However, the SCRB could not explain the reason of the data mismatch between the state’s figure and the NCRB report.

“We receive data from the district police offices and send it to the NCRB. All forms of crime classifications, sought by NCRB, were sent to them,” SCRB director Rajesh Kumar said.

Police denied allegation of suppression of data. Another police officer said the data mismatch occurred because of NCRB’s crime classification rules. “They (NCRB) have written in the beginning of their report that they have some limitations. If a single FIR has mention of crimes of different nature, the NCRB will consider only the most heinous crime with maximum punishment. For example, a murder with rape is accounted as murder only for the NCRB’s compilation of data,” the officer explained.

CHENNAI: The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) will fund the construction of nearly 18km elevated stretch between Meenakshi College in Kodambakkam and Poonamallee Bypass, which is part of Chennai Metro Rail Limited’s (CMRL) ambitious 118.9km 3-corridor phase-2 project.

The Beijing-headquartered bank will fund around Rs 2,306 crore ($320 million) to build the stretch linked by 18 elevated stations.

“We will call for tenders in another two to three months. A detailed design consultant, who will design the stations and the line, is already on the job. Soil test on this stretch is also completed,” an official said.

The stretch between Meenakshi College and Poonamallee bypass is part of 26.1km corridor 4 from Light House to Poonamallee Bypass. The stretch will link localities like Porur, Iyyappanthangal, Kattupakkam, Kumananchavadi, Karayanchavadi and Poonamallee which are otherwise not linked with good public transportation.

Officials said Asian Development Bank will fund the rest of the corridor between Light House and Meenakshi College covering around 8km.

Earlier, CMRL planned corridor 4 between Light House and CMBT linking core areas of the city including Mylapore, Adyar, Nandanam, T Nagar a Kodambakkam and Vadapalani. But they later extended the line to cover localities like Porur, Iyappanthangal, Kumanan Cahvadfi, Karayan Chavadi and Poonamallee, which were earlier planned to be part of monorail project, as studies found that the passenger traffic was high which could be handled only by metrorail services.

Construction for a 52km corridor in the phase is expected to begin in June. Tunnelling will be carried out on two stretches - from Venugopal Nagar in Madhavaram to Kellys covering 9km and from Kellys to Taramani Road Junction covering 12km. CMRL has invited tenders for the work.

The 52km stretch between Madhavaram and Sholinganallur and Madhavaram to CMBT will be funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).

Chennai: Some of the senior railway officials facing vigilance enquiry into the Train-18 case have replied to the chief vigilance officer of Chennai-based Integral Coach Factory (ICF) stating that the questionnaire served to them is a procedural violation as per the Indian Railways Act. At least one officer has refused to respond to the questionnaire citing this and has returned the envelope unopened, multiple official sources told TOI.

The issue pertains to a vigilance case opened by railways vigilance wing to probe the alleged procedural irregularities in the procurement of electrical propulsion system for the first two rakes of Train-18, which is operated as the Vande Bharat Express between Delhi-Varanasi and Delhi-Katra. After stopping production, ICF last month floated fresh tenders for procurement of propulsion system.

Top officials including former general manager Sudhanshu Mani, former chief mechanical engineer Shubhranshu, chief design engineers Srinivas and Vavre, chief electrical engineer NK Gupta, deputy chief engineer Amitabh Singhal, finance head Kanwaljeet Asla, another CME LC Trivedi and another chief design engineer DP Dash were served questionnaire. Some officials have responded stating that the vigilance questionnaire should have been served only after consulting respective controlling officers, which was not done.

For instance, one officer has replied that his controlling officer, Railway Board Member Rolling Stock was not consulted. “This is a violation of the Indian Railways Vigilance Manual,” the official wrote in the letter. Another official in a similar letter has stated that the procedure prescribed by the manual has been violated.

Another retired official in his response has stated that for natural justice to prevail, he should have been given ‘copies of the documents, file notings and correspondence pertaining to Train-18 to be able to make a complete and competent reply.’

The officer also stated that he had been asked to support his response with documents. “How can I do that once I’m retired and not in office,” he said in his reply. However, he has responded to the questions on alleged irregularities, stating that it was from memory alone. TOI has seen copies of some of these replies and spoken to other officials regarding their response.

When contacted, ICF chief vigilance officer G Loganathan declined to comment, stating that he was not authorised. Request for an official response through the spokesperson also went unanswered.

Kannur: CPM will organize Constitution protection collectives in 104 places in the district as part of the campaign against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The party said that it is against the Constitution to decide citizenship on the basis of religion.

This apart, a massive rally would be organized in Thalassery on January 13, in which chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran and prominent LDF leaders would participate, said CPM district secretary M V Jayarajan addressing a news conference here on Thursday. The collectives have already been held in some places. Jayarajan alleged that the BJP government at the Centre introduced this amendment to “divide the nation and people”. “Hence, the protest against this should not be limited to minority communities alone who are anxious about their future here,” said Jayarajan.

“That is why we decided to set up constitution protection committees,” he said, adding that the protest held in Thiruvananthapuram, in which both the ruling and opposition parties took part, within five days of the passing of the Bill was a model for the entire nation. When the assembly unanimously passed a resolution against CAA, the lone BJP member did not even vote against it because of the unity among the people of Kerala against this law, he pointed out.

The committees formed at the local level have the participation of the people who believe in secularism and democracy, but the communal and extremist organisations are not part of it, he said, adding that already 25 such committees have been formulated.

Congress and IUML activists had extended all cooperation to the campaign rallies held in the recent days, he claimed.

As per the new directives issued through a letter by Hockey India - Hockey Bhopal, Hockey Madhya Bharat (Jabalpur) and Hockey Madhya Bharat (Gwalior) - will lose their membership and Hockey Madhya Pradesh will come into existence from July 20 this year.

The letter states, “From July 1, 2020, the membership of your unit with the Hockey India will deemed to be withdrawn and you will be required to coordinate your sports activities related to hockey through Hockey Madhya Pradesh.” With the IOA emphasizing on the need for national federations to work in sync with its constitution, HI has decided to comply with clause 31.1.3 of IOA's statutes that states, “The right to vote in any of the national sports federation is granted to those associations that have only one sports association in one state for those sports. It implies, therefore, that in the field of sports, it will be ‘one state, one unit’ and at the national level it will also be one unit (national sports federation) for one sport.”

From July 1, only one team — representing Hockey Madhya Pradesh— will be allowed to participate in the Nationals. It has been made clear to Hockey Bhopal and Hockey Madhya Pradesh that from July 1, 2020, the operation area of the new state member unit (Hockey Madhya Pradesh) will be all the districts of the state, including the players registered with the Hockey Bhopal and Hockey Madhya Bharat.

When contacted, secretary Hockey Bhopal, Syed Jalaluddin Rizvi, admitted that he has received a letter in this regard. “We have been running hockey for more than a decade. I will write to Hockey India that we must be given the responsibility of the upcoming Hockey Madhya Pradesh,” said Rizvi.

HYDERABAD: All is not well in Choutuppal mandal’s Aregudem village. Locals say they are forced to spend Rs 200 every day to buy packaged water for household purposes. The borewell water is heavily polluted, thanks to large-scale presence of pharma firms.

The villagers’ concerns were corroborated by experts who said the water in the village was not fit for agricultural purposes.

While the recommended maximum level of total dissolved solids (TDS) in water is 500mg/l which is fit for use, experts found TDS to be as high as 2,000 mg/l to 20,000 mg/l. “We also found almost 10,000 tonnes of illegal solid waste dumped in and around the area. This, even as the people have been facing various health issues like skin diseases and respiratory problems,” said Damodar Reddy, an environmentalist.

Infuriated residents of this village in Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri district staged a dharna recently, demanding that expansion plans of Divis Pharma company be stalled. “The company is polluting groundwater. Even animals and cattle are not spared. Crops are dying and so are the cattle because of pollution ,” said Rajsekher Reddy, social activist from the village.“The company illegally dumps chemical waste without treatment. The borewell water is brown and some times black, but the authorities have turned a blind eye,” he charged.

The situation is much the same at Polepally village in Mahbubnagar. “Over the past couple of years, we have been complaining about the pharma companies causing pollution in the surrounding areas. In 2017, a letter was sent to the National Green Tribunal by locals about the issue,” said J Venkataiah, a farmer and resident of Polepally.

Nine companies were penalised, but they were small units, Venkataiah said. “Big players like Aurobindo Pharma Ltd, Hetero Labs, Shilpa Medicare, etc., have not been penalised. It is time criminal cases were filed against these companies,” the farmer said.

Erode: A 25-year-old female elephant was electrocuted near Thalavadi here in the early hours of Thursday when it tried to break through an illegal electric fence that was set up around a coconut farm.

According to a forest official, they have registered a case against the farm owner, 49, of Thiginarai village near Thalavadi, and arrested him for installing the electric fence without obtaining permission from concerned officials.

Pointing out that Thiginarai was situated adjacent to Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve, the officer said wild elephants used to stray into the village and raid farmlands.

“Rangasamy erected the electric fence to protect his crop from wild elephant raid. He used to power it at nights and disconnect power supply during daytime,” the officer said.

On Thursday around 4am, the elephant tried to damage the fence using its trunk to enter the coconut farm. “The elephant was electrocuted as soon as it touched the live wires,” the official said.

When alerted, forest officials conducted autopsy and buried the carcass in the forest area. “We have registered a case against Rangasamy and arrested him,” the forest official said.

252,['10/01/2020'],Madhya Pradesh CM Kamal Nath questions BJP on nationalism,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Kamal Nath

BHOPAL: Chief minister Kamal Nath on Thursday attacked BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for “teaching lessons on nationalism” to Congress, asking if PM Modi has even a distant relative who joined the freedom movement and whether BJP has a single freedom fighter.

“You have to realise the politics of BJP. It is just politics of diversion that we have perceived in the past six to seven years. Now that the assembly elections are near, look how they have diverted from real issues,” CM Nath said at a training camp of Congress’ grassroots organization, Seva Dal, on Thursday evening.

“There are questions and challenges before the nation that get no answer. Have you heard Modiji talk of the youth, farmers and women’s issues in the past few months? And they will teach Congress and Seva Dal lessons on nationalism. I always say that Modiji should name one person from his party who was a freedom fighter,” the CM said.

“If he was not there himself, then at least mention a relative who has fought for the country’s independence. Forget your name, leave out even the names of your ancestors, father and grandfather. They don’t have a single freedom fighter and want to teach nationalism to Congress,” Nath remarked at the Seva Dal camp.

CM Nath also attacked BJP over NRC and CAA. “Look how our country is under attack today and think of the outcome of this in the future. This is taking a dangerous turn. Many persons dismiss it as just politics and think it will all pass by. But the seeds that are being sown now will not go away,” CM Nath cautioned, reminding that the world looks upon India with respect for its unity in diversity and tradition of tolerance and brotherhood which is the essence of the Constitution.

“There is no other country like ours with so much diversity. The Soviet Union was there, but it disintegrated because their culture was not like ours. And our biggest strength is being attacked,” he said.

“If you go to register under NRC, there will be a question asking about your religion. You say, I am a Hindu. Then, they will ask for proof. Do you have proof you are a Hindu, your father was a Hindu and your grandfather was a Hindu? What is written in the Act is not important. What concerns us more is what is not written. Laws are made but there are sections that protect citizens also. Are those sections there?” he asked.

Reacting to the CM’s attack on PM Modi, LoP Gopal Bhargava said, “WasCM Nath a freedom fighter? Was his father or any person in his family part of the freedom movement? This debate is unnecessary and meant to divert the attention of people.”

Not a single manifesto promise of Congress has been implemented, he claimed. “Tirth darshan Yojana has stopped, 27,000 newly-wed couples are still awaiting the payment of Rs51,000 under Kanyadaan Yojana. It doesn’t matter if anyone has participated in the freedom struggle. Nationalism is defined as love for the nation. Seventy-two years have passed since the country became Independent. The chief minister should concentrate on good governance.”

Visakhapatnam: The wait for the new four-story court complex in the district court premises is on since years.

The cost for the Rs 31-crore project is said to have gone up by several notches in the meantime. However, the civil works of the building is still incomplete. A separate court complex with parking facilities was much needed as the existing cramped courtrooms are posing inconvenience for all.

After a wait of over three years since demolition of the old criminal court building in 2014, the foundation stone laying ceremony for the new court complex took place in early April 2017 on the district court premises. The first phase of the 2.78-acre court complex was supposed to be completed by 2018-end. After years of wait, the construction of the new court complex had begun in 2017 funded by the roads and building department. The work was going on at a slow pace and after sand shortage hit the market last year, works have come to a standstill. The civil works are incomplete and as per sources, the estimated cost likely to have escalated to nearly Rs 50 crore due to this delay.

President of Vizag Bar Association (VBA) G Maheswara Reddy said, “Around 50% works of the new court complex has been completed. The contractors have told us they would finish two floors in the first phase soon for courts to commence functioning though they have not given any deadline.”

Senior advocate and president of Forum of Legal Professionals Kuppili Muralidhar told TOI, “The new court complex was supposed to house different courts in four floors .”

M Purushothaman

CHENNAI: Two days after a Class IX boy went missing, his body was found on Wednesday in an abandoned well in Chengalpet district with the hands and feet tied. The boy, who had gone to a nearby temple, reportedly went missing on Monday and was found in the well near the land where the new collector’s office is set to come up.

Police said M Purushothaman, 14, was the second child of Murugan and Usha. Almost seven years ago, Usha separated from her husband and was staying at Kannadasan Street in Vembakkam in Chengalpet district. Purushothaman was a student in a nearby private school.

On Monday evening, Purushothaman had left home saying he would be visiting the Kannabiran temple near his house. He used to frequent the temple to meet his friends. As he did not return home till Monday night, his mother launched a search for him and contacted his friends. As she could not locate him, she lodged a complaint at the Chengalpet Taluk police station.

However, on Wednesday evening, public alerted police about a body on vacant land behind the Government Industrial Training Institute in Chengalpet. The land had been allotted for the construction of the Chengalpet collector’s office and there was an abandoned dry well near the land, police said.

Police, who recovered the body, said Purushothaman had injury marks on his hands and his limbs were tied. His mother confirmed his identity.

The Chengalpet Taluk police registered a case and sent the body to the Chengalpet Government hospital. Police said that other than the temple, the boy doesn’t venture anywhere. Police, who are clueless about the motive behind the murder, are probing whether any fight between the friends resulted in the murder.

AGRA: Yamuna River, near Gokul barrage in Mathura , has been flowing with bubbling thick foam and filth, caused by waste discharge. Though, the froth appears like snow, this toxic waste is full of residential and industrial discharges, confirmed district authorities in Mathura.

Prof Ateeque Ahmad from Geography department in Aligarh Muslim University, who has field specialisation in environmental planning and management, told TOI on Thursday that the condition appears like frozen water due to low temperature at surface of water bodies.

“The foam starts forming on the water due to high concentration of fluoride content, caused by industrial waste and it remains standstill due to low temperature at surface of water body during this period,” he said.

Such a situation may occur when concentration of fluoride content increases and also due to unusual low temperature in winter, he said, adding that this will be more visible in morning hours when the temperature is very low.

An activist, Gopeshwar Nath Chaturvedi, who filed a petition in NGT and Allahabad high court for cleaning and maintaining ecological flow of Yamuna, told TOI that there has been no change in river’s condition till date. He said, around 1,000 people, comprising marginal farmers, devotees and activists, had started a march from Kosi Kalan in Mathura to Delhi in 2015 in a bid to save the Yamuna that has presently turned into a sewer canal. The group reached the national capital with the intent of staging an indefinite protest, which was led by Ramesh Babaji Maharaj of Maan Mandir at Barsana.

But the protest was called off after the union government gave assurance to resolve the issue. He claimed that there has been no change in quality of water till date, in fact, aquatic animals have been found dead almost every year whenever pollution levels increases in the water.

It is worth mentioning here, cleaning of Yamuna is also part of the Namami Gange Mission and Government of India has been supplementing the efforts of the states for checking the rising level of pollution of Yamuna, a tributary of Ganga, by providing financial assistance to states of Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh in a phased manner since 1993 under the Yamuna Action Plan (YAP).

The Namami Gange Mission has been approved as the flagship programme by the Central government in June 2014 with a budget outlay of Rs 20,000 crore to accomplish the twin objectives of effective abatement of pollution, conservation and rejuvenation of national river Ganga.

257,['10/01/2020'],Health workers to help locate illegal sewage outfalls,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Chennai: Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC)’s health workers who are currently busy spraying mosquito larvicidal oil (MLO) to cut breeding of malaria mosquitoes will contribute to assimilation of a data spread that will help the storm water drain (SWD) department identify illegal sewage outfalls.

Senior officials in the civic body said in most of the locations, health workers have found that mosquito breeding is concentrated in some pockets of the storm water drain (SWD) channel. This means that there is water stagnation in some pockets of the drains, facilitating breeding.

“Since this is happening at a time when there is negligible rain, this means the water stagnation is due to illegal sewage being let out in drains,” said a senior official. This comes at a time when many residents across the city have complained about mosquito breeding.

Civic body’s engineers have repeatedly pointed out how many residential as well as commercial establishments have not obtained sewer connections and let out waste matters into the nearest SWD outlet.

Since the field-work by health workers will be documented in the vector control monitoring system, corporation’s engineers will get accurate data on the areas where this illegal practices are happening, the official said. Already, inter-departmental meetings have taken place discussing this aspect.

The corporation’s anti-mosquito drive has been mostly focussed only on the water-bodies like Cooum, Adyar and water canals. To put things into perspective, the waterways are 234km long in the city, while the storm water drain network has a total length of around 1,800km. “Even if 30%-40% of the network has stagnant water, it would be a cause for concern from the mosquito point of view,” another official said.

An official earlier said at the zonal level, there were dedicated staff for drain desilting work, who would monitor the mosquito breeding spots in the channels. “But now the desilting work is done by contractors,” the official said.

Visakhapatnam: Though property offences saw a steep fall of 32 per cent in 2019 compared to the previous year, giving the city a reason to cheer, crime mapping has revealed that 35 per cent of the offences took place in a handful of locations — MVP Colony, HB Colony, Seethammadhara, Lawson’s Bay Colony, Pandurangapuram, East Point Colony and few other spots under east and Dwaraka sub zones of the Vizag Police.

Close to 850 cases of property offences were reported in 2019, the corresponding figure for 2018 was 1,256.

Speaking to TOI, ADCP (Crime) V Suresh Babu said that the police department has adopted new strategies to nab habitual offenders, some of whom belong to inter-state gangs, bringing down the number of untoward incidents significantly.

“We observed that the over 35 per cent of the property offences were reported from posh colonies in the city. We are chalking out plans to mitigate the number of offences in the areas in the coming days,” he added.

Vizag Police Commissionerate has two divisions (North and South) and six sub-divisions — east, west, south, north, Harbour and Dwaraka sub-divisions. Among the six sub-divisions, Vizag east and Dwarka sub-divisions witnessed more incidents of theft — Rs 6.06 crore in cash, gold and silver ornaments were stolen in 2010 and the city police managed to recover Rs 2.77 crore with 50 per cent detection rate in the cases.

Crime mapping is one of the major tools to understand crime trends, crime-prone zones, the modus of operandi and pattern to the reduction of the crimes and nabbing the offenders. Crime mapping supplemented with preventive measures can play a critical role in keeping the city safe, said ACP of Central Crime Station, DS Sravan Kumar.

“We are working on keeping the number of break-ins in the city to a minimum this Sankranti vacation by deploying special teams at vulnerable locations in the city,” said a police official.

City police chief RK Meena said increasing number of online thefts were a cause for concern in the city. Cyber criminals stole over Rs 7.2 crore in 2019, while house break ins caused a loss of Rs 6 crore.

Hyderabad: With advance GDP estimates projecting FY20 GDP growth at 5% it is necessary for the government to look at measures to infuse capital in the economy in a systematic way, FICCI national president Sangita Reddy said on Thursday.

“FICCI is of the view that the fiscal deficit target could be relaxed to support infusion of Rs 1.5-2 lakh crore in the economy in the coming year as such fiscal expansion is much needed at the current juncture to give a boost to demand and trigger investments,” Reddy said in a release.

“The nature of the economy is cyclical and when a potential recessionary cycle is foreseen, move to induct more capital into the economy to re-energise it is more important than worrying about fiscal deficit. A time-bound plan must be put in place to repair fiscal deficit through different measures including disinvestment in PSUs,” she said.

Reddy said India Inc was looking forward to the government continuing taking steps towards bridging the existing gaps and giving out positive signals to boost sentiment, consumption and investments. “Apart from providing cheaper loans, more efforts must be made to increase incomes, especially in rural areas. This can be achieved through an increase in the quantum income support under PM-KISAN and expansion of the direct benefit transfer scheme. Steps are also required to boost construction, infrastructure and exports,” she added.

Pointing out that FICCI is conducting a survey across industry to assess the sentiment of the nation and what it would take corporate India to re-energise itself, Reddy said the government must enable reforms, which will enable ease of doing business, for sustaining growth and demand.

Chennai: Soon after the inauguration of the 43rd Chennai Book Fair on Thursday, a special auditorium showcasing artefacts excavated from Keeladi in Sivaganga district and the virtual reality show taking the visitors to excavation trenches became an instant hit with visitors to the fair.

The 3000sqft auditorium titled as Keeladi-Eeradi at the fair at YMCA grounds in Nandanam displayed 2,600 years-old artefacts like bones of humped bull, terracotta vessels, model of excavation trenches, replica of water management structures, black and redware bowls and pot sherds inscribed with Tamil Brahmi. Some of the ancient copper objects and Carnelian beads displayed at the auditorium also attracted many visitors and some of them took pictures with the ancient artefacts.

But, youngsters and old people queued up to get the feel of the Keeladi excavated site through virtual reality.

Tamil Nadu’s archaeology department has employed a virtual technology start-up to record 3D images of the Keeladi excavation site. With the help of virtual gears, viewers get a feel of entering the excavation site.

“It is excellent experience. I felt like being physically there in the trenches where the excavation is going on. We can also get the feel of ambience with trees in the surroundings are visible,” said R Mehandran, a civil service aspirant.

K S Madhuvanthie, a Class IX student said the experience was very exciting and she can see inside one of the tents at the excavation site. If visitors focus more on the objects, they can also view the Brahmi writings on the pot sherds at the site.

Adjacent to VR show, there were another display of excavated objects with explanation of their usages in Tamil. Viewers can also take a picture at Keeladi site using Kinect technology at the auditorium. The pictures will be mailed to them within hours.

Along with Tamil Nadu Textbook and Educational Services Corporation, the archaeology department brought out a book about Keeladi excavation and artefacts in 24 different languages.

“We are releasing Keeladi book at the Chennai Book Fair. Readers and visitors can buy a book in any language including French, Spanish and German and Mandarin,” said T Udhayachandran, commissioner of archaeology, Tamil Nadu.

Earlier, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami inaugurated the book fair and Keeladi-Eeradi auditorium. He also unveiled Tamil saint poet Thiruvalluvar's sand sculpture by Sudarsan Pattnaik at the venue.

He said, “The government would give Rs 75 lakh to Booksellers and Publishers’ Association of South India (BAPASI) to conduct book fair.”

MEERUT: Transporters are up in arms as they were charged an “entry fee” at three points in Meerut Cantt on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday. The Meerut Cantt Board had cancelled the order allowing the private contractor from imposing an “entry fee” on all commercial vehicles. However, the contractor cited a Allahabad High Court order, dated December 20, 2019, which put a stay on the Cantt board’s directive.

The fee is being levied to create funds for maintenance purpose as no new funds are being released for the same by the authorities. Earlier, no fee was charged. The instructions to levy a fee were given by the Cantt board on December 8. However, after protests, the board authorities withdrew their order on December 12 and cancelled the contract with the contractor. Later, the contractor approached the Allahabad High Court for relief and obtained a stay on the Cantt board orders.

On January 8, the contractor in question suddenly started taking an “entry fee” without informing the Cantt authority. He cited the HC order to do so.

According to sources, the authorities of the Meerut Cantonment Board have set up new barriers at three spots — Mawana Road, Roorkee Road and Jali Kothi — to collect an “entry fee” to the restricted area. This is in addition to the nine existing barriers. The fee ranges between Rs 25 and Rs 150 depending on the size of the vehicle.

Mamta Kansey, additional CEO, Meerut Cantt, said, “We did not give any permission to the contractor to collect the fee, and the procedure was started without bringing this to our knowledge. A board meeting is scheduled for January 14. Before this, there is little that we can do because of the court order.”

MEERUT: Six deaths in just six weeks were enough to instill fear. Panicked villagers in affected parts of western UP’s Bijnor have stopped venturing out alone after the darkness falls. And when they do, they go out in groups huddled together, vigilant and armed. “Leopards, although shy, give you a swift death,” said a villager in Najibabad area, where the felines have mauled three persons to death in the last one month. On Monday, a leopard killed a 14-year-old boy in Najibabad’s Bhogpur village. Soon, enraged villagers shot the animal dead and dragged the carcass for a mile. Administration and forest department officials came later, and booked 80 villagers for killing the animal.

According to experts and forest department officials, the count of leopards has increased considerably in the region, although no one knows their exact numbers in the absence of census. With the numbers, their “trespasses” have also increased, posing a challenge before the forest authorities.

This man-animal conflict will give space to poachers and forest tribes if government agencies are not able to act on time and mitigate the growing crisis, experts believe. “It has already started,” one of them said, while referring to a recent seizure of leopard skin worth Rs 20 lakhs in street market from three poachers in neighbouring Saharanpur district.

“Seizure of leopard skin in Saharanpur is just the beginning of a dangerous trend. There is a growing disenchantment among villagers whose role is critical to the conservation of wildlife. As the forest department is ill-equipped to reduce man-animal conflict, poachers and hunting tribes like Kanjars and Badhiya can easily join hands with panicked villagers to ‘address their problems’ and this obviously will expose leopards and other animals in the region to grave risk,” said Abrar Ahmed, illegal wildlife trade investigator and former programme officer at Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna in Commerce (TRAFFIC-India).

“Perception created by these communities among the farmers and villagers is that they help alleviate human-animal conflict through their traditional vocation of capturing animals,” he adds.

Baljeet Singh, a certified hunter who was on several occasions engaged by the UP and Uttarakhand governments to kill man-eaters, says the problem is going to rise in the future due to depleting green cover and ever-increasing farming lands.

“Though there has been no census done for the leopard in this area, but my experience tells me that there are no less than 200 in Bijnor district. I have seen six of them recently, including four cubs around my village in Jhaalpur,” says the hunter who has so far killed a dozen man-eating leopards in the last four decades.

When contacted, divisional forest officer (DFO) of Bijnor, M Semmaran, a veteranian who rescued more than a dozen leopard cubs from Bijnor, Amroha and Moradabad, told TOI, “There is always a possibility of poachers taking advantage of the vulnerability of villagers. And, the only way out of this situation is creating awareness among farmers in favour of the big cats. Death of villagers in leopard attacks is certainly unfortunate. We have our infrastructure in place, with all cameras fitted in the region. This year we will certainly have census of the leopard.”

Farmers, on the other hand, are stuck between the deep sea and the devil. “Leopards are a kind of evil necessity for us as they keep stray animals and neelgai away from our crops. But, at the same time, these big cats, if turn man-eaters, can play havoc with our lives especially when forest department is unable to mitigate the crisis due to lack of expertise and equipment,” says Rajender Singh, a villager based in Muzaffarnagar.

AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi at the plenary session on ‘Organisational Burden on Political Parties’ on Thursda... Read More

HYDERABAD: Pointing out how parties tend to make attempts to be in the good books of multinationals that fund elections, MIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi said there should be prohibition on sponsorship of elections by multinationals and NGOs. He also said that electoral bonds must be done away with to bring about a level playing field for parties.

Speaking at the plenary session on ‘Organisational burden on political parties’ organised as part of the Indian Democracy at Work Conference- Money Power in Politics, he pointed out that political parties representing marginalised communities lack a level playing field when it comes to elections and are finding it increasingly difficult to fight elections, as each is getting costlier.

“The real cost of sustaining a political party is in competing with disproportionately richer political groups which are now back by corporate donations. This means that parties will not only have to compete for voters but also for being in the good books of large businesses. Therefore, the most urgent reform I believe is to prohibit all forms of corporate donations and NGO donations.”

Owaisi also struck off electoral bonds as a viable option. “Electoral bond is a mystery. It is wrong on principles of equity and transparency. I am of the opinion that it is better to let citizens contribute as I am answerable to citizens,” he added.

He said that among other issues was the privilege that bigger national parties enjoyed. “The biggest injustice is we are carrying a legacy of the British era. For example, any national party having 7 MPs will get subsidised land for construction in Delhi. The expenditure of star campaigners up to 40 is not included in electoral expenditure of the party. These things work in favour of bigger parties and prevent smaller parties from catching up,” he added.

Representative image

CHENNAI: Presence of hawkers and street vendors can help prevent anti-social activities and even trafficking in such areas, claimed an association of hawkers of NSC Bose Road, which has been declared a no-hawking zone.

Hawking and street vending are recognised and permitted in many countries with appropriate regulation. But in the guise of enumerating hawkers, many new people are added to the list while persons who are hawking in the NSC Bose Road for over three decades are left, advocate Nagasaila, representing the association, said.

The issue pertains to a contempt plea moved by social activist Traffic Ramaswamy and another PIL by a charted accountant to maintain the road as a no-hawking zone as per the directions of the Supreme Court. When the pleas came up for hearing, the association submitted that the Chennai corporation authorities are conducting the enumeration through private agencies who have engaged persons who do not even speak the local language for the process. “The authorities will not complete the process or implement the provisions of the Street Vending Act for their own interest of collecting mamool form such vendors,” she added and said that the only way to find a proper solution for the issue is to include the hawkers in the enumeration process.

However, additional advocate-general PH Arvind Pandian representing the corporation submitted that the enumeration process has been completed in all 15 zones in terms of Street Vendors (Protection of livelihood &Regulation of Street Vending) Act 2014. As for NSC Bose Road, he said the town vending committee rejected the request with regard to 637 street vendors in zone V.

Recording the submissions, a division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and Justice R Hemalatha put a specific question as to the steps taken to check unauthorised parking of two-wheelers on the extended platform along the NSC Bose Road. To this, Pandian submitted that there is a proposal to place bollards at all the intersections from Rajaji Salai to Govindappa Naicken Street for which estimates have been prepared for Rs 28.95 lakhs which is inclusive of fixing duct doors, water tables and floor concrete. Tenders have been floated for the work and it is expected to be completed by February 28, he added.

The bench directed the corporation to publish the enumeration list in its official website and adjourned the hearing to March 10.

Representative image

BHUBANESWAR: To improve learning abilities of weaker students, the state government has decided to conduct extra classes for them during summer vacation. Teachers will take classes on rotation basis for these students, said school and mass education minister Samir Ranjan Dash.

“State government is taking several learning enhancement programmes (LEPs) for improvement in standard of kids and to ensure that students feel confident to take examinations. So to encourage students, who are weak in studies, they will be asked to attend extra classes during summer vacation,” Dash said.

An official source said after the final examination results are out, students, who are found performed badly in the exam, will have to come to school to attend classes during the holidays for the next session. Teachers, who will come to school on roster duty will implement learning enhancement programmes like Ujjwal and Utthan schemes during the holidays, he added.

Government schools close for around 45-50 days for summer vacation in May-June every year. The one-and-a-half month time can be effectively used for improving the standards of children by taking extra classes for them, he pointed out. The classes will be held for students up to class IX.

The minister further informed that a lot of districts, including Cuttack , Kendrapara , Kandhamal and others, have undertaken special measures to ensure mission zero fail in matriculation examination. This year 82 schools across the state had zero results, said an official.

While parents welcomed the decision of the government, teachers were apprehensive about losing the summer holidays. “It is good that government is thinking about weak students and trying to improve their standard by conducting extra classes. If they get proper guidance and intervention at the right time then many of them may make up when the schools reopen,” said Ajanta Parida, mother of a Class IV student.

“Unlike other jobs, teachers get some extra holidays during summer and winter vacations. But of late due to different administrative works and trainings we are not getting these holidays. Now these extra classes will add to the burden of teachers,” said a teacher, requesting anonymity.

Trichy: Ever since the death of a 24-year-old woman in Chennai after an illegal banner fell on her, the authorities have prevented hoardings from cropping up at public spots in Trichy city. However, political parties have now an alternative to make their presence felt and appease their visiting party seniors - traffic islands and roundabouts. Though flags erected on the traffic islands and roundabouts are as fatal as flex hoardings, the government agencies are yet to take a step against it.

As the BJP conducted a demonstration in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Trichy on Thursday, party flags occupied the traffic islands of Major Saravanan signal and Palakkarai roundabout. Dozens of BJP flags were erected and tied to the traffic infrastructure. Thursday’s incident was not the first of its kind, as various political outfits had done it recently to welcome their senior party leaders to the city.

While city police and Trichy City Corporation have taken a tough stand against illegal flex banners ever since the death of Subashree in Chennai, they lack the steam in tackling the flags in public places. ""Flags erected on public spots are also risky. Police and the civic body should take steps against erecting flags on roads as well,"" S P Thiyagarajan, an RTI activist, said. City traffic police remain a mute spectator to the violations or blame it on the corporation or the state highways department.

AGRA: Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) administration on Thursday issued a warning to students to end their sit-in against CAA at Bab-e-Syed gate, as it violates a high court order that bars holding of any protest at the main gate of AMU’s administrative block.

The AMU administration has put notices in campus, stating all concerned are requested to comply with orders of the high court, which direct the Aligarh district magistrate and SSP to ensure that no person is allowed to “convene, hold, attend, address or take part in procession or join any kind of dharna pradarshan and rally, either at the main gate of the administrative block of AMU or within 100m radius of the block and the VC’s lodge inside campus”.

In response, students’ leaders claimed they had measured the distance at which they have set up their protest site, and it is more than the distance suggested by the high court. Former students’ union president Faizul Hassan said their protest will continue, notwithstanding directions of the varsity administration.

Meanwhile, hundreds of students formed a human chain from the Arts Faculty lawn to Bab-e-Syed gate, to express solidarity with JNU students and teachers who were attacked by masked men in their campus.

Demanding immediate action against the goons, the students also sought a probe into the role of Delhi Police and JNU administration in the attacks. They also demanded withdrawal of FIRs lodged against several JNU students including its Union president Aishe Ghosh.

Continuing their protest against CAA, NPR and NRC, the students sang revolutionary songs and poems in chorus, led by Haider Saifullah, such as Faiz Ahmad Faiz’s Hum Dekhenge, Hafeez Meeruthi’s Zanjeeren and El Profesor’s Bella Ciao.

It may be noted that Faiz’s poem, Hum Dekhenge, had created a controversy after IIT Kanpur set up an enquiry to decide whether it is anti-Hindu, a move that was criticized by eminent literary figures including Javed Akhtar.

The protest on Thursday was concluded by recitation of the AMU anthem (Tarana) and India’s National Anthem in succession.

MEERUT: Uttar Pradesh government is planning to make WhatsApp groups of block education officers in each district to keep a check on implementation of government policies and school activities. This, government authorities say, will make it easier to keep a check on the policies being implemented in schools in the entire state.

“This is to bring to your notice that in order to keep a check on government policies being executed in the schools and to also see whether school activities are being carried out properly or not, all the block education officers should share their numbers registered on WhatsApp. This is being done so that a WhatsApp group at the state level can be formed to get a daily update from all schools,” Vijay Kiran Anand, state project director, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, has said in an order.

The numbers have been asked from each district in a tabular format, which has been shared with all 75 districts of UP.

Snow-covered picturesque Mukhba village near Gangotri

DEHRADUN/MUSSOORIE/UTTARKASHI: The weather cleared on Thursday after almost three days of incessant rain and snowfall in many places across Uttarakhand. People basked in the sunshine which came as a welcome relief from the cold wave conditions. However, over 100 roads, including the Gangotri and Yamunotri national highways in Uttarkashi remained blocked on Thursday following the heavy snowfall that had taken place at many places across the state a day earlier.

In terms of accessibility, Pauri district remained the worst affected with around 40 roads, mostly village link roads, remaining blocked, while over three dozen roads in Uttarkashi district were also obstructed due to heavy snowfall. Badrinath and Kedarnath national highways, which had also been blocked on Wednesday, were opened for traffic movement on Thursday evening, according to state emergency operation centre (SEOC)

Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat who took stock of the situation, told mediapersons that “all the concerned agencies and departments are at work and efforts are on to open all blocked roads.” “The situation will be normal in the next 24-48 hours,” he added.

Electricity and water supply in several villages across the state were also disrupted. In Uttarkashi, drinking water supply was reported to have been disrupted in as many as 55 villages including Harsil, Mukhba, Raithal, Barsu, Kharsali, Jankichatti, Kupda, Narayanpuri, Kimdar, Pujeli, Liwadi and Fitadi among others.

Meanwhile, cold day conditions prevailed across Uttarakhand with temperatures, both maximum and minimum, settling below normal levels. Mussoorie was recorded as the coldest place in the state on Thursday with mercury plunging to a minimum of -2.5 degrees Celsius. Heavy snowfall in the Queen of Hills on Wednesday had thrown traffic completely out of gear as the roads were blocked and entry of vehicles inside the town had been stopped by police. However, from early Thursday morning, JCBs were deployed and snow was cleared from all connecting roads of the town. Although vehicles from Dehradun were being stopped at Kothal gate and were later allowed to come up till Jaypee bend, this did not deter many tourists who walked nearly 4 km from Jaypee bend to enjoy the snow which was between 9 to 10 inches deep in most places.

Normal traffic on Mussoorie-Dehradun road was resumed by late afternoon. Meanwhile, electricity supply which had been disrupted due to faults as well as trees falling on the supply line in Mussoorie, was resumed by Thursday evening.

In Dehradun, the maximum temperature was recorded at 10.8 degrees Celsius, almost eight notches below normal, while the minimum settled at 4.5 degrees Celsius, two degrees below the normal level.

The regional meteorological centre has predicted continuation of cold conditions across the state on Friday as well.

Protest by a section of students at NUJS

KOLKATA: A group of students of the West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences ( WBNUJS ) “uninvited” Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar from a prestigious event of the university. These students are protesting against the governor’s stand on the CAA . The event, International Mock UN or MUN , starts on Friday.

According to sources, soon after Jagdeep Dhankhar came to Bengal as the governor in last August, an official invite was sent to Raj Bhavan, requesting his presence at the closing ceremony of the event as the chief guest. Raj Bhavan, sources said, had on January 6 gave its consent and subsequently sought more information to work out the logistics. This invite was “withdrawn” early on Thursday. Raj Bhavan chose not to react to the issue. TOI sent a written query to the governor, but it evoked no response. Interestingly, Trinamool Congress MP, Derek O’Brien has been invited to inaugurate the event on Friday.

Public posts on social media by a group of students, who are part of the NUJS International MUN organising committee, say explicitly why they first chose to invite the governor and then why they chose to “uninvite” him. The post mentions that the decision had been taken after a meeting of the Juridical Association — the governing body of the students’ association. This comment has got the students of the university divided because the Juridical Association categorically said there was no GB on the issue and no resolution was taken. This was confirmed to TOI by student vice-president, Akshat Kaushik.

The Association has 600 student members, of whom about 45 felt that the governor should be “uninvited”. “He had been invited at the behest of a particular student. We were excited about the invitation. Surprisingly, this student is now part of the 45-strong group which feel that the governor should not come to the NUJS campus. He has gone ahead and sent a mail to uninvite him. The students’ body is in a fix over this,” said a student.

A detailed mail sent out by this student (the same person who had sent the first mail to Raj Bhavan) indicated that though they had sent an invite to the governor, statements made by the governor in December 2019 “where inconsistent with the views and ideals of the NUJS MUN Society and the NUJS general body at large”. The student reasoned it was then Congress MPs Gaurav Gogoi and Jyotiraditya Scindia were invited to the programme to replace the governor. But this wasn’t informed to the Raj Bhavan then because the students did not get any response to their August invite till then.

VISAKHAPATNAM: When the future seemed blurred after having experienced two major jolts in life, Marta Valdivia, a biker from Spain realised that it was time to chase her dreams. The first jolt was when she was diagnosed with breast cancer and second when her business had to be shut down.

During her first solo biking world tour with a cause to raise awareness on cancer, Marta was on a two-day visit to the Port city to interact with the members of Women’s International Motorcycle Association (WIMA) and the other bikers of the city. Marta reached Visakhapatnam via Anantapur and left to Odisha from the city on Thursday. The 55-year-old has travelled 11 countries and covered 15,000 km already through her solo bike tour. A few of the countries include France, Italy, Bulgaria , Bosnia, Iran, Turkey and others. In India, the female biker has been through Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Chennai, etc. The next country she plans to reach is Myanmar via West Bengal.

During her visit to the city, Marta, said, “If there is something that has remained unchanged throughout my life, it has been my passion for the motorcycle and road. After closing my companies, I decided to make my passion for the motorcycle my new way of life. But I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012 and when I got my mastectomy done along with chemotherapy sessions, it left me on the verge of death.”

“The burning passion of motorbiking and the diagnosis of cancer gave me a reason to chase my passion. Hence, having battled cancer, I decided to take up biking with a cause and to spread the word that cancer is not the end of life,” added Marta.

When asked about the city of destiny, Marta said that she loved the city and it felt like home.

North Spain’s geography is similar to the Port City, she pointed out. She also said that the people are very warm with great hospitality. “I would want to come back to the city and meet my fellow bikers,” she said.

“I wanted to project something for women in an environment as masculine as the motorcycle. I wanted to break the stereotypes which led to a project ‘La Motera’ (Women on wheels) that reflects on the needs of women, especially those who have made the motorcycle their means of transport, their hobby or way of life,” added Marta who rode for around 50 kms in the city covering the coastal stretch.

NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday upheld the decision of the deputy registrar to dissolve the managing committee of MKP College Society and call fresh for elections.

The committee which is tasked with managing the affairs of North India’s first college for women is elected by the MKP College Society. However, the deputy registrar in 2013 said that as the society did not follow the rules and regulations of its constitution therefore the new constitution and all its activities, including election of managing committee were dissolved.

Speaking to TOI, Sashank Pandey the lawyer appearing for one of the respondents said that the MKP Society then approached the court arguing that the registrar’s decision was wrong. “However, the court upheld the decision and has now ordered the registrar to see that a fresh election for the managing committee is conducted within three months,” Pandey said.

The bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma said in their order that the registrar was within his rights to reject the amendments in the constitution of the society and therefore call for fresh election. “Since the certificate of registration of the society expired on October 9, 2015, and the application for renewal of the certificate of registration of the society is still pending before the deputy registrar, we direct the deputy registrar to convene a meeting of all the members of the Society for election of the managing committee within three months,” the order read.

When the plea moved by R Girirajan, legal wing secretary of DMK, came up for hearing, R Nedunchezhian, counsel for election commission, contended that the plea moved as a PIL cannot be entertained. He further submitted that in respect of counting for election to the posts of chairperson and vice-chairperson to district panchayat councils and panchayat union councils, CCTV cameras would be put in place for the purpose of video recording only. Even during the election to the rural local bodies, no audio recording facility was provided, he added.

Recording the submissions, a division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and Justice R Hemalatha said, “This court is of the considered opinion that since the petitioner himself is said to have been aggrieved by the alleged irregularities that took place in the recently concluded phase of the local body election, the relief cannot be sought through a PIL.”

The bench then directed the registry to list the petition before the roster judge for further hearing. According to the petitioner, the indirect election to the post of chairperson and vice-chairperson is scheduled to be held on January 11.

“During the counting of votes held on January 2, many irregularities, malpractices, misuse of power and illegalities were committed by the election officials in collusion with the ruling AIADMK and in various places, even after declaration of results in favour of DMK candidates, the results were illegally changed and subsequently AIADMK candidates were declared elected,” the party said.

A similar situation may arise in the forthcoming indirect election too. Therefore, to ensure transparency, besides CCTV camera recording, the entire election process should be videographed with audio recording which shall be preserved, the petitioner said. This apart, the petitioner wanted the court to direct the commission to ensure that except the returning officer, candidates and police, others were not allowed inside polling and counting rooms.

CHENNAI: The Madras high court has refused to entertain a PIL by DMK for a direction to the Tamil Nadu State Election Commission to videograph and audio-record the entire process of indirect election to chairperson and vice-chairperson posts in district panchayat councils and panchayat union councils to ensure free and fair elections .

When the plea moved by R Girirajan, legal wing secretary of DMK, came up for hearing, R Nedunchezhian, counsel for election commission, contended that the plea moved as a PIL cannot be entertained. He further submitted that in respect of counting for election to the posts of chairperson and vice-chairperson to district panchayat councils and panchayat union councils, CCTV cameras would be put in place for the purpose of video recording only. Even during the election to the rural local bodies, no audio recording facility was provided, he added.

Recording the submissions, a division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and Justice R Hemalatha said, “This court is of the considered opinion that since the petitioner himself is said to have been aggrieved by the alleged irregularities that took place in the recently concluded phase of the local body election, the relief cannot be sought through a PIL.”

The bench then directed the registry to list the petition before the roster judge for further hearing. According to the petitioner, the indirect election to the post of chairperson and vice-chairperson is scheduled to be held on January 11.

“During the counting of votes held on January 2, many irregularities, malpractices, misuse of power and illegalities were committed by the election officials in collusion with the ruling AIADMK and in various places, even after declaration of results in favour of DMK candidates, the results were illegally changed and subsequently AIADMK candidates were declared elected,” the party said.

The board officials had earlier claimed that a printed gazette would be circulated containing the results but that never came out. Then we were told to check the result from the website, but no one had an answer on how to access the internet since we have had no net access in the valley since the past five months,” said Raina while talking to TOI over phone.This is when the Dehradun-based J&K Students’ Association came to the 17-year-old student’s rescue. A member of the association checked Raina’s result and informed him that he has scored 80 % with highest marks in science. Immediately after knowing his own result, Raina shared the helpline number with 45 other friends who also managed to know their marks from the same source.Nasir Khuehami, spokesperson of the J&K Students’ Association said that the association had helped scores of students of Kashmir valley — that is facing an internet clampdown since August 2019 — by finding out their exam results. “We have circulated among students in the valley the numbers of as many as 60 of our volunteers across the country who have checked the results of the students and shared the details with them immediately.”He claimed that “approximately 7000 students from Kashmir have been helped till now.” “We have divided responsibilities among the volunteers. While some are attending calls, others are checking the results simultaneously,” Khuehami said.Junaid Ayub, a volunteer from Dehradun, who told TOI that his team of five volunteers had checked around 1000 results till Thursday, said that calls are continuously pouring in from students anxious to know how they had fared.“It is a mixed feeling as those who have passed with good grades are ecstatic and thanking us profusely for conveying the good news while those who score badly are disconnecting the calls without uttering a word,” he said.Mehraj Hussain, a volunteer from Punjab, said that he was glad that he was engaged in a noble cause.“Class 10th is the first and the biggest result one faces in his or her academic life.

300,['10/01/2020'],"Junked laws are still part of syllabus, say Osmania University students","This story is from January 10, 2020

SECUNDERABAD: Final year law students of Osmania University (OU) raised concerns over LLB syllabus on Thursday claiming that it continues to have laws that were either amended or were repealed in the recent past.

Questions over the syllabus were raised during the recent semester exams conducted by the university. In the criminal procedure code law of juvenile justice and probations of offenders’ paper, students were asked to write a brief note on the salient features of Juvenile Justice Act, 2000, which was repealed by the Parliament in 2015. “Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 came into force from January 15, 2016. But still, OU is making us study the repealed Act instead of the 2015 Act. Why are we asked to study a 20-year-old law which was repealed five years ago?” asked Alluri Divakar Reddy , a student of Pendakanti Law College, who wrote a letter to the in-charge vice-chancellor seeking revision of the syllabus.

Students claim that despite revising the LLB syllabus in 2017, the university failed to add the new JJ Act, 2015 by removing the repealed Act of 2000, and added that Consumer Protection Act, 2019 was also passed by the Parliament repealing the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Following the semester exams, students demanded that there are many laws which were amended in the Parliament over the last two years.

“We are close to 10,000 law students who are studying the same old syllabus prescribed by the university. The university must revise the syllabus in the next academic year and make the necessary amendments,” said a student.

When TOI contacted GB Reddy, dean, faculty of law at University College of Law, OU, he said that the syllabus is revised once in every three years. “It is true that several amendments were made to many enactments in 2018 and 2019. These recent changes are so numerous and drastic in certain cases that it is difficult even for practicing lawyers to comprehend,” said Reddy. Reddy said the varsity will try to incorporate the changes during the next immediate revision in 2020. “However, the teachers concerned must be up-to-date with these changes and the examiners also must ensure the same while examining the students,” he added.

301,['10/01/2020'],Swachh stats ‘whistleblower’ sacked from Gwalior civic body,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Bhopal: A computer operator of Gwalior Municipal Corporation — who had alleged flaws in the performance audit of various cities in Madhya Pradesh during Swachh Survekshan 2019 and sought an inquiry by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office — has been terminated from service on charges of ‘conspiring against a government department’.

Various associations in Gwalior have registered protest and have submitted memorandums to revoke the termination of Sandeep Sharma.

Sharma claims he has been targeted for speaking up against wrongdoings. “They initially asked me to ‘work together’, but when I raised objections against bogus inputs (for the Swachh survey), I was removed,” Sharma told TOI, adding he plans to move Supreme Court for an inquiry into the technical evaluation of Swachh Survekshan.

Sharma’s termination order says he has violated civil services rules by misusing his official position and “creating a confused relationship between state and the central government”. It accuses Sharma of moving court without the state government’s permission, that too by submitting documents that he was not authorised to access. “This act falls in the category of grave indiscipline. Since he has submitted unauthorised documents in court with false accusations and complained against senior officers at various platforms,” reads the order, signed by Gwalior municipal commissioner Sandeep Kumar Makin.

This officer could not be contacted for his version despite several attempts.

A few days ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office had ordered an inquiry into Sharma’s complaint that data was fudged in evaluating performances of cities in Madhya Pradesh during Swachh Survekshan. The ministry of housing and urban affairs was asked to investigate.

Sharma claims to be in possession of documents and data analysis reports to prove that facts and figures were distorted by consulting agencies in connivance with a section of officials of the urban administration. He says Gwalior was placed 32nd despite the outstanding work by its municipality to keep the city clean. “Gwalior is being counted among the dirtiest cities in the country because false data was submitted and this should be exposed,” Sharma says, adding that survey companies are paid in crores from public money, so he has every right to challenge their work.

Madhya Pradesh won the best performing state award for solid waste management in the 2019 survey in terms of door-to-door garbage collection, segregation, recycling, and composting. In 2018, MP was certified the first in the country to achieve 100% door-to-door garbage collection. And in 2017, all urban areas of the state were declared ODF with construction of 4.80 lakh household toilets.

“Gwalior performed better than many other cities under Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban), but false data management by agencies led to its defeat in the 2019 survey. It was downgraded in comparison to Indore, Bhopal, Ujjain, Jabalpur, Chhindwara, Neemuch, Peethampur, Devas, Singrauli and Khargon,” Sharma had alleged in his complaint to PMO.

Gwalior scored only 200 out of 500, whereas Singrauli got 500 despite applying with similar documents, he claims, alleging that data was generated without physical verification. “I have requested the PMO to conduct a fair and impartial inquiry and constitute a committee for proper assessment of ranking,” Sharma added.

Eight cities of MP — Indore Ujjain, Dewas, Bhopal, Khargone, Nagda, Singrauli, and Jabalpur — figured among the top 25 cleanest cities of India in the last survey. Indore was #1, while Bhopal slipped from second place to 19th. Ujjain was adjudged cleanest medium city (population 3-10 lakh). The ministry of urban affairs has been conducting Swachh Survekshan every year since 2016 to evaluate cities on cleanliness standards.

NAINITAL/ALMORA/PITHORAGARH: The heavy snowfall on Wednesday night brought joys for tourists who had come to Nainital after predictions of heavy snowfall. While much of the Mall Road was covered in snow after it started snowing on Wednesday evening and continued till midnight, places such as Naina Devi temple, Kilbury Road, Snow View Point and many other locations were also draped in snow.

Kautibh Roy, a tourist from Kolkata said that he and his family were finally happy to see the snow draped hill station. “We have been to Nainital many times but it’s the first time that we saw snowfall. My family was out on the Mall Road till midnight enjoying the snowfall,” he said. Tourists said they were finally happy to see snow for which they had travelled from Kolkata.

However, as the tourists were happy with the season’s heaviest snowfall in Nainital, local residents were badly affected since most of the roads were blocked and cars couldn’t even move. Those who had to travel remained stuck in their homes and power supply which was cut off on Wednesday night around 9 remained so till late afternoon on Thursday. “I had to go to Ghaziabad for official work but I can’t since my car is stuck in snow and the road downhill is too slippery,” Ranjan Sah, a resident of the Zila Panchayat Road. The snowfall and the rush of tourists also led to traffic snarls at many locations. Though the Mall Road was free of jams, Haldwani-Nainital Road saw much traffic and cars were stopped at Rusi Bypass. “As a preventive measure, we had to stop the movement of private vehicles beyond Rusi bypass due to tourist rush and the threat of accident due to snow,” said Nainital circle officer Vijay Thapa.

Meanwhile, due to the heavy snowfall and extreme cold on Wednesday, a person died in Artola area of Almora district . Revenue police officers said that they had received information of a person being buried under snow in the morning. “The deceased has been identified as Kishan Singh, 45, a resident of Bajgaon village,” said Gopal Singh Bisht, revenue sub inspector.Incidentally, a dozen roads in Almora and Bageshwar districts were blocked following heavy snowfall on Wednesday. Power supply is also reported to be disrupted at several places.

The Almora disaster management department said that Almora-Ghat Motor Road was closed near Panuwanula area and among other roads blocked were Suvakhan-Daram-Chalinchina, Artola-Jageshwar and Panuvanula-old Jageshwar motorway.

Rakesh Joshi, Almora district disaster management officer, said, “PWD and disaster management teams are working together to open the roads at the earliest. All roads have been opened, except Kafadkhan-Binsar Motor Road.”

Heavy snowfall also disrupted normal life in Pithoragarh district . Heavy snowfall on Thrusday night cut off Munsyari from the district headquarters in Pithoragarh. Apart from that, five other roads are also blocked in the district.

BHOPAL: BJP on Thursday attacked senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh for his remarks against RSS, saying he has been exposed as a “pseudo Hindu”.

“Digvijaya could see terrorism in ‘bhagwa’ (saffron), but not in madrasas. Saraswati Shishu Mandirs do not need a certificate from Digvijaya Singh. The Congress leader is blind to terrorism that emanates from madrasas. He shares the same platform with those who oppose Vande Mataram, use ‘ji’ as honorific for terrorists such as Osama bin Laden and Hafiz Saeed,” said BJP MLA from Huzur, Rameshwar Sharma.

On Wednesday, the Congress stalwart had called RSS a “fascist organization imbibed in the ideologies of Hitler and Mussolini”, and said it “cannot be accepted as an organisation of Hindus”. “Saraswati Shishu Mandirs are schools where hatred is taught, which gives birth to violence. And violence gives birth to terrorism,” he had said.

Outraged, Sharma said: “In Saraswati Shishu Mandirs, children are taught to respect the national song, Vande Mataram, and the Tricolour. Digvijaya has no problem with madrasas, where Vande Mataram is opposed. He is the person who had coined the term ‘bhagwa’ terrorism.”

305,['10/01/2020'],Chennai: Watch out for this death trap along busy Koyambedu road,"This story is from January 10, 2020

<p>Pedestrians are the worst hit due to the dug up road opposite Koyambedu bus terminus<br></p>

CHENNAI: If you plan to use the road opposite Koyambedu bus terminus , perhaps you should think twice. For, chances of an accidental fall into a trench dug by the electricity board along the choked road are rather high. A recent visit to the spot by TOI revealed that pedestrians, in particular, are put to a lot of hardship on the dug-up stretch.

S Sundaresan, a resident of Arihant Towers, said the trench was dug by the electricity board about 10 days ago. The excavated soil was dumped along the pavement and was made to resemble an embankment perhaps to prevent accidental falls into the pit. Senior citizens, women and children among others find it extremely difficult to walk on the road as the trench has been dug for more than half a kilometre, he said.

Adding to the trouble, protruding iron rods from a flyover that is coming up on the stretch pose another threat to pedestrians. This makes almost the entire stretch unsafe for pedestrians and motorists. Vehicles from Tirumangalam heading towards Vadapalani zip along the road, exposing pedestrians to accidents as well.

A senior traffic police officer said the electricity board claimed the trench will be covered and the road laid properly by Monday. However, it has been stuck due to a delay in the arrival of cables that need to be laid on the stretch.

Due to the trench, traffic from Tirumangalam moves at a snail’s pace. The road from near Koyambedu-CMBT signal up to Jayapushpam hotel has become narrow due to this. “We have been urging the electricity board officials to cover the trench at the earliest,” the officer said. When contacted, TamilNadu Transmission Corporation Limited (Tantransco) officials said the work is part of a 110-KV transmission line being laid between Koyambedu and Kodambakkam. “The work will be completed mostly before Pongal or a week after that. The line will carry high tension power to Kodambakkam sub-station in order to provide quality power to the residents,” an official said.

Met says that cold spell may set in again following the light rain on Thursday.

KOLKATA: The rain on Thursday will bring back the winter chill once again, said the Met officials. Though the city received light spells of rain , it will make the city colder from the weekend.

“This winter we have had rain in December, apart from the one on Thursday. Such rain indicates that winter is still active and the cold spell will set rolling again. The mercury is set to dip again from Saturday,” said GK Das, director (weather) at the Regional Meteorological Centre Kolkata. On Thursday, Alipore recorded only 0.3mm rain while other parts of the city like New Market, Mominpore and Ultadanga received more than 1mm rain till late evening. Some adjoining areas of the city, including Diamond Harbour, received around 9mm rain during the same period. However, the Met officials ruled out the possibility of further rain now.

The minimum temperature on Thursday was 15.5°C — one notch higher than the normal. With a clear sky and the Northwesterly wind blowing without any hindrance, the mercury is expected to dip to 12°C from Saturday. “On January 2, the rainfall in the city was 30mm. But this time the cyclonic circulation was not strong enough for moisture incursion. That is why, the intensity of the rain was less. We don’t expect any further spell of rain now,” said Das.

Even if it does not rain on Friday, the sky will remain overcast in the first half of the day. The cloud cover along with the residual moisture is likely to trigger dense fog in early morning on Friday and Saturday, reducing the visibility to around 200 metres.

NAINITAL: Uttarakhand high court (HC) came down heavily on the Uttarakhand Power Corporation Limited (UPCL) managing director (MD) saying that he should either comply with the court’s order or be personally present in court to explain why its orders have not been followed.

The warning was issued by the single judge bench of Justice Manoj Kumar Tiwari while hearing a contempt petition filed by Udham Singh Nagar resident Avdhesh Kumar Sharma. Sharma who was a labour in UPCL said that he along with many others had filed the contempt plea. “We had approached the labour court which passed an order in 1992 that we should be made permanent and given several other benefits. UPCL then approached the HC which upheld the labour court’s order. However, our services were regularised only by 2009. We approached HC again which in 2014 said that all the benefits should be given from 1992. Yet the corporation is not complying with the orders,” Sharma said.

HARIDWAR: A 25-year-old woman has been arrested by Haridwar police for allegedly conning a man by marrying him. Police have also arrested her legitimate husband who posed himself as her brother at the time of the marriage. According to police, after coming to Haridwar with the victim on their honeymoon, the woman fled from the hotel room with cash and gold jewellery.

A case has been registered against the woman Anjali and her husband Mahaveer by the victim’s sister Sonia, resident of Kalka, Panchkula under section 420 (cheating) of Indian penal code in the city police station.

According to police, Sonia was looking for a bride for her 35-year-old brother Deepak Kumar. She contacted a mediator Sonu, resident of Roorkee, Haridwar, who introduced Anjali and his alleged brother Mahaveer, resident of Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh.

Anjali and Deepak married on December 18 and they eventually reached Haridwar for their honeymoon. They had booked a room in a hotel, from which Anjali ran away at midnight with Rs 50,000 in cash and gold jewellery, while Deepak was asleep.

Senior sub-inspector of city police station, Jagmohan Ramola, told TOI, “During investigation we found that Anjali’s real name is Pooja and Mahaveer is not her brother but her legitimate husband. The duo were facing financial problem and came up with the plan to dupe men.”

KOLKATA: With rising number of allegations against cabbies for misbehaviour, sexual harassment and assault on women, a leading online cab aggregator has come up with more features for the safety of passengers.

RideCheck is one of such features added by Uber to flag certain trip irregularities. If an anomaly is detected, the aggregator will reach out to both the passenger and driver with the help of the feature.

The aggregator is piloting audio recording as a pioneering safety feature in the Indian market. A rider or driver partner will have an option to record audio through their phone during a trip. When the trip ends, the user can report any untoward incident by submitting the audio recording.

With the audio file being encrypted, the user cannot listen to the stored recording on their device, but the person will be able to send it to the aggregator’s customer support agents who will use the audio to know about an incident and take appropriate actions.

The aggregator has also added safety PIN , a trip verification feature to ensure that riders get into their booked cabs.

Illustration used for representational purpose

HYDEARABAD: The Telangana high court on Wednesday refused to take up an appeal filed by the state government seeking permission to go ahead with the election to Karimnagar Municipal Corporation (KMC) along with other municipal bodies.

The government was aggrieved with the restraint order passed by a single judge who, on Tuesday, directed the officials to rectify anomalies in the population figures of SCs and STs before going ahead with the polls in Karimnagar. It urged the high court bench to set aside the single judge order as it wants to conduct polls in KMC also.

Though the government filed an appeal against the order of the single judge and urged the bench headed by Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan to suspend that order, it could not secure a copy of the order of the single judge.

Additional advocate general J Ramachandra Rao requested the bench to hear the matter without the copy of the order. The CJ, however, refused to oblige because he was not aware of the contents of the order. Stopping the state counsel from making repeated appeals, the CJ asked: “Where is the order of the single judge? How do I know what was there in the single judge order. What is the logic behind asking me to hear a challenge to an order without placing the order in question before us?”

The state counsel urged the bench to trust his word and the state’s affidavit and hear the matter based on them. The CJ then said, “A lawyer is never to be believed until and unless a documentary proof of what he is saying is furnished. I am sorry. We will take it up on Friday.”

The state counsel said the single judge had passed order, which was in contravention to the order passed by this bench. “The single judge also did not take into account the evidence we placed before him. Now, we are unable to hold elections because of that restraint order. The government wants to hold elections there,” the state counsel said.

Counsel Mayur Reddy, who brought out the irregularities in Karimnagar, however, told the bench that the order of the single judge was reasonable and was passed after hearing the contentions in an elaborate manner. The state counsel requested the court to take up the case on Thursday if they could secure a copy of the single judge order. The bench told him to first get the order copy.

Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy launched ‘ Amma Vodi ’ scheme in Chittoor district on Thursday to fulfil one of his key pre-poll promises made to the people.

Under the flagship programme, the government will extend an annual financial grant of Rs 15,000 to all mothers/guardians who send their children/wards to state-run schools. The scheme will benefit nearly 43 lakh mothers/guardians and the state would be disbursing Rs 6,456 crore towards the scheme this year.

“Education is the biggest asset parents can give to their children, which is why article 21A was inserted in the Constitution to provide free and compulsory education to all children in the age group of 6 to 14 years. But education still remains a distant reach for many due to various reasons. This scheme is for them,” the CM told people at the PVKS degree college ground in Chittoor from where the scheme was launched.

Jagan recalled his interactions with people during his Praja Sankalpa Yatra. “I found there are many mothers who couldn’t afford to send their children to even state-run schools because of acute poverty. This programme will ease the concerns of every single mother in the state who desires to equip her child with the asset of education but can’t afford to do so,” he added.

On the compulsory 75% attendance required to claim the financial assistance under Amma Vodi, he said the compulsory norm has been relaxed for this year but will be made mandatory next year onwards.

Explaining the reason behind introducing English as medium of education in state-run schools, Jagan said he wants students passing out of government schools in 10 years from now to be better equipped to face the competitive world. “We will first introduce English medium in state-run schools for classes 1 to 6. It will be extended to class 10 in a phased manner. In four years from now, all our children will appear for their 10th class board exams in English medium,” he said. He further stated that the government will soon improve the syllabus in state-run schools and change the menu of mid-day meal scheme, so that government schools in the state are transformed into centres of excellence. “I am perhaps the only CM in the country who has sat down to revamp the mid-day meal menu. Though it will put additional burden on the state exchequer, we are ready to shoulder the burden to bring smiles,” he asserted.

318,['10/01/2020'],NCRB report continues to show downward trend of crime in city,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Pune: The National Crime Record Bureau’s latest report for 2018 has revealed a continuing downward trend in the rate of cognisable crimes in the city.

Among the 19 metropolitan cities with a population of more than 20 lakh, calculated using Actual Population Census 2011, Pune has been ranked 17 in terms of crime rate. Kochi topped the chart.

The latest report comes barely two months after the NCRB released its report for 2017 in October last year. Pune was ranked 16th among the 19 metropolitan cities then.

The 2018 report has shown Pune’s crime rate at 277.9 incidences per one lakh population as against 379.6 incidences in 2017. A total of 14,034 crimes were registered in 2018 as against 19,172 in 2017. For the preceding year of 2016, the crimes were 19,554. These crimes include offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) as well as the special legislative laws (SLLs), such as Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, IT Act and Juvenile Justice Act, among others.

Pune’s crime rate at 277.9 is also far less than Mumbai’s 309.9 per one lakh population. Police officers pointed out that Mumbai had a much bigger jurisdiction and population compared to Pune.

According to the report, the IPC crimes have gone down from 15,144 in 2017 to 11,551 in 2018, further fortifying the downward trend considering that the same in 2016 were recorded at 16,296.

Similarly, the SLL crimes declined by almost half from 4,028 incidences in 2017 to 2,483 in 2018. In 2016, there were 3,258 incidences of SLL crimes.

The NCRB’s annual reports are published on the basis of information provided by the state police units and the central law enforcing agencies. The bureau has considered Pune’s population at 50.5 lakh for calculating the crime rate, which is crimes per one lakh population.

Usually, the NCRB takes more time in releasing annual reports after collecting data on a pan-India basis, compared to annual figures released at the police commissionerate levels.

For instance, Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham on Tuesday had released the city’s annual crime statistics for 2019. It showed a 9% drop in serious crimes from 9,552 in 2018 to 8,677 in the last year.

The NCRB report shows that the number of murder cases in Pune declined to 73 cases in 2018 from 110 cases in 2017. When it comes to the cases of kidnapping and abduction, they went down to 636 in 2018 from a total of 964 cases in 2017. This is an improvement considering that in 2016, the city had recorded 851 kidnappings and abductions and the same had gone up in 2017.

Crime against women reduced to 1,481 cases in 2018 from 2,032 in 2017, while crime against children reduced to 877 cases from 1,335 in 2017.

NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) came down heavily on the Uttarakhand Power Corporation Limited (UPCL) managing director (MD) saying that he should either comply with the court’s order or be personally present in court to explain why its orders have not been followed.

The warning was issued by the single judge bench of Justice Manoj Kumar Tiwari while hearing a contempt petition filed by Udham Singh Nagar resident Avdhesh Kumar Sharma. Speaking to TOI, Sharma who was a labour in the UPCL said that he along with many others had filed the contempt petition after the corporation did not follow the court’s orders. “We had approached the labour court which passed an order in 1992 that we should be made permanent and given several other benefits. The UPCL then approached the high court which upheld the labour court’s order. However, our services were regularised only by 2009 when the labour court order had come in 1992. We approached the high court again which in 2014 said that all the benefits should be given from 1992. Yet the corporation is not complying with the orders,” Sharma said.

The court has now listed the case for February 18.

CUTTACK: The state vigilance on Thursday arrested five working and retired engineers of the Roads & Buildings (R&B) Division-II, Cuttack , as well as a contractor on charges of misappropriating government money to the tune of Rs 43 lakh during the construction of a bridge over Taladanda Canal near Nayabazar , here, between 2014 and 2019.

All six along with a retired divisional accounts officer of R&B were forwarded to the court of special judge vigilance, Cuttack, and were remanded to judicial custody till January 22.

Among those arrested on the basis of prima facie evidence included assistant executive engineer Rajanikanta Dalabehera, assistant engineer Rabinarayan Sahu, divisional accounts officer (retired) Abanikanta Rout, assistant engineer Ranjan Kumar Debata, executive engineer (retd) Sudhir Kumar Panda, superintending engineer (retd) Bimal Chandra Dash and contractor Trupti Ranjan Debata.

The state vigilance had registered a case on December 10 at the Vigilance police station in Cuttack under the Prevention of Corruption Act and Section 420 of the IPC.

An official release stated that investigations revealed that the construction work was executed under R&B Division-II, Cuttack. During the tendering process, Trupti, the lone bidder, submitted his bid papers by hiding the fact that his elder brother Ranjan was an assistant engineer at the R&B Division, Cuttack. Trupti furnished a false “no relation certificate” in violation of the terms and conditions of the tender.

The tender was accepted by Bimal, the then superintending engineer, R&B Circle, Cuttack, for Rs 2,12,53,801. Accordingly, an agreement was executed on January 5, 2015 with Trupti. Since he had no such work experience, Trupti executed a power of attorney and authorised Manas Ranjan Ojha to execute the work. But in reality it was his brother Ranjan who was executing the work.

After completion of the work, Trupti was paid a sum of Rs 2,02,25,148 by the executive engineer based on the measurements undertaken by the assistant engineers and assistant executive engineers without any bills and invoices from authorised/designated dealers, the official release stated.

Further investigation revealed that during execution of the work, an amount of Rs 43,16,044 was misappropriated by the government officials in connivance with the contractor by falsely showing excess utilisation of iron rods and cement and allowing payment in excess of the estimated cost.

Delhi high court (PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Friday refused to entertain a plea urging it to intervene to remove protesters at Shaheen Bagh so that smooth traffic movement can renew on the DND Flyway and other areas. The plea complained of inaction on part of Delhi Police in clearing the demonstrators blocking roads that are causing traffic congestions.

The application, in the form of a handwritten letter, was mentioned before a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar, which, however, declined to give any relief or issue any order.

The letter by two residents said the route from Delhi to UP, Delhi to Uttarakhand, Delhi to Noida hospitals, Ashram and Badarpur is unavailable due to the protest as the roads around Shaheen Bagh are blocked and vehicles are being diverted to the DND Flyway.

“Lakhs of people are suffering and it is also an issue for people in emergency. The protesters have put barricades and heavy stones on the side of the roads and are not even allowing pedestrians to pass. They have also damaged the dividers and other public properties, causing loss to the government exchequer,” the letter said, pleading HC to step in and give orders.

322,['10/01/2020'],N Chandrababu Naidu dares YS Jaganmohan Reddy to seek fresh mandate before shifting capital from Amaravati,"This story is from January 10, 2020

N Chandrababu Naidu

AMARAVATI: TDP supremo N Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday dared chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy to seek mandate from the people afresh before shifting the capital city from Amaravati .

He said that he would accept Jagan’s decision if he gets re-elected. “You can’t move the capital city from Amaravati even by an inch,” Naidu thundered.

In a token gesture, he collected donations to run the movement for capital city in Vijayawada before reaching Machilipatnam to attend a public meeting organised by Amaravati JAC.

Addressing the meeting, Naidu said Amaravati is equipped to facilitate administrators and there was no reason to shift the capital city. “Amaravati is the future of the state. It is the future of the next generations. I appeal to people to send at least one from each family to the movement to protect the capital city,” said Naidu. He lashed out at the state government for not visiting the families of the farmers who died of heart-attack following the government’s plans to shift the capital city. Naidu fumed at the government when there was a power outage during the public meeting and alleged that they have deliberately disrupted power supply. He, however, said that they are not cowards and warned of serious consequences if the government did not relent.

Naidu said farmers have sacrificed nearly 33,000 acres of land for the construction of the capital city and it was a rare instance in history and criticised the ministers for making derogatory comments on the farmers movement. He said the agitation for Amaravati has turned into a peoples’ movement and the Jaganmohan Reddy government would surely get washed away in the anger of people.

“I may have been defeated. But, I am not completely out. I will continue to fight for the people as long as I have the blessings of the people,” said Naidu. He said that women who never stepped out of their houses have also joined the movement. He faulted the police for toeing to the line of YSRC leaders and preventing the bus yatra on Wednesday. He showered praises on Jana Sena leader Pawan Kalyan and called him a fighter.

324,['10/01/2020'],Jaganmohan Reddy to appear before CBI court today,"This story is from January 10, 2020

HYDERABAD: Heavy security was in place at the CBI court in Gagan Vihar where Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy will appear before the judge on Friday in connection with the quid pro quo case filed by CBI against him.

There were speculations that he may challenge the order of the CBI court before the high court. “However, he has decided to appear before the CBI court on Friday,” said sources, who cited heavy security arrangements being made at the CBI court premises as proof for their claims.

The frayed tempers on account of protests over capital being shifted out of Amaravati are also cited as one of the reasons for heightened security for Jagan , sources added.

Jagan did not appear before the trial court ever since he became chief minister after his YSRCP came to power in the neighbouring state.

His counsel has been filing exemption pleas every week and the court has been allowing them with the former citing Jagan’s busy schedule as chief minister. However, last week, principal special judge BV Madhusudan Rao ordered Jagan and his associate and Rajya Sabha MP Vijayasai Reddy to appear before the court on January 10.

CBI had filed 11 chargesheets against Jagan in the case charging him with influencing his father YS Rajasekhara Reddy when he was chief minister of undivided AP to dole out public assets to certain businessmen and industrialists between 2004 and 2009 in lieu of the investments they made in his firms.

YSRCP alleges that a politically motivated case was foisted against Jagan after the death of YSR and soon after he quit Congress.

Participants raise slogans during Wednesday’s protest in Mysuru.

MYSURU: In a big boost to the student community, the University of Mysore stood behind its students and pointed an accusing finger at mischief-mongers. While it has initiated legal action issuing showcause notices to the organisers of the demonstration on Wednesday, it was quick to defend its students.

Varsity vice-chancellor G Hemantha Kumar said the university has lodged a police complaint about the incident. “We are extending all support to the investigation,"" he said.

According to registrar R Shivappa, the students who had organised the protest were social activists ""They were exercising their democratic rights, but a woman misused the situation. We know all these students well. They are not anti-national elements. They are known for seeking social justice. We’re helping police in their investigation to identify the culprit,"" he said.

He also said the university administration will not allow any student to indulge in anti-national activities. ""We won’t allow anyone to use our campuses for anti-national activities,"" he said.

In its report submitted to the governor's office, the varsity said: ""We have issued show cause notice to the Research Scholars Association and Dalita Vidyarthi Okkuta.”

The police launched the investigation in the morning after the video of the girl holding a ‘Free Kashmir’ placard went viral. A team of officials visited the PG campus and quizzed students about the incident. Police also collected CCTV footage for further investigation and confirmed a probe in under way.

According to the complaint, police or varsity authorities were not aware of the rally being held on Wednesday. On learning about the flash protest where slogans were raised, a police team reached the spot and left the spot. It was found that one of the protestors was holding a placard that encouraged protesters to oppose the government in connection with the Kashmir issue.

The protest was held without permission of the University of Mysore or police. Students took out a torchlight march from the clock tower inside the campus and reached the entrance where they sat on a dharna. Sources said only one protester had held the controversial placard.

TIRUPATI: After its position went down by two ranks last year, the Tirupati municipal corporation this year has pulled out all the stops to improve its position in Swachh Survekshan 2020.

After securing the sixth spot in Swachh Survekshan 2018, TMC slipped to the eighth position in the 2019 survey. So this year, it has unveiled an aggressive information, education and communication (IEC) strategy and has been organising back to back novel activities to garner people’s support.

Some of the activities organised by TMC include, the twin bin concept, the 5k run, a human chain involving over 10,000 students, a quiz and painting competition organised at Sri Venkateswara university and distribution of over 10,000 plus Swachh Survekshan 2020 badges to hoteliers and students. TMC is also promoting its ‘‘Swachh Tirupati” campaign on its Facebook page.

The civic body is now set to organise a Swachh short film and singing contests on the theme ‘‘Clean Tirupati - Green Tirupati” at the amphitheatre at Prakasam Park on January 11. It has already received 70 entries for the short film contest and 25 entries for the singing contest. TMC would give away cash prizes to the top three winners in both the contests.

Speaking to TOI, TMC commissioner PS Girisha, said Tirupati, which is home to a population of 2.88 lakh as per the 2011 census, also attracts a mobile population of nearly 80,000-1 lakh devotees every day.

“Keeping a city clean that is home to nearly 3 lakh people, besides attracting millions of devotees from across the globe annually, is always a challenge. Despite the challenges, TMC broke into the top 10 cleanest cities in the country as per Swachh Survekshan 2018 and 2019”, said PS Girisha.

“Although we slipped by two ranks last year, we are sure every citizen of the temple city will strengthen our efforts to improve our position this year”, asserted the TMC commissioner.

Kolkata: The argumentative Kolkatan will have a new reason to debate.

Registrations are open to the college students for the first season of the West Bengal edition of “Speak for India”. This widely popular inter-collegiate debate competition has been garnering good response from the student community across the nation. An initiative by Federal Bank in association with The Times of India and Ei Samay provides a platform for college students across West Bengal where they will voice their views and opinions on contemporary issues for changing the society.

The aim of the forum is to discover the top inter-collegiate debaters in the state through multiple levels of competitions. It gives college students the opportunity to explore their awareness, insights and perspective on contemporary topics. All college students from the state can participate in the competition. All the participants at each level would get participation certificates and they can choose their preferred language from Bengali, English or Hindi. The winner gets a cash prize of Rs 1.5 lakh and the runner-up gets Rs 1 lakh cash prize. Each of the finalists also stands to win Rs 25,000 each. College students can participate by registering online at www.speakforindia.in.

In Tamil Nadu, the second edition of the popular intercollegiate debate competition, Speak for India , was held in September last year. An initiative by Federal Bank in association with The Times of India, the competition had emerged as a vibrant, competitive platform for college students across Tamil Nadu to voice their views and opinions on contemporary issues and become change-makers of society.

“Speak for India is a huge platform. Since I won the competition, I have been getting a lot of opportunities. I have been invited as a guest speaker at 11 different institutions. I have also learnt a lot from the method adopted by ‘Speak for India’. In their very first round, they gave us just one minute to summarise what we had to say. This taught me time management and confidence. Participating in a competition of this scale has also trained me to think out-of-the-box,” said V Veera Balaji, a final-year MA (commerce) student and last year’s title winner in Tamil Nadu.

Phases of evaluation would include district, zonal, semi-final and the final rounds. The contest will be conducted at common venues. At the initial level, participants will speak at their respective district centre or at the designated centres.

Puducherry: The tussle between lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi and Congress government over the mode of appointment of state election commissioner (SEC) intensified on Thursday with Congress MLA T Djeamourthy raising a breach of privilege issue against the chief secretary and three other officials for disobeying a unanimous resolution passed by the legislative assembly appointing retired IAS official T M Balakrishnan as SEC in July last year.

Djeamourthy in a memorandum submitted to V Sivakozhunthu, speaker of the legislative assembly, accused the chief secretary (Ashwani Kumar), local administration secretary (Ashok Kumar), local administration director (G Malarkannan) and local administration under-secretary (Giddi Balaram) of releasing an advertisement to select the SEC, bypassing the government’s appointment of Balakrishnan as the SEC. The Congress MLA charged that the officials insulted the assembly, the speaker, the cabinet and the minister concerned and the elected members by disobeying the assembly's resolution and raised a privilege issue seeking the speaker to initiate appropriate action against the officials to restore the dignity and decorum of the House.

He pointed out that chief minister V Narayanasamy issued an order on January 3 directing the chief secretary not to obey Bedi’s order and initiate efforts to select an SEC. He said Narayanasamy in the order cited relevant Articles of the Constitution of India and Sections of Puducherry Village and Commune Panchayat Act and Puducherry Municipalities Act to prove the legality of the appointment of SEC.

“But the officials have violated the government orders by releasing an advertisement on January 7 to select SEC unilaterally without the knowledge and approval of the speaker, cabinet, chief minister, minister concerned and the government. The act is a breach of privilege of the elected members and an insult to the House,” he said.

Djeamourthy also regretted out that the chief secretary failed to honour the Union home ministry’s direction in September 2018 to consider re-delegation of financial powers conferred on the lieutenant governor to the secretaries, heads of the departments and offices and council of ministers proportionately.

In the last three years, MLAs cutting across party lines had raised ‘breach of privilege’ issues against Bedi, BJP Puducherry president V Saminathan, who is one of the three members nominated to the legislative assembly by the Centre, under-secretary (confidential and cabinet) M Kannan, Bedi’s secretary G Theva Neethi Dhas and former Puducherry municipality commissioner R Chandrasekaran accusing them of lowering the dignity and decorum of the House.

Broken roads and open roads are in this municipality which constitutes three gram panchayats — Manikonda, Alkapur and Neknampur. Areas under the municipality house a sizeable population of techies.For many, a major issue has been a lack of connectivity to Outer Ring Road (ORR). “Many bought houses here because of its proximity to the IT belt through ORR. Only later did they realise that most link roads to ORR have either been encroached upon or are still undeveloped,” said Manoj Kumar, an IT employee who resides in the area.Apart from lack of connectivity, maintenance of roads has also been an issue. “Several roads are riddled with potholes. Driving on these roads have resulted in severe back problems for many,” said Ram Shankar, a local. For example, Road No 1 in Alkapur, which connects to a school and is used by children daily, remains in a poor state.

The two cops initially agreed for bribe of 80,000 but settled for 50,000 & two bottles of whiskey

HYDERABAD: A sub-inspector ( SI ) of Jubilee Hills police station was caught red-handed while accepting Rs 50,000 cash and two whiskey bottles as alleged bribe from a businessman at Jubilee Hills on Thursday. As Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) sleuths were en route to arrest Jubilee Hills inspector Balvantaiah, a co-accused in the case, he abandoned his bandobust duty point near Krishan Kant Park and fled in an auto-rickshaw. ACB sleuths launched a manhunt to nab him.

On January 7, ACB sleuths had received a complaint from one M Vamsi Krishna Chowdary, a businessman from Jubilee Hills, alleging that SI P Sudheer Reddy and inspector Balvantaiah demanded Rs 1 lakh bribe to grant station bail to him in a cheating case and help him in settling the case in the Lok Adalat.

On December 29, Akshaya, who runs Page 3 Luxury Saloon, lodged a complaint against Chowdary alleging that he availed hair, face and neck treatment for his wife and also purchased some products, worth Rs 34,130 and failed to pay up. Based on the complaint, police had registered a case under Sections 420 (Cheating) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the IPC against Chowdary.

“After registering the case, the SI and the inspector demanded Rs 1 lakh bribe to grant station bail to the accused, drop Section 406 of the IPC and help him by recommending to the complainant to settle the case in the Lok Adalat. The two accused have also made the complainant pay Rs 25,000 to the spa owner on December 31 with an agreement that the balance amount would be paid after settling the case at Lok Adalat,” an ACB official said.

Chowdary then requested the two cops to reduce the bribe amount and they initially agreed for Rs 80,000 and later settled for Rs 50,000 and two bottles of whiskey. At 2.15 pm, an ACB team trapped SI Sudheer Reddy when he got into the businessman’s Innova car on Road Number 10 of Jubilee Hills and accepted Rs 50,000 cash and two liquor bottles. “The SI spoke to the inspector over the phone before collecting the bribe,” an ACB official said.

After arresting the SI, the ACB team shifted him to the Jubilee Hills police station, while another team rushed towards Krishan Kant Park where inspector Balvantaiah was on bandobust duty. “Balvantaiah got wind of the trap. He stopped an auto and fled from the spot at Krishan Kant Park. He switched off his mobile phones. We have launched a manhunt to nab him,” an ACB official said.

BENGALURU: Shalini Balakrishna, 29, from Old Bagaluru Layout, east Bengaluru, is due for delivery by the third week of January. In her third trimester, she wanted to confirm the air she breathes does not impact her baby’s health. Volunteering to be part of a study , she wore a device that tracked the quality of the air she inhaled for 24 hours.

Track the pollution level in your city

She is among 505 pregnant women voluntarily wearing air pollution trackers during their pregnancies and turning up for check-ups at Bagaluru and Sriramapura public health centres. The women must wear this device for 24 hours once each in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy to record their exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution.

The ongoing study by Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) is assessing the relation between air pollution and the risk of low birth weight . After a pilot in 2017, the team started the actual study in February 2018. The areas chosen, Old Bagaluru Layout and a slum in Sriramapura, are located closer to commercial areas and main roads.

The pregnant women have to wear the personal air quality monitoring device with a power bank kept in a ventilated sling bag, which together weigh less than 300 grams.

Shalini told TOI she was curious to know the study outcome. “The air I breathe should be the best for my child’s health,” she said.

“Most of the participants are homemakers. While resting, they can keep the device closer to them,” said Prafulla Shriyan, research associate with PHFI who is working on the study.

Through the device, the study estimates the level of exposure to air pollutants including coarse particulate matter (PM10), fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) and carbon monoxide levels in both indoor and ambient environments.

During the study, the socio-economic and demographic variables, current and previous obstetric history, fuel used for cooking, heating, location of the kitchen are also considered. Field workers seek information on other sources of indoor pollution such as burning of incense sticks, mosquito repellents and candles.

Of the 505 women taking part in the study, 213 have delivered so far. “We observed higher exposure to indoor pollution among women living in small houses without exhaust/ chimney/ ventilation in kitchen, who used kerosene and solid biomass fuel and whose spouses smoked at home,” Prafulla said.

“The study will also follow up on the delivered children until they turn two. The objective is to estimate if the absolute risk of having low birth weight is caused by air pollution and other variables, which has been established in global studies. Our focus is on understanding nuances of this issue in the Bengaluru scenario,” said Dr Giridhar Babu, professor and head of Lifecourse Epidemiology, PHFI, Bengaluru.

Hyderabad: In techies’ residential hub of Alkapur , bijlli and paani remain the key poll issues. In the past year, residents have come onto the streets by the thousands to protest the shortage of safe drinking water in the area. “We need 200 tankers per day to meet our water needs but at present we are only getting 15 tankers,” said Rajasekhar, a resident. He said prices for tankers peak during summers going as high as Rs 2,000 per tanker.

The current situation has made locals heavily dependent on private players. They claim that the ‘tanker mafia’ has threatened them that they will not supply water to them if they approach the water board while the latter cannot meet the demand.

“We have been left in the lurch. If we pursue the matter with officials and they are not able to deliver, we will have no one to go to,” said one resident on the condition of anonymity.

“We have already presented a proposal wherein the township takes up 50% of the cost for laying pipelines and the other half is taken up by the government. Residents have been asked to consider this plan,” said HMWS&SB general manager, division 18, Ravinder Reddy.

When asked, the Alkapur Resident Welfare Association (RWA) said that this was not a feasible option.

Within three months, the municipality was made a municipal corporation. Six months down the line, nothing much has changed as Jawaharnagar still has no proper roads, underground drainage, parks, graveyards and streetlights.The official estimation is that the corporation requires at least Rs 500 crore to have basic facilties in place. Worse still, the corporation continues to function from a small panchayat building without a town planning officer, an engineer and accounts officer.The predicament of Pocharam, an emerging IT hub in the eastern part of the city, is no different. It has about 50,000 population and was made a municipality in August 2018. Except the IT corridor, the municipality lacks civic infrastructure . Villages like Narapally, Ismailikhan, Yanampet and Annojiguda are in a bad shape. Ironically, Pocharam municipality in the IT hub does not have a facility to enable people pay their property tax online.The TRS government had hurriedly created as many as 60 new urban local bodies without providing or improving infrastructure and basic facilities.

Pune airport

PUNE: Come April, e-gates and body scanners will be a permanent fixture at the city airport.

“Both the projects are high-priority. The trial run of the body scanner is going on. Before making it a permanent facility, we want to ensure that there are no glitches in the services offered. The decision for both the projects would take a concrete shape soon,” Pune airport director Ajay Kumar told TOI.

At present, Lohegaon airport has a body scanner machine installed. The facility was set up by a Germany-based company, having a base in Delhi.

Tokyo-based NEC Technologies will set up three e-gates to make the entry into the airport easy and seamless. “E-gates equipped with facial recognition technology will be installed at three points — the entrance of the airport, security holding area and the boarding gate area,” a spokesperson of the Tokyo-based company had said earlier.

“The company chosen to install the facial recognition gates (e-gates) has conducted a survey of the airport and the work on its installation would start soon,” another official said.

The e-gates function on facial recognition technology. Before entering the airport, passengers will have to activate their DigiYatra identity and capture facial image at self-service kiosks. Then, passengers will proceed to the e-gates at the entrance of the airport for verifying boarding pass and facial recognition. Once they are in the airport, passengers can complete check-in, security checks and boarding processes seamlessly through facial recognition.

A source said the number of body scanners would increase once the trial run was successfully completed of the one already installed at the city airport. “The trial run of the scanner would go on for a couple of months before being commissioned,” the source said.

Last year, the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security had issued a circular, making it mandatory for 84 airports in the country to install full-body scanners by March 2020 to screen air travellers.

341,['10/01/2020'],"Key posts continue to stay vacant, health department looks for boost","This story is from January 10, 2020

PUNE: A senior health official posted in Akola district has an additional task in hand nearly 480km away. The administration has told him to double up as the joint director of the state health department in Pune.

The Akola-based official has been told to take up the additional charge of the joint director of health services following the retirement of his predecessor on January 1. Senior health officials said the order has once again brought into focus the issue of long-pending vacancies in the department.

“This is the state of affairs in the health department because nearly 63% of key posts of Class I officers, including directors, additional directors, joint directors and deputy directors, are lying vacant for many years. The charge of these keys posts is given as an additional charge to someone already overburdened,” a senior health official said requesting anonymity.

Public health expert Prakash Bhoi, who was the joint director and responsible for controlling vector-borne diseases in the state, retired from his service on December 31.

“Such a key post cannot be left vacant. Hence, an additional charge has been given to a senior health official working in Akola district. Now, how can he be present to oversee work of the joint director’s office in Pune while dispensing an equally important duty in Akola?,” the official said.

When contacted, Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary in the department of health and family welfare, told TOI, “The civil surgeon in Akola was high up on the seniority list for promotion and continuously making representation for the same. Regular posting orders are issued at this level with concurrence of the health minister and chief minister. But this takes time. As a result, the additional charge was proposed as a temporary measure since the incumbent officer was superannuating. We will ensure effective changes soon.”

The instance of the Akola health official getting an additional charge is, however, not the lone case. The issue of long pending vacancies has become a serious concern.

“In the absence of supervision from top officials, there is no one to fix accountability of staffers working at the region- and district-level. There is no vision to take the department a notch higher, bring in some positive changes, make newer experiments and try out-of-the-box ideas. There is no motivation left,” another state health official said.

Another senior officer said, “The entire administrative procedures are in a mess in health department. There is no seniority list and there have been no promotions for years. In the revenue department, a clerk can go up the ladder and even become the tehsildar. But in our department, there are scores of examples where people working for more than 25 years in same post.”

The state government has created two posts of directors in health department. Of them, the director’s post in Pune is being handled as an additional charge by senior public health expert Archana Patil (who is an additional director). This means one of the two posts of director is vacant.

The roll-out of FASTag — a way to electronically pay toll — has been anything but smooth in the state

PUNE: Glitches and stutters have marred the roll-out of FASTag , which will become mandatory from January 15, albeit only on national highways.Some people have been charged incorrect amounts, while others had to pay twice — via FASTag and by cash.FASTag will be compulsory only at the 500-plus toll plazas on national highways controlled by National Highways Authority of India and not state highways, which come under Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC). “Maharashtra is the first state in the country to roll out FASTag across all state highways, but it remains optional,” MSRDC general manager (toll collection) Bharat Bastewad said.The roll-out of FASTag — a way to electronically pay toll — has been anything but smooth in the state. Many people said the authorities should have thoroughly tested the system before rolling it out.Mumbai resident Vrinda Walavalkar said on a recent trip, their vehicle’s FASTag was scanned twice by an operator on the ‘ETC+Cash’ lane at the Khalapur toll plaza and both times, the balance was erroneously shown as 0. “We paid cash and proceeded, only for my friend to get a FASTag charge notification a while later,” Walavalkar said.At the next plaza, they took this up with the operator, who told them to call a phone number mentioned on the tag. On their return trip, just before Urse toll plaza, Walvalkar said they received a message that the same amount was debited again. ""We had not even passed the toll plaza then. We managed to get free passage at the time. We have been trying to reach the number mentioned on the tag since then, but got no response,” she saidAnother Mumbai resident, Ameya Hardas, ended up paying toll for a different class of vehicle on a recent trip from Pune. “While coming to Pune on January 5, the correct amount (Rs230) was debited from my tag. On my return trip, Rs1,166 was debited — I noticed that I was charged the fee levied on multi-axle vehicles,” he claimed. Hardas’ tag was issued by a private bank.Bastewad said different tags were issued for different classes of vehicles and that it was unlikely that a single tag could be charged different amount within a few hours. “This could be taken up with the tag-issuing bank,” he said.“It is advisable to physically obtain the tags rather than online. Those who got the wrong tags must immediately have them replaced,” Pravin Bhalesain, founder-CEO of ZatpatPay, a company working on FASTag implementation and providing FASTag solution to banks, said.He said the ETC ( electronic toll collection ) lanes on the expressway are already equipped with FASTag readers. “Hand-held devices have been issued as backup,” he said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73181000,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-495411,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fastag-mandatory-only-on-national-highways-msrdc/articleshow/73179600.cms

NEW DELHI: Granting bail to 12 men arrested following the Seemapuri protests against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens , a city court on Friday directed Delhi Police to clear the “doubts” of these men about CAA.

The applicants will appear on January 19 between 2pm and 4pm at the Seemapuri police station, where the investigating officer/station house officer “shall make endeavour to remove the doubts of the applicants in respect of CAA”, additional sessions judge (ASJ) Sanjeev Kumar Malhotra said. Besides this condition, the accused were directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs 20,000 each with one surety for the bail.

The right to protest is a fundamental right in a democracy but this right of peaceful protest and open criticism of government policies does not extend to disturbing the public order, the court pointed out. On Thursday, another city court also made similar observations while granting bail to 15 men in relation to the Daryaganj violence.

Public peace, safety and tranquillity of a place cannot be jeopardised owing to protests, ASJ Malhotra said. “The Constitution of India also prohibits a person from making any statement that incites people to commit an offence,” he added.

The court also asked the investigating officer if any of the 12 men was seen in the CCTV footage collected by police or in the video on news channels or social media as pelting stones or causing damage to public property or injuring cops. The police submitted that none of them was involved in any such activity.

The lawyers of the accused argued a few of these men weren’t even present at the spot and the rest were protesting peacefully. The men have also been booked on the attempt-to-murder charge though the injuries suffered by seven cops were simple in nature, the lawyers said.

NEW DELHI: Assets worth over Rs 2,500 crore have been attached in connection with a money laundering and fraud case against Haryana-based SRS group , the Enforcement Directorate said on Thursday.

""Movable and immovable assets like land, real estate projects , commercial projects, residential houses, a school, cinema hall, balances in bank accounts and fixed deposits totalling to Rs 2,510.82 crore of the SRS Group, its promoters, their family members and associate companies have been attached,"" the agency said in a statement.

A provisional order for attachment of these properties has been issued under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act ( PMLA ).

The group and its promoters have been accused of allegedly making fraudulent promises of giving high returns to investors in the guise of investments in real estate units like shops, plots, flats and apartments among others.

The SRS Group, as per information provided on its official website, is a diversified business house with a ""strong presence"" across multiple sectors that include gold and jewellery, commodities, cinemas, retail, hospitality, financial services, real estate, education and health care.

The ED said its probe found that the promoter of the group, Anil Jindal, and founder directors Jitender Kumar Garg and Praveen Kumar Kapoor along with other accomplices ""hatched a criminal conspiracy"" and lured investments from several individual and institutions on fake promises of high returns in the guise of investments. Jindal was arrested by the Faridabad Police in 2018 as part of the probe.

""These investments were later siphoned off into group companies through various shell companies of the group having dummy directors, who were mainly SRS Group employees,"" the agency said.

""To sustain their illegal investment schemes, the accused further availed loans which were used for re-payments and to develop their other projects,"" the statement said. PTI

The associations claimed that the action was consequent to submission of a memorandum and meeting with Union state finance minister Anurag Thakur and other CGHS officials. They added: “While the total outstanding was close to Rs 1,000 crore, the approved outstanding from CGHS as on date was Rs 450 crore, which hospitals would get forthwith.”

IMA and AHPI would continue to insist that all outstanding amount was paid on urgent basis, as the hospitals — being pushed to the brink of unsustainability — would be constrained to suspend cashless services, officials said.

Last month, AHPI — that claims to represent some of the country’s top hospitals, including Max, Fortis, Medanta and BLK — had approached the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) demanding payment of dues with respect to treatment of CGHS and Ex-servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) beneficiaries. Dr Girdhar J Gyani, the director general of AHPI told TOI the government owes about Rs 245 crore (Rs 165 crore CGHS and Rs 80 crore ECHS) to the Max group of hospitals, Rs 225 crore (Rs 70 crore CGHS and Rs 155 crore ECHS) to the Fortis group and Rs 73 crore (Rs 42 crore CGHS and Rs 31 crore ECHS) to Medanta Medcity.

A police team led by senior inspector Shakar Avtade made the arrests and have recovered gold ornaments and cash, collectively valued at Rs3.38 lakh, from the trio.

“The trio — Sunil Sonawane (28), Soni Sakat (22) and Bhagyashri Kasbe (28) — are from Vishrantwadi. We have detected five cases against them — four registered with the Bhosari police and one with the Pimpri police.

349,['10/01/2020'],"7 years on, Calangute sewerage project yet to take off","This story is from January 10, 2020

The pumping station site at Gaura Vaddo had been barricaded by the contractor some months ago

CALANGUTE: Nearly seven years after work started on a sewerage pipeline network and a sewerage treatment plant (STP) for Calangute, the project is yet to see the light of day. It was to be completed within three years, in March 2016.

While most of the pipeline network is ready, work has been stalled for the last couple of years because of opposition to two pumping stations, though a solution is expected soon.

According to Calangute panchayat members, the two pumping stations in Calangute are needed to move the sewerage towards the STP, which is located at the northern end of Calangute at Baga. People have opposed the two pumping stations at Gaura Vaddo and Porba Vaddo as they are located close to residential areas and would cause air pollution.

“It is technically not possible to build them elsewhere, so the contractor is trying to find a solution which would address the fears of the locals,” a panchayat member said.

According to waste management minister and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo, the reason why the STP, which has been completed, is not being inaugurated, is because of a “reverse pipeline” which needs to be laid from the STP to the garbage treatment plant (GTP) at Saligao. The reverse pipeline will take the treated water from the STP to the GTP for use there, he said.

However, with the state government facing a financial crisis, the reverse pipeline is still in the pipeline, and a sewerage network in Calangute is still a work in progress.

350,['10/01/2020'],Leaders opposing CAA without knowing why: Ram Madhav,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Trichy/Madurai/Chennai: Under fire from the opposition parties and allies over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Narendra Modi government has gone into firefighting mode deploying ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and Smriti Irani as well as BJP general secretary Ram Madhav to clear the air over the issues in the state.

Ram Madhav said at a meeting preceding a rally organized by the district wing of the BJP in Trichy that those opposing the CAA do not know anything about it. He said the sea of participants in the rally was proof of thousands in the state supporting the Act as all of them were patriots. “Some leaders in Tamil Nadu are opposing the Act. If we ask them the reason for their opposition, they do not have answers. Those who oppose the Act really do not know anything about the Act,” he said.

The opposition leaders are not bothering about the people living in India but worried about the Muslims living in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Another propaganda about the Act unleashed by the DMK was that the Act has excluded Sri Lankan Tamils from becoming Indian nationals. “I appeal to the Muslim brothers to not to fall prey to the propaganda of the opposition parties. This Act is not against Muslims or Christians,” he said. Party’s national executive committee member L Ganesan, actor Gautami and state general secretary M Muruganantham also participated.

At Sellur in Madurai, Union Minister of Women and Child Development and Textiles Smriti Irani asked DMK, “When you had so many opportunities to show your sympathy towards Sri Lankan Tamil refugees and other minorities when the UPA government came up with policies which against their welfare why did you not react.” She said they had gathered there because all those who were participating in the rally had put the nation first. ‘When the November 2007 special commission for rehabilitation did not entertain citizenship for Sri Lankan refugees under the UPA government why did you remain silent?’’ she asked. ``We recall the sacrifices of the Indians beyond caste and religion, so that they can live in dignity, but the DMK has joined hands with those who shamed those sacrifices,’’ she said.

At Chennai, Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the government will hold talks with allies and take them into confidence. He was responding to a question on Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami’s statement in the assembly that he had told Home Minister Amit Shah that NRC was not acceptable to the AIADMK government. On NRC, he said, “There are provisions that the date for NRC shall be announced, there will be verification, hearing of objections and disposal of objections and appeal against that. Nothing has been decided at all including the date.”

351,['10/01/2020'],"6 short of majority in Nandurbar ZP, Cong, BJP reach out to Sena","This story is from January 10, 2020

Nashik: The post-ZP poll scenario in Nandurbar has taken an interesting turn as both Congress and BJP will need support from Shiv Sena , which seems to be bargaining for the president’s post with only seven seats in its kitty.

Congress and BJP have won 23 seats each and are short of six seats to reach the magic figure of 29 to rule the 56-member Nandurbar ZP for the next five years. The NCP won only three seats.

Sources in Shiv Sena on Thursday told TOI from Nandurbar that their party will extend support on the condition that the ZP president will be from Sena.

“The situation in Nandurbar is similar to the one after the state assembly elections last year,” said Sena insiders..

The sources said that Congress and BJP have reached out to the local unit of Sena seeking support.

“Although Congress, NCP and Sena are a part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state, the three parties fought the ZP polls in Nandurbar separately. Our party will extend support on the condition that the ZP president will be from Sena,” party insiders said.

Chandrakant Raghuvanshi, senior Sena functionary from Nandurbar, said his party will play a key role in deciding who comes to power in the local zilla parishad.

“We will abide by the decision of the party high command and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Given the numbers, our party is eyeing the post of ZP president,” confirmed Raghuvanshi.

According to Sena insiders, party MP Sanjay Raut and state tribal welfare minister K C Padvi had a preliminary discussion over the phone about Congress and Sena stitching up a post-poll alliance to rule the zilla parishad.

Padvi, the local Congress MLA from Akkalkuwa assembly segment of Nandurbar, could not be contacted. “We are assuming that our high command will direct the local unit to join hands with Congress to keep BJP out of power. The scenario would be clear within the next couple of days,” said a Sena functionary.

The local BJP unit has ruled out the possibility of Sena getting the post of ZP president. “The local Sena unit is bargaining hard and BJP will not succumb. Our party can offer the post of ZP vice-president and chairperson of few committees in to the Sena if they extend support to our party,” said a district BJP functionary.

According to Nandurbar BJP MLA Vijay Gavit, the party is exploring all options to come to power in the zilla parishad. “BJP has done well in the polls and is keen to rule the Nandurbar ZP,” he said, but refused to divulge details about the options available before his party to cobble up a majority.

Trichy: A Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) employee lost Rs 30,000 after an unidentified man stole his ATM card and PIN while it was being used in an ATM room in Perambalur town on Wednesday.

Tangedco employee Balakrishnan handed over his ATM card to his son-in-law, Balamurugan of Pudhunaduvalur, to withdraw money. Balamurugan, who is an autorickshaw driver, went to an ATM room in Venkatesapuram locality.

As Balamurugan tried to withdraw money, the card got stuck in the ATM. An unidentified man, who was standing behind Balamurugan, took note of the ATM PIN. Under the pretext of helping Balamurugan, the accused swapped the ATM card with a bogus one. Without noticing it, Balamurugan left the ATM room.

The unidentified man withdrew Rs 30,000 from Balakrishnan’s account. Upon receiving a text message on money deducted from the account, Balamurugan and Balakrishnan realised that they had been cheated. Balakrishnan approached the bank and blocked the ATM card.

The Perambalur police began investigations based on footage from a CCTV camera in the ATM room.

GUNTUR: The government is losing nearly Rs 13,000 crore annually due to boom in illegal cigarette trade, said director of Tobacco Institute of India Syed Mohammad Ahmed at a meeting held in connection with the annual TII awards for growers from AP, Telangana and Karnataka on Thursday. Stating that high taxes on cigarettes is not only helping widen the market for illegal cigarettes in India, Ahmed said, that it is also adversely affecting tobacco growers. He said any further tax increase on cigarettes will affect the offtake of Indian tobaccos and increase the stress on earnings of domestic tobacco farmers .

He urged the Centre to adopt a consultative approach for policy development on tobacco so that livelihoods of farmers are protected.

PANAJI: Pending final approvals, the construction of the ‘ Goa Bazaar ’ at Merces seems to have hit a roadblock.

“We have submitted the proposal to the town and country planning (TCP) department for approval. The expenditure finance committee (EFC) committee too is yet to approve of the project. There are some technical reports sought by the government pertaining to land feasibility. As the project has been designed by the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (GSIDC), we’ve asked it to submit the report,” said Sanjit Rodrigues, project director of the North Goa District Rural Development Agency (DRDA).

Slated to cost approximately Rs 53 crore, the project will be undertaken phase-wise. “Central funding amounting to Rs 12 crore is already with us and we’re ready to start the work. However, we cannot tender the works until the approvals come through,” Rodrigues said.

Goa Bazaar, being planned on the lines of Dilli Haat in the national capital, will accommodate 200 stalls and two halls. A fountain built outside will feature different variants of lotuses. The unique project will probably be the first government building to access sweet water from the natural spring at Merces.

Sources from DRDA said that there is water erupting within the premises of the project, and this will serve as the water source for the fountain. “We will be using the spring water for both, construction work and as a water supply source. It will save money as well by eliminating the need for water tankers,” a DRDA official said.

355,['10/01/2020'],"Nagpur: Metro takes away another green patch, this time from Neeri","This story is from January 10, 2020

Representative image

Nagpur: City’s another green tract of land is set to be knocked out as Mahametro has acquired around one acre of National Environmental Engineering Research Institute’s prime green area in Ajni.

The land is near Metro’s Ajni Square station. While MahaMetro officials didn’t specify the purpose of acquiring land, TOI learnt that it is likely to be used for parking.

Neeri director Rakesh Kumar informed that the decision to hand over the area was made around five years back. “The procedure happened following directives of the government which state that vacant land should be expeditiously given for developmental projects,” said Kumar.

With the completion of formalities, the area is now in possession of MahaMetro which is now carrying out fencing work. “We have taken possession of the area but are yet to decide its usage,” said a Metro spokesperson.

As the news came out, it received a backlash from several environment activists who opposed destruction of the green cover. MahaMetro stated that it has no immediate plans to cut down trees in the area. Garden superintendent of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) Amol Chorpagar confirmed that the agency has not sought permission to fell trees yet.

However, environment activists are certain that significant green cover would be lost. “The fact that Metro has acquired land implies that it is planning to carry out construction activity. And, for this, trees will be chopped,” they said.

Stating that the land is along side the road and not too deep inside the forested area, Neeri officials said, “Many trees in that given area are of subabul specie.”

Activists however pointed out that the green patch is home to various species of birds, including owls and other animals too. “A cluster of subabul trees is also an important habitat. Over the years, experts have recorded various species of birds in that area. Before handing over the land, an environment impact study should have been done,” said Jaydeep Das, honorary wildlife warden of Nagpur.

Many green lovers expressed objection to the move on social media platforms, blaming civic authorities for not ensuring sustainable development . “Why is MahaMetro only encroaching on green patches of the city? Why can’t it find other alternatives? Damaging age-old trees and biodiversity habitat and then justifying it with reasons like parking or a road is not acceptable,” they stated.

Since over a year, a large group of citizens have been protesting a proposed road which threatens to kill age-old trees and a biodiversity habitat in Bharat Nagar. The road was proposed by MahaMetro and NMC.

357,['10/01/2020'],Voltage fluctuation damages 100 household appliances,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Nashik: A sudden power fluctuation damaged at least 100 household electric appliances in Cidco’s Uttam Nagar area on Wednesday morning. Appliances such as televisions, set-top boxes, audio systems, mixer grinders, refrigerators, washing machines, computers and even photocopiers were damaged as a sudden high voltage current flowed across supply lines to residential and commercial establishments in the area around 8.30am. An MSEDCL official said senior officials of the state power utility will take a decision on compensating citizens whose appliances were damaged.

“We were watching television when it suddenly switched off. At first, I thought it was due to a power failure. But then there was a foul smell of a damaged LED bulb. Many neighbours also started complaining, indicating that several appliances in the area were damaged,” said Sanjay Patil, a resident of Uttam Nagar, adding that his LED television had cost around Rs 49,000.

Citizens alleged that they waited for about an hour before complaining to the state power utility but since officials did not turn up, angry residents got together and rallied to the MSEDCL office near Sambhaji Stadium. Uttam Nagar corporator Ratnamala Rane alleged that this was the third such incident in the last one-and-a-half-years and has affected many people. “Previously, we only sought the MSEDCL officers’ response but this time since so many people were affected we marched to the office. Most people came voluntarily,” said Rane.

About one-and-a-half years ago in Janeshwar Chowk, 57 televisions were damaged due to a similar case of fluctuation in power. During Dasara, 23 televisions and other electrical appliances were damaged due to a similar incident. “The MSEDCL will have to pay for the damaged goods this time. They cannot take us for granted,” said Snehalata Vaidya, another resident of Uttam Nagar.

The MSEDCL, meanwhile, said the sudden power surge was due to the insulation over the wires wearing out and two supply cables getting connected. “A technical failure at one of the distribution points at Uttam Nagar resulted in the voltage fluctuation that led to damaging of electrical installations in the area. A panchanama is being carried out to ascertain the damage,” a senior MSEDCL official said.

The MSEDCL has appealed to people to put in place electric safeguards as mandated by the company. “Protection kits have been made mandatory. Besides, many people either modify the parameters or even bypass safeguards,” said another official, adding that people should follow rules. When asked about compensation, the official said “There is no statutory provision for compensation, but senior officials will decide.”

358,['10/01/2020'],House site among sops in consideration for secretariat staff shifting to Port City,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Amaravati: The state government is planning to grant house sites to all secretariat employees in the proposed executive capital city of Visakhapatnam. Besides, a special house building loan of Rs 25 lakh and an additional 10 per cent displacement allowance is also under consideration. The initiatives are meant to mollify the anxiety that has gripped secretariat staffers.

The high-power committee, formed to study the expert panels’ recommendations on the capital issue, is believed to have also discussed the grievances of the employees in moving the capital to Visakhapatnam. The committee, which met three days ago, is reported to have readied a list of sops to be granted to the employees if the capital is shifted and is waiting for a clearance from chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy before making the list public.

Sources said the high-power committee has suggested grant of house sites to all employees before they move to Visakhapatnam, keeping in view the non-fulfilment of promises made to the secretariat staff by the erstwhile TDP regime. When the capital was slated to come up in Amaravati, the then Chandrababu Naidu government had promised house sites for all secretariat employees. Though many All India Service (AIS) officers got their plots registered, other officials attached to the secretariat could not get them till the general elections, the outcome of which has now changed the whole scenario.

The committee, therefore, wants house sites to be given to all employees before they move to Visakhapatnam. The plots, however, would be offered at nominal rates. The stamp duty for registration of house sites would be exempted. The spouse of the employee would also be transferred to Visakhapatnam urban area without reference to the vacancy position in that particular cadre. Besides a house rent allowance of 30 per cent, the secretariat staff would also be given an additional 10% city compensatory allowance as displacement allowance.

It has also been decided to grant a shifting allowance of Rs 1 lakh to gazetted officers, Rs 75,000 to non-gazetted officers and Rs 50,000 to class-IV employees. Further, the government is also considering subsidised housing facility for those who shift their families to Visakhapatnam. A 2-bhk flat would be offered at Rs 4,000 per month while the staff would need to pay Rs 6,000 for a 3-bhk apartment. Free accommodation would be provided to bachelors, as in the case of Amaravati.

The present 5-day week system will continue for another three years. Free bus passes will be provided in Visakhapatnam city, while employees would get a 50% concession twice a month to travel from Visakhapatnam to Hyderabad or Vijayawada to meet their family members. The committee has also decided to give top priority to medical facilities for employees by setting up a dispensary and station an ambulance at the new secretariat.

PANAJI: Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) has demanded that the state government remove director of education Vandana Rao, an IAS officer, from the post, stating that she has created ‘an atmosphere of discontent among stakeholders’.

If the government fails to take action, GPCC, along with parents, teachers and schools, would hold an agitation for Rao’s removal, Congress spokesperson Swati Kerkar said. Kerkar said that since the day Rao has taken over as director, she has only issued irrelevant and unwarranted circulars one after another.

“She has been ordering schools to comply to her fanciful activities at gun point, threatening the managements, heads, and teachers of the serving educational institutions of this state. The director has failed to understand that every educational institute has it own yearly programme planned well in advance at the beginning of academic year. The director directs to conduct several tireless and time-bound activities to school and staff. However, these activities clash with the school activities planned earlier,” Kerkar said.

She said Rao should take the view of various organisations of schools, school heads, teachers and other stakeholders in the state and plan the academic activities accordingly.

Recently, Rao had issued show cause notices to schools which failed to appear for a meeting called by her.

In one of the circulars issued by the director, the pay scales and status of teachers working on temporary basis have been illegally changed violating the principles of ‘equal working equal pay’, Kerkar alleged.

Hyderabad: With Iran targeting US forces in Iraq by firing missiles, 25,000 Telangana workers in Erbil , Iraq, are on tenterhooks. In view of the situation escalating further, workers are willing to be evacuated.

The Telangana Gulf Employees’ Welfare Association stepped in and issued an appeal to Telangana workers to gather at the Consulate General of India in Erbil at 6pm on Thursday to bring pressure on the authorities to facilitate their travel back home. The Indian embassy also advised Indian nationals to avoid non-essential travel to Iraq until further notification.

“There is utter chaos and uncertainty here. There are a lot of American troops, who are being targeted by Iran. The situation is going to get dangerous in the coming days,” said Ramachander Rayalawar, vice-president of the association. Ramachander, who works in Erbil.

There is tension in the air and we are definitely facing a dangerous situation,” Ramachander told TOI over telephone from Erbil. A majority of workforce from Telangana is employed at construction sites in Erbil and nearby towns.

In a travel advisory issued on Wednesday, embassy in Baghdad asked Indian nationals residing in Iraq to be alert and avoid travel within the country. “Our embassy in Baghdad and consulate in Erbil will continue to function normally to provide service to Indians in Iraq,” the embassy said.

Indian workers have always considered Baghdad a dangerous city to live and hence chosen Erbil which is considered safer. “The missile attack took place in the night and there is a lot of movement of government and military convoys here. We heard that some helicopters were taken down in the missile attack. We also heard about casualties though we are not sure about that,” Ramachander said.

According to Iraqi military, 22 missiles were launched by Iran on Ain al-Asad air base and another base in Erbil between 1.45am and 2.15am (local time).

This is part of the company’s ambitions to emerge as one of the largest integrated environment solutions players in emerging economies, REEL managing director and CEO Goutham Reddy told TOI.

“We are eyeing a bigger play in Africa, South East Asia and Middle East. We already have projects worth nearly Rs 950 crore that are under construction in India and the Middle East and expected to be commissioned within the next six months. We also have projects worth around Rs 2700 crore under various stages of planning over the next two to three years,” Reddy said.

Reddy pointed out that Hyderabad will account for a chunk of its investment plan at Rs 1,500 crore, including the Rs 400 crore, 20MW waste-to-energy (W2E) plant coming up at Jawaharnagar that is to be commissioned by March this year.

TRICHY: The principal district court has ordered an AIADMK candidate, who was declared elected as councillor of district panchayat ward 15 in Thanjavur district, to abstain from the indirect election of the council chairman on January 11.

According to sources, out of 28 district panchayat ward councillors, DMK bagged 22 and AIADMK the remaining six at the civic polls held recently. Ponnusamy (DMK) and B Vinubalan (AIADMK) contested in ward 15. Though there were 62,313 eligible voters, a total of 39,158 votes were polled in the election. However, 2,680 votes were declared invalid by the election officials at the counting on January 2.

363,['10/01/2020'],Nagpur: Tiger Sahebrao to be fitted with artificial limb on January 18,"This story is from January 10, 2020

NAGPUR: Sahebrao, the 9-year-old tiger at Gorewada Rescue Centre in the city, is all set get an artificial limb on January 18.

This will be the first case of prosthesis for a tiger in the world. Earlier, it has been done for dogs and elephants.

Prosthesis is an artificial device that replaces a missing body part, which may be lost through trauma, disease or congenital conditions. They are intended to restore normal functions of the missing body part.

According to Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) sources, which runs the rescue centre, the artificial limb will be fitted in the presence of noted orthopaedic surgeon Dr Sushrut Babhulkar, Dr Peter Giannoudis, professor of orthopaedics with University of Leeds, United Kingdom, FDCM officials and wildlife veterinarians from Maharashtra Animal and Fishery Sciences University’s Wildlife Research & Training Centre (WRTC).

“The artificial limb has been prepared by a team of local doctors who have expertise in fracture fixation of humans and animals. Sahebrao’s limb has been prepared under the guidance of Dr Babhulkar with technical know-how from Germany’s AO Foundation, well-known in fracture fixation of humans and animals too,” said the sources.

Dr Babhulkar is the only Indian Council member of AO Foundation and hence used his connections to ensure that Sahebrao can walk once again.

TOI on February 3, 2018, was the first to report about the decision to fit an artificial limb to Sahebrao with the help of Dr Babhulkar, who had adopted the male tiger then.

Experts involved in the process told TOI they will examine the limb before going ahead. The first step to fit an artificial limb started in August 2018 by taking X-rays and blood samples. Based on the radiology reports, a team of WRTC experts operated Sahebrao on October 9 for neuroma and took measurement for the prosthesis. “Post-surgery, Sahebrao is under observation of WRTC team. The tiger’s surgery wounds have healed and pain has reduced drastically. The vets planned to fit the artificial limb after six weeks. It is nearly three months now and stage is set for the world’s first such procedure,” said sources.

Till the prosthesis is done, experts are playing cards close to their chest as this will be the first such process on a tiger. “The artificial limb is made of polysynthetic material and is very strong. It will be interesting to see how Sahebrao reacts to the artificial limb,” said sources.

Two-year-old Sahebrao and his sibling were caught in a steel trap laid by organized gang of Baheliya poachers in Gondmohadi outside Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) on April 26, 2012. While the sibling died, Sahebrao was rescued but his injured front leg had to be amputated because of gangrene. The tiger was later shifted to city’s Maharajbagh zoo on December 12, 2012 and on June 1, 2016 to Gorewada.

Trichy: Jallikattu is a native sport and should be conducted in a traditional manner as the very purpose of the traditional sport will be lost if it is commercialised, Tamil film composer Hiphop Tamizha Aadhi has said. Aadhi, who was the chief guest, was speaking to reporters after attending Pongal celebrations at St Joseph's College on Thursday. Referring to jallikattu league being planned in the state, he said detaching the sport from its traditional identity might affect the sport.

Giving an example of the sport turning commercial, he said Coimbatore district has no jallikattu connection but is being conducted there now. “However, Rekla race is native to Pollachi and adjoining areas of Coimbatore. Jallikattu should be conducted in a traditional way as it was conducted in the past. Otherwise, the purpose of the sport might be lost,” he said.

He supported restrictions on the conduct of jallikattu as they would ensure safety of both bulls and bull tamers.

He condemned the attack on students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). He said students should be given freedom to express their views. “It is unfortunate that an organization was allowed to carry an attack on JNU students and proudly claims responsibility for it,” he said.

PORVORIM: The Goa Legislators’ Forum on Thursday passed a resolution calling on the Centre to prevent Karnataka from diverting water from the Mhadei river basin through the Kalasa Bandura project.

The resolution was passed in the presence of chief minister Pramod Sawant where former St Cruz MLA Victor Gonsalves also said that he does not trust the assurances given by the Centre.

“Most of us have doubts over the Centre’s promises on Mhadei. The CM should show this resolution to the Centre. We resolve here that all members of the Goa Legislators’ Forum want Mhadei river to be saved and that no water should be diverted from the Mhadei basin to Karnataka,” Gonsalves said.

The resolution was unanimously approved and passed by the Goa Legislators’ Forum at an event to mark Legislators’ Day.

Sawant lauded the contribution made by MLAs and former legislators. Sawant, who was speaker of the assembly just a year ago, said the forum was one of the most active in the country.

“Goa could consider hosting a legislators’ forum conference,” Sawant suggested, adding that the government will support all efforts to host such a conference.

Deputy speaker Isidore Fernandes, however, rued the lack the of interest shown by present legislators in attending the function which was held at the assembly complex. “I sent a message to ruling MLAs, but nobody came. I request the speaker to make it compulsory to have four ministers in attendance at the next Legislators’ Day function,” he said.

HYDERABAD: In what could raise eyebrows of environmentalists and green activists, the state government has exempted TSGenco from conducting a social impact assessment (SIA) study for acquiring 234 acres for laying a railway line, water pipeline, intake structure and other facilities for the Rs 20,000-crore 4,000 MW thermal power plant at Veerlapalem village in Nalgonda ’s Damaracherla mandal.

A GO (No. 20 dated December 2, 2019) was issued in this regard with a rider that this was being done in public interest as per the powers vested with the government under the provisions of Land Acquisition Act, 2013. Special chief secretary, energy, Ajay Mishra told TOI that government could use such powers and added that all environmental norms were being followed.

“Why would we take a risk in execution of a huge project. All norms pertaining to National Green Tribunal and central environment committee have been followed while giving SIA exemption. The project is being taken with hypersensitive technology in compliance with norms,” Mishra said.

Meanwhile, environmentalists have kicked up a furore and demanded that SIA be conducted. “Was Genco not aware that it would be requiring 234 acres for laying the railway line and water pipeline when it launched works three years ago? Under the pretext of urgency to complete the project, the government has given exemption to Genco, which is not acceptable,” said environmentalist and IICT former scientist K Babu Rao.

Babu Rao said chapter II of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, clearly states that SIA needs to be conducted whenever a government intends to acquire land for public purpose.

Human Rights Forum Nalgonda unit secretary G Mohan said the government cannot bypass SIA. “It should conduct SIA at all costs,” he said. The project has seen protests from locals affected by the project.

HYDERABAD: The CBI said trial court’s cognisance order in respect of role played by former AP revenue minister Dharmana Prasada Rao holds good under provisions of Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act in Vanpic chargesheet of quid pro quo case filed against AP CM Jagan and others.

The investigating agency conveyed this to the trial court in compliance with a direction given by principal special judge BV Madhusudan Rao of Hyderabad CBI courts, who sought to know the status of the case filed by CBI against the former minister in the Supreme Court. Dharmana was an accused in Vanpic chargesheet.

Vadarevu and Nizampatnam Port and Industrial Corridor (Vanpic) was proposed to be set up between Guntur and Prakasam districts in 2008 in an extent of 28,000 acres. Dharmana’s role as then revenue minister came under CBI scanner. In its chargesheet, CBI said businessman Nimmagadda Prasad, Dharmana and others entered into a criminal conspiracy to cheat the state.

Section 19 of PC Act makes it mandatory for CBI to obtain sanction from the state government to prosecute a public servant like a cabinet minister in a trial court. The state had refused to accord sanction in 2012. The trial court took cognisance of the role of the former minister in respect of IPC sections like cheating, criminal conspiracy, etc., but deferred the cognisance in respect of PC Act. Later, when he ceased to be a minister, CBI approached the trial court again and asked it to take cognisance as he was not a public servant. The trial court then took cognisance of Dharmana’s role under the PC Act.

Dharmana moved the HC challenging trial court’s decision. Stating that trial court erred in taking cognisance during second round, he contended that trial court has no review power. HC agreed with it. But, SC later found fault with HC order and upheld trial court’s decision. It said trial court had merely deferred its decision on cognisance and cannot be called as first decision.

“There is no second decision. Trial court took cognisance when Dharmana ceased to be a minister and it should be seen as sole decision,” SC said while remanding the matter to HC asking it to examine whether there is any need to obtain prior permission under the PC Act. Though the HC, in tune with the order of SC, took up the matter, Dharmana withdrew his plea from the HC later. “This means that trial court order taking cognisance stands good,” CBI counsel K Surender said. The case will come up for hearing on January 10.

371,['10/01/2020'],Official in soup for letting women councillors’ husbands to read oath,"This story is from January 10, 2020

The Krishnagiri district administration has sought explanation from the returning officer who presided over the swearing in ceremony of district panchayat councillors when some of the women elected representatives got their husbands to read the oath instead of them.

Krishnagiri collector S Prabhakar told TOI that the returning officer was asked to submit his reply within 15 days. On Monday, when the district panchayat councillors took charge in the district, husbands of women councillors read the oath in a jarring indication of the influence they might wield over the women representatives.

Thirteen of the 23 district panchayat councillors in Krishnagiri were women. Sources said that at least four men who accompanied their wives to the swearing in ceremony read the oath instead of their wives including that of M Anitha, a DMK councillor representing fourth ward.

Oath taking is an essential part of the swearing in ceremony of panchayat representatives. During the hearing of a case in 2018, the Supreme Court had warned of serious consequences if the elected representatives did not take oath. The court had then lauded Tamil Nadu for making oath taking mandatory for local body representatives. “For some reason, it was the women councillors who asked their husbands to read the oath. But the final words agreeing to swear by the oath were uttered by them,’’ said Krishnagiri district rural development agency project officer C Periyasamy, who was the returning officer who presided over the swearing in ceremony.

Prabhakar, however, said that there are clear rules even in case a councillor was illiterate or unable to read. “In such cases, the officials should read out the oath and the councillors are supposed to repeat. We will see the explanation and decide the next course of action,’’ he said. He assured that the husbands or any other male relatives will not be allowed to interfere in the functioning of woman councillors.

NAGPUR: In a silver lining for the city’s guardians, the just-released national crime data of 2018 illustrates that Nagpur can no longer be associated with the moniker of ‘crime capital’, which was once used by the opponents of the-then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to corner him on the assembly floor.

During a media briefing earlier this week, city police chief BK Upadhyay had claimed that there was a 10% dip in the crime rate in 2019, when compared to the previous year. The assertion has been validated with the release of the crime statistics of 2018 by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), where Nagpur’s position is quite lower down the order in most categories of serious crimes in the nation.

In a majority of the categories, Nagpur is third in the state after Mumbai and Pune, barring the category of ‘Crime rate of cognisable offences’, registered under Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Special Local Laws (SLL), where it has overtaken the bigger two metros in comparison of 19 such places nationwide. While Nagpur has a crime rate of 688.6 per one lakh, Mumbai stands at 309.9/lakh, while Pune’s is the lowest (277.9/lakh) in Maharashtra. Nagpur is placed at number 12 in India in the same crime rate category.

Upadhyay said that the crimes are under control, and that the numbers have both, visibly and statistically come down. “It is a safe city. Our force is constantly trying to remain on its toes and improve the scenario further,” he said.

The city stands at number 12 in the country for rape, with 69 offences registered in 2018, and third in the state after Mumbai (319) and Pune (103) — making it statistically safer for women. In the category of ‘Assault on women with intent to outrage her modesty’ under Section 354 of IPC, the city holds the 10th position in the nation with 274 offences. It is third in the state after Mumbai (2,038), which is second in the nation, followed by Pune (406).

In the category of ‘Total offences affecting human body’, Nagpur is 14th in the nation with 2,619 offences, and third in the state with Mumbai (11,585) at number two in the country and Pune (2,903) standing at the 12th position.

In the category of murder, the city is 12th in the nation and third in the state with 72 such offences, which is one less than that in Pune. Mumbai is fourth in the nation and first in the state with 164 murders. In the ‘Attempt to murder’ category, the city is third in the state and 11th in the nation with 77 offences, after Pune (127) and Mumbai (280).

In economic offences, Mumbai is first in the nation with 4803 crimes, while Nagpur is 15th, with 534 offences. Pune is 12th in the country with 777 offences.

The city is also relatively safer for senior citizens, with 207 offences — which is sixth in the nation and second in the state after Mumbai (1,043), which tops the chart. Pune, with 169 offences, is safest in the state for the elderly population as per the national crime data.

In crimes against children, Nagpur is third in the state and sixth in the country with 538 offences. Mumbai has the highest crime against children in the state and second in the nation, with 2,538 offences.

373,['10/01/2020'],Nagpur: Will Nitin Raut gel well to steer city’s development?,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Nitin Gadkari

NAGPUR: After Nitin Raut ’s appointment as guardian minister, the city has two Nitins at the helm of affairs, both belonging to opposing parties and having different ideologies. While one is at the centre, the other is at state, and coordination between them is must for city’s development , feel the politicians and observers.

“I am never against any development and we will work together. In fact, I had brought many developmental projects for the city. However, I would not support those projects that are against public interests. City’s development and generation of employment is a priority,” says Raut.

Earlier, it was Gadkari’s partymate Chandrashekhar Bawankule who was the guardian minister. Inevitably, there was synergy between them. With a change in guard in the state, it could become difficult for the powerful Union minister to implement his ambitious plans like Intra Model Station (IMS) at Ajni on Central jail’s land, modernization of city’s Dr Ambedkar airport, expanding metro rail to suburbs like Katol, Saoner and Kamptee, and rejuvenation of Nag river among others.

“We’ve to wait and watch on how the two Nitins gel. Though it’s too early to comment on their chemistry, one thing is sure that the development would definitely take a back seat, at least for some time. We can only hope that both should work in a tandem to ensure city’s development, for which the people have voted them to power,” political analysts Anjali Gaidhane says.

Earlier, the presence of former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis from the city and finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar from Chandrapur, helped in getting clearance and funding for all the major projects like Metro rail expansion, airport modernization, construction of highways, flyovers, railway under and over bridges and others, in last five years. In the current scenario, it seems to be bit difficult.

Politicians like ex-city MP Vilas Muttemwar feel if the same party government is working at centre, state and also in municipal corporation, it helps in expediting and implementation of the projects. “I was lucky as the Congress government held power at all three places from 2002 to 2007 and we brought many projects. All the projects Gadkari was taking credit for like Mihan and metro rail, were introduced by our government,” he says, adding that how both Nitins coordinate with each other would be vital for development.

It’s not only that centre needs state’s help for projects, many a times, it’s vice versa. Being a senior minister in Modi cabinet, he can easily push the state’s proposals.

“I think both Nitins are big leaders and worked hard for city’s development in their respective capacities. Both should take lessons from assembly polls, where BJP lost many seats in district, due to their failure to carry out development works. Now, I think there would be a competition between two for launching new projects,” says Congress MLA Vikas Thakre who got chosen to the state legislature for the first time.

Former president of NGO Janmanch, Sharad Patil, believes that both Nitins would give priority to their respective parties, their own personalities and then to the development. “Obviously, there would be a break to the city’s development. It would need some time to get back its momentum provided both leaders work closely with each other by keeping aside their party affiliations,” he says.

374,['10/01/2020'],Goa government mulls relocating families living in Mhadei eco zone,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Goa CM Pramod Sawant

PORVORIM/KERI: The death of four tigers within the Mhadei wildlife sanctuary has prompted the state government to look afresh at the proposal to relocate families situated within the proposed tiger corridor.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant has asked the principal conservator of forests and other authorities to prepare to evacuate two families and rehabilitate them outside the wildlife sanctuary.

“I am not talking about everyone. It is only those in the eco-sensitive zone in the Mhadei sanctuary.I think there are just two families who live in what could be declared as the tiger corridor,” said Sawant.

“The government’s preparations to shift them along with their livestock and relocate them somewhere else is on. There are some from the tribal community and other communities, and we need to insist that they relocate to another locality,” said the chief minister.

He said that the government would provide land and other resources so that the families can be rehabilitated along with their livestock.

The chief minister said the death of the tigers had mentally disturbed him. He said that in order to ensure that such situations did not occur, the principal conservator of forests had been empowered to compensate or assist farmers who had lost livestock to predators.“It is our misfortune that these four tigers died and it is not just the state government but the Central government has also taken note of this,” said Sawant.

Under the Forest Dwelling Act 2006, Goa government had constituted committees and asked villagers in forests to produce evidences of their settlement. But so far the cases of their rights have not been settled. Harishchandra Gaonkar from Caranzol said, “We are living on these lands in the sanctuary since ages, but so far the issue of our right over these areas has not been recognised. In this situation, initiating the relocation of the villagers will not be fruitful.”

Villagers from Cadval and Vainguinim have expressed willingness to move out of the sanctuary area if proper rehabilitation packages are extended to them. They, however, said they have no faith in forest department officials as for the last two decades no concrete steps have been taken to solve their genuine problems.

However, environmentalists and wildlifers have welcomed the government move.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh (ANI photo)

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday told his US and Japanese counterparts, Mark Esper and Taro Kono, that India was firmly in favour of de-escalation in the ongoing tensions between the US and Iran in the middle east.

Singh, in separate telephonic conversations with Esper and Kono, shared with them India's ""concerns, stakes and interest"" in the West Asian region, while also affirming the Indian government's resolve to further expand defence cooperation with the US and Japan.

Esper assured Singh that the US too was interested in ensuring that the security situation in West Asia did not deteriorate any further, while briefing him on the developments in the region. India has watched with growing concern the escalating tensions in the region after the killing of top Iranian military commander Qassim Suleimani and the retaliatory missile strikes by Iran against US-led forces in Iraq.

India has huge stakes in West Asia, ranging from energy supply to an over seven million strong diaspora. ""While reviewing the situation in the middle east, Singh and Kono discussed ways to ensure the security of their energy and oil lines flowing through the Persian Gulf.

The two ministers also discussed measures to enhance the bilateral security cooperation under the framework of the India-Japan special strategic and global partnership,"" said an official.

Singh and Esper, in turn, resolved to strengthen bilateral defence cooperation in line with the two-plus-two dialogue, which is the highest-level institutional mechanism between India and the US to review the bilateral security, defence and strategic partnership, held in Washington last month.

India and the US reiterated their commitment to advancing ""a free, open, inclusive, peaceful, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region"" during the dialogue, while agreeing to ""further deepen"" militaryto-military cooperation, including between the Indian Navy and the US Navy fleets under the American Indo-Pacific Command, Central Command and Africa Command.

377,['10/01/2020'],8 coaches of Rajya Rani Exp to be reserved for Nashik region,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Nashik: Rajya Rani Express , that will run from Mumbai to Nanded instead of Manmad from Friday, will have as many as eight second sitting coaches and one AC chair car, reserved for travellers from Nashik region in both directions.

The intercity Manmad-Mumbai-Manmad (No. 22101/2) Rajya Rani Express will be renamed as Nanded-Mumbai-Nanded (17611/2) and will start its maiden journey on January 10 from Mumbai.

“The train will begin service after being extended up till Nanded and the railways has taken care to ensure there are coaches reserved for the travellers in Nashik region travelling to and from Mumbai,” a railway official said.

Sources said that when the train leaves Nanded station, the reserved coaches will be locked till the train reaches Manmad. In the return journey from Mumbai, the same numbers of coaches will be reserved only for the people travelling up to Manmad and not beyond.

“It clearly means that the people willing to travel beyond Manmad will have to occupy other coaches and if there were passengers travelling to Nanded in the coach, they could be removed with the help of authorities. Besides while coming to Mumbai, passengers from the region will get ample space,” the official said.

Passengers from Nashik, however, are skeptical about the arrangements and believe that it was likely to create friction between the commuters.

“When the train will leave CSMT it is likely that the passengers travelling beyond Manmad will occupy seats in these coaches and this it will lead to friction. Similar will be the case when the train in heading towards Mumbai,” a passenger said.

“People from other coaches will rush to the coaches that are being opened in Manmad. So by the time the train comes at Nashik Road, the train will be full just in the case of Tapovan Express,” Rajesh Nahar, a regular commuter, said.

Commuters have therefore demanded than three coaches should be reserved for Nashik Road railway station.

378,['10/01/2020'],PMPML board electric bus fare-hike proposal,"This story is from January 10, 2020

The board of directors of PMPML rejected a proposal to increase electric bus fares at a meeting on Thursday

PUNE: The board of directors of Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) rejected a proposal to increase electric bus fares at a meeting on Thursday.

“The board didn’t approve the proposal,” a senior PMPML official confirmed to TOI.

Last month, the transport body said it planned to double the fare on-board its 119 e-buses, thanks to a loophole in a government resolution (GR), which allowed levying double rates on air-conditioned buses. “Since the electric buses are air-conditioned, their on-board fare can be increased. The issue is not e-buses, but AC buses,” a PMPML official had said.

The move had sparked dismay among regular passengers, who said the transport body should have been clear about increasing the fares from the onset, rather than claim the fares would be the same as other buses.

The buses were acquired as a part of Phase II of the FAME India scheme, which is aimed at boosting clean mobility in public transportation.

Hemant Rasane, a PMPML director, said board also rejected another proposal — for a team of technicians from Tata Motors to maintain 400 new buses set to arrive this year. “Why do we need a special team to maintain new buses? We thought that the proposal was not quite realistic and turned it down,” Rasane said, adding that the board informed PMPML that, if anything, a special team was needed to maintain the older buses.

Rasane, however, added that they would float a tender for the maintenance of their fleet of midi (mid-sized) buses. “Tata Motors can bid for it. This special team of technicians will take care of the midi bus fleet,” he said.

In December, two PMPML technicians had sustained injuries following an explosion in a midi bus that was under maintenance. All 233 midi buses on PMPML’s fleet were manufactured by Tata Motors. The transport utility then sent one of the buses to Automotive Research Association of India to seek a third-party opinion.

In another development, PMPML will rent 40 buses owned by a body of self-help groups of army widows. “These are around 40 self-help groups, which get grants from the Sainik Welfare Board. All these SHGs have come together and formed a company and bought 40 buses. PMPML has decided to take these buses on a rental basis. The rates they have quoted are less ... PMPML will deploy conductors for these buses, which will be inducted in the fleet after checks by Central Institute of Road Transport and PMPML,” Shankar Pawar, another director, said.

NAGPUR: An Indian-origin professor from Japan’s Keio University (KU) on Thursday proposed levying a new water and forest conservation tax on Nagpur city to compensate for the resources people are drawing from rural areas, especially the Pench corridor from where most of the drinking water requirement is fulfilled.

KU professor Rajib Shaw, who is part of a study report submitted to Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on environmental mitigations under India-Japan bilateral programme, said the model has been successfully implemented in Yokohama and other Japanese metro cities where urban dwellers are paying $10 per household for the last 13 years.

He was speaking to TOI on the sidelines of a round table conference held at VNIT’s Senate hall to conclude the India-Japan bilateral programme.

The professor said since the money comes from people, it is monitored by them too. “It is a transparent system though the prefecture government utilize the funds for conservation. A monitoring committee is part of the system to ensure proper utilization,” he said.

Shaw said that the measures have “made a big difference as the money collected was used for water conservation, tree plantation, groundwater and other such measures”. “The soil condition where the measure were taken has improved. However, during our study and visits to Pench, we found the water level has gone very deep while it was healthy just five years ago,” he said.

The professor from KU’s graduate school of media, governance and policy management said a citizens’ forum having NGO and VNIT experts can ensure proper utilization of the money if such a tax is implemented here.

“In India forests are cut but in Japan the forests are owned by individuals. If I have my own forest, the government can’t cut,” said Shaw.

“53% of forests outside cities are owned by private individuals as a result of the urban funding. We know if we maintain the forest, it will have water for urban dwellers,” said Shaw.

When the water level comes down there is disruption and disaster, according to Shaw. “The impacts can be seen in Nagpur which was forced to supply water on alternate days,” he said.

Tirupati: Three girls attempted suicide by consuming overdose of sleeping pills in Anantapur district on Thursday unable to bear the harassment of their Facebook friend from whom they had borrowed money.

The girls were found in a state of unconsciousness at the local bus station in Anantapur. The police shifted them to hospital where they are recovering. The accused Facebook friend was later arrested by the police.

The police said the girls, who are classmates, hail from Dharmavaram town in Anantapur district.

The victims told the police that they had decided to end lives unable to bear the harassment of their Facebook friend, whom they have identified as Mahesh. Incidentally, Mahesh also hails from Dharmavaram.

Dharmavaram police inspector Asrar Basha told TOI that one of the girls, Navya Sri, developed contacts with Mahesh. The girl and Mahesh used to chat on social media quite often.

A few months ago, the girl introduced her friend to Mahesh, who reportedly borrowed Rs 20,000 from him. Later, when she learnt that Mahesh was developing friendship with other girls too, she distanced herself from him. She also blocked him on social networking sites.

After their friendship turned sour, Mahesh demanded his money back from the first girl’s friend. Meanwhile, another girl and a common friend of the first two girls, also came in contact with Mahesh. When the girls expressed their inability to immediately pay him, Mahesh allegedly began harassing them. A couple of days ago, he allegedly spread rumours against the three girls in an attempt to put their character in bad light.

After deciding to end their lives, they bought sleeping pills and reached the bus station in Anantapur. After consuming the pills they became unconscious. Timely intervention of the local police saved their lives. Dharmavaram police registered a case against Mahesh and took him into custody. Further investigation is on.

382,['10/01/2020'],Vijai Sardesai slams red tape for slow bioremediation work,"This story is from January 10, 2020

The third dry waste baling machine was inaugurated at Sonsoddo

MARGAO: Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai on Thursday expressed his displeasure over the tardy pace of the bioremediation exercise at Sonsoddo and blamed it on the inefficiency of bureaucracy.

“We have five months to go (before the monsoon). One month is already wasted. It’s very unfortunate that a lot of red tapism is going on. Meetings after meetings are being held, but effectively, nothing much is happening,” Sardesai said. He was speaking after inaugurating the third dry waste baling machine at Sonsoddo, Margao’s fifth such machine. CCTV cameras installed at Sonsoddo were also commissioned by Sardesai on Thursday.

While a gate has been installed to regulate access to the site, the work of fencing the area will also begin soon, it was informed. Hoping that unauthorised dumping of waste will now come to an end, Sardesai voiced his suspicion over the existence of a waste disposal ‘racket’ at Sonsoddo by five-star hotels in South Goa.

“There are unanswered questions as to where the waste churned out by all the five-star hotels is going. I think there’s a big racket going on. Hopefully that racket will now stop. Everybody has to keep an eye on this,” Sardesai told reporters.

With the third dry-waste baling machine made operational at Sonsoddo on Thursday, and two more machines already functioning behind the Margao municipality, the Margao Municipal Council (MMC) has succeeded in bringing about a semblance of order in processing the incoming waste generated daily by the city.

MMC’s chief officer Ajit Panchwadkar said that a sixth baling machine will be installed soon. “Our objective is to ensure that the entire dry waste generated in the town is treated the same day,” he said.

Stressing the need for MMC to identify land for temporary storage of residual waste from the bioremediation at Sonsoddo, Sardesai said that the parking lot in the old market could be utilised for the disposal of the inerts, like construction rubble. The bioremediation process of the 2,35,000 tonnes of legacy garbage began in December and is expected to take three years to complete.

NEW DELHI: More number of crimes against women was reported in the national capital in 2018 compared with the previous year. Delhi Police registered 13,640 cases of crime against women , which was almost 4.7% more than the 2017 figures.

As per NCRB data, as many as 1,215 cases of rape were registered in 2018 compared with 1,168 cases of rape in 2017. Delhi also reported more cases of crime against women per one lakh population in 2018 as compared to other metropolitan cities, with 149.6 cases being registered per lakh population.

Trichy: Hinting that cinema is responsible for most of the sexual harassment incidents against women in the society, Tamil film director and script writer Lenin Bharathi has said that very few movies speak about societal issues.

He was addressing a students’ gathering at Holy Cross College (HCC) in Trichy on Thursday on ‘social media and women related issues’ as part of a two-day international conference on ‘Social media: Issues and challenges’.

Speaking on the negative portrayal of women in movies, he asked young women to stop enjoying their negative projection onscreen and watch movies with self-respect. They should not hesitate to boycott a movie if it doesn’t do justice in terms of gender equality.

Saying that women are the most under-privileged section in the society even in the present era, he asked them to be conscious and leave movies in the cinemas. Most of the movies are keeping people in imaginary dream world away from societal reality, he said.

We may think that cinema may not impact our imagination, but it affects our thought process and even develop complex among many who are obese, bald or even dark skin, he said.

Social media platforms lack basic ethics and operate with the basic objective of keeping people engaged by making trivial incidents. Make effective use of your time instead of falling victim to online media, which is feeding information every minute.

Udhagamandalam: The erratic rainfall pattern in 2019 has delayed the onset of winter season in the Nilgiris. While monsoon showers were scarce until July in the last year, the hill retreat received heavy rain in August, September and October. And the rainfall recorded was more than the double the district received in the corresponding months in 2018.

The rainfall was, however, not proportional across the district. Some locations recorded heavy rain, while the intensity was low in other places. According to horticulture department officials, the unusual heavy downpour during the three months has delayed the onset of winter season.

However, the delayed winter season has benefitted the tea plantations as they won’t be affected by frost. Normally, temperature would dip to 2Celsius to 3Celsius in December and the first week of January. But the minimum temperature registered in the past three weeks in Ooty was 7Celsius. The temperature had on Wednesday night dipped to 2Celsius, the lowest till date.

Shiva Subramaniam Samraj, joint director, horticulture department, told TOI, “The rainfall pattern was very erratic last year. The southwest monsoon was a failure, but the months of August, September and October recorded around 100% more rain than the corresponding months in 2018.”

Pointing out that the rainfall was location-specific in the district in 2019, the official said, “While Avalanche received more than 800mm rainfall on August 8, Ooty and surroundings recorded only 70mm-90mm. Most of the agriculture fields in low-lying areas were severely affected due to floods, which also claimed human lives.”

According to him, the district last year missed the autumn season, when tourist inflow is usually high. “The extended rain till October has ultimately affected the winter season. There has been no report of frost in the district till date this year,” Samraj said.

He said the frost-free December had benefitted the small tea farmers who realized a good yield.

Viswanathan, president, Nilgiris Farmers’ Association, said, “Vegetable growers faced a huge loss owing to the heavy rains in August and September last year. Most of the fields with standing crops were damaged. However, the delayed winter has now helped the tea gardens.”

He, however, said the district could expect severe winter anytime till February 15.

SALEM: A 31-year-old woman, neck deep in debt left behind by her husband who committed suicide seven months ago, sold her hair to feed her children.

On Friday last, Prema, widow of Selvam had run out of the last penny she had. With three children, aged five, three and two years, by her side in hunger, Prema approached every person she knew seeking money. But none of her neighbours or relatives would part with cash on a Friday, an auspicious day.

That’s when a man passed through her street in Ponnamapet offering to buy hair to make wigs. Without a moment’s thought, Prema rushed inside her hut, chopped off her hair and sold it for Rs 150 with which she bought food for Rs 100. Then she went to a shop and asked for a bottle of insecticide. The shopkeeper sensed something amiss and refused to sell her.

“She then attempted to consume poisonous arali seeds (nerium oleander). Fortunately, her sister stopped her from consuming it,’’ said G Bala, a graphic designer who posted Prema’s plight on social media and eventually helped her crowd fund financial support.

Prema and her late husband Selvam were working as daily wagers in a brick kiln. Selvam wanted to set up a small business of his own and borrowed money to the tune of Rs 2.5 lakh. But he was cheated by people and eventually the family slipped into deep penury forcing him to commit suicide. Shattered by husband’s death, hounded by those who lent money and saddened by suffering of children, she decided to end life.

A week later, now Prema is a new woman. Thanks to Bala’s post, several good Samaritans offered help and she managed to collect Rs 1.45 lakh. On Thursday, the Salem district administration also sanctioned her monthly widow pension. Bala’s friend Prabhu who runs a brick kiln has also given her a job.

So regained confidence so much so that she asked Bala to remove his Facebook post seeking help for her. “I am so overwhelmed by the support of people. I will never even think of committing suicide again. I want to give a good education to my children and take them out of this penury,’’ says Prema.

What changed her was not just the help that poured in but Bala’s advise too, as they were not just textbook motivational speech but his own life experience strikingly similar to that of Prema. When he was a child Bala’s family too was in penury and his mother once attempted suicide. “One day we never had any money left for food. My mother sold all the old newspapers and with Rs 4 she got, bought rice and cooked it for us. Soon after she tried to commit suicide, but relatives saved her,’’ recalled Bala.

“I told Prema that if my mother had died that day she wouldn’t be here now to go around in her son’s car,’’ Bala said.

Representative image

PUNE: The city police have booked sitting MLC Anil Bhosale and 15 other office-bearers of Shivajirao Bhosale Cooperative Bank Limited here for an alleged economic fraud of Rs71.78 crore involving the bank’s funds.

Bhosale is the chairman of the bank. His wife Reshma, a sitting corporator, and the bank’s chief executive officer Tanaji Dattu Padwal are among those booked for the offence.

The fraud is suspected to have been committed during the financial year 2018-19 and came to the fore during an audit by a statutory auditor assigned in May last year by the Reserve Bank of India.

“All 16 office-bearers face charges of misappropriating Rs71.78 crore by way of fudging entries in the bank’s cash balance records and siphoning off the amount to some other account for their personal benefit,” deputy commissioner of police (economic offences wing) Sambhaji Kadam told TOI.

“The RBI has been monitoring the bank’s functioning and has appointed an administrator to look into its daily affairs. We have kept open the option of arresting those booked at an appropriate time during our probe,” Kadam said.

The case has been transferred to the economic offences wing for investigation after chartered accountant and statutory auditor Yogesh Rajgopal Lakade lodged a formal FIR with the Shivajinagar police on Wednesday night.

When contacted, Anil Bhosale told TOI, “We will give all replies to the investigating agencies and whoever calls us for any inquiry in relation to the complaint that formed the basis for the FIR against us.”

On whether he would contest his or any of the other office-bearers’ involvement in the matter, Bhosale insisted that all answers will be given to the relevant investigating authorities.

TOI on Thursday visited the bank’s head office in Shivajinagar but found it closed. Some officials sitting nearby refused to comment.

Lakade has stated in the FIR that an RBI-appointed scrutiny panel had told the bank’s head office to provide the cash records for verification, but the latter failed to act on it. The scrutiny panel had come across certain discrepancies in the bank’s cash register and the computer system and the bank was unable to explain it properly, the FIR stated.

Consequently, on May 16, 2019, the RBI assigned Lakade’s statutory auditor firm, Torvi Pethe and Company, to conduct an audit of the cash records of the bank’s head office and all other branches, the FIR added.

The audit revealed a shortfall of Rs71.78 crore funds in the cash register of the bank’s head office, the FIR said, adding that the auditor intimated it to the office of the district special auditor in the state department of cooperatives.

A special supplementary audit was conducted in November last year, following which the district special auditor authorised Lakade’s firm on November 14, 2019, to register a case, the FIR stated.

Mihir Thatte of Punekar Nagarik Kruti Samiti and a few other account holders of the bank told TOI, “We have reasons to believe that the amount of misappropriation is more than what has been mentioned in the complaint. We will fight against the alleged corrupt activity and will knock on the doors of the state government, seeking justice for all depositors of the bank.”

For now, the police have invoked offences under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 408 (criminal breach of trust by clerk or servant), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery), 471 (using as genuine a forged) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code against the 16 office bearers.

A senior police officer told TOI, “As the amount of the fraud may increase during the course of investigation, we have decided to employ the services of a forensic auditor to establish the money trail.”

At 10.2 degrees celsius, the city recorded the season’s lowest minimum temperature as against 16 degrees celsius on Wednesday. The previous lowest temperature was recorded on January 1 at 10.3 degree Celsius.

The minimum temperature rose to 14 degrees celsius on Tuesday and 16 degrees celsius on Wednesday. On Wednesday and Thursday, Nashik recorded maximum temperature of 26.5 and 25.4 degrees celsius respectively. “It was warm throughout Wednesday but it suddenly became cold on Thursday. I had put away my woollens for the past two three days but took them out again as it got cold,” said Bhusan Gavande, a resident of Nashik.

The district’sNiphad taluka, which is known as the grape-growing belt, recorded the season’s lowest temperature at 8 degrees celsius on Thursday. According to the Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth, Rahuri, this is the lowest temperature recorded in Niphad this season as against the previous lowest temperature of 9 degrees celsius on Sunday. “Rainfall continued till the end of October this year leading to humidity in the soil. There have also been variations in the climate: Sometimes it is cloudy and sometimes it is dry. This is why minimum temperature has been fluctuating,” said an official from the weather station of Mahatma of the Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth.

The drop in temperature, meanwhile, has led to concerns that grapes may be affected. “The minimum temperature was in the range of 10 to 12 degree celsius for the past few days, but it suddenly became cold on Thursday. The fruit may crack if the temperature goes below 5 degrees celsius. Low temperature also affects the growth of the fruit,” said cultivator Arvind Bhosle. Meanwhile, Jalgaon city recorded minimum and maximum temperature at 13.6 degree celsius and 25.5 degree celsius, respectively.

PUNE: Over 20,000 housing societies in the state, especially in the city, Mumbai, Thane and Nashik , granted collector’s land have been given the leeway of leasing it out without fresh permission.The Sena-NCP-Cong government issued an order in this regard on January 7 to reduce bureaucratic delays, clear confusion among residents of such housing societies and allow short-term lease of land without any fee and fresh permission. A senior revenue official, however, said the leave and licence agreements would have to be registered with the registration department.“There was confusion among these housing societies on the registration of lease agreements and sale of land. So, we decided to clear the confusion and ease the trouble of society members making rounds of the office of the collector concerned,” he said.Collector’s land was granted to various housing societies across the state between 1960 and 70. Many were using it as amenity space, while some constructed structures on it.Last year, the erstwhile cabinet had cleared the proposal to convert the collector’s land to freehold land against a premium — 15% of the ready reckoner rate. Now, the present government has given its nod to lease out collector’s land without fresh permission.Housing society federations’ members feel the move would give them relief from visiting the office of the collector concerned to seek permission every time the lease term got over.Suhas Patwardhan, who represents the housing federation in the state and the district, said easing the rules would benefit these societies. “It will ensure that they can lease out the land without any further permission as well as ensure lease agreements,” he said. Many old housing societies would benefit from the new initiative, he added.President of Real Estate Agents Sachin Shingavi said with no additional fee being charged for permission to lease out land, housing societies would take the necessary steps to register the lease agreements with the registration department. “It is a win-win situation for citizens from these housing societies as well as the government,” he said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73182932,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-125590,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hsg-societies-can-lease-out-collector-land-sans-fresh-nod/articleshow/73179765.cms

Zafar Ali wil be handed over to the special cell of Delhi police

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) on Thursday nabbed an alleged operative of international militant group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) from Gorva area of Vadodara city. The ATS officials said that he had come to Gujarat to radicalise youths in Jambusar in Bharuch and establish an ISIS module locally.

According to official statement by Gujarat ATS, the alleged ISIS operative has been identified as Zafar Ali Mohammed Haliq, a 25-year-old resident of Cuddalore district in Tamil Nadu. He was nabbed from Panchvati circle in Gorva in a joint operation of the ATS and Vadodara police.

Officials said that fake IDs were found on Ali. ""The fake IDs name him as Abdul Rahim,"" said an ATS official who, however, conceded that no material linking him to ISIS or weapon was found on the suspect.

Zafar Ali had come to Vadodara from Cuddalore to attempt to establish new module of ISIS in the state. He is alleged to be in touch with three alleged ISIS operatives who were held by special cell of Delhi police on Thursday. Zafar Ali was also involved in setting up a module in Tamil Nadu, said ATS officials.

The Gujarat ATS action followed an intelligence input by sister agencies that six Tamil Nadu residents, wanted in serious crimes like murders, had absconded from their respective native places.

“The intelligence inputs indicated that the six absconding men were talking about conducting Jihadi activities at some unknown place. They were inspired by the ISIS and were Islamic extremists. There was a high probability that they could plan terror activity in the country,” said the ATS statement.

Following this, Gujarat ATS officials activated their network in different places and found that one such person was hiding in Vadodara. On the basis of specific inputs, a team of Gujarat ATS and Vadodara police traced at Gorva in Vadodara and nabbed him.

Zafar Ali would be handed over to the special cell of Delhi police for further legal procedure.

The state also ranks fifth in terms of overall human trafficking cases in India.The NCRB data reveals that AP has a poor record in terms of disposing cases of human trafficking. The conviction rate stands at only 11.4%. Overall, the state saw 367 people being trafficked during 2018. Of them, 266 are women. The state accounts for 9.7% of India’s human trafficking crime. Interestingly, Telangana accounts for 9.8% of the country’s human trafficking offences.The data has vindicated many studies conducted by NGOs that showed how human traffickers walk scot free in the state. Only 48 people have been convicted while 484 accused were acquitted. Overall, Andhra Pradesh saw around 2.2% increase in crime rate in 2018 compared to 2017.

Conversely in 2017 NCRB data which was released in October, 2018 shows the state accounting or 4.3% of the overall crime rate in India.Andhra Pradesh continues to perform in a dismal manner in terms of crimes against SCs and STs. It ranks 5th in the country and No. 1 in South India when it comes to poor conviction rate.The state saw a healthy 8% decrease in crimes against senior citizens. However, it continues to account for 6.9% of the crimes against senior citizens in the country.The crime against women also saw a marginal five percent increase.

404,['10/01/2020'],Scada meter project hits a roadblock,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd’s (NMSCDCL) plan to install water meters in all households and commercial establishments in the city have apparently hit a roadblock .

While corporators are insisting that installation of the water meters should be carried out simultaneously across the city, the NMSCDCL wants to undertake the project in phases.

“Around 50% of the total water meters are defunct. We want to replace these existing meters with new Scada metres, but the project is yet to be worked out. We are currently issuing average water tax bills to the residents,” an NMC official said.

The corporators, however, are opposing the NMSCDCL’s plan. Mayor Satish Kulkarni, who is also the director of NMSCDCL, said the issue will be discussed during the upcoming board meeting of NMSCDCL.

There are around 1.85 lakh water connections in the city. “It is wrong if 50% of the total water meters are lying defunct in the city. It is a loss to both Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) and water tax payers. I will soon hold a meeting with the officials from the water supply department on the issue and take proper measures in this regard,” Kulkarni said.

“Last month was my first meeting of the smart city board after taking over as its director, but it was adjourned. The next meeting will be held by the end of this month during which will take up the issue of Scada water meter project,” he added.

Last year in July, the NMSCDCL had cancelled the tender process for the Rs 300 crore Scada (Supervisory control and data acquisition) water meter project after allegations that the installation process was purposely being carried out in phases to benefit some contractors.

BJP leaders and some directors of smart city had alleged financial irregularities in Scada water metre project and had also strongly criticised the smart city officials.

Following this, NMSCDCL chairman Kunte had directed the smart city officials to cancel the tender process. The new water meters are to be replaced with the existing ones at homes, hotels and other commercial establishments.

The total network of water pipeline in the city is of 2,100-km. Currently, the non-revenue water (NRW) losses owing to water leakages and theft is around 45% of the total supply.

The Scada project will monior water supply from start point (water filtration plant) to end users (consumers). As part of this, the existing meters are to be replaced with Scada metre. The objective of the Scada water meter project was to keep a check on non-revenue water.

PANAJI: Calling chief minister Pramod Sawant “a failure on all fronts”, a united front of all opposition parties, including Congress, GFP, MGP and Shiv Sena on Thursday said he should resign, taking responsibility for the death of four tigers in Goa’s forest in Sattari taluka. “It is our apprehension that the killings could be a conspiracy to eventually change the status of the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary and to use the land for other purposes,” said the opposition parties that have come together to organise a movement called ‘Save Mhadei, Save Goa’, to agitate against the diversion of the Mhadei’s water to Karnataka .

“The central government committee, which has been formed to investigate deaths of the four tigers, should also nail those who failed to protect the tigers. What were the CM and the principal conservator of forests doing? It is their job,” said Hrudaynath Shirodkar of the Progressive Front of Goa. “The government now wants to relocate forest dwellers from the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, stating that it has caused the man-animal conflict and led to the poisoning of the tigers. But the government refuses to stop hosting Sunburn in Goa inspite of three deaths. The government is only hitting at the disadvantaged,” he remarked.

Narayan Sawant of MGP said that the government first misled the people of Goa on the diversion of Mhadei water to Karnataka, and now has failed to protect the state’s wildlife.“We have not just lost our Mhadei, but also her children, the tigers. It is a conspiracy to finish off the existence of the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary. If there is no wildlife, there will be no sanctuary. Tomorrow we may hear of the CM having an interest in land in the sanctuary area,” said Ravi Harmalkar of the voluntary organisation ‘Yuva Goa’.

He said the forest-dwellers were illiterate and may not be aware of the importance of certain wildlife to the ecology. “Forest officials have failed in counselling them appropriately,” he added.The front also demanded that a body of Goa’s wildlife conservationists be formed to save any further damage to the state’s wildlife.

Representative image

PUNE: Defence lawyer Sushilkumar Pise argued on Thursday that there was no strong evidence against Anuradha Purandare, sister-in-law of jailed developer DS Kulkarni (DSK) and a co-accused in the alleged Rs 2,091.11-crore economic fraud by the DSK group, to justify her detention in custody.

Pise, while arguing for Purandare’s bail before special MPID judge Jayant Raje, submitted that his client had been arraigned in the case merely on account of her being the sister of DSK’s wife. This is Purandare’s first bail plea after the filing of chargesheet in the case.

Among other things, Pise argued for bail on the grounds of parity with DSK’s chartered accountant and statutory auditor who has been granted bail on a previous occasion. Besides, he cited the applicant’s old age and her ailing husband’s health condition as grounds for bail.

In a related development, lawyer Rohan Nahar, who is appearing for DSK’s chief engineer Rajiv Newaskar, furnished an application seeking the court’s direction to the authorities to furnish copies of all the documents, which police have submitted with the chargesheet, to enable him argue his client’s case for a discharge from the case.

In Purandare’s case, special public prosecutor Pravin Chavan has already submitted a 30-page written submission opposing her bail plea, stating that she may influence witnesses and tamper with evidence if released on bail.

Pise, however, submitted that the charge under Section 409 (criminal breach of trust by banker, merchant or agent), a non-bailable offence, was not applicable in her case as she did not accept any money and was merely a partner in two of the eight partnership firms floated by DSK, till 2015. In the Phursungi land deal, Pise said the prosecution was yet to furnish to the court any power of attorney claimed to have been executed in her favour for making transactions.

Next hearing in the case is on January 20.

407,['10/01/2020'],Pune: Biomedical waste along rivers challenges ploggers,"This story is from January 10, 2020

PUNE: Citizens and ploggers involved in clean-up drives across different stretches of rivers in the city have said the biggest challenge is the amount of biomedical waste dumped along the rivers.

Vivek Gurav, who started the movement Pune Ploggers, which undertakes clean-up drives every weekend across different river stretches across the city, said it was a chronic problem.

“We find a range of biomedical waste freely dumped along the riverbanks. We have approached different Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) departments about the waste and sought advice on how to go about disposing this waste. They took it from us at the time and said they would take care of it. However, we are still unsure as to how to go about disposing the biomedical waste,” he said.

He said they had spotted such waste at different spots across the city. “We have found it near Bhide Bridge along the Mutha river. We discovered syringes, two packets of needles and many test tubes containing blood samples,” he added.

Fellow plogger and student Bhushan More (19) said, “I discovered the bag of needles dumped along the Mutha river banks. We have no idea how to clear this.” He added that they came across this kind of waste quite often during plogging sessions.

Shailaja Deshpande , founder director of Jeevitnadi, which conducts river clean-up drives across the city, also said they had discovered such waste along the rivers mostly near crematoriums.

“We found a lot of such biomedical waste usually near the crematoriums along the river banks. We not only find biomedical waste, but bedsheets, mattress and pillows dumped along the banks. As far as biomedical waste is concerned, we generally find syringes, adult diapers, medicines, pads and injection bottles,” Deshpande said.

Dnyaneshwar Molak, head of the civic body’s solid waste department said they tried to clear biomedical waste at source.

“The PMC’s biomedical waste collection entails a system where we collect biomedical waste from each hospital. If there is such waste dumped along the river sides, we will try and carry out an enquiry on the sites where it is found and take action,” he said.

Erode/Tirupur: Ration card holders were made to wait in long queues for hours to collect Pongal gift hampers in many places in Erode on Thursday.

Erode district administration said the state government had allocated Rs 71 crore to provide the Pongal gift hampers to 6.8 lakh card holders. The gift hampers comprise Rs 1,000, 1kg raw rice, 1kg sugar, a 2ft sugarcane, 20g of cashew nuts and kismis each, 5g of cardamom and free dhoti and sari.

The authorities had earlier announced the plans to distribute the gift hampers on Thursday between 9am and 6pm in all the ration shops. However, in many shops, the card holders stood in queues since early morning to collect the same.

While ministers K A Sengottaiyan (school education) and K C Karuppanan (environment) inaugurated the scheme, AIADMK functionaries led the proceedings in shops in their respective areas. In many places they were late, forcing the people to wait in long queues for many hours. For instance, the card holders were standing in the queue since 5am in a ration shop on Karupanna Gounder Street near the Erode MLA office. AIADMK functionary Manoharan, of Periyar Nagar, who was supposed to inaugurate the proceedings, reached there only by 11am, said K Prabhu, of Vasuki Street.

In a few shops, which caters to a large number of ration card holders, AIADMK cadres pitched in to distribute the gift hampers to the beneficiaries. Police protection was given to many shops, where the crowd was more.

In Tirupur, which was allotted Rs 96 crore to distribute the gift hampers to 7.2 lakh card holders, animal husbandry minister K Radhakrishnan had inaugurated the freebie scheme in a ration shop in Udumalpet on Sunday. But it was formally distributed only on Thursday.

JAIPUR: Two days after the murder of a mother-son duo in Jaipur’s Pratap Nagar area , the police are yet to arrest or even detain any suspect. The murdered woman’s husband remains on the police’s radar, but it appears that the cops have found no solid evidence against him.

Two persons were rounded up from Vaishali Nagar area and are being interrogated. However, the officials did not divulge anything. Sources told TOI, the husband, who is also the complainant in this case, is not cooperating much in the investigation. After the woman’s body was found in a bloodied state in her flat on Tuesday, police found her son’s body in a deserted area close to the residential complex where the family lived.

While the husband Rohit Tiwari has neither been officially detained nor arrested, the cops are keeping him under watch at the local police station. The brutal murders of his wife Shweta Tiwari and son Shreyam had sent shock waves across the city.

Rahul Jain, DCP East, Jaipur said, “We are talking to Rohit though obviously he is saying that he has no reason to kill his child. Through CCTV footage, we confirmed that he was at work at the time of the killings. We are looking at all possible leads to solve the case at the earliest.” Tiwari’s family also reached Jaipur on Thursday while the cremation of the murder victims was done in Kanpur by Shweta’s family.

Sources told TOI that Rohit was playing it smart and not cooperating in the investigation and an official on condition of anonymity said, “There are many things which he is not revealing and not cooperating as well. There are many suspicious aspects about his involvement in the murders. Since he is the complainant as well in the case, so we have to be very careful with the investigation.”

Rohit, a native of Delhi and an Indian Oil Corporation employee, had moved to the city two years ago with Shweta, a native of Kanpur. He was at work when their maid found her body in the living room on Tuesday and informed neighbours, who alerted cops.

Shreyam had been missing since then. On Wednesday afternoon, a police search party ultimately found the child’s body in the forest area just over the boundary wall of the residential complex where the family lived. Sources said the body was dumped there on Tuesday itself.

Kolhapur: The stand taken by revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat that he would not to take charge as district guardian minister of Kolhapur has once again revealed the cracks within Congress and Maha Vikas Aghadi partners.

Thorat, who is also state Congress chief, has expressed his unwillingness to take charge saying that he had made it clear long time back that he would not take responsibility of district guardian minister. Sources in Congress said that Thorat was surprised after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced list of district guardian ministers late on Wednesday night.

Thorat is scheduled to meet Thackeray over the issue and would prevail upon him to look for a new guardian minister for Kolhapur district. Congress leaders, however, said the post would remain with Congress at any cost.

Thorat’s appointment assumes significance due to tussle between Congress’s Satej Patil and NCP’s Hasan Mushrif over the post. Both were eager for the post and had exchanged duals overs the issue after formation of Thackeray government.

Patil and Mushrif have been kept away from their home district. Mushrif is guardian minister of Ahmednagar while Patil has been given responsibility of Bhandara. The move has, however, upset workers of both the parties.

Sources in Congress said the post has been given to Congress as it has six MLAs, while NCP has two. According to formula decided by ruling partners, post of guardian minister is to be given to the party which has more MLAs in the district.

NCP has chosen senior leaders to take care of crucial districts in western Maharashtra. Dilip Walse Patil is district guardian minister of Solapur district, where NCP suffered setbacks in the recent past. Balasaheb Patil will be in-charge of Satara district, where party bounced back despite defection of leaders like Udayanraje Bhosale and Shivendraraje Bhosale. Jayant Patil is new district guardian minister of Sangli, his hometown.

In western Maharashtra, Congress has been given charge of only Kolhapur district. Pune and Ahmednagar districts are also with NCP. Ajit Pawar and Hasan Mushrif, will be in-charge of Pune and Ahmednagar districts, respectively.

Nashik: Environmentalists in the city are opposed to the Godavari river front and beautification project, saying that the work cannot be done in red and blue lines of the river.

The Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (NMSCDCL) has undertaken the project at a cost of Rs 68 crore.

“The civic body had developed Goda Park, which has gone under water several times and the project is now almost ruined. Hence, developing the Godavari river front under smart city is nothing but waste of funds,” said Devang Jani, a senior environmentalist.

Jani said that he has sent a letter in this connection to the smart company chairman, Sitaram Kunte, and CEO Prakash Thavil, seeking their attention to his objection to the river beautification project.

The NMSCDCL had earlier planned to remove concrete from the Godavari riverbed to reduce the flood impact.

“Instead of de-concretisation of the riverbed, the smart city company has directly started beautification work on the stretch between Ramwadi bridge and Ahilyabai Holkar bridge,” said Jani.

Nishikant Pagar, another environmentalist, echoed Jani’s views and said that work on blue line cannot be undertaken. “The smart city company is misleading people. For instance, work on the smart road has been under way for two years, whereas the deadline was six months. Besides, the quality of the road is not up to the mark,” he alleged.

There were plans to revive 17 ancient kunds in the river. The NMSCDCL had also started the work last month, but had to halt it following opposition to de-concretisation and revival of the kunds in the riverbed of Godavari by some corporators.

Municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game said, “Every citizen has the right to oppose in our democracy. However, the Godavari river front and beautification project is to be done as per the norms and considering all the legal aspects.”

Last week, the Bombay high court appointed a special committee to tackle the Godavari pollution and directed the NMSCDCL CEO Thavil to conduct a survey before reviving natural springs in the river.

Objections have been raised against the works undertaken by the NMSCDCL in Goadavari riverbed.

Taking the cognizance of this, divisional commissioner Rajaram Mane, who is the chairman of the special committee on Godavari pollution, had directed the NMSCDCL CEO to submit a detailed report about the works during the committee’s next meeting.

Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Roy said “There’s absolutely no problem (in using the land). There are high court directions, we have to implement them. The MMC has the right to use the land. Bioremediation is going on and they have to take care of all the fractions. And all the responsible agencies are coming together for this,” Roy said.

The MMC has already identified 5,000 sq m of land at Ravanfond and a private land adjoining the Sonsoddo dump for temporary storage of the residual waste. However, due to objections from certain quarters, the land remained unutilised, hampering the pace of the bioremediation exercise.

“The by products of bioremediation are proven to be safe; and that’s the whole purpose of going in for bioremediation. While the RDF(refuse derived fuel) will be sent to cement factories for the generation of heat, the compost can be used for crops. It has been decided that the inerts will used for filling of land for highway work, a practice widely adopted throughout the country,” Roy said, adding that the Konkan Railway has also been asked to identify projects for which inerts could be used for land-filling.

Sources disclosed that the meeting also discussed identifying more parcels of land for the storage of RDF.

PUNE: When actor Shivaji Satam of CID-fame spoke in honour of his friend BP Singh, who was presented a distinguished award by Pune International Film Festival (PIFF) on Thursday, a member of the audience at Balgandharva Rangmandir yelled out a dialogue familiar to him by now. “Daya, darwaza tod do (Daya, break open the door)!” That’s how Satam, as ACP Pradyuman, often commanded his sidekick.

“No, not today,” Satam responded to peals of laughter from the crowd. He was also joined by his co-stars on the show Dayanand Shetty and Aditya Shrivastava.

Thursday evening was about recognition for long careers. As a tribute, the organizers have dedicated the festival to the late Shreeram Lagoo. During the inaugural function, the organizers also screened a tribute film to Lagoo.

The honoree list for the evening also included veteran actor Vikram Gokhale. “I have received many awards in my career but this award carries some emotional weight. I had a great relationship with Dr Lagoo. I have analysed his work for 40 years and a friendship developed. For so many years, I had discussed with him his performances and his books. I was never afraid of his reaction if I told him that I didn’t like a part of his work. His death was a personal loss to me,” Gokhale said in his address. He dedicated the award to his father the late actor Chandrakant Gokhale .

418,['10/01/2020'],Kamat tells govt to tackle fund crunch with austerity steps,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Porvorim: Given the economic slowdown and the decline in tax revenue, the state government needs to implement austerity measures and also cut down on unnecessary expenditure, former chief minister Digambar Kamat said here on Thursday.

Speaking at the function to celebrate Legislators’ Day, Kamat also said that MLAs and former MLAs need to discuss ways to improve the state’s finances.

“In such times, people look towards MLAs and former MLAs to bring the state out of a crisis. I feel that it is important for the state that all should be united to see what austerity measures can be taken. Today, it is important to see how unnecessary expenditure can be curbed,” said Kamat.

Kamat said that a global economic slowdown has put India’s and Goa’s economy in a crisis, and it would require a collective effort from not just the government and the MLAs, but former MLAs too to assist the state.

“A lot of the responsibility comes on the MLA, and even if you no longer an MLA, the role played by former MLAs is equally important. If you have been elected even once, you have to play the role of the guardian of society,” said Kamat.

Minister for panchayats Mauvin Godinho disagreed with Kamat about the state of India’s economy, but agreed that all need to work together to help the country and the state develop.

“We are still the fastest growing economy and I still say that India is still performing better than other countries. I am confident that India will become a $5trillion economy by 2026 because our fundamentals are right,” said Godinho.

Kamat also said that all parties, MLAs and former MLAs need to stand united on the Mhadei water diversion issue. “I think it is unanimous that under no circumstance can water from Mhadei be diverted,” the opposition leader said.

The other issues highlighted by Kamat included drugs and prostitution.

UDAIPUR: A government schoolteacher posted in a remote tribal block of Udaipur district was served show-cause notice by chief district education officer on Thursday for spreading an old message of the collector regarding holidays in schools.

Shivlal Damor, a teacher at the government primary school in Lakhumbara Fala in Jhadol block, posted a letter issued by the collector announcing closure of primary schools due to extreme cold conditions from January 9 to 12.

The letter also announced change of timings for the secondary classes and the new timing was said to be from 10.30 to 3.30 pm with immediate effect.

The letter was posted in the WhatsApp group 'Guruji-2' which had many members including head masters, teachers and staff of several government schools.

The letter created much confusion among the members and some of them who did not verify or carefully read the date mentioned in the letter, believed it to be true and were misled about the holidays.

When the authorities came to know of the post, they found that the collector’s letter was issued in 2019, when the schools were closed down for the same dates.

Bengaluru: The archbishop of Bangalore, Rev Peter Machado, on Thursday urged the Centre to have a dialogue with those opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

In a memorandum to the President and Prime Minister, the archbishop said: “We appeal to the central government to grant citizenship to illegal immigrants based on each individual case and not on the basis on religion. It is important that the government engages in a dialogue with those opposing the Act.”

Machado said he regretted “the polarization of people” over CAA on religious lines. He said students looking to study are unable to do so due to the current climate at universities in the country.

“In general, we have accepted the Act. We are only asking for a small correction and that is to not make a distinction on the basis of religion. Violence is not a solution when there is a difference of opinion. It is necessary for the government to enter into dialogue with those opposing the Act and come to an agreement about the way forward with justice, equity and fairness. There is no harm in backtracking and changing course if necessary,” he said in the memorandum.

He said the Act “will make it difficult for certain sections of the population to prove their citizenship”. “This includes the poor and women, who have traditionally moved place with marriage.”

Speaking about the participation of students in the protest, he stated that institutions are places where students ‘come to study’.

“I have requested the police commissioner to give minimum security to our institutions, at the outset,” he said. “Most students are reacting not to the Act itself, but to what happened in (other) universities. It is our duty to protect students and ensure they study well. At the same time, students are grown-ups, they have their own wisdom to react in the way they want to.”

Nashik: Byelections in two wards of the Nashik Municipal Corporation held on Thursday recorded a 34.03% turnout. The fate of 14 candidates, who contested from ward 22 (A) and 26 (A), will be decided on Friday when the results will be declared.

Election officials attributed the low voter turnout to possible ‘election fatigue’. “Voters were not so enthusiastic about the bypolls. There were Lok Sabha elections in April-May last year and then state assembly elections in October. Hence, there was little enthusiasm among the people to vote,” said an election official.

The counting of votes will begin on Friday morning at Nashik Road and Satpur divisions. While eight candidates were in the fray in ward 22, six contested ward 26. A total 520 employees were deployed on election duty. Of the 63,045 voters in both civic wards, 21,453 voters exercised their franchise. Of 30,165 voters in ward number 22, as many as 10,388 voters cast their votes recording a turnout of 34.44%. Of the 32,880 voters in ward number 26, only 11,065 voters exercised their franchise and the turnout stood at 34.03% in this civic ward.

Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) has fielded NCP candidate Jagdish Pawar from ward 22 (A) in Nashik division, while Shiv Sena’s Madhukar Jadhav is contesting from ward 26 (A) in Satpur division. In ward number 26 (A), MNS has fielded Dilip Datir while BJP’s Kailas Ahire contested this ward. MVA fielded Madhukar Jadhav from Shiv Sena.

The corporator’s post in ward 22 (A) fell vacant after BJP’s Saroj Ahire resigned and joined NCP to contest the state elections from Deolali assembly constituency. The election in ward 26 (A) was necessitated after Shiv Sena corporator Dilip Datir resigned and joined MNS to contest the Nashik West seat in the assembly elections.

Thiruvananthapuram: The Centre has once again cut the borrowing limit of Kerala, thus further smothering the state financially which is reeling under a severe fiscal strain , finance minister T M Thomas Isaac told reporters here on Thursday.

“The Union government, without citing specific reasons, had informed on Wednesday that the borrowing limits of the state has again been reduced. As per the budget estimates, the state was supposed to get Rs 24,915crore loan from the Centre during financial year 2019-20. Of this, the state was eligible for loan worth Rs 10,233crore during the last quarter of the current fiscal. The Union government, by the middle of the current financial year, had informed that the loan limit for the last quarter would be cut by Rs 5,325 crore,” Isaac said.

“But, as per the latest communication that reached us yesterday, the Union government says that Kerala would be eligible for only Rs 1,900crore. This simply means that the Union government has further cut the borrowing limit by Rs 3,000crore. When the state gets the Rs 1,900crore loan, we would need to pay back to Centre Rs 4,615crore by way of the principal and interest towards the loan the state had availed earlier,” he added.

The state government would urge the Centre to revise the unexpected changes in the borrowing limits and issuance of grants.

The state finance minister said that the government would try to manage the deepening financial crisis by resorting to some emergency management tactics, including deferred payment of bills from contractors and suppliers.

The minister, however, said that the twists and turns brought on by the Centre on the state’s finances wouldn’t have any significant impact on the next budget, which is only a few months away. “The government plans to face the current crisis by increasing revenue and curtailing expenses,” he added.

VIJAYAWADA: With the three-day harvest festival Sankranti approaching, the demand for traditional delicacies is on the rise. Despite massive discounts offered by wholesale traders, citizens say they prefer cooking their favourite festive sweets at home.

Sankranti is among the biggest festivals celebrated in the Andhra region. “Sankranti is a festival of giving thanks. Cooking food at home in large quantities and sharing it with neighbours is an age-old ritual during Sankranti,” said K Lakshmi Devi, a home maker from the city. “We prepare traditional dishes like Arisalu, kobbari burelu, chakralu, gorumittelu, gavvalu. Food is an important part of Sankranti celebrations,” she added.

Sweet stalls and home food centres in the city said the sales were poor this Sankranthi season. “We offer a variety of home foods and traditional sweets at an affordable price, but there is no response from the buyers,” said M Ravi Krishna , who runs a sweet shop in Governorpet.

A few sweet stalls have come up with the idea of ‘live kitchens’ which involves the the buyer in making their own sweets, with the help of an expert cook, at the sweet stall.

Meanwhile, the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) says it is looking to celebrate Sankranti on a grand note. VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh said that an inter-school cultural fest would be conducted at Tummalapalli Kalakshetram on January 10.

Bareilly: Traffic police has imposed a three-day restriction on the movement of traffic at the railway underpass near Izzatnagar area here due to the on-going construction work of the IVRI flyover.

According to traffic department officials, the commuters were allowed to use the underpass as the railways had, so far, not taken up the construction work of the flyover above the tracks.

However, with the construction of the railway overbridge (ROB) now being initiated, the traffic will remain suspended from 11am-5pm on January 11, 15 and 17, said officials, suggesting that the commuters going to Delapir could take Kudeshiya Phatak route.

Speaking to TOI, superintendent of police (traffic), Bareilly, Subhash Gangwar said, “Despite the construction of the flyover near the Central Jail trisection in Izzatnagar underway, the traffic movement was allowed partially in the area. Although a major portion of the project was completed by Uttar Pradesh State Bridge Corporation (UPSBC) Ltd, the portion above the railway tracks was yet to be constructed. And since the railways is undertaking the ROB construction, the traffic movement cannot be allowed in the area. The traffic will remain suspended from 11am till the evening on January 11, 15 and 17. Commuters going to Delapir are requested to take another route.”

“Motorists coming from Nainital road will be diverted towards Kudeshiya Phatak to reach Delapir,” added the SP.

The UPSBC had taken up the construction of nearly 700-metre-long flyover in Izzatnagar area around three years ago. The total cost of the project is Rs 38.23 crore, of which the f Bridge Corporation is paying Rs 28.85 crore and the railway’s contribution is around Rs 9.35 crore.

The flyover that will connect Izzatnagar (IVRI) to Nainital road will soon be thrown open to the traffic.

JAIPUR: The heinous murder case of a 34-year-old woman and her son took a new twist on Thursday when the husband of the deceased woman accused the police of harassing him. He has filed an application in the court of Metropolitan Magistrate number 30 against the cops for not conducting a fair investigation in the matter.

Responding to the application, the court has asked the station house officer (SHO) of Pratap Nagar to appear in the court on Friday with the case diary.

Advoate Deepak Chauhan appearing on behalf of Rohit Tiwari, husband of deceased woman Shweta Tiwari, alleged in a complaint filed in the court that Rohit had lodged an FIR on January 6 on the murder of his wife. “Police has not been investigating the case properly. The preliminary investigation did not brought any concrete evidence or clues still the police are unnecessarily taking the case in a direction where they can put the blame of murder on the deceased’s husband. We have requested the police to do a fair investigation, still nothing much is been done by the police in this regard,” said Chauhan.

The Supreme Court has stated in the case of Sakiri Basu that if the investigation officer does not conduct true and impartial investigation in a case, the complainant may appeal to the concerned magistrate for monitoring by presenting an application before the magistrate concerned.

The complainant says that his “constitutional and fundamental rights are being violated by the actions of the investigating police officer”, thus the court should monitor the investigation of the case. The complainant has requested the court to monitor the investigation and also summon the investigation officer with the case record.

The matter will be heard on Friday after the report is presented from the Pratap Nagar police station. A 35-year-old woman was found murdered at her residential apartment in Jaipur’s Pratap Nagar area on Tuesday. Her two-year-old son was also found murdered a day after on Wednesday.

435,['10/01/2020'],BJP made Delhi garbage capital: Arvind Kejriwal,"Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: Accusing BJP of making Delhi the “garbage capital of India” , chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday asked people to choose between the governance model of AAP and that of the municipal corporations being run by the saffron party for the last 15 years. Presenting a detailed report card of the three civic bodies vis-à-vis the performance of his own party’s government in Delhi, Kejriwal alleged that the corporations had failed in all fields, including education, healthcare and sanitation.The CM claimed that Delhi government schools and hospitals were doing far better than those runs by the corporations.“The strength of corporation schools has gone down by 2.5 lakh students in the last nine years. We still see students in around 100 schools sitting on the floor. Delhi government schools have better infrastructure than in private schools, with swimming pools, lifts and sports grounds,” Kejriwal said, while addressing a press conference at AAP’s headquarters.The CM cited a study to claim that 74% of students who had completed Class V from corporation schools couldn’t even read a simple text from their Hindi textbooks. On the other hand, he said, with a 95% pass percentage in Class XII, Delhi government schools had done even better than private schools (93%).Mincing no words on the performance of Delhi Police, Kejriwal said that while the force was capable, it got “orders from the top not to stop violence”. He also alleged that there was a 90% chance that the cops wouldn’t file a complaint in case of an emergency. Anil Mittal, additional PRO, Delhi Police, rubbished the allegations, stating that it was “absolutely incorrect” to say that the cops acted under any pressure whatsoever. “It is also incorrect to suggest that complaints are not registered at police station. In police stations, there is a well-established mechanism to address complainants,” he said.Kejriwal laid special focus on sanitation. “The biggest gift of BJP to Delhi is the waste mountain at Ghazipur, which is expected to cross the height of Taj Mahal,” he said, adding that only 40% of the garbage in Delhi was processed. AAP has promised to make Delhi the cleanest city in the world if re-elected. Kejriwal said nearly 90% of the toilets built by the corporations didn’t have water or power and had no security or maintenance staff. Delhi government’s DUSIB had built and ensured good maintenance of 20,000 community toilets, he added.Alleging large-scale irregularities, Kejriwal claimed that MCD had come to be known as an acronym for “Most Corrupt Department”, adding that even BJP’s Vijay Goel had accepted that the corporations were neck-deep in corruption. “The corporations have been under BJP for 15 years and it has done nothing to eliminate corruption,” Kejriwal said. “Delhi’s municipal corporations are the only local bodies in any major city to have failed to pay salaries to their staff. This despite the fact that Delhi government has increased its allocation to them by Rs 1,322 crore in the last five years — from Rs 3,345 crore in 2013-14 when Congress was in power, to Rs 4,667 crore in 2017-18,” he said.“Most of their dispensaries and hospitals are poorly maintained, with no availability of medicines, missing roof tiles, falling wall plasters, dirty corridors and toilets. In the last three years, the combined health budget of all three corporations has reduced by Rs 97 crore. On the other hand, Delhi government has added 450 new mohalla clinics and 26 polyclinics in the same period. The number of hospital beds has increased from 7,200 to nearly 10,000 and the construction of three new government hospitals is nearing completion,” Kejriwal said. The health budget in Delhi had increased from Rs 3,500 crore to Rs 7,500 crore in the last five years, he said.Referring to BJP’s promise that it would raise subsidy on water and power by five times, Kejriwal said: “BJP should provide it in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh first,” adding that Delhi had already decided to vote for AAP.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73181316,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-817834,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-made-delhi-garbage-capital-kejriwal/articleshow/73179856.cms

VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC), which is running around 4,200 special bus services in view of the Sankranti rush, is offering 40 per cent concession on ticket prices in routes where demand is less.

Though passengers need to pay an additional 50 per cent over and above the regular ticket prices for the special services, the demand is mostly for the onward journey, and the buses almost run empty while returning. The buses will run from Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru to various destinations in AP during the Sankranti festival.

Nagendra Prasad, APSRTC’s regional manager for Krishna district , said the demand will be mainly from Hyderabad and other cities to various destinations in the state, and from Andhra Pradesh to Hyderabad and other major cities after the festival. “So we have decided to offer 40 per cent discount to Hyderabad before festival and to various destinations from Hyderabad after the festival,” he said

“We have almost doubled our frequency for the festival. Advance reservation facility has also been opened for passengers planning their travel. The response is huge, as over 60 per cent of seats have already been booked. To ensure that people are not fleeced by private buses during the festival, we have arranged abundant number of buses this year to meet the demand before and after the festival,” Prasad said.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka said market sentiments have revived as oil prices cooled down due to no further escalations in the Middle East. “The US has offered to impose sanctions on Iran instead of military action.

While Lucknow overall got an encouraging 16th rank out of a total of 425 cities, it scored poorly in several aspects. The survey was conducted by a body hired by the ministry of housing and urban affairs (MOHUA). The city’s total score was 1,389.5 (75%) out of 1,836.5. However, LMC scored 156 (42%) marks out of 365 in garbage management. The score is significant because annual swachh survey begins on January 20.As per MOHUA data, LMC got 42 out of 100 marks in door to door garbage collection. This means that over 2.7L city households (45%) are still not covered under daily garbage collection. LMC has performed miserably with 18 out of 50 in sweeping and garbage management of markets and commercial places. In segregation of dry and wet waste, Lucknow scored 43 out of 125.In the ‘reduce, reuse and recycle’ category, city has got 18 out of 50.

PILIBHIT: Resentment is brewing among farmers in Pilibhit over arrears in payment for paddy crop worth Rs 71.38 crore, which accumulated due to the launch of a new central government system, of transferring payment for procured paddy to bank accounts of the respective farmers. With farmers going unpaid for over a month after the 72-hour deadline, the district vice-president of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), Manjit Singh, has sent a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath, demanding he expedite the payment so that farmers can invest in their next crop, which would be wheat, mustard or lentils.

He also warned that farmers would be compelled to agitate if their arrears were not cleared within a week.

Singh said of the eight agencies deployed by the government to purchase paddy in Pilibhit, barring the state food department, all seven were initially transferring payments via RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement), but after a government order dated December 23, they began transferring to farmers’ bank accounts via the Union government’s public financial management system (PFMS), which had already been adopted by the food department.

“The new system is sluggish due to multiple complications related to verification of farmers’ particulars. As a result, the outcome is huge arrears in paddy payments, leaving farmers in a liquidity crisis ahead of the Rabi crop season,” Singh said.

District food and marketing officer, Avinash Jha, said, “PFMS is a Union government financial portal to which all bank accounts across the country have been fed. After procuring paddy from a farmer, the transaction is locked online by the procurement center in-charge with his digital signature. Thereafter, the district food and marketing officer and the regional accounts officer has to independently verify the particulars of each farmer filed with his bank account, including land ownership revenue documents and registration with government website for paddy sale. Only then are details uploaded by the regional accounts officer on the PFMS for payment.”

“Payment is transferred to farmers’ bank accounts only after all their details match with those fed to PFMS. There are a lot of teething issues such as mismatch of spellings of farmers’ names, his status as first holder of bank account or incongruity in land ownership documents, which is delaying payment,” Jha said.

The Union government’s objective behind introducing PFMS from this season was to wipe out manipulations in payment transfer process, which had frequently been reported during the previous years, he explained.

He added that till January 8, the district had procured 3.70 lakh metric tonnes of paddy, valued at Rs 680.13 crore, of which the backlog of payment is around Rs 71.38 crore.

Some affected farmers, including Lakhwinder Singh of village Naurangabad , Gurpinder Singh of village Khamaria Patti, Ramesh Singh of village Dudhia Khurd and Om Prakash of village Tanda Chhatrapati, all under Puranpur tehsil, told TOI that their payment was held up since last week of November.

PUNE: ABVP activists on Thursday staged demonstrations near four educational institutions to protest the recent violence at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and approached the city police against what they claimed defamation of their union by rival student groups opposing the incident.

The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) members also took a dig at the Nationalist Congress Party ’s (NCP) student wing for the blackening of the board of the former’s office in Sadashiv Peth on Tuesday.

Around 40 ABVP members gathered near SP College to stage the protest, from where they proceeded to PVG’s College of Engineering, Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce on Ganeshkhind Road and finally near the Savitribai Phule Pune University ’s (SPPU) main gate.

They carried banners with messages such as #StopRedTerrorInJNU, #OpposeRedTerror and “JNU must be saved from fanatic violent left”. ABVP city secretary Anil Thombre said, “We should be careful on campuses and try to keep a tab on people brainwashing the students towards ideologies supporting Naxalism and Maoism.”

Shambhavi Sale, a second year BA-LLB student of Modern College of Arts, Science & Commerce, said, “Over 20 students supporting the ABVP were injured in the violence at JNU on Sunday night. Many of those students are still recuperating at AAIMS. I also want to tell the NCP supporters that the ideological tussle is between us and the left wing groups. I fail to understand why the NCP’s student wing is getting into it.”

The ABVP members on Wednesday night submitted a complaint application to the Deccan Gymkhana police station, claiming that their union was defamed during the protest marches carried out by the students of Fergusson College, Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) and SPPU and other youth groups.

Senior inspector of Deccan Gymkhana police Deepak Lagad said, “We have accepted the complaint application for further investigation.”

The ABVP’s complaint letter stated that many groups active on the social media were defaming the union by blaming its activists for the attack on the JNU students and teachers. An ABVP activist said the union would not tolerate action such as blackening of its office board.

“It is difficult to stop social media posts offending any organization. We would like to appeal to the people to not spread rumours,” a police officer said.

Bicholim: Villagers from Pale and Usgao, Bicholim, have raised concerns over the killing of fish using gelatin bombs in the Pale-Usgao river.

Locals have complained that unidentified persons have been detonating gelatin sticks in the Pale-Usgao river and surrounding rivulets, consequently destroying different species of fish, besides damaging the river banks and houses located near the river.

They believe the gelatin bombs are made in Usgao, Pale, Vaghurme, Vagus and surrounding areas.

“This type of fishing is banned and unethical. There are large numbers of blasts being perpetrated in broad daylight, by unknown persons, as a result of which different types of species of aquatic life in the river are killed. It also damages the river banks,” said Prakash Naik from Usgao.

Dinesh Volvoikar from Pale told TOI that the government was not initiating any action, despite the blasts being set off during the day.

“We demand that the authorities, especially the marine police, investigate the matter and take stern action against the guilty,” he said.

NEW DELHI: If Congress comes to power, it will provide slum dwellers 25-square-metre flats in multistorey buildings as part of in situ development of slum clusters in the capital, Delhi Congress president Subhash Chopra said on Thursday. BJP has already promised ‘Jahaan Jhuggi Wahan Makaan ’.

Chopra said Congress would replicate the Kalkaji model to relocate the people without demolishing any slum cluster. He was referring to the in-situ slum redevelopment project of Delhi Development Authority (DDA) in south Delhi’s Kalkaji A-14, where more than 3,000 families from three slums will be provided flats. Chopra said he had got the project started as its local MLA.

Pointing out that this will be one of the main promises in the Congress manifesto for the assembly elections, Chopra claimed “Congress fulfils what it promises” and the Kalkaji model, with various amenities such as schools, anganwadis, dispensaries and parks, was an example of it. Both BJP and AAP have betrayed slum dwellers across Delhi, he alleged.

Chief spokesperson Mukesh Sharma claimed Congress had always protected the interest of slum dwellers by providing all civic amenities. When the late Indira Gandhi was the Prime Minister, 46 resettlement colonies were set up in Delhi, he said.

Chopra asked why the Kalkaji flats, finished after a delay of three and a half years, were yet to be allotted. When Congress’ Ajay Maken was a Union minister, flats were also constructed at Katputhli Colony and Ashok Vihar, but these are yet to be allotted, Chopra said. But BJP and AAP are trying to take credit for these flats, he alleged.

Both Chopra and Sharma alleged that BJP and AAP were misleading over 40 lakh residents of the unauthorised colonies in the capital in the name of giving ownership rights.

PUNE: A group of 106 retired civil servants from across the country on Thursday put out an open letter to the citizens on the social media stating that the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ), National Register of Indian Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR) could not be delinked as per the government’s claim.

City-based former IPS officer Meeran Borwankar, who is among the signatories of the letter, told TOI on the group’s behalf that it was high time the government focused on issues to address poverty “rather than divide the country on the lines of castes and communities”. She said, “I foresee a lot of harassment for the poor and the marginalised through this exercise.”

The letter stated that the powers to include or exclude a person from the local register of Indian citizens “vested with the bureaucracy at a fairly junior level has the scope of carrying out the activity in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner”.

The group said NPR and NRC were “unnecessary and wasteful exercises”, which would “cause hardship to public at large and entail public expenditure that is better spent on schemes benefiting the poor and disadvantaged sections”. It expressed reservations about the constitutional validity of CAA’s provisions, which they said were “morally indefensible”.

“It (CAA) is a black act. The government is using the Act to create divisive politics. The National Register of Citizens (NRC) has created an atmosphere of fear in the country. The government is acting against the school of thoughts promoted by Mahatma Gandhi ,” said Sinha. He was in the city along with Congress leaders Prithviraj Chavan and Shatrughan Sinha as part of a 3,000km Gandhi Shanti Yatra from Mumbai to New Delhi launched on Wednesday in protest against CAA.

The Yatra will pass through states such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana and conclude at Raj Ghat in the national capital on January 30, the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. The Yatra is also taken out in demand for a judicial probe into the violence at JNU and scrapping of the NRC.

BENGALURU: Under-graduate students of Azim Premji University (APU) on Thursday staged a day-long protest to register their opposition to CAA and NRC and also express solidarity with their peers in Jawaharlal Nehru University, Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Milia University. The students returned to campus on Tuesday after a semester break. The protest inside the campus was out of bounds for media and outsiders.

“The violence unleashed on students of JMI, AMU and JNU show the paranoia, intolerance and the subsequent feeling of insecurity of oppressors as regards their vested interest in retaining the status quo,” a statement released by the students said. “The state’s explicit war against critical dissent does not stop with this and also gets expressed unsubtly in its continual efforts to penalise public universities such as the recent fee hike in JNU.”

Students demanded that the Delhi police drop all charges against students who protested peacefully and the unconditional release of Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan and Akhil Gogoi.

Students and faculty members shared experiences of their times in JNU, “which is contradictory to what is being portrayed by people who want to defame it”. “There were students who were in Delhi when the internet was cut off, some from Assam who have seen the chaos of NRC and detention centres for themselves. All of them narrated their experiences at the protest,” said a student who participated in the protest.

Students also ""condemned"" IT major Wipro, for assisting the government in implementing NRC in Assam.

""We appeal to the private sector not to partner with the state in its fascist projects by assisting its discriminatory schemes,"" said a statement signed by 120 students of APU. Wipro did not respond to TOI's request for a comment.

The APU is an arm of Azim Premji Foundation, established by Wipro’s founder-chairman Azim Premji.

The same procedure will be followed this year.

SUK had conferred around 50,000-degree certificates at the 54th convocation ceremony in 2018, while in 2019, at the 55th convocation ceremony, the university conferred degree certificates to in-house students only.

BAREILLY: In a sigh of relief to Bareilly police, gangster Salim, alias, Altaf, was nabbed within 15 hours after he escaped from their custody around 11.50pm on Wednesday.

Three policemen were taking him to Alwar when Salim, 55, jumped off the train as soon as he boarded it at Bareilly Junction railway station . The policemen chased him, but he disappeared in the dense fog.

Superintendent of police (city) Ravindra Kumar said on Thursday afternoon , they arrested him from Bareilly City railway station.

The SP said Salim was lodged for 18 months in a case of theft registered against him. “He has several cases such as theft, animal and vehicle lifting registered against him in various districts. Since he has been operating a gang, the Gangster Act was slapped on him. Salim was taken to Alwar on Wednesday to produce before a local court in connection with a case lodged there when he escaped from the custody,” said the SP.

It has been learnt that policemen — head constable Krishan Avtarn and two constables Dinesh Kumar and Rampal, who were escorting the gangster — had dinner and allegedly consumed alcohol with Salim before boarding Shramjivi Express from platform number two.

“An inquiry has been set up against the cops and appropriate action will be taken against them if found lax on their part,” said the SP.

According to police, as soon as the train arrived, the cops made Salim board a general compartment. He was handcuffed and a policeman was holding him with a rope. However, Salim jumped off the train from another door with handcuffs in his hands.

The SP said after the incident, police sounded high alert across the district and launched a massive manhunt for him.

“However, after fleeing, Salim reached City station to board a train when our team spotted and arrested him,” added the SP.

LUCKNOW: After Mandi Parishad registered a spike in its revenue, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said it should give 3% cess instead of existing 2% towards welfare of cows.

At the end of current financial year, Mandi Parishad is expected to give about Rs 60 crore for the upkeep and maintenance of stray cattle in cow shelters.

The CM has set a target of Rs 100 crore for the Parishad.

Minister of state (independent charge), agricultural marketing, Sriram Chauhan told TOI that in 2018-19, the total income of Mandi Parishad was Rs 1,346 crore and it paid Rs 26-27 crore as cess for cow welfare.

“This year, our income has already touched Rs 1,508 crore and is expected to touch Rs 2,000 crore by the end of this financial year,” he said.

Chauhan said the CM was of the view that a portion of the amount should be given to those institutions that run cow shelters with devotion while some money could also go to animal husbandry department.

“The CM said in view of volatile situation in the Middle East, the administration should take steps to check hoarding and black marketeering essential items. The CM said we should keep a check on prices of essential commodities. If oil prices are affected, we will have to ensure that there is minimum impact,” Chauhan said.

Yogi also directed officials to ensure that a lab for producing organic food is set up in Lucknow, Varanasi, Gorakhpur , Bundelkhand and west UP. These labs will be set up in Krishi Vigyan Kendras in every district.

Representative image

PILIBHIT: The Allahabad high court has given six weeks’ time to the Centre and to the UP government to frame and enforce the service rules for Special Tiger Protection Force (STPF) and to conclude all concerned proceedings by February 16. The Lucknow bench comprising justices Pankaj Kumar and Narendra Kumar Johari fixed final date in the matter to February 17.

The court directed the principal secretary of forest in UP to appear before it if the compliance with the court order was not ensured by the fixed date.

In absence of separate service rules for STPF in Uttar Pradesh , the policemen for this special force are sent on deputation from police or provincial armed constabulary (PAC) who are governed by their own service rules. This badly hampers the objective of tiger protection as well as the effective control on wildlife crimes.

The petition in the matter was filed by Lucknow-based lawyer Satish Kumar Mishra, in 2016. “It was the outcome of my petition that following the high court order, the first STPF comprising 112 cops had been constituted by the state government in 2017 for its deployment at Dudhwa Tiger Reserve (DTR),” the petitioner said.

The court had also been asked to issue directions to the state government to frame exclusive service rules for STPF with an aim to open the door for direct recruitment of cops for this special force and to keep them under the exclusive command and control of the forest authorities, he said.

As the government continued to seek time stating that efforts were on to wipe out legal complications from the way of framing rules in question during the previous about 18 hearings, the matter could not reach its final destination, Mishra said.

“Now the court has extended the last opportunity to the respondents to finalize the proceedings of service rules for STPF and to file the compliance report before the bench on February 17,” he said.

Meanwhile, the field director of DTR, Sanjay Kumar, who is one of the pleaders in court on behalf of the UP forest administration, said, “The new service rules will wipe out complications in governing the STPF in accordance with the actual needs of the forest department.”

“The newly recruited cops will be given proper training in forest and wildlife crime control matters in all aspects and the forest authorities will be free to bring them under the ambit of legal as well as the departmental action in case of any discrepancy on their part without depending upon any other department,” he said.

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD : Traffic diversions will be imposed at Bhakti Shakti Chowk on the Pune-Mumbai highway in Nigdi from Monday to facilitate construction of a grade separator and a flyover.

The ever-busy Bhakti Shakti Chowk, a gateway to Pimpri Chinchwad city from old Pune-Mumbai highway, is located at the intersection of Pune-Mumbai highway and Spine Road. The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has started the construction work of a grade separator and a rotary flyover at this chowk to ensure uninterrupted traffic flow.

The construction work had begun in the area two years ago, during which vehicles were allowed to the ply on the road with reduced carriageway width. This resulted in traffic snarls, particularly during the peak morning and evening hours, on both the sides of the highway and Spine Road.

Vijay Bhojane, spokesperson of the Bus Rapid Transit System cell, told TOI, “About 80% construction of the grade separator and the rotary flyover has been completed. Now, we need to dig the highway for the construction works. Therefore, vehicles will not be able to cross the junction from one side of Spine Road to another.”

The contractor for the projects has been told to to put up direction boards, radium strips, adequate lights and deploy 50 wardens to control traffic at the chowk when the construction work is in progress. The contractor will be entirely responsible if any accident takes place on the chowk, Bhojane added.

As per the traffic police, vehicles headed to Mumbai from Pune will have to take a left turn at Bhakti Shakti Chowk and go via Appughar through Transportnagar to reach Pune-Mumbai highway. “The vehicles coming from Pune to go to Triveninagar will have to take left turn at the chowk and go via Appughar through Transportnagar to reach Nigdi octroi post and go through PMPML bus terminus and take a left turn to reach Triveninagar,” a traffic officer said.

Similarly, motorists coming from Mumbai to Pune will have to take a left turn and go through PMPML bus terminus to reach Durganagar Chowk. “From there, they will be required to take a right from to reach Tilak Chowk on Pune-Mumbai highway to reach Khandoba Mall Chowk in Akurdi on Pune-Mumbai Highway,” he said.

When it comes to traffic heading to Chinchwad from Mumbai, motorists will have to take a left turn to arrive at Chicken Chowk. From there, they can reach Chinchwad via Durganagar and Tilak junctions. “Traffic going to Pune from Triveninagar, will have to go via Tilak Chowk,” the official added.

BAREILLY: There was a panic at the Regional Transport Office (RTO), located on Bareilly-Rampur road, in the afternoon on Thursday, after district magistrate (DM) Aunjaneya Kumar Singh came for a surprise inspection and found most officials missing in office. Sources said the raid was conducted after the DM received information about irregularities and unauthorised occupation of the office premises and campus by touts, and absenteeism of officials during day time.

Speaking to TOI, DM Aunjaneya Kumar Singh said, “Numerous complaints were pouring in about officials not being present at the RTO during working hours. Besides, there were other complaints pertaining to agents/touts entering the office premises, and of random people entering the office. Several complaints were being lodged by local residents who were being bothered by these “agents” present at the RTO, and therefore a surprise inspection was conducted. During the visit, it was found that only a handful of staff members and contractual employees were present in office, while most were missing.”

He added, “On inquiry, it was found that the passenger tax officer (PTO) was away on field inspection. But six clerks, who were supposed to be in office, were found missing. Several unauthorised people who were inside the premises managed to escape. The inspection continued for around 30 minutes. I’ve ordered one day’s salary to be deducted from those who were absent. One tout was caught from inside the office, and has been detained for enquiry. Strict warning has been issued to the officials to remain present during working hours and take up their responsibilities effectively.

Rampur assistant regional transport officer (ARTO), Arun Kumar, told TOI, “I’m also the office head and was present during the surprise visit by the Rampur DM. PTO Anita Verma was not in office as her work is mostly in the field. But legal action has been initiated against six clerks who were absent.”

Trying to explain the embarrassment, the ARTO pointed at the inconvenience faced by RTO employees, saying, “The current office, set up in a private building, is very small and has reached its maximum capacity . It always remains congested. We’ve requested the administration to relocate the office for the convenience of employees.”

464,['10/01/2020'],Medicos to get lessons in spirituality in UP,"Representative image

LUCKNOW: Amid complaints of misbehaviour of doctors and commercialisation of the medical profession, the medical education department has decided to run spirituality and morality classes for students in state-run medical colleges.The government is set to issue an order in this regard. The classes would be compulsory for all MBBS and PG students . Sources in the department said the government was planning an overhaul of medical education in the state.While life coaches and experts will be invited for moral and spiritual sermons to students to make them more sensitive, the cost of medical education is also expected to go down. The government aims to make it easier for students from humble economic backgrounds to study in the field.The first major step towards this is the setting up of 45 medical colleges in UP by 2023. Every second district will have a medical college by then to check brain drain from UP. Authorities feel that adequate availability of medical education institutions would check the shift of aspirants to highly commercialised private medical colleges and thus prevent young doctors from “turning into money-making machines”. Medical education minister Suresh Khanna, who also holds charge of finance and parliamentary affairs ministry, confirmed that his department would direct medical colleges, universities and research institutions to hold special classes on spirituality and morality to inculcate a sense of service among the young doctors.Khanna said he had already discussed the plan with principals of medical colleges and they had supported this.Initially, classes on spirituality would either be held in the morning assembly or the end of the day at 4pm for MBBS and PG students. Classes would be held once a week but periodicity could be increased later.“Senior faculty members of professor-rank would be assigned lectures on the significance of ethics and spirituality. Experts will also be invited,” said Khanna.The minister added that this was the most auspicious year to launch such a curriculum as 2020 was being celebrated as the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi , who embodied ethics and morality in life.Khanna also claimed that there was acute shortage of doctors in UP. There is a need of 2.2 lakh doctors as of now. Under WHO norms, there should be one doctor for 1,000 people. However, in UP, one doctor was for 3,700 people.This deficit, mainly in the government sector, was tempting medical practitioners to make money, he said. The solutions to these concerns was setting up more medical colleges and teaching ethics and spirituality, he said.Incidentally, in November, the Medical Council of India changed the syllabus for medical education nationally to include a component on attitude, ethics and communication to sensitise students.",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73181181,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-360347,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/medicos-to-get-lessons-in-spirituality-in-up/articleshow/73180282.cms

PUNE: The town planning scheme draft for Uruli-Phursungi faces a six-month delay as the Pune Municipal Corporation failed to complete its report till December 31, 2019, deadline.

The state government has now given the civic body time till July 2020 to finish the task.

Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials said the civic body had planned TP schemes at Uruli Devachi and Phursungi. They would be built on land measuring between 110 and 541 hectares. “The draft will show how these schemes will be implemented. The preparations were to be completed by 2019-end,” a civic official said.

After the deadline lapsed, PMC approached the state government for an extension, which was approved. The state has also told the PMC to get due approvals from key municipal committees. “The civic body had some limitations in working on the draft due to the election code of conduct during state polls,” Yuvraj Deshmukh, a senior official of the civic building permission department, said.

Kolhapur: The Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) has shut down over a dozen mutton shops across the district over the last 30 days for failing to comply with guidelines, said M S Kembalkar, assistant commissioner of the FDA ’s Kolhapur unit. He added that the licence of one mutton shop from the city was suspended while in Jaysingpur, the licences of nine shops have been cancelled. Four shops were shut down in Kagal last week due to non-compliance.

According to the FDA official, the action was taken under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. There are around 550 mutton shops across the district, while Kolhapur has over 150 shops. Kembalkar said the guidelines for meat shop owners include an elaborate list of dos and don’ts which are frequently overlooked.

“Meat shops near religious places and vegetable markets are strictly forbidden. According to the rules, meat sellers have to remain beyond a 50-metre radius of religious places. They must also ensure their shops are located at least 100 metres from the main gate of such places. Meat sellers cannot slaughter any animal inside a shop, and have to put up curtains or tinted glass so that the meat is not visible to the public.”

He further said that all people working at meat shops must obtain health certificates from government doctors. The meat will also have to be certified by authorised veterinarians. The FDA is the issuing authority for certificates in urban as well as rural areas. “Meat vendors have also been directed not to slaughter any ill, milch or pregnant animal. All the knives and other implements must be made of steel and there should be no trace of rust on them. Meat shops must have proper waste disposal arrangements and should keep a record of all meat purchased from slaughterhouses. Moreover, the fresh orders specify that meat can only be transported in insulated freezer vehicles from slaughterhouses and should be stored in refrigerators with transparent doors,” said Kembalkar.

“We are aware that this is an exhaustive list of guidelines, but meat shop owners need to comply with it. If, during an inspection, rules are found to be violated, the meat in the shop can be destroyed and the shop can lose its licence. A fine is also imposed,” he said.

CJI Bobde

NEW DELHI: The first-ever legal experiment to test the applicability of habeas corpus writ to locate an elephant failed as the Supreme Court on Thursday asked how such a writ, generally used to locate the whereabouts of a person in illegal detention, could be applied to animals.

CJI Bobde asked, “Is elephant a citizen of India? How does habeas corpus petition apply for animals? If we agree with your arguments, then a villager whose cattle is stolen by another can move the high court with a habeas corpus petition to recover his cattle from the illegal custody of others.”

Appearing before a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant, advocate Wills Mathews argued that since animals had right to life, as ruled by the SC while banning Jallikattu (bull running) on the ground of cruelty to animals, habeas corpus could be used by a mahout to locate elephant Laxmi.

Laxmi was in the news four months ago as Delhi Police on September 17 had claimed that they had arrested mahout Saddam, the petitioner before the SC, for allegedly stealing and hiding her. Saddam was released on bail by a Karkardooma court in east Delhi after spending 68 days in Mandoli jail.

Laxmi, allegedly recovered by police from Saddam, was sent to a rehabilitation centre. The SC asked the petitioner to move the HC where a custody battle over Laxmi is being fought.

Another group held a protest against the CAA, saying it seeks to divide people

BENGALURU: The Citizenship (Amendment) Act is ruffling feathers of legal eagles in the Karnataka high court. A day after the central government moved the Supreme Court requesting petitions against CAA in the high court be moved to the apex court, two groups of advocates on Thursday held separate demonstrations for and against the Act.

Pro-CAA advocates, under the banner Adhivakt Parishad, Karnataka, congregated in front of the main gate of the high court around 12.30 pm. They demanded immediate implementation of the new legislation — for which rules are yet to be notified. They waved placards and shouted slogans in support of CAA.

Senior advocate Vivek Reddy said a disinformation campaign is being spread against CAA by political parties and individuals. “The Congress and Communist parties, which till now did only lip service to the problems the country faces, are spreading falsehoods on CAA. We commend the Modi government for finding a solution to a 70-year-old problem.”

DP Prasanna, who was all praise for CAA, said the new legislation does not affect any Indian citizen, including Muslims. He said the law was brought in to protect persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh , who are living in India.

Around 4pm, another group of advocates assembled in front of Vidhana Soudha, voicing concern over the new legislation. They said it is discriminatory as it seeks to keep the Muslim community out. Waving the tricolour, the advocates held hands, stood facing Vidhana Soudha and formed a human chain between the two entrances of Namma Metro Vidhana Station on the high court side. The demonstration lasted an hour and ended with them singing the national anthem. Advocates Association, Bengaluru president AP Ranganatha was spotted among the evening protesters.

AS Ponnanna, senior advocate and former Additional Advocate General, who is against CAA, said the earlier definition was homogeneous, but the new legislation seeks to classify religious persecution and is opposed to secularism, the basic principle of the Constitution. He said when the state has no religion, any legislation that seeks to differentiate on the basis of religion goes against the concept of equality and secularism.

Firoze, who works as advocate clerk, said the government should provide jobs for all and stop dividing people.

Syed Ali Navaz, Khaja Moideen & Abdul Samad.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police ’s Special Cell on Thursday morning arrested three alleged Islamic State operatives from a north Delhi locality. The trio was identified as Khaja Moideen (52) and Abdul Samad (28) from Cuddalore, Tamil Nadu and Syed Ali Navaz (32) from Kanyakumari. Another suspect, Zafar Ali, was arrested in Gujarat.

Samad, who has pursued an MCA, is the member of banned outfit Popular Front of India (PFI). Moideen had joined the CPI (M) and later joined Manitha Neethi Pasarai (MNP) as a district organiser in Cuddalore area. A manhunt has been launched for three more members of this module who have been identified as Taufiq, Shamim and Anees.

ACP Lalit Mohan Negi’s team had received an input that a group of highly radicalised suspects from Tamil Nadu had fled under mysterious circumstances and pledged allegiance to ISIS . On January 9, the team found out that the trio had shifted to Delhi and rented a room in Wazirabad area. A team led by inspectors Sunil Rajain, Ravinder Joshi and Vinod Badola laid a trap near Wazirabad bridge and arrested the trio after a brief exchange of fire around 7am.

As per sources, Moideen told the cops that he had made a detailed plan to revive the ISIS network in India. Several rounds of meeting were organised by him at different hideouts to indoctrinate and motivate youths to pledge allegiance to slain ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. They were guided by a foreign based handler on Telegram and WhatsApp. The group then decided to abscond and meet their handler in Nepal.

Moideen, along with Syed Ali Nawaz and Abdul Samad, went to Kathmandu, Nepal after illegally crossing the border with fake documents. After setting up a base in Nepal to be used as a hideout, they had come to Delhi.

In 2004, Moideen was arrested in Cuddalore for organising a training camp at Nellikuppam. In 2014, a local Hindu Munnani leader namely K P Suresh was brutally hacked to death by this module. In September 2017, one of his recruits Shakul Hameed alias Salavadin, an MBA dropout, was arrested from Otteri in Chennai. It was Moideen, who lured Hameed to IS and even arranged his travel abroad.

BAREILLY: In yet another incident of man-leopard conflict, a leopard was allegedly killed by villagers under Kanth police station limits of Moradabad district. The big cat’s carcass was found on Wednesday following which forest department has lodged an FIR against unknown villagers for killing the animal.

Notably, at least 80 villagers were booked in neighbouring Bijnor district on Tuesday for reportedly killing a leopard there.

Speaking to TOI on Thursday, divisional forest officer (DFO) of Moradabad Kanhaiya Patel said that the leopard carcass was sent to Bareilly for autopsy. “The postmortem report suggests that the animal succumbed to traumatic shock due to head injury. Besides head, no other injury mark was found on the body. Veterinary experts said the leopard was either struck on the head by a heavy object or it may have sustained head injury after being hit by a vehicle,” the DFO said, adding that “we have lodged an FIR since it cannot be ruled out that the animal was killed by villagers”.

“The case will be clear once police complete its probe whether the animal was hit by a vehicle or attacked by villagers,” Patel also said.

The carcass of the three-year-old adult male leopard weighing 61 kg was first spotted by villagers near Jamuniya Khurd village on the Moradabad-Amroha border on Wednesday morning. A team of forest department rushed to the spot after getting information. SHO Kanth inspector Ajay Gautam also reached the spot with a police team. SHO and forest officials said that this was “a rare occasion when a leopard’s carcass has been found under mysterious circumstances in the district”.

BAREILLY: After state government’s directives, the district administration here has started its preparation to update the National Population Register ( NPR ).

The NPR is considered as the first step towards National Register of Citizens (NRC). However, the Union home minister Amit Shah has lately said after countrywide anti-CAA-NRC protests that there is no link between NPR and NRC. The Centre has approved Rs 3,941.35 crore for updating of NPR as well as Rs 8,754.23 crore as funding for Census 2021.

Additional district magistrate (finance & revenue) Manoj Pandey told TOI on Thursday that four gazetted officers from Bareilly have recently participated in a training session on NPR preparation held in Lucknow. “These master trainers will further train 180 officers on how to update NPR,” he said.

The officers who attended the training session were district development officer Shiv Kumar, additional statistic officer Mahesh Chand, block education officer Devesh Rai and additional BSA Rajeev Srivastava.

Kumar said that officials from all districts had arrived to take part in the session.

While updating the NPR, all houses will be counted by the enumerators and observers for which a field survey will start from May 16 and will continue until June 30. ADM said that master trainers would start a training session for enumerators and observers from April 20.

Director at UP directorate of census operation, Naresh Shankar Pandey, has asked all district magistrates across the state to select enumerators and observers and provide the list, latest by January 31.

The demographic data for NPR was reportedly first collected in 2010 during UPA government and it was last updated in 2015.

Kolhapur: Using two-wheelers for ferrying students or sticking to the stipulated limit of five students are some of the alternatives that autorickshaw union Vidyarthi Vahtuk Sanghatana is working upon to continue with their school children transport business across the city and district.

Shivaji Patil, president of the 2,300-member Vidyarthi Vahtuk autorickshaw sanghatana, said that the union is trying to abide by the Central Motor Vehicle Rules for the time being until there is some kind of golden mean to the situation.

“Some autorickshaw drivers who have their own two-wheelers are ferrying children to school and back home while others have limited the student carrying capacity in their rickshaws. Earlier, rickshaws used to ferry 10-12 schoolchildren at a time. The number has now reduced to five,” he said.

Patil said that the parents are worried as the only medium of transport for their children has been hampered. They have demanded that the government and school administration should increase the presence of school buses in all areas so that students do not face difficulties in commuting to schools and back home.

“We are firm on filing a public interest litigation (PIL) before January 20. The preparations regarding the same are in progress. PIL is the only way we can have some kind of representation for our case. In cities like Kolhapur , several things, including traffic, is quite different as compared to metro cities like Pune and Mumbai,” he said.

According to Patil, the union ferrys more than 10,000 students to their respective schools with precaution and that the union members are ready to abide by the necessary safety guidelines.

Meanwhile, the Regional Transport Office (RTO) sources said that they have relaxed the action on the rickshaws considering the public sentiments and students’ interest.

An official from the RTO, Kolhapur, said that they received a letter from the education department as well to relax the action until the commencement of the next academic year in June 2020.

“We are not ignoring the situation, but action is being taken against those violating the Motor Vehicle Act. We are monitoring students transportation in rickshaws as well as in school buses,” said the official.

B S Salunkhe, official in-charge of NHAI, Kolhapur , said, “The toll collection through FASTags is increasing but at a slow pace. At present, the total toll collection stands at around 40%. We are trying to ensure 100% toll collection through FASTags. For that, we are taking up drives to increase awareness about FASTags among vehicle owners. We expect that they will follow the set rules and regulations about FASTags soon. The Kini toll plaza on the Pune-Bangalore national highway has four lanes and, as special arrangement to avoid inconvenience to the travellers, we have already dedicated two lanes for vehicles paying toll in cash.”

The government had earlier said that no vehicle will be allowed to pass through toll plazas without FASTags from December 1. The deadline was later extended to December 15. However, due to several reasons, the government had to extend the deadline further to January 15. At the time, it was decided that one lane will be kept open for collecting toll through cash for the time being and once all vehicles are equipped with FASTags, all lanes at toll plazas will be closed for cash payments.

FASTags are prepaid rechargeable tags for toll collection that allow automatic payment deduction from a vehicle owner’s account. They are affixed on the front windscreen of vehicles. FASTags work on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology.

Madurai: The state election commission (SEC) has informed the Madras high court that the indirect election process in local bodies which is to be conducted across the state on January 11 would be videographed.

Two separate petitions were filed by Lalitha, newly-elected DMK councillor of ward 20 in Nilakottai panchayat union in Dindigul district and K Murugan, councillor of ward 5 in Mudukulathur panchayat union in Ramanathapuram district seeking to videograph the indirect elections conducted in their respective panchayats. When these petitions were heard on Thursday, a senior counsel who appeared for one of the petitioners submitted that the entire election process conducted for indirect election in the state should be videographed in order to ensure a free and fair election. He further submitted that videograph of the entire election process would prevent malpractices such as booth capturing which were reported in previous elections.

Another senior counsel who appeared on behalf of the SEC submitted that a circular had been issued to all the district election officers to videograph (not CCTV) the election process whereever required.

He said that the SEC shall instruct all district election officers to videograph the indirect election process conducted for electing the posts of chairmen and vice-chairmen of panchayat unions and district panchayats across the state on January 11. He also submitted that the commission would also issue a modified circular to all the district election officers in this regard.

A division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran observed that since the state election commission informed that indirect election process across the state would be videographed, the court is not inclined to pass any further orders in this regard. The judges disposed of these petitions directing the state government to file affidavit of compliance on January 21.

478,['10/01/2020'],"Nagpur: VNIT study suggests new body, measures for metro region water woes","This story is from January 10, 2020

NAGPUR: A joint study by professors and students of Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology ( VNIT ) and Japan’s Keio University (KU) has recommended the establishment of an urban-rural coordinating entity at governance level in Nagpur for dealing with water conflicts emerging due to rapid urbanization, loss of cropland, conservation of forests, land utilization and food security concerns in the metropolitan area.

The study has also highlighted the declining water availability in the Nagpur Metropolitan Area (NMA) and suggested the creation of alternative water sources in different parts of the district. Numerous agencies are involved in water management in Nagpur region, but there is a need for policy coordination at various levels for water being shared in NMA, it states.

Under land cover change, the study places on priority the need to ensure food security in NMA, as fertile agricultural land in its northeast area was lost to urbanization between 2006 and 2018.

The report showcases the flow analysis of people in urban, rural and forest areas along the Pench corridor. It carries a foreword by mayor Sandip Joshi, who notes that the report provides a glimpse into the grassroot level issues in Nagpur, and that strengthening urban-rural linkages holds the key to achieving sustainable urban development.

The study ‘Building Resilient Cities — Through Urban-Rural Partnership’ attributes water as one of the key determinants of economic growth, and calls for a comprehensive long term plan to balance supply and demand of the scarce resources in the region.

As per data from civic bodies, the researchers also recommended alternate water sources, such as Rehari barrage on Kanhan river to fulfil growing water demands in view of declining water availability in Totladoh dam.

Showing a comparison of decadal data, the study points out that areas close to Nagpur city are witnessing maximum rural-urban change.

On Thursday, a round table meet comprising representatives from disaster management institutions, civic bodies, the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES), and VNIT, KU professors was held to discuss the study, which has been submitted to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). National Fire Service College (NFSC) director GS Saini, NMC acting chief fire officer Rajendra Uchake, VNIT director Pramod Padole and the research teams were present.

The researchers comprise Kamakshi Thapa, Harshitha N, Sameer Deshkar (all from VNIT), Vibhas Sukhwani, Rajib Shaw, Wanglin Yan (all from KU) and Bijon Kumar Mitra (IGES). The report is part of research conducted under the India-Japan Bilateral Programme.

The study aims to apply the concept of ‘Regional-Circular Ecological Sphere (R-CES)’ in rural and urban Nagpur. It details the physical characteristics and changing climate, demographic transitions, land utilization/land cover change, water source areas of Nagpur, urban-rural water conflict, water policy and governance aspects, and avenues for urban-rural partnerships, besides recommending entry points for R-CES.

Professor Deshkar said that the R-CES concept is based on an integrated policy approach that incorporates low-carbon society, resource circulation and living in harmony with nature.

Kolhapur: As many as 50 autorickshaw drivers have been fined by the traffic police for not following the prescribed dress code while driving the autos in city.

According to police, from January 1 it is mandatory for auto drivers to wear khaki-coloured uniform along with the registration badge while driving the auto.

Vasant Babar, police inspector in-charge of city traffic department, said, “We launched the drive on January 1 to fine those driving autos with the prescribed uniform. We had held meetings with auto drivers and had asked them to follow the rules. We had also informed them that we will initiate action from January 1 and fine them if they are found violating the rules. In the first eight days, we have fined 50 autorickshaw drivers for violating the dress code norm.”

He added, “Most of the drivers were fined in the first two-to-three days. Now, almost all drivers are found following the dress code and we rarely come across anyone riding an auto without the uniform. The number of such drivers is around 2% in Kolhapur .”

Babar said they are also taking action against auto drivers found violating traffic norms. “The drivers are now following the dress code owing to the ongoing drive. However, our department will continue to take action against them throughout the year if they are found driving without the uniform,” he said.

City traffic department had last month launched a drive against six-seater autorickshaws and those ferrying passengers from neighbouring villages to Kolhapur and had banned their entry into the city.

The drive was successful after the traffic department allowed such autos to enter some roads in the city and assigned stops for them. “Our aim is to ensure that traffic on city roads should move smoothly without unnecessary stops by these autorickshaws,” Babar said.

Manoj Tiwari

NEW DELHI: Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari on Thursday came down heavily on chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for the latter’s scathing comments on the BJP-run corporations . He claimed that the chief minister was talking about the corporations in a bid to escape people’s questions on the “failures” of AAP government.

At a press conference held soon after the CM released the report card of the corporations, Tiwari showed videos and photos of broken roads, overflowing sewers, schoolchildren endangering their lives crossing open drains, etc, to claim that AAP government had failed completely onall fronts. He said the pictures were being sharedon social media by citizens.

“Kejriwal has no answers to the questions about the failures of his government. Even after five years, he is running away from the people. To cover up his failures, Kejriwal talks about irrelevant things, but not about water supply, the depleting fleet of DTC buses, pollution, lack of colleges and poor condition of flyovers and roads,” Tiwari said.

The Delhi BJP chief said he would ask Kejriwal one question a day on the development of Delhi for the next 10 days. “Why were Rs 20,000 crore due to the corporations not released by AAP government?” he asked, adding these could have been used for paying the salaries of the employees.

Tiwari said BJP would not allow Kejriwal to escape from a discussion on the performance of his government. “Kejriwal starts talking about other states when we ask him about dirty water supply, pollution and lack of transport infrastructure in the city. The assembly elections in Delhi is just a few days away, people want to know what AAP government has done in all these five years,” Tiwari said. If elected, Tiwari said, his government would give the people of Delhi five times of what AAP was offering in subsidies on power and water, apart from the free bus rides for women and other schemes.

He said that BJP would give the benefits to the people for five years, unlike the AAP which, he claimed, had introduced schemes for free bus ride and electricity in the last few months of its term.

South Delhi BJP MP Ramesh Bidhuri said while Kejriwal was comparing the work of his government with that of the municipal corporations, BJP was asking him about the schools, colleges and hospitals that he had promised but never built in the last five years.

“Kejriwal promised 500 new schools, 20 colleges, free Wi-Fi all over the city and houses for slum dwellers but could not do anything,” Bidhuri said, adding that people were waiting for the election to teach AAP a lesson.

CLEARED SKHER

Kolhapur: The last four months of 2019 brought a major worry for dairy farmers of the region, especially those in Kolhapur .

Dairies in the region have recorded a decline in milk production owing to the after-effects of devastating floods in August 2019. Not only did the farmers lose a lot of cattle, the water damaged sugar cane fields that provide easy fodder for the cattle. The hike in price of cattle feed only added to their woes.

Officials associated with dairy farming said the Kolhapur District Milk Producers Organisation, popularly known as Gokul, is facing daily drop of 2.50 to 3 lakh litre in milk production. Gokul is the biggest cooperative dairy in western Maharashtra and supplies milk to major cities including Mumbai and Pune.

According to the district cooperative department, the milk collection in the district has declined by seven lakh litres in a year. The total milk collected in the district in December 2018 was around 26,17,724 litres. In contrast, milk collection in December was 18,87,497 litres. The daily milk production has continued to reduce from three to seven lakh litres in last four months in 2019 compared with the year 2018.

Gokul director Arun Narke said they had daily collection of around 12 to 13 lakh litres of milk, which has reduced to 10 to 10.50 lakh per day now.

“Sudden changes in climate have affected milk production. The floods in August 2019 devastated life and cattle population in Kolhapur district and also the standing crops, including sugar cane. This led to a serious problem of fodder for cattle. The livestock residing on all the banks of the rivers in Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts are severely affected due to this,” he said.

Narke added that the price of cattle feed has increased, making it difficult to dairy farmers to sustain the cattle and impacted milk production.

Dairy farmers said the daily expenditure on maintaining cattle in the absence of ready cattle in their fields had become unbearable.

Ramesh Malgonda Patil, dairy farmer from Gadhinglaj, said, “The rate of cattle feed has increased by Rs 400 for 50 kg sack as compared with last year’s prices. We are also facing paucity of fodder to feed cattle due to floods. I have seven cattle that used to give 40 litre milk daily last year, which has now reduced to 30 litres per day. We are unable to meet daily expenditure on the cattle. The rearing of cattle is no more a profitable business now.”

Madurai: The Madras high court has directed the state government to file an affidavit with regard to the steps taken to ensure safety of bulls and their owners who wait behind the vadivasal (entry point of bulls to the arena) during jallikattu events. K M Thiruppathy, a resident of Madurai district, in his petition stated that he owned bulls, which had won prizes at various jallikattu events. He used to take care of his bulls with utmost care.

Every year when jallikattu events are conducted, officials concentrate on the steps taken in front of the vadivasal but fail to make safety arrangements behind it where the bulls and their owners would line up. Since there is no sufficient space behind the vadivasal, the bulls experience suffocation. He further stated that lack of sufficient space would also lead to injuries to the bulls and their owners.

Though he submitted a representation to the authorities concerned seeking to form a committee to ensure the safety of bulls and their owners behind vadivasal, no steps were taken in this regard.

Hence, the petitioner moved the high court seeking to constitute a committee to ensure the safety of jallikattu bulls and their owners behind vadivasal during jallikattu events conducted in Madurai district every year.

When the petition was heard on Thursday, additional advocate general K Chellapandian explained the steps taken by officials in various departments to ensure the safety of the bulls during jallikattu events. Taking note of the submission, a division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran directed the state to file an affidavit on Friday.

Kamaljeet Sehrawat

NEW DELHI: Taking strong exception to the criticism by CM Arvind Kejriwal , officials of the three corporations on Thursday accused AAP government of deliberately crippling the civic bodies by deducting more than Rs 10,000 crore from their kitty between 2014-15 and 2019-20.

Kamaljeet Sehrawat, leader of House in SDMC, said while the south body was the only financially viable corporation in the city, further fund cuts in the last two years had compelled it to stop all development work. “We used to get Rs 380 crore annually under the sanitation head, but the government reduced it to zero, forcing us to divert funds from development projects,” she said.

Despite this, Sehrawat said, the corporations had beautified 12 flyovers under PWD as well as parks on Delhi government land, besides developing the waste-to-wonder park.

She said SDMC’s performance was comparable with that of Delhi government. “As many as 400 of our 486 schools have CCTV cameras, 286 have smart classes, 100 have gyms for kids and playstations. Our happiness curriculum with bagless day is functional for two years. Our classrooms are no less than Delhi government schools and while ours cost Rs 8-9 lakh, they have spent Rs 20-25 lakh on each.”

EDMC mayor Anju Kamalkant said the east body was hit the worst by the trifurcation of MCD but was being given step-motherly treatment. “We are getting even the basic machinery for fighting pollution through the Rs 100 crore received from the Centre. EDMC has over Rs 3,000 crore pending from Delhi government as dues. We have the poorest areas with the largest chunk of JJ clusters and unauthorised colonies,” she said. “We don’t even have funds to provide uniforms and basic equipment. Give us funds and then judge us”

North Delhi mayor Avtar Singh said the corporation was carrying out its obligatory functions despite financial troubles created by Delhi government. He said the fund allocation was much better under the Sheila Dikshit regime.

Jai Prakash, standing committee chairperson of north Delhi municipal corporation, hit out at AAP and claimed that no such tussle regarding fund allocations happened during the Sheila Dikshit led Congress government.

Madurai: Madras high court has imposed a cost of Rs 15,000 on a petitioner for filing a false case stating that his father, who is the ward councillor of Mudukulathur panchayat union in Ramanathapuram district, was abducted.

In his petition, S Raja stated that his father Sathaiah had won the local body election for the councillor’s post as a DMK candidate. However, he has been missing since January 3 when he went out of the house. He claimed that when his mother contacted him over phone, he informed her that he had been abducted by four highly influential people to prevent him from voting to elect the chairman of Mudukulathur panchayat union on January 11.

Since the Mudukulathur police registered a community service register, he filed a habeas corpus petition before HC Madurai bench. The court, in its previous hearing on Wednesday, directed police officials to produce the petitioner’s father on Thursday, failing which the Ramanathapuram SP was told to appear before the court. Accordingly, when the petition was heard on Thursday, the police officials produced Sathaiah before the court.

However, the abduction case took a turn when Sathaiah informed the court that he was not abducted and was living with his daughter.

Taking note of the submissions, a division bench of Justice T Raja and Justice B Pugalendhi imposed a cost of Rs 15,000 on Raja for wasting the court’s time by filing a false case. The petitioner was asked to pay the cost to the High Court Legal Services Authority within 10 days.

RAMPUR: UP police on Thursday put up notices on the house of senior Samajwadi Party (SP) leader and Rampur MP Azam Khan, declaring him, his wife and son absconders. The court had declared them absconders in three cases recently, a police officer said, adding that the next step will be the attachment of their properties.On Thursday morning, an old and frail man sitting on rickshaw and carrying a battery-operated mike, announced that Azam Khan, his wife and Rampur MLA Tanzeen Fatimah and son Abdullah Azam were absconders in a locality where the SP leader holds sway. A man beating drum also followed him.The exercise, known as ‘munadi’ in official parlance, is part of Section 82 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and is used when a warrant against an accused cannot be executed.Speaking to TOI, additional district government counsel Ramautar Saini said, “The court directed the police to comply with the proclamation notice against Azam Khan and others into the matter.” Earlier, the court had issued non-bailable warrants against the Khans after they had failed to present themselves before it. Additional district and sessions judge Dhirendra Kamboj on Wednesday proclaimed them “absconder” invoking Section 82 of CrPC.Speaking to TOI, Rampur’s circle 0fficer Satyajit Gupta said, “Azam Khan and his family members against whom the non-bailable warrants were issued by the court failed to appear before it. Therefore in compliance of Section 82 of CrPc, apart from ‘munadi’, the proclamation notice was put up on the wall of his house as well.”On Wednesday, the court gave a fresh date and asked them to appear before it on January 24 in connection with alleged forged birth certificate of Abdullah Azam, whose election from Suar assembly constituency was recently annulled by the Allahabad high court.In two other cases, they have been asked to appear on January 20. On January 3, 2019, BJP leader Akash Saxena had logged a complaint alleging that Azam and his wife helped their son in obtaining two fake birth certificates — one from Lucknow and another from Rampur. Following the complaint, the Ganj kotwali police registered an FIR against the trio under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Later, the high court annulled the election of Abdullah as Suar MLA on the ground that he was underage and not qualified to fight the 2017 elections.The court had also issued the proclamation orders in another case registered against Azam and his three supporters for rioting and other offences based on the complaint of the former UP minister’s neighbour.",bareilly,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73181790,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-177823,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/sp-mp-azam-khan-wife-son-declared-absconders-cops-stick-notice-on-their-home/articleshow/73179089.cms

With the protest gaining steam, politicians of various parties traded words over the incident and some even made a beeline to the women-only college. With tension simmering, the college management promptly announced holidays on Friday and Saturday. Class tests scheduled for Saturday were postponed.

#StandWithJNC trended on Twitter for most part of the day. Taking note of the developments, chief minister BS Yediyurappa said police have been instructed to investigate the matter.

Tension at the college mounted on Wednesday, when at around 3.30pm, BJP workers led by Mohan Kumar, the party’s BTM Layout general secretary, erected a poster supporting CAA on the college compound wall. Workers then allegedly forced students walking out of the gates to sign the poster to show support for the controversial law. Several students took exception to the party workers’ conduct and an argument ensued. Videos of the argument were widely shared on social media.

On Thursday, some parents of students arrived at the college in the morning and demanded security for their wards. They said BJP workers’ conduct raised serious questions over their wards’ safety.

A group of students then held a demonstration outside the college during the lunch break. “Students from other colleges also arrived to support them. Due to safety reasons, we asked the girls to get inside the college,” said a JNC professor.

Students were allowed to hold a silent protest inside the college. Protesters said it was as much against BJP workers’ behaviour as against CAA. “BJP workers spoke rudely to our collegemates and misbehaved with them. They did not have any permission to put pictures on our college walls,” said Krithika (name changed), a JNC student.

“They asked us if the college wall belonged to us. They called it public property, which is incorrect. As students of JNC, we have a sense of belonging to the college and ownership of its properties. We do not want anyone to vandalize our college property,” Krithika said.

Another student said, “We were initially neutral on CAA, but after yesterday’s incident, we have decided to stand up against the law.”

Tension escalated when a group of boys, claiming to be brothers and friends of JNC students, landed at the campus gates and demanded that they be allowed inside to show solidarity with the girls. The management denied entry to all outsiders, but the boys began shouting slogans against the BJP.

One protesting youth, who claimed his sister was a student of JNC, said: “I am worried over the safety of my sister. This is the plight of many of us, whose kin are studying in JNC.”

With additional reinforcements in place, police asked the boys to disperse and they fell in line. With a huge contingent of police in front of the campus, the college asked its students to leave from the back gate by 3pm after declaring a two-day holiday.

490,['10/01/2020'],BBMP banks on injection wells to prevent underpass flooding,"Of the 24 underpasses in Bengaluru, at least 10 are known to flood during heavy rain

TimesView The depleting groundwater table is a bundle of paradoxes. While groundwater in itself is, geologically, a common property resource that runs without barriers, its unbridled exploitation is largely private. With replenishment of the groundwater table possible only by harvesting runoff rainwater, public bodies have a larger role. BBMP’s initiative to create injection wells in underpasses is ingenious but everything hinges on implementation. However, this certainly is an opportunity for the agency to redeem itself after having left Bengalureans to live with what are apologies for underpasses.

How it works

Tapping rainwater

BENGALURU: Flooded with complaints about underpasses across the city getting inundated at the slightest hint of rain, BBMP is creating injection wells at the structures to prevent waterlogging and to recharge the groundwater table.The first of such wells has come up at the Sankey Road-Cunningham Road junction underpass . It was successfully tested on Wednesday.“Almost 10,000 litres of recycled water was used for the trial run,” BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar said. The 230-ft recharge pit took in all the water in less than five minutes. “We will replicate the project in underpasses across Bengaluru,” he added.Of 24 underpasses in the city, at least 10 are known to flood during rain. Located at Puttenahalli, Kadirenahalli, Tagore Circle, Kadubeesanahalli, Cunningham Road-Sankey Road junction, Doddanekkundi, KR Circle, Palace Road near Maharani College and Kasturinagar, they turn into pools, making it impossible for vehicles and pedestrians to even enter them. BBMP will create injection wells at all these 10 underpasses as the first step.“Though the underpasses have drains, waterlogging persists because they haven’t been laid properly. We hope injection wells will be able to resolve the problem,” a senior BBMP official said.V Ramprasad, an expert on lakes and water conservation, told TOI if BBMP is planning to come up with injection wells, the water quality has to be good, without any impurity. This can happen only if it’s directly injected into the fractures of hard rock layer, he said.An injection well leads water deep into the subterranean surface. Silt traps filter the dirt and debris before the run-off is diverted into the well. Also, multiple layers of filtration media placed at the top purify water to the maximum extent, BBMP officials explained.Kumar said each well can harvest 2.1 million litres of rainwater in a year, and if such structures are created at all underpasses, the city’s groundwater table may never plunge.BBMP is betting big on rainwater harvesting to address the city’s drinking water needs. Injection wells are among the agency’s initiatives to aggressively harvest rainwater.According to another senior official, the city receives an average rainfall of 800mm per year. “Precipitation of just 12.5mm can yield 50,000 litres of water per acre. Even if 40% of water is lost due to evaporation/runoff and soil absorption, a minimum of 30,000 litres of the assured quantity of water can be recharged into the groundwater source daily,” he explained.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73180941,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-565122,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmp-banks-on-injection-wells-to-prevent-underpass-flooding/articleshow/73179057.cms

MUMBAI: Every day, 10 children fall victim to crimes in Mumbai.

A total of 10,701 children became victims of different types of crimes in Mumbai between 2016 and 2018, according to the latest NCRB report. Mumbai ranked second in the rate of crimes against children per a population of one lakh, though it recorded a marginal, 7.4% dip in cases in 2018 to 3,511 from 3,790 a year earlier.

While Delhi topped among cities, Mumbai has occupied the second spot for three years now, followed by Bengaluru, Indore and Pune. The report showed the majority of cases reported in Mumbai included kidnapping, followed by unnatural sex, murder, abetment to murder, infanticide, foeticide, exposure and abandonment of newborns.

Experts said newborns are abandoned on the roadside or are found dumped in garbage bins.

Investigators said towards rural areas of the state, children are abandoned due to poverty and females due to social prejudices in favour of the male child. In urban areas such as Mumbai, the majority of abandoned children are those born out of the wedlock.

Requesting anonymity, a senior IPS officer said a major chunk of kidnapping cases are of minors who elope and who are later tracked down.

Cases of rape, though, continue to be reported regularly, especially from slums.

“Take the example of Kurla’s 2011 Nehru Nagar rape and murder of three minor girls. All the minors were lured with chocolates by the accused,” said the officer.

Investigation into abandonment, foeticide and infanticide is given top priority. “We continuously seek information from civic bodies (health teams) about action taken against quacks and those who carry out illegal pregnancy and abortion tests. Accordingly, action is taken and further probe is carried out after a case is registered,” a senior IPS officer told TOI.

RTI activist Jitendra Ghadge said it is unfortunate that most of Maharashtra ’s population is still socially and economically backward. “It is not easy for any woman to abandon her newborn but poverty and family pressure for a male child puts a lot of pressure on her. The state sovernment has failed to empower women with education and livelihood. Social and economic independence of a woman is the only solution.”

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

492,['10/01/2020'],HC seeks govt counter on plea to redo corpn delimitation,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Madurai: The Madras high court has directed the state government to file a counter on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by DMK MLA of Madurai Central constituency P T R Palanivel Thiagarajan seeking to re-do the delimitation exercise for Madurai Corporation.

In his petition, Thiagarajan stated that Madurai Corporation is the second largest by territorial area and third largest population-wise in the state. It is divided into four zones with a total of 100 wards.

After the announcement of delimitation of wards, he submitted a representation to the Madurai district collector in 2018 in that regard, however, it was not considered.

He stated that the delimitation of the wards violates certain basic principles specified by the delimitation commission constituted under the Tamil Nadu Local Bodies Delimitation Regulations, 2017, and Section 3(1) of Tamil Nadu Commission Regulations Act, 2017.

The boundaries of an assembly constituency should not be altered during the delimitation process. He stated that the creation of a ward that spreads across the boundaries of an assembly constituency is also a violation of law and it is against the principles specified in the People’s Representation Act and Tamil Nadu Delimitation Commission Act.

Since the urban local body elections have not been declared in the state, the delimitation of wards in Madurai Corporation can be rectified before election is notified.

Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench seeking to declare the current delimitation of wards null and void and sought to re-do the entire exercise of delimitation by strictly complying with the provisions of Act and Regulations.

When the petition of Palanivel Thiagarajanwas heard on Thursday, a division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran gave the direction to the state.

MUMBAI: Mumbai saw 10% rise in crimes against women in 2018 with 6,058 cases compared with 5,453 in the previous year, shows the latest NCRB data.

Among 19 cities with over 20 lakh people, Mumbai ranked 13 in the rate of crimes against women per a one lakh population. Lucknow saw the maximum rate of crimes against women in the country with 2,736 cases in 2018.

Delhi registered 13,803 cases in 2016, which fell to 11,542 in 2017 and then increased slightly to 11,724 in 2018.

“Women in urban areas are no longer willing to take things lying down. Earlier, there was shame associated with reporting offences. Women would brush aside instances of sexual harassment but they are no longer quiet. The call log of police’s 103 helpline shows that the maximum complaints received are of domestic violence, followed by molestation. It is a positive sign that women are now more open to registration of offences,” said Y P Singh, IPS-officer-turned lawyer.

Social media has played an important role too, with survivors sharing photographs of perpetrators online and tagging security agencies.

According to NCRB, Maharashtra had the highest number of cases of abetment of suicide, abducting, stalking, voyeurism and assault. “Data usually shows crimes against women rising in urban areas, but not as much in rural belts. This doesn’t mean women are not being harassed in villages. There is just no environment to report crimes. Victims do not know whom to approach, there are no NGOs to support them, the victims are located very far from a taluka and in general no systems work,” said advocate Flavia Agnes of NGO Majlis.

Agnes said police in Maharashtra and Mumbai take the initiative to lodge complaints. Even survivors are coming forward to lodge complaints, she added.

Former Thane police commissioner S P S Yadav, too, said women who are not aware of legal assistance and live or work in isolated places are at greater risk of facing crimes.

Santosh Rastogi, joint commissioner of police (crime), said the increase in cases was also due rising awareness among the masses. “We are also doing a lot of awareness programs. Our ‘Police Didi Project’ is on and people are now coming forward to lodge complaints in such crimes. We are registering all such cases,” said Rastogi.

Rastogi further said the police pay special attention to crimes against women as well as detection of cases.

“The detection rate of crimes against women is 90%. CCTV footage is a great help in identifying an accused and arresting him. A speedy probe and preventive action against habitual offenders is undertaken too.”

495,['10/01/2020'],Nagpur: Opening of Reach I Metro stations delayed by six months,"This story is from January 10, 2020

Representative image

NAGPUR: MahaMetro had promised to open all stations of Reach I (Sitabuldi to Khapri stretch) by December 2019 end. However, now officials say it will take another six months.

Metro’s figures show that opening of new stations increased ridership. Despite this, it has failed to open the stations as per schedule.

Reach I had been inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March 2019. At that time, five stations were operational — Sitabuldi Interchange, Airport, Airport South, New Airport and Khapri. It took MahaMetro another six months to open a new station — Jai Prakash Nagar in November.

Five more stations — Rahate Colony, Congress Nagar, Ajni Square, Chhatrapati Nagar and Ujjwal Nagar — have to be opened. According to a Metro official, Rahate Colony station would be started this month. “Chhatrapati Nagar and Ajni Square stations will be ready in February, while Congress Nagar station will be ready by March end or April first week. Ujjwal Nagar station will take some time because we got the land recently. The land owner had moved the court,” said the official.

According to the official, opening of Congress Nagar station may be delayed further as Metro plans to open Manish Nagar railway underbridge (RUB) in March end anyhow. “As contractor is the same for the two works, he may concentrate on the RUB at the cost of the station,” he said.

Metro may complete construction as per its schedule, but opening the stations will take more time. Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS) will have to inspect each station and then give a green signal for opening them for the public. Metro officials, therefore, expect all the stations, barring Ujjwal Nagar, to be open by the middle of the year.

Commenting on the reasons for the delay, the official said initial contractor ILFS went bust forcing the Metro to re-tender the works.

The official said that work on stations of Reach III (Sitabuldi to Lokmanya Nagar stretch) was going ahead at full pace. “Bansi Nagar station will be ready this month. Wasudeo Nagar station is almost complete. Rachna T-point, LAD Square and Shankar Nagar stations will be ready by April or at the most May. Dharampeth College station will be the last as it has a viewing gallery,” he added.

Commenting on the delay in opening of Reach III, the official said that it was expected this month.
