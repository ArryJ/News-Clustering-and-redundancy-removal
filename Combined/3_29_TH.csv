0,2020/03/29,Yeshwantpur APMC yard to function for four hours three days a week,"Association threatens to shut shop over govt. directive to onion, potato traders to shift to outskirts

While farmers are dumping perishable produce as they are unable to get them to wholesale markets, stocks are running low in the city.

Supply-chain distortions persist despite assurances by the State government to the contrary. To stretch the stock till at least April 14, when the lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19 is scheduled to end, traders at the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yard at Yeshwantpur have decided to function only on alternative days for a limited time window of four hours.

The market will operate on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays till April 14. “There was some respite in the movement of trucks following the recent meeting with the State government. We could unload all the trucks at the yard, but around 90% of the trucks crossing inter-State borders are now stuck on national highways. So, we have to manage with the available stock,” said Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, chairman, APMC Committee, Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

Health concerns over the spread of COVID-19 have also been a cause for concern following which it was decided that the APMC would operate for a four-hour window, he added.

Lack of supply

What has crippled the wholesale markets is that mandis across the country where farmers auction their produce have been shut for over a week. “For instance, the Kalaburagi mandi, a primary market for toor, was open on Friday but had to close in just two hours as thousands gathered. So, there is no new supply of toor to the dal mills in the region. What we can get now is the stocks at mills, be it rice, dal, sugar or oils. The Union government has to take a call and ensure the mandis run in the next two weeks,” Mr. Lahoti said. Distortion of transport networks has only meant that even stock available at the mills are unable to reach markets.

‘Shift sales to outskirts’

To prevent overcrowding at the Yeshwantpur yard, the State government has directed merchants selling onions, potato, and garlic to shift to Dasanapura market, near Nelamangala, 20 km away from Yeshwantpur.

Bangalore Onion and Potato Traders’ Association has, however, argued the shifting is not feasible and said it will mostly shut shop till April 14. “Even if farmers come to Dasanapura to sell their produce, given the situation in the city it is highly unlikely that retailers will be able to make the trip to Dasanapura. It is just not feasible. So we may not be open for business till April 14,” said a senior onion trader with the association who wished to stay anonymous.

However, retail chains, including HOPCOMS, will continue to buy from farmers.

This shutdown is expected to create a shortage of staples and drive up prices. On Sunday, in some localities a kg of garlic was retailing for ₹180 to ₹200.

Truck drivers worried

Most drivers have taken leave and are reportedly refusing to ply trucks. “They and their families are also scared of contracting COVID-19. Moreover, there is no guarantee that there will be a smooth passage to the destination. They may arbitrarily be stopped along the highway and forced to spend many days on the road. So, most of them are refusing to ply,” explained Ravi Kumar, a senior merchant at the Yeshwanthpur APMC yard. Several traders are prepared to pay double the price for transit but are unable to find drivers, he explained.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/fykyoo/article31201475.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGAPMCYARDPROTESTONLINETRADING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/yeshwantpur-apmc-yard-to-function-for-four-hours-three-days-a-week/article31201476.ece
1,2020/03/29,Old age homes in city become fortresses to protect residents,"Visitors being discouraged, staff members living on premises

Staff and management of old age homes as well as the senior citizens living there are struggling to cope with the lockdown. Movement restrictions have resulted in many people employed at old age homes being unable to report to work. What is worrying is the knowledge that it is the elderly who are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19.

Nightingales Centre for Ageing and Alzheimer’s, which has 98 patients with dementia, is functioning with about only 50 staff members. “This is not sufficient as each patient requires one caretaker,” said S. Premkumar Raja, co-founder of the Nightingales Medical Trust.

‘Hard to get vegetables’

Prajwal S., manager of Shree Old Age Home which has 20 senior citizens, said they were finding it difficult to procure vegetables. “After the announcement on the lockdown was made, we stocked up on the groceries but stepping out to get vegetables has been a challenge,” he said. He added that they have stopped visitors from coming to the old age home and do not allow any of the senior citizens or their staff to step out.

Similarly, Ananadashram, another home for the elderly, has had some staff being unable to come to work. Dilshad S., the manager in charge, said visitors have voluntarily stopped coming while others have been asked not to come. Donors are also not being allowed inside either. Though most staff are lodged within the campus, the ones who used to come to work from home are not able to make it. “We are also being careful and taking all precautions. We have provided masks to everyone and are encouraging frequent hand washing. We are also not letting anyone go outside for now,” she said.

Dip in requests

Caregiver providers are also seeing two developments: a dip in requests, as well as many caregivers who offer daycare out of work. The manager of one such agency, which has presence in six States and caters mainly to the elderly, said they were not providing any day visits. “We are also getting very few requests for 24x7 care. The caregivers, trained in bedside assistance, are paid when they have work. They are also hit now,” he said.

(This is the first of a two-part series on senior citizens.)",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/4686li/article31201405.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGOLDAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/old-age-homes-in-city-become-fortresses-to-protect-residents/article31201406.ece
2,2020/03/29,BBMP identifies 17 ‘quarantine’ hotels,"They are for people suspected to have contracted COVID-19

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has identified several hotels across the city where people who are suspected to have contracted COVID-19 can be quarantined.

In a press release, the civic body has said that samples will be collected from people who develop cold, cough, and fever — common symptoms of COVID-19 — to ascertain if they have contracted the novel coronavirus. It usually takes around two days to get the results. Such people cannot be sent back home as there is a risk that the virus (if confirmed) may spread to others.

Nearly 1,300 rooms have been earmarked in 17 hotels across the city. The authorities will assign people waiting for their test results to the hotels.

The release added that there should be no air-conditioning in the hotels. Food will be provided in disposable cutlery and crockery. Officials of the Department of Commerce and Industries will check if those quarantined in these hotels have been provided with food and other essentials.

The room rent and food charges will be provided based on rates determined by the Karnataka Disaster Management Authority. Based on the occupancy, the money will be released to hotels, the release added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-identifies-17-quarantine-hotels/article31201145.ece
3,2020/03/29,Labourers in camps down to one meal a day as supplies deplete,"Many of them are out of work for over a week now and are running out of money and rations; there is severe water scarcity at most of the camps

Mohammed Shabbir, a migrant labour from Assam who lives at the Kariyammana Agrahara camp on the city’s outskirts, said his family of five, including three children, have started rationing their food. For the past week, they have been having only two meals a day; soon it will be down to one. The lockdown which has been enforced to check the spread of COVID-19 has changed the way such people live for the worse.

Several families at various camps of labourers in the city had a similar story to tell when The Hindu visited them on Saturday. They are running out of food supplies, which, they said, would last only for the next couple of days.

At least two families said they were planning to eat just one meal a day in a desperate attempt to stretch their rations.

“We have been out of work for over a week now. Money and rations are fast running out. Unless the government comes to our rescue in the next few days, many of us will starve,” said Bharamappa, a labourer from Raichur.

People from north Karnataka and States such as Assam, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal live cheek by jowl in these camps.

In desperation, some people are going to extreme lengths to get food. “Two days ago, a migrant worker sought to be admitted at a government hospital citing cough. But when doctors directed him to Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases fearing that he could have contracted COVID-19, he came clean and said he was only trying to ensure that he got food. He didn’t have any cough,” said Hemanth Kumar of Migrant Construction Workers’ Association, Bengaluru, and added that the incident reflected the desperation for food. As money and rations run out, he feard that loan sharks would make a killing and push the workers into a deep debt trap.

Migrant labourers at multiple camps in southestern parts of the city — Munekolala, Whitefield, Varthur, Marathahalli, and Kundalahalli — are short of staples and foodgrains, milk, and water. With no exception, all the camps reported that no representative of the government had visited them to date. No one has come to help them or educate them about COVID-19. This, despite the Labour Department allocating ₹15 lakh to each Labour Officer to create awareness and distribute masks and sanitiser for free.

‘No water to wash hands’

Most of the women were seen covering their face with their sari or dupatta, while many men had tied handkerchiefs to cover their nose and mouth. “We have been learning about COVID-19 through television and are scared,” said Utpal Dutt, a labourer from West Bengal.

Though they know they have to wash their hands regularly, they cannot do it as there is a severe water scarcity at most of these camps. “The landlord provides each house with three drums of water every week. But since this scare started, there has been no water supply as tankers are not plying. We are buying drinking water for ₹5 a can, but there is no water to wash our hands or bathe,” said Shivamma, a labourer from Raichur. Amid such water scarcity, talk of hygiene rings hollow. Social isolation is impractical.

The families, most of them with children, are also finding milk hard to come by. Ameena, who is in her late 30s, has five children. She sleeps with them in front of her shed at a camp at Kundalahalli. The youngest, just over a year old, is breastfed. But the other children, all aged below 10, are hungry. The camp had a ‘tent school’ where children would get midday meals and milk every day. But that has been closed now. “We are feeding the children a porridge without milk. But the younger ones need milk, which, however, is not available. And even when it is, we are not able to afford it,” said Ms. Ameena.

At Kariyammana Agrahara, two police constables visited the spot after reports of a clash between residents and a shopkeeper. “The shopkeepers are charging exorbitant rates and that seems to have caused tension. We are educating them to let go of profit at least for milk, which is essential for children. Milk is in short supply at these camps. We will try to fix the supply gap,” said the head constable, who did not wish to be named.

Returning home

The number of people at these camps has significantly dwindled. Sections of those living in these camps, especially those from north Karnataka, left for home over the last few days.

“Masons and others who are relatively better off left over the last two days. In trucks and mini-buses, they charged at least ₹2,000 per seat to travel back home. We did not have that kind of money, so we stayed back,” said Yellamma, a migrant from Kalaburagi district who works as construction labourer and stays at a camp at Kundalahalli. Very few of the migrants from northern and eastern States have left, as they found the travel back home daunting. They have heard reports that people who left are stranded midway as the authorities have stopped them.

Those who remain are struggling to make ends meet.

Govt. launches Hunger Helpline

The State government has launched a ‘Hunger Helpline’ — 155214, with 30 lines. K. Sudhakar, Minister in charge of COVID-19 affairs, said this helpline would coordinate both government and private initiatives to ensure no one goes hungry. “The lockdown and social distancing have impacted labourers and the homeless the most. Despite our efforts to make some alternative arrangements, it is true that they are suffering,” he said.

Following the Centre’s directions to ensure that migrant workers are not stranded on highways while trying to reach their home towns, the Karnataka government is taking steps to stem the tide by providing food, shelter, and other basic amenities to them. Deputy Commissioners have been instructed to utilise funds to provide relief. These include identifying lodging facilities in residential areas, PG accommodation, and university hostels. It will be applicable to homeless people as well. Those availing of the shelter will have to register and may be asked to give Aadhaar details, number of family members, and where they are headed. Basic facilities at the lodging should be cots, beds, electricity, and water for drinking, bathing, and toilets, the order said.

‘Efforts found wanting’

Many writers and activists wrote to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Saturday saying efforts by the government to help the poor was found wanting. “Although Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package announced on March 26 provides for some measures, it leaves out large sections of the population who may not be covered under various schemes. It is necessary that basic right to food and essentials is provided to all persons irrespective of previous coverage under schemes,” the letter states. It has been signed by several activists and writers, including Devanur Mahadeva.

While welcoming the package, the signatories were critical of the gaps. “The relief package gives rations to families with ration cards for three months and free cooking gas under Ujwala Yojana, which has only eight crore people covered. Moreover, the government must make use of the capacity to cook meals at schools and anganwadis, and provide cooked meals to the poor and homeless twice a day. They may also open kitchens at stadiums and grounds for the same,” the signatories said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hozsen/article31195685.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGMIGRANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/labourers-in-camps-down-to-one-meal-a-day-as-supplies-deplete/article31195676.ece
4,2020/03/29,Archdiocese to help the poor,"The Archdiocese of Bengaluru has come up with an action plan to help out the poor and underprivileged during the lockdown.

In a press release, Archbishop Rev. Peter Machado has stated that temporary shelters had been established to accommodate migrant workers, the homeless, and those stranded in the city during the lockdown. As many as five temporary shelters have been set up at St. Philomena’s School, Railway Colony; St. Joseph’s School, Briand Square, Mysuru Road; St. Xavier’s School, Shivajinagar; Lourdes School, Cubbonpet; and Lourdes School, Halasur.

That apart, every parish priest has been directed to identify small groups of volunteers to identify poor families, daily wage workers and other needy people, apart from donors who will help fund providing essentials to the needy. Every Monday, food material packs containing rice, ragi, flour, and oil, would be distributed. These food packs, the release added, could be given out or an arrangement could be made with the local grocery and retail shops from where the needy could procure the same. The archdiocese has also promised to help out poor parishes in this venture, provided the needy have already been identified.

Rev. Machado has also called upon all Catholic and Christian hospitals and medical personnel to reach out and take care of the sick, especially those affected by the coronavirus.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/archdiocese-to-help-the-poor/article31195526.ece
5,2020/03/29,Power supply to be available round-the-clock: Electricity Minister,"The Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) is taking all steps to maintain power supply round-the-clock, all over the State, in the wake of the lockdown because of COVID-19, said Electricity Minister P.

6,2020/03/29,Keeping those at shelters engaged,"NGO ensures mental well-being of the residents

While the Chennai Corporation has rescued and housed several persons stranded in the city in its community shelters, steps are being taken to ensure that they are at ease as well.

At the community shelter set up at a wedding hall in Thiruvottiyur, yoga sessions were organised for nearly 85 persons who have been housed there for the last one week.

“Even though they are now safe in the shelter and are being provided food and other essentials, they are anxious about the situation. Since they are not able to step out anywhere either, we decided to have a short yoga session for them, every day,” said K.S. Mariasusai, managing trustee, Rehoboth Educational Trust. A yoga instructor was invited to teach them simple breathing exercises and stretches, and speak to them with the help of one of the persons there who knows both Hindi and Tamil.

The NGO in charge of the community shelter and its members have ensured that people practise physical distancing during their meal time as well as sessions like this.

Among them, 85 persons are pilgrims who were visiting Rameswaram. There are also migrant workers who could not leave the city in the last minute, owing to the lockdown, implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The Corporation had rescued several such stranded persons from the Central railway station.

Mr. Mariasusai said that they were also working to bring about more entertainment options for those housed in the community shelter. “We are trying to arrange a television set, so that they can watch Hindi films and shows,” he said.

P. Akash, regional deputy commissioner (North), said that the Corporation, apart from providing food and a safe stay, has been conducting periodic medical check-ups and other necessary health interventions.

“Initiatives taken by the NGO to ensure the mental well-being of residents in these shelters is a welcome move and we will surely look to extend it to other areas as well if necessary,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/t16cyh/article31201325.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG20200329192117,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/keeping-those-at-shelters-engaged/article31201326.ece

8,2020/03/29,The renewed focus on kitchen gardens when lockdown strikes,"As the country rations its ingredient inventory, here are a few tips to grow your own vegetables

A final sprinkle of green garnish makes a dish complete. That said, many across the country are finding themselves hunting for such greens during the ongoing 21-day lockdown.

There has been a scarcity across produce, crucial to Indian cuisines, because of panic-buying and stockpiling, despite diligent efforts of supermarkets to keep their shelves stocked. Plus, e-commerce platforms such as BigBasket and Amazon Pantry are facing restrictions with their movements for deliveries.

Boosting access

That said, the kitchen garden has never been more valuable. Unlike the ornamental garden, a kitchen garden comprises produce. In India, they are often on balconies, window sills, terraces or even inside a room. In the case of the lockdown, it boosts a household’s access to fresh food, while keeping residents home.

Before you run outside to procure seeds and gardening inventory, we share advice and important information from experts in the industry, as well as people who have long nurtured their kitchen gardens.

Sixty-year-old Sujatha Ravi in Besant Nagar says she is not rushing to the vegetable market for fresh produce; she just has to source it all from her terrace garden, filled with various types of keerai, lady’s fingers, pomegranates, papayas, strawberries and more.

“I’ve had my kitchen garden for four-and-a-half years. After the lockdown is over, I want to start growing microgreens. I completely cook in one-pot-one-shot, a method which doesn’t kill the vegetable. It retains the colour and nutrition, and motivates you to grow more. At the markets, they segregate it with their feet so you have to wash them well. So that is another reason to maintain your own kitchen garden,” she said.

Alladi Mahadevan, founder of TheOrganicFarm.in, says one does not need to look beyond their home for a gardening kit. For 25 years, Alladi’s organisation has advocated urban farming across Tamil Nadu, and he says he is available for remote assistance during lockdown.

“The average Indian household has about 83 food items and about 20 of those can be used to procure seeds. Make sure you can access good soil and patience. Plan your calendar and use as much as possible,” he said.

Alladi recommends growing greens as a priority, as well as pulses and legumes, as they are packed with nutrients. To speed up germination, one can also soak methi seeds overnight and crush coriander seeds before sowing.

Subsidised kits

For two years now, the National Agriculture Development Programme and the Tamil Nadu Department of Horticulture and Plantation Crops have been encouraging this through their Urban Horticulture Development Scheme, inviting city dwellers to grow their own vegetables using subsidised gardening kits that include coco-peat, organic fertilisers and pesticides, grow bags and seeds of ten vegetables, along with a manual.

Lockdown for many has been mentally strenuous, and both Alladi and Sujatha agree that gardening is cathartic. Sujatha says when she digs into the soil and sees the full ecosystem created, she sees plenty of hope for the planet.

The idea of gardening is close to the idea of ‘renewal’, she concludes, and about leading out into the light of the new, adding “Do not be intimidated by a kitchen garden, it is more rewarding and brings happiness to the home, especially in this difficult time”.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/784dy3/article31201274.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PHOTO-2020-03-28-14-59-06,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/the-renewed-focus-on-kitchen-gardens-when-lockdown-strikes/article31201275.ece
9,2020/03/29,Physical distancing goes for a toss at fish markets,"Though many in the crowd were wearing masks, they were seen jostling for space

Due to non-availability of mutton, fish markets at Kasimedu, Chintadripet, Aminjikarai and Avadi witnessed large crowds on Sunday, despite the lockdown.

Though people were seen wearing masks, they did not adhere to personal distancing and were seen jostling for space.

“At Kasimedu, the crowds started as early as 7 a.m. and buyers were there till noon. People were buying directly from the boats. Though fishing is not allowed now, boats sold fish from their stocks. These were kept in deep freeze on ice. However, prices were quite high due to the demand,” said a fish dealer.

Sources said that sellers at markets in Pattalam, Vanagaram and Kavankarai were told not to sell fish. The Marina Loop Road, a popular space for many in the city to buy fish, was also closed on both sides to prevent people from entering.

“This is not fair. When 40 tonnes of cultured prawns were sold at Chintadripet, our fishermen were not allowed to go to sea or sell fish. These were brought from far way and sold there. When there are so many restrictions for movement of other trucks, we wonder how these reached the heart of the city,” complained K. Bharathi of Nochikuppam.

Price rise

Redhills resident I. Murugappan said that he was able to make mutton biryani on Sunday since a vendor he knew had sold a goat to him and his friends.

“And we got it at a reasonable price too. Chicken and egg prices have climbed up back to ₹190/kg and ₹5/egg this weekend. No fish was sold in our area on Sunday,” he said.

Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar said that sale of fish inside Kasimedu would not be allowed near the wharf from Monday.

“Fish sale is being allowed since we cannot deny it. The issue at Kasimedu was that people went there at the same time and they just bought fish off the boats. The government has instructed the police and Fisheries department officials to ensure that people adhere to strict norms while buying fish. Since fishing in the sea is not allowed now, we got fish from the Sathanur dam for the Sunday demand. We sold inland fish, including cutla, rohu and carp,” he said.

The fish market at Vellore too saw large crowds on Sunday. The police and the district administration have asked vendors, including those selling vegetables, to adhere to norms stipulated by the district administration. Commercial Taxes Minister K.C. Veeramani and Collector A. Shanmuga Sundaram visited both markets and gave instructions to officials on regulations.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/i950gq/article31201269.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30THFISH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/physical-distancing-goes-for-a-toss-at-fish-markets/article31201270.ece
10,2020/03/29,Corpn. implementing containment plan in 15 locations,"Workers undertaking door-to-door verification

The Chennai Corporation has started intensive door-to-door verification and community surveillance in 15 neighbourhoods of the city, where residents tested positive for COVID-19.

Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash has advised all residents in the 15 neighbourhoods to stay home. Releasing the list of the 15 areas, Mr. Prakash said: “People are strongly advised to stay home and to come out only for basic needs. Masks are advised indoors for people who have a travel history or a history of exposure to any positive patients in the notified localities.”

“All those under quarantine are to be 300% careful and should never step out of their homes. They have to make their own local arrangements to get products delivered in a basket outside. Any violation will be viewed strictly,” said Mr. Prakash.

“A containment plan was started in Chennai from Sunday morning. Houses where residents tested positive for COVID-19 will be the epicentre. Some 2,500 houses around these epicentres will be the focus area, and all houses will be inspected every day. Workers will repeat the inspection daily to track cases of fever and other symptoms. Areas outside the focus area will be verified by health workers once in two days. This will be done for 28 days,” said Mr. Prakash.

He requested mediapersons to broadcast names of the affected locations “again and again”, with names of the areas as notified by the Public Relations Officer. But a few media houses have decided not to disclose the names to avoid panic among residents of the localities. Essential services such as delivery of drinking water cans in some of the 15 areas have reportedly been disrupted, as news of the list of localities spread on Sunday.

Fifteen teams have been constituted for door-to-door verification in the areas. “For the containment plan, we are deploying 2,500 DBC, 1,500 anganwadi workers, 750 health nurses and 1,500 schoolteachers. It is a very important step that we are taking. All protective equipment will be supplied and basic enquiries will be made,” he said.

Involves teachers

The civic body has asked 1,500 teachers, of its 281 schools, to carry out community surveillance, contact tracking and be part of its containment strategy.

“We are ready to serve, but we are not technically qualified to do the work during a pandemic. They should have used services of sanitary inspectors who have the requisite skills. Teachers who visit affected homes may even cause the spread of COVID-19 in their neighbourhoods, as they are not skilled to handle a pandemic,” said a teacher.

The Corporation has asked 20,240 persons to be under home quarantine. As many as 1,120 persons have completed 28 days under home quarantine.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/wvyn8s/article31201255.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30THCORPORATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/corpn-implementing-containment-plan-in-15-locations/article31201256.ece
11,2020/03/29,Applications pour in for passes,"Police have issued just 50 such emergency permits so far

More than 5,000 people have sought emergency passes to travel amid the lockdown for various reasons, including attending marriages and taking care of ailing relatives. However, the police have provided only 50 passes so far, to those deemed to have valid reasons.

To prevent the spread of COVID-19, the police enforced Section 144 in the State since March 24. The movement of people, even within districts inside the State, is not allowed. However, on Saturday, the Greater Chennai Police set up a control room to help people travel to other districts and States for emergencies like death, medical reasons and marriages of their family members.

Those who need help were asked to contact the helpline 7530001100 or e-mail gcpcorona 2020@gmail.com and produce valid documents and identity proof. A team headed by H. Jayalakshmi, Deputy Commissioner, wing for crime against women and children, is in charge of the control room.

“From the moment this was announced, we got more than 5,000 e-mails. However, we scrutinised all petitions and approved only 10,” said Ms. Jayalakshmi.

There were many mails from bachelors from other States, who were stuck in the city.

“They wanted to be with their families. But such requests were not entertained. Death or marriage of a very close blood relation or medical emergencies was accepted,” said an officer.

“Only those who have been asked to come to the Commissioner’s office need to come. Our lines are constantly busy,” he added.

The police in Triplicane have stepped up efforts to keep people indoors: if they are found venturing out without valid reason, their motorcycles and shirts are being painted.

In Tiruvallur district, the police threw water mixed with turmeric at those going out unnecessarily.

After facing flak for wielding the lathi, the police have started using new techniques to discourage people from coming out of their house.

Unmindful of Section 144, people going around the city freely is a common sight.

Now, the Triplicane police have have started painting motorcycles and the shirts of people if they think they are stepping out unnecessarily. “We did this because it is difficult to wash the paint away. This will prevent them from coming out without any reason. Many try to visit relatives’ houses and give health condition as a reason. We allow those with genuine reasons,” said a police officer

In Uthukottai in Tiruvallur distrct, the police throw turmeric water on those venturing out.

“We mixed turmeric and neem in water and filled them in water bottles. We stop motorcycles and if we find that they are roaming around without reason, we pour the water on them,” said a police officer.

In Kancheepuram, the police used drones to track people who step out of houses.

13,2020/03/29,"Grocery stores, vegetable shops remain open for restricted hours","Food delivery platforms resume operations

With new restrictions coming into force from Sunday, shops selling vegetables and groceries functioned only from 6 a.m. till 2.30 p.m. People were seen queuing up at supermarkets. Many were relieved that food delivery apps have resumed their services.

In many locations, shoppers had to wait in spaces marked to maintain safe distance and only after a customer exited, another shopper was allowed inside to avoid crowding.

One of the popular vegetables and fruits retail chain in the city took orders only on Dunzo.

V. Padmanabhan, a 40-year-old resident said, “I was told that they accept orders only through Dunzo. So, I had to come again and place the order for fruits.”

Police personnel patrolling some of the areas advised shops and roadside vegetable vendors to ensure that they shut shop by 2.30 p.m. “The police have already come thrice and instructed us to close by 2.30 p.m,” a roadside vegetable vendor in Besant Nagar said.

Limited restaurants

Residents have started placing orders through Swiggy and Zomato. Sneha Sankar, a 27-year-old working professional in the city, said she was relieved that the government lifted the ban and allowed orders for a limited number of hours. “Though I and my friends may not order every day, we know this option is available, in case one of us is not well. Today, when I ordered, I saw only a limited number of restaurants on the app. Delivery executives wore masks.”

Rajkumar of Chennai Hotels’ Association said that very few restaurants were open in the city, including Koyambedu and Central station, with restrictions. No customer was allowed inside and only takeaways were allowed. Swiggy and other operators had very minimal orders, he added.

Residents have appreciated the efficient work of conservancy staff in various parts of the city. V. Rajagopal, an activist in TVS Colony, Anna Nagar West Extension, said conservancy staff of Ambattur zone had been carrying out door-to-door garbage collection regularly, in addition to the regular spraying of disinfectants, using tractor-mounted sprinklers.

218 vehicles seized

Policemen were deployed in many parts of the city and they checked every passing motorist.

“A motorist told me that he was rushing to buy medicines for his six-month-old baby. People are coming out with all kinds of lies to roam around,” said a policeman.

The police booked 307 cases, from 6 p.m. on Saturday to 6 a.m. on Sunday, for violating prohibitory orders in the city. As many as 218 vehicles were seized from offenders.

From March 24 till date, 1,913 cases have been filed for flouting prohibitory orders. and 17 people have been booked for sneaking out of quarantine. A total of 856 vehicles have been seized.

15,2020/03/29,Corporation's move to connect public directly to zonal officials comes in for praise,"During the last week, the Greater Chennai Corporation has been circulating and creating awareness about their control room numbers as well as the contact details of their zone wise officials for emergencies during the ongoing lockdown and this came in handy for a resident in the city.

Vidya Reddy, a resident of Vepery in Zone 5, said that there were issues regarding the plumbing in her house. ""With two senior citizens at home, this was becoming a matter of concern. We weren't able to find a plumber to come and carry out any repairs as well due to the lockdown,"" she said. She had then reached out to the zonal officials who immediately sent a plumber with the city corporation to rectify the issue. ""They considered the fact that there were senior citizens and their timely assistance was greatly appreciated,"" she said.

The GCC had shared numbers of the zonal officers and regional deputy commissioners on their social media handles a few days back, stating that the public can directly call them in case of any concerns as it would be easier to resolve when it is decentralised. Some of the queries that they expected to get was regarding the opening of grocery shops, mobilising ailing patients, addressing the needs of expectant mothers and senior citizens.

R. Manoharan, zonal officer in Zone 5, said that over the last few days, they have been getting calls from residents about purchasing medicines and enquiries about the availability of essentials in their areas. ""For senior citizens who have called in and told us about their inability to procure medicines, we ensured that our health department officials reached out to them and got them the medicines. We recently had a call from a man who needed medicines for his wife who had just delivered a baby and since he was hesitant to step out, we ensured the medicines reached him as well,"" he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/corporations-move-to-connect-public-directly-to-zonal-officials-comes-in-for-praise/article31200837.ece
16,2020/03/29,"Time restrictions could increase infection by creating bottle-necks, says epidemiology researcher","The timing restrictions imposed as part of efforts to contain COVID-19 by Tamil Nadu government for the general public to shop for their essential vegetables and provisional supplies, could only “increase infection by creating bottle-necks”, a U.S.-based epidemiology researcher has opined.

Suhas Srinivasan, a Ph.D. scholar with a research focus in Biological Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, affiliated with Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, said it could increase infection.

The limited operation hours can cause more anxiousness about access to groceries. At a given time (likely before the stores open), there can be an increase in the number of people getting out of their homes and into streets leading up to the stores, he contended.

“Even though many stores are trying to enforce physical distancing, from many news reports the distance is not consistently 6ft (which is very hard to implement in the first place),” he argued.

Instead of the time restrictions, these outlets could provide separate hours (in the morning or evening) for the elderly and those with serious medical conditions and there could be increased hygiene practices at stores, he said.

17,2020/03/29,COVID-19: Volunteers pitch in to help home-alone seniors,"While the majority are looking for help in sourcing essential items, a good number of the elderly are battling depression in these times and may need counselling support

Septuagenarian D. Rajasekaran’s voice quivers with helplessness as he narrates the difficulties in finding help for his “flock”. He is the secretary of the Tamil Nadu Senior Citizens’ Association, a 3000-member group, and is now getting accustomed to receiving frequent calls through the day from seniors who are unable to get their medicine or provisions.

“There are frequent calls now from seniors seeking some kind of support, many are from rural areas,” begins Rajasekaran, and he reveals that just a while ago he was on the phone with a pan-India organisation for the welfare of senior citizens seeking to find out if they can help out in some way.

Ironically, Rajasekaran, retired income tax official who lives with his wife in Chennai, is looking for help himself.

“This morning, I went to buy fruits but the shop had run out of stock, and I was asked to return and try my luck a couple of hours later. I did and stood in a queue and got some fruits,” he says.

“While those staying in apartment complexes have somebody to reach out to for help, for those living alone and are cut out from city limits, these can be stressful times,” says Rajasekaran.

Battling loneliness

Rajasekaran says that some seniors, who are members of the Association, are battling the effects of loneliness, and looking to talk to someone.

Three team members from HelpAge India Chennai make 60 calls a day, on an average, to check on senior citizens. They also receive calls with great frequency.

“Some calls are from those seniors who have associated with the voluntary organisation for a long time, and others are those who get on our helpline number,” says R. Muthukrishnan, senior manager, HelpAge India, adding that counselling support is being offered on all the helpline numbers of HelpAge India.

“On an average we spend 20 minutes speaking to one caller,” he says. “This apart, there is a good number of calls from those who are trying to help the homeless elderly on the road. We direct such calls to the Corporation which runs night shelters.”

Limiting factors

Restrictions on movement of people sometime come in the way of efforts to help seniors.

“For many seniors, it is comforting that that such services are available. It’s not always that we can deliver but we call back and say we were not able to do this today but may be tomorrow,” says Aruna Subramanium, trustee, Bhoomika Trust.

The not-for-profit organisation, which has disaster relief and rehabilitation as one of its thrust areas, launched the senior citizens helpline recently seeing the need to address problems faced by this age group.

“It’s a new kind of crisis that nobody has worked on, you are not able to send people out on the field. We have rules like no volunteer should enter the house and also not to exchange currency,” says Aruna.

In the long run, she says, communities have to support and they are trying to propagate that idea.

18,2020/03/29,Signs suggest summer dates for 2021 Olympics,"Organising committee president Yoshiro Mori suggested there would be no major change from 2020.

Tokyo Olympic organisers seem to be leaning away from starting the rescheduled games in the spring of 2021. More and more the signs point toward the summer of 2021.

Organising committee president Yoshiro Mori suggested there would be no major change from 2020.

The games are meant to be in summer, so we should be thinking of a time between June and September, Japanese news agency Kyodo reported Mori saying on Saturday.

International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach, after the postponement was announced in Switzerland on Tuesday, left open the possibility of spring dates.

Mori suggested some decisions could be made as early as this week when the organising committee’s executive board meets.

Any final decision will be made between local organisers and the IOC, and hundreds of sponsors, sports federations and broadcasters.

Athletes have been left in limbo by the postponement. Many have been forced to stop training because of the spreading coronavirus virus. Even those who can train have no idea about how to schedule training to reach peak fitness at the right time.

Enormous cost

Mori and organising committee CEO Toshiro Muto have both said the added cost of rescheduling will be enormous. Early estimates put those costs at between $2-3 billion with the several levels of Japanese governments likely to foot most of the bills.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/m5ysqt/article31176104.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27MUTO,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/signs-suggest-summer-dates-for-2021-olympics/article31200238.ece

21,2020/03/29,Vikas vows to win Olympic gold,"I am the toughest one and it is time to perform, he says

These are exciting times for Indian boxing as a record nine pugilists (five men and four women) have made the cut for the Tokyo Olympics (postponed to 2021). London 2012 had witnessed seven Indians in the fray.

Vikas Krishan, the most experienced boxer in the group, is considered a bright prospect to win a medal, even gold. He won the yellow metal in the Asian Games in 2010 (Guangzhou), and a bronze at Incheon (2014) and Jakarta (2018). He also clinched the third spot in the 2011 World championship and a gold in the 2018 Commonwealth Games at Gold Coast.

Santiago Nieva, India’s High Performance Director, said: “Vikas has been at an exceptionally high level for the last couple of years and we have high hopes on him. The 69kg category suits him better [he was in 75kg earlier] as he is more powerful and can sustain the high pace. This, along with his experience as a pro boxer in the United States, makes him a strong candidate for gold.”

The SAI-BFI factor

The Argentine, speaking to The Hindu from Patiala on Saturday, said there were a lot of factors for Indian boxing’s gradual growth. “The most important is the work done by the Sports Authority of India through the Boxing Federation of India (BFI) in the last two years. A solid organisational structure and a strong training system at all levels are the main reasons. We have improved in many areas and the results are there for all to see,” said Nieva.

C.A. Kuttappa, head elite men’s coach, said the upward graph began after the 2016 Rio Olympics. “Both BFI and SAI sent the Indian boxers to quite a few tournaments abroad, and they were sent on merit,” he said. “Everyone received equal opportunities for training and competitions abroad.”

Kuttappa said Vikas’ strength was his powerful punches and uppercuts. “He was at his best when he defeated an experienced Kazakshtan boxer Ablaikhan Zhussupov [Asia/Oceania Olympic qualifying tournament in early March] in the semifinals where he smartly mixed his body punches and punches to the face.”

BFI selector V. Devarajan said Vikas has the “speed and power” to take on any opponent, and “his confidence levels are high now.”

The boxer, who had been travelling frequently, is now spending quality time with wife, two sons and a daughter at his home in Bhiwani (Haryana).

“My priority is to give time to my family as they miss me when I go to camps and competitions. Training is not on my menu right now as I want to rest and recover,” Vikas told The Hindu.

About his third straight Olympics, the 28-year-old said, “I am going there to get the gold. I have trained hard. The quality of boxers doesn’t matter. I am the toughest one. I have sacrificed a lot and it is time to perform.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/6lq8tx/article31194789.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29FRESH-VIKAS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/vikas-vows-to-win-olympic-gold/article31194794.ece
22,2020/03/29,Overhauling research in universities,"Creativity and originality of thought take a beating in these institutions, affecting research

Ever wondered why the CEOs of some of the big companies in this world are of Indian origin. Why is it that we have to call them Indian-origin and not just Indian?

This leads us to a glaring issue in the Indian system of education. Many of these CEOs completed their higher education in foreign countries and thereafter continued to live there. What is that the foreign education system provides that our system cannot? Why do many students prefer completing their higher studies in a foreign university at exorbitant costs, remaining away from their homeland? What do we lack that we have hardly come up with an Indian CEO?

The answer I believe would be lack of research in our universities where students can take part. Yes, there are opportunities for research, but creativity and originality of thought takes a beating in our universities. Research requires creativity and originality of thought. For some reason, the syllabus in our education sector has burdened our students so much that they do not find enough time to kindle creativity in the minds of our students. Students tend to borrow ideas and work upon these very ideas and bring a few changes to bring in the uniqueness. Such uniqueness, most of them are hardly worth any value. Research and innovation are intertwined. Research leads to innovation and innovation is born out of research. Innovations help in taking the world a step forward. Without innovation, the world becomes a boring place to be in, without anything new. Research improves the lives of the people. For this reason, research is something every institution should always concentrate on and give ample amount of time to. A student learns more through practical experience. In our institutions, the students are made to go through rigorous theoretical examinations that include only cramming of texts a night before the exam. This very concept snaps the bud of creativity before it can bloom into the flower of innovation.

As an engineering student myself, I have gone through rigorous tests that at the end proved completely a waste of time. Our final year project was guided more by deadlines than by the quality of the work done, thus significantly affecting students, who were inspired more to complete the work in time.

All institutions in our country should stop this theoretical torture and go for the practical peace that will help foster the culture of research and innovation. Besides, the budget should divide the money allocated for the education sector into parts. One looking after the primary, secondary and higher secondary education, one after the higher courses that would include anything above higher secondary and the third, looking after research. This will help us produce more Indian CEOs and then we can be rightly proud of our nation and our CEOs.

23,2020/03/29,Why we lie,"There are multiple reasons but generally people lie to get more of something or not to lose something

The first time Rohan lied to his wife Janvi, he made sure he spoke to her on the phone so that she couldn’t see his facial expression or eyes. People who lie are initially wary of revealing themselves through body language; they prepare in advance to appear normal. Janvi trusted Rohan and that emboldened him to fib more often and more glibly.

Researchers at the University College London and Duke University while investigating the effect of lying on the brain, discovered that the amygdala, the seat of our emotions, gets distressed and signals negative feelings when we lie the first time. However, as we choose to prevaricate in a variety of situations, it stops experiencing stress and adapts itself to our new behaviour, making it easier to lie.

Lying is learnt behaviour, and not natural like hunger, thirst, laughter or sex. Children learn to lie from adults, peers and the media. The habit has to be curbed in childhood itself because later it only gets reinforced and entrenched.

There are multiple reasons for lying but generally people lie to get more of something or not to lose something. More economic advantage, power, money, promotions, worldly success, more women, more men; the list is endless. It often originates in insecurity. The upshot of it all is that once a person learns to trade integrity with gains, it is a downhill slide which includes using unethical means.

People who lie often believe that others do not know they are lying. Modern society provides us YouTube videos and courses on how to lie without getting detected. Liars pick up the tips, tricks and techniques which are equally available to everyone. Liars adopt newer and newer ways of evading exposure. A popular American leader lied to evade impeachment and lost his earlier gleam. When a person lies beyond acceptable limits, their image gets tarnished permanently.

The consequences of repeated lying are grave. It spares none, not even the highest in the land. A lie is not just a playful aberration but an act of planned dishonesty for the sake of advantage. All liars are scared of some terrible fate. In the long run, no one ever flourished on lies. Their mental health gets affected, they experience emotional distress, loss of friendships and isolation. The bigger the scam, the bigger the man who takes his life to prevent public shaming.

I recall the words of my School Principal spoken to us in Grade IX. She had said, “Never do in secret what you are ashamed of doing in public.” This advice is the litmus test that distinguishes lies from truth. All extramarital affairs, scams, money-laundering episodes, political intrigues happen clandestinely and are built on the edifice of untruth, and deceit. All come a cropper with time. One wonders why people still resort to prevarication when they know they will be discovered.

“One word of truth outweighs the world,” said Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Speaking the truth is the easiest thing to do because it is based on facts. The beauty of truth is that it never changes. A life where we commit ourselves to speaking only the truth is the happiest. Wise people and saints universally have urged mankind to be truthful and experience inner peace.

Is it possible to give up the habit of lying?

Yes, it is. One way is to trust our conscience or the instinctive negative response of the brain and refrain from telling a lie. The second is to make an effort to speak the truth, irrespective of the temptations. The third is to share our decision with a friend or family member and request them to check us whenever we lapse.

A lie distorts our inner and outer worlds. To be a master of our soul, our being and our brain we must confidently choose only the ethical and honest path. Once we are determined to speak, think and act only in truth, the habit of telling a lie should get rooted out forever.

24,2020/03/29,The COVID cycle,"Governments have the opportunity to shore up their credibility and regain the trust of citizens

The summer of 2020 is yet to come upon us, but we are all facing the heat. At the time of writing (March 22), the SARS-CoV-2 virus has claimed the lives of over 13,000 people from over 3,07,000 infected. There is good news in that over 92,000 people have completely recovered from COVID-19 and that there is far more seriousness about tackling the spread than there was a couple of weeks ago. We humans have the enemy in our sights, and we believe we will emerge victorious in this battle.

Let us not forget though that viruses stay around because of their ability to mutate and to adapt to conditions that are hostile. The virus that caused smallpox was first suspected to have latched on to humans sometime between the 3rd century BC and the 7th century CE. Vaccination against the disease emerged from an experiment in 1796 and by the early decades of the 19th century, it was accepted as the best way to prevent the disease. And yet, smallpox continued to ravage humanity around the world. Though the mortality rate came down from 40% (earliest, 18th century estimates) to 17% (20th century estimates of average), the disease was not eliminated. In fact, an epidemic of smallpox in India between 1926 and 1930 had a mortality rate of almost 43%, while the mortality rate from 1921 to 1930 in the U.S. was 0.7%.

The WHO’s first programme for global eradication of smallpox was initiated in 1959. It languished for a few years until 1967, when an “Intensified Eradication Programme” began. The intensity was characterised by two non-medical aspects: establishing a surveillance system to detect and to follow up on suspected cases and mass vaccination campaigns. Even with such changes (and greater commitment from governments around the world to eliminate smallpox), it was only in 1980 that the WHO declared the world free of smallpox.

The last person to die of smallpox was not from an impoverished ‘third-world’ country: Janet Parker died of smallpox on September 11, 1978 at Birmingham, U.K. That the solitary case did not become an epidemic at that time was mainly because over 500 people believed to have been in contact with her during the first two weeks of her condition were vaccinated and quarantined. Those were the days when institutions commanded a lot of respect; when governments were more trusted than today. In the case of smallpox, the respect and trust seem to have been well placed.

As the world woke up to the enormity of COVID-19, respect and trust were not among the top 10 words to describe governments, or institutions. But in the past few weeks, it has been heartening to see expertise reclaiming some of the respect it should rightfully have. It needed experts to decode the virus genome — and those experts had the luxury of standing on the shoulders of other experts who, over the years since 2003, have been working on decoding several variants of the SARS-CoV-1 virus. Without such long-lasting efforts, it would not have been possible for us to begin our assault on COVID-19.

Governments have the opportunity to shore up their credibility and regain the trust of their citizens. Even in the age of WhatsApp rumours and armchair specialists, those experts who have been completely truthful and transparent are the ones who have inspired the citizenry to heed their instructions. Few have attempted to bask in the limelight; they are doing what is expected of them as experts and not playing politics, or currying favour to get their way. Experto crede will be fashionable when the experts favour not the rulers but the science.

This epidemic of COVID-19 will wind down in months or in weeks. During that time, each of us should objectively assess how we treated the institutions that protected us from the worst aspects of the disease. And learn that there are areas we should fear to tread, even as we seek to know how we are being saved. For, make no mistake, SARS-CoV-2 will linger around. And unless we are able to demonstrate that institutions deserve respect and governments deserve trust, the virus will win when it strikes the next time.

25,2020/03/29,Campus capers: just for laughs and thrills,"When funny pranks and youthful derring-do set a campus alive

Timid in school, I had my mischief buds awakened only after joining college in Delhi. My partners in crime were Arvind, Philip and Shamsher, pranksters par excellence.

Our first victim was a fellow who sold fruits at exorbitant prices on the campus. We struck at midnight.

With a wicked-looking hook ingeniously attached to a long pole, Shamsher lifted basket-loads of luscious fruits through the ventilation of the hostel into our waiting hands and mouths. The next day, the man was found frantically examining the waste bins on the campus. But we had outsmarted him by evenly spreading the banana skins, orange peels and other incriminating evidence across the residential blocks. Eventually, after a series of such raids, he got frustrated and sealed the ventilation much to our dismay.

Arvind once boasted that he would sleep all alone at night on the Ridge, a wooded, spooky area near the college. He placed a bet with us, and we deposited him around midnight near the grave of a British Captain who died in action during the 1857 War of Independence. Nonchalantly lighting up a cigarette, Arvind looked dangerously close to winning the bet, as he cheerfully slid into his sleeping bag. As usual, Shamsher saved the situation. He rushed to a nearby postgraduate hostel where he had friends, and mustered three vicious-looking characters who pretended looking for buried loot near Arvind’s sleeping place. We watched in glee from the nearby bushes, as a shaken Arvind was rudely chased away. He escaped leaving behind his spectacles and sleeping bag, and it was only several months later that we told him the truth.

Honking mad

Philip had an old-fashioned horn pilfered from an ancient city bus abandoned on the Ridge. He and Arvind would go around on a scooter, get close to the ears of unsuspecting cyclists or tonga wallahs and scare the living daylights out of them, by squeezing the rubber bulb which would then emit an unearthly shriek. Occasionally, a water pistol replaced the horn, with much the same results.

Sometimes, the cyclist would even fall off in fright, while the two triumphantly fled the scene. I once tried replacing Arvind on the pillion seat, but was hopelessly clumsy. Our target, an old tonga wallah, reacted with lightning speed. As I squirted water onto his face, he let out an expletive and lashed out at me with his horse whip, resulting in painful red welts all over my back and chest. For a long time after that, I declined to go with Philip on his marauding spree.

One day, a famous cartoonist was invited to the college. The hall was full, partly because of his reputation but also because of the exquisite chocolate éclairs served during tea. Shamsher and I, who came mainly for the goodies, had to stand outside and watch the proceedings. As tea was being served, we noticed that SJ, a batch mate, was sitting on the window sill in front of us. He was leaning forward, teacup in hand, anxious to take in every word of the cartoonist.

Scalding hot

As he did so, his shirt went up and trousers slid down exposing his back. Shamsher winked at me; I winked back and in a trice, poured hot tea from my cup into the cleavage. SJ yelped and shot out of his seat, sloshing himself and others with tea. Livid with rage, he turned around and spotting me, ran out of the hall and chased me down the corridor. He would have beaten me to pulp had Shamsher not intervened.

Many years later, Shamsher bumped into SJ at an alumni meeting. A senior IAS officer then, SJ mercifully laughed it off, even as Shamsher helpfully pointed out that he was probably the only man in the world who had tasted tea from both ends!

26,2020/03/29,Age is in the eye of the beholder,"You are considered young or old solely on the basis of who is assessing you

Three decades ago, in my early 30s, I noticed a group of teenage girls playing hockey. Having played the game during my college days, I decided to seize this opportunity to impress them. With their consent, I entered the field, and pumping adrenaline, I chased the ball but soon ran out of breath.

One of the girls advised me, “Please don’t over exert, uncle.” That last word came as a rude shock. Since when did I begin to look like an uncle, I asked myself.

Years later, in my mid 50s, wearing a pair of jeans, I attended a wedding. A boy of around 10 approached me and asked, “Can you please tell me where is the dining hall, grandpa?”

Shock and confusion continued.

After my retirement, when I visited a senior citizens’ home, an elderly person, perhaps in his late 70s, hailed me, “Hello, young man, what brings you here with all the old people?”

Neither young nor old

Though I felt happy, my confusion continued. When I was young, I was forced to think otherwise. Now when I start beginning to realise that I am getting old, someone calls me young.

But soon, clarity emerged.

During a community festival, I was chatting with a 93-year-old man. Soon we found that his cousin was my neighbour. He complained that the said relative had not visited him for many years, though he is quite young. I was amused since the young cousin’s age was 81.

And then in a chat group of my family members, one person posted about the death of a woman at the age of 78. In response, another, in his mid-40s, observed that the woman had lived a “full life”, implying that her time was up. Immediately, a third member wrote that the deceased was too young to die, that she should have lived for at least another 15 years or so. I soon found out the reason for this remark — the comment was made by a woman who was in her early 80s.

Suddenly, years of confusion gave way to clarity. You are considered young or old solely on the basis of who is assessing you.

Simply it’s all a matter of relativity.

Unfortunately, Einstein seems to have been too much engrossed on pure science that he missed out on this aspect of social science.

27,2020/03/29,"O death, where is thy sting","Musings on life’s larger lesson while spending time in quarantine

The grim reaper is rearing his head once again, as he did during the Great Plague, the World Wars and the Partition of India. The last two events were constructed and administered by us human beings; so it tore us apart.

What we are now encountering, the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, is challenging us to stand together and not yield to any call of destruction.

I am in Delhi, quarantined by health authorities for 14 days in a hotel after having landed from the U.S. Several thoughts and feelings rose in me because of the manner in which I went through the immigration process and was questioned by Health Ministry authorities, and the subsequent internment in a hotel. Yet after the upheaval within subsided, I seemed to want to recognise a larger lesson being offered.

There is pain in the draconian measures that are being put in place, such as what I, like so many passengers returning from overseas, faced at the airport. I was impatient, at my wits’ end, waiting to be ushered through the various government bodies that ensured I was infection-free, yet I realise that this is no time to pick fights nor have pangas. I want to support the work that is being done without demur, for I know if I cooperate, my kith and kin will breathe easy and may remain disease-free too.

As Carlos Castaneda writes, “Whenever we think we are being annihilated, let us turn to death and ask if this is so. Death is our eternal companion. Whenever we think that everything is going wrong and we are on the edge of destruction, we can turn to death and ask if that is so.”

The touch

If we are willing to listen attentively to the message we are being given, we will hear the following words: “You are wrong and nothing really matters outside my touch. I haven’t touched you yet.”

For us to give ourselves the opportunity to live and live well, I wish not to allow for myself and my fellow human beings the pleasure of death saying, “I have swallowed you and I have won.”

28,2020/03/29,Save the hugs for now,"Social distancing is the new norm; hence physical demonstration of love is verboten now

“Not so hard!” My older daughter reminds me when I hug her too tight. I repeat the same words when my younger one has me in her vice-like grip. We are a family that believes in hugging. We save our kisses for little children. We hug when we meet, part, celebrate, mourn and sometimes for no reason at all. The longer the hug, the more emotional we are in the moment.

And in one fell swoop, the novel coronavirus has snatched away our hugs. What was normal yesterday seems downright irresponsible today. Physical distancing is the new norm, and hugs are now verboten, clubbed with socially unacceptable activities such as coughs and sneezes even at home. In the early onset of the outbreak, when things did not seem catastrophic, I had attended my regular Toastmasters meeting. Nobody was shaking hands and the proposed “elbow bump” seemed strange like an awkward dance move (something that my two left feet objected to vehemently). I resorted to putting my palms together in a namaste, and my fellow Toastmasters, bless their hearts, followed suit.

“Wash your hands, stock up, avoid crowds!” The mantra is repeated by family and friends from across the world. A friend from California emailed me that her local grocery had run out of wheat flour. Her family consumed rotis at every mealtime. That got me taking a hard look at my pantry. I worried if I had enough rice, lentils and spices for the next couple of weeks. Alas, it wasn’t just my friend but all of social media was bombarding me with endless dos and don’ts. Messages ranged from the meaningful, what-to-do to the bizarre. While one thread declared homoeopathy as the magic cure, another proclaimed that garlic will prevent infections. Certainly, the garlic theory would keep other humans away.

My younger daughter who is in graduate school in Boston called every day, presumably to allay our fears rather than hers. She complained about young students attending COVID-19 parties, rather than isolating themselves. I wasn’t sure how to respond. She didn’t wait for me. “What if I can’t see my grandparents this summer,” she whispered as though not wanting to tempt fate.

Even before I could keep up with the change in topic, she asked, “How old is dad?” It appeared that she was as worried about her nearly 60-year-old father as she was about my nonagenarian father. The question was simple yet I sensed it was important that I weigh my reply carefully. The statistics on age groups at risk were not helping.

My daughter is plagued with fears, and if this were just another day, I would have given her a hug and no further response would have been necessary.

Dry hands

Her questions are not just about other people. She continues grilling me every day with “Are you washing your hands?” I almost snap back that my hands are beginning to resemble dried prunes. Growing up in the early 1970s meant following my parents’ diktats on being careful and watching out for every calamity, natural or man-made.

Today, my parents live alone in Chennai. They have always been uncomfortable with physical demonstrations of love. When I call them, my mother who shies away from hugs does not refrain from saying, “I told you so!” Our conversation is peppered with prayers and dietary tips. “Drink lots of green tea,” she says.

We drink tea at all times — after a celebratory meal or to perk up flagging spirits. We love our tea as much as our hugs.

We believe it is a panacea for many of our ailments, real or imaginary. While sipping my umpteenth cup of tea, I look for virtual alternatives to hugging.

And the next time my daughter hugs me tight, I will never complain.

29,2020/03/29,COVID-19 | Four patients in Mumbai have international travel history,"The civic body on Saturday also confirmed the death of the 85-year-old surgeon from South Mumbai due to COVID-19

Four of those who tested positive in Mumbai on Saturday have an international travel history while the remaining are contacts of patients who tested positive earlier. The others include four from Pune, two from Nagpur, four from Palghar, Vasai-Virar and Navi Mumbai region and 1 from Jalgaon.

The civic body on Saturday also confirmed the death of the 85-year-old surgeon from South Mumbai due to COVID-19. With this addition, the State’s death toll is now six. The deceased’s son, a cardiac surgeon and his grandson who had returned from the UK who also tested positive, are admitted at the Hinduja Hospital. The case has sparked a debate on whether the family of doctors could have taken more safety measures. On Saturday, a few staff members from the Saifee Hospital tested negative while some more reports were pending.

Asked about challenges facing BMC, Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), said, “The biggest challenge is when educated people behave in an irresponsible manner. We are carrying out counselling in slums but learned people are behaving this way.” Elaborating on latest measures being taken by BMC to contain the spread, he said, “We have now undertaken rigorous disinfection of slums and within a week will cover every slum.”

The Matunga police on Saturday detained the owner of a popular café in Matunga after a video of him driving around with a siren blaring from his vehicle during the lockdown emerged on social media platforms.

According to the Matunga police, the offender, Ali Koolar, owns the Koolar Cafe in Matunga. The video, which is presumed to have been shot by Mr. Koolar’s friend from the passenger seat, shows him driving with a government siren sounding, while him and his friend are heard laughing.

Police officials said inquiries were initiated into the matter after the video was brought to their notice by several Twitter users and Mr. Koolar was brought to the police station subsequently.

31,2020/03/29,"NGO supplies essentials to slum dwellers, homeless","YUVA based its help on a survey to find those in need; supplies grain packets, soap across city

In the time of a lockdown, when families in slums and daily wage earners are finding it difficult to survive, an NGO called Youth for Unity and Voluntary Action (YUVA) has stepped in to ensure that food packets are supplied to those in need.

“We work on slum issues and the problems of the homeless. Ever since the government started taking precautionary measures against the novel coronavirus, we realised that it will impact the homeless and the extremely poor in slums,” said Vijay Kharat, senior project associate with YUVA.

YUVA ran an online campaign called ‘Together We Can’, appealing to individuals to donate generously for the cause. The organisation then conducted a survey in bastis (slums) to find those who are actually in need of this help. “We took the details of those individuals and after identifying them, gave them coupons. The coupons were meant to make the process easy and hassle-free,” said Marina Joseph, another senior associate.

Those who were given coupons were called at a designated place at a given time. The packets being given to families include 5 kg rice, 5 kg wheat, 2 kg dal, masala and a one-litre oil packet, along with detergent and hand soap. Till now, 800 such packets have been distributed to slums in Nerul, Panvel, Belapur, Mankhurd, Jogeshwari, Bandra, Malad, Nalasopara and the homeless in Matunga, Kurla and Kharghar with whom the organisation is already working on various projects. A small group of volunteers go to the assigned spots to distribute the packets.

YUVA had conducted a survey of around 1,500 families before going ahead with the distribution. The remaining 700 packets will be distributed in slum pockets in Sanpada, Malvani in Malad, Vashi Naka in Chembur, Sathe Nagar in Mankhurd, and Sakinaka near Andheri.

“We will need cooperation from government and police authorities due to lockdown orders given by the State government. We have communicated to the Chief Minister’s and Home Minister’s offices via e-mail and also sought permission from the collectors of Thane and Raigad. We are awaiting their response and are confident that we will get a positive reply,” said Roshni Nugehalli, executive director, YUVA.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/dkf6jz/article31198384.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/jogeshwarihomelessjpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ngo-supplies-essentials-to-slum-dwellers-homeless/article31195523.ece
32,2020/03/29,Police issue e-passes to Navi Mumbai residents,"The Navi Mumbai Police started issuing e-passes to residents for stepping out to buy groceries and medicines on Friday night. So far, the police have received more than 2,000 applications.

“The applications take around an hour and a half to get either approved or rejected. There are people applying for non-essential travel outside Navi Mumbai, which we are rejecting. Only urgent applications within our jurisdiction will be approved,” Navi Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Kumar said.

Four teams are processing the applications and the Assistant Commissioner of Police is taking the final call. Pravin Patil, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Crime Branch, said, “ACPs and our personnel are working 24x7 on rotation basis. They are also monitoring Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp to address the issues of people. Everyone needs to stay indoors for their safety. People are permitted to venture outside only for one hour for valid reasons.”

He added, “Time, source and destination of the applicant is recorded on the e-pass. After approval, the applicant will receive a PDF of the e-pass. The applicant will have to produce the government ID and phone used to book the e-pass. We are working on developing a software to extend the duration for relevant cases and uploading documents when needed.”

Mr. Kumar said, “Every housing society has to take initiatives to make sure no member steps outside unnecessarily. Over 900 people are now home quarantined in Navi Mumbai.

34,2020/03/29,"Morning digest: India to increase focus on high disease burden areas, Opposition parties say lockdown was ill-planned, and more","A select list of stories to read before you start your day

With 185 new cases and two deaths due to COVID-19 reported in the last 24 hours, the Union Health Ministry on March 28 announced a change in strategy with increased focus on high-disease burden hotspots across India. Working with the State governments, there will be intensified efforts to strengthen community surveillance, contact tracking and containment strategy, officials said. There, however, is no change in testing strategy, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said.

Congress and CPI(M) slammed the Narendra Modi government for the ill-planned nationwide lockdown and general unpreparedness in tackling the novel coronavirus outbreak. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi in a series of tweets said the government was responsible for the “alarming” situation.

In the wake of the present the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a much-needed increase in awareness among the general public of the importance of handwashing, social distancing and observing cough and sneeze etiquette. Observing a healthy ‘toilet hygiene’ must also be stressed, in view of the fact that COVID-19 affects the gastrointestinal tract too.

Feeding centres, medical care and sanitised transport services are needed to provide immediate relief to the lakhs of migrant workers stranded on roads, said an appeal to the Central government signed by 200 academics, economists, social activists, lawyers, retired bureaucrats and concerned citizens. The sudden imposition of a 21-day lockdown, with just four hours notice, has had horrific consequences leading to a humanitarian crisis, it said.

As the debate rages about the viability of convalescent plasma (plasma extracted from those who are recovering from coronavirus (COVID-19), a paper published in the Journal of American Medical Association has hit a home run for a possible treatment methodology. At a time when the world is grasping at straws for treatment methods, every positive outcome raises hope.

Professor Adam Kucharski, who is an Associate Professor and the Sir Henry Dale Fellow at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, specialises in the mathematical analysis of infectious disease outbreaks. He spoke to The Hindu about the global coronavirus pandemic, specifically on what nations can learn from models of infectious outbreaks, and even of fake news.

Deaths from new coronavirus in the United States surged past 2,000 Saturday, doubling in just three days, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The number of deaths late Saturday was 2,010, about a quarter of them in New York City, the country's hardest hit region, Johns Hopkins reported. That is fewer than the 10,023 in Italy, Spain’s 5,812, China’s 3,299 or the 2,314 in France, the tally showed.

As novel coronavirus cases kept rising in the national epicenter of New York, President Donald Trump said Saturday he is considering a quarantine affecting residents of the State, neighbouring New Jersey and Connecticut. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Saturday he wasn’t sure what the President meant but didn’t “like the sound of it.” Meanwhile, Mr. Cuomo postponed New York’s Presidential Primary from April to June, and nurses made anguished pleas for more protective equipment and rebuffed officials’ claims that supplies are adequate.

The number of coronavirus deaths in Britain jumped by 260 in one day to pass 1,000, official data showed Saturday, the day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson himself tested positive. The death toll was 1,019 on Friday, up from 759 at the same time on Thursday, the most recent Health Ministry figures showed. More than 17,000 people have also tested positive for COVID-19, including Johnson and his health minister, Matt Hancock, who are both now self-isolating with “mild” symptoms.

Italy’s death toll from the novel coronavirus shot past 10,000 on Saturday with 889 new deaths, the country’s Civil Protection Service said. The toll in Italy, which has suffered more deaths than any other country, now stands at 10,023. An additional 5,974 infections brought to 92,472 the number of people who have officially tested positive for COVID-19 in Italy since the crisis began last month.

Sri Lanka on Saturday reported its first COVID-19 death, of a 65-year-old patient, who had diabetes and renal health complications, Health Ministry officials said. The island nation has 113 confirmed coronavirus patients so far. Sri Lanka’s health officials have also detected four COVID-19 positive cases in people who recently returned from Chennai, prompting authorities to term Chennai a “high-risk” zone.

The Saudi-led military coalition intercepted a missile over Riyadh late Saturday, State media said, after AFP reporters heard three explosions in the capital. “A ballistic missile was intercepted and destroyed over Riyadh,” State-run Al-Ekhbariya television reported. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but Yemen’s Iran-aligned Huthi rebels have previously launched missiles, rockets and drones on the Saudi capital and other cities.

35,2020/03/29,When in doubt lash out: why do we cop it so often?,"When I was three or four I was brought up to believe that policemen were terrible monsters who ate children refusing to finish the vegetables on their plates or broke things in the house. Now, all these decades later, the warning flashes in my mind again. When in doubt lash out seems to be the motto of the men appointed to protect us.

There might be a cultural reason for this. In our epics, villains like Ravanna had the indestructible Chandrahasa sword, Duryodhana had his mace and so on. The Indian policeman has his lathi. Interestingly, such power was granted by the gods in charge.

Videos of cops and thugs (increasingly indistinguishable in their behaviour) have been beating up citizens, upsetting the food carts of the poor and helpless, and creating terror in parts of India have been circulating since the lockdown began. We can put it down to a lack of communication – the Great Communicator being unable to get his message across – if we want to be polite. But that still doesn’t explain the manner in which policemen have been behaving with impunity across the country, smashing bones, destroying libraries, damaging vehicles, and suggesting they are just a step away from making my childhood nightmare come true.

I know some wonderful police officers. Educated, gentlemanly, compassionate, and focused on helping the citizens of the country they are a part of. Bengaluru has seen policemen handle the traffic to enable important medical equipment reach patients. It has seen policemen helping fill potholes. So what happens to their colleagues in some situations?

Are they over-worked, under-paid, and in the current situation, simply scared? Are some of them upset that the casual favours they demand for minor transgressions have dried up? Or, like the rest of us, are they furious that stupid, unthinking citizens out for a joy ride on empty streets or playing cricket and football in maidans are foolishly endangering all our lives?

The question, naturally, is how can they distinguish between the stupid and the desperate who are on the streets because they need to buy food and vegetables? Well, they can ask. They can check. If the answers are unsatisfactory, they can fine them. But when you start swinging the lathi indiscriminately, you become part of the problem, not part of the solution.

The lockdown is necessary even if it came without proper warning. South Africa, for example, gave its citizens three days to prepare. Our lack of preparation has seen hundreds of migrant workers walking hundreds of kilometres to their homes – the full picture of the damage will only emerge later.

Doctors, delivery boys, emergency workers, even a senior journalist of this newspaper in Telengana, those in “essential services” across the country all have stories of being roughed up by policemen who ought to know better.

The Narayanastra, to return to our epics, was a deadly weapon that could be used only once. Lathis should be converted into similar single-use weapons for the well-being of our citizens.

36,2020/03/29,North Korea fires 2 short-range missiles,"Pyongyang has launched nine projectiles in four rounds this month

North Korea fired what appeared to be two short-range ballistic missiles into the ocean off its east coast on Sunday, the latest in a flurry of launches that South Korea decried as “inappropriate” amid the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Two “short-range projectiles” were launched from the coastal Wonsan area, and flew 230 km at a maximum altitude of 30 km, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff reported. “In a situation where the entire world is experiencing difficulties due to COVID-19, this kind of military act by North Korea is very inappropriate and we call for an immediate halt,” South Korea’s JCS said in a statement, according to Yonhap news agency.

Japan’s Ministry of Defense said they appeared to be ballistic missiles, and they did not land in Japanese territory or its exclusive economic zone. They would be the eighth and ninth missiles launched in four rounds of tests this month as North Korean troops conduct military drills, usually personally overseen by Kim Jong-un.

Unprecedented number

That would be the most missiles ever fired in a single month by North Korea, according to a tally by Shea Cotton, senior researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. “Coming this early in the year, the only time we’ve seen tests this frequently were in 2016 and 2017, both of which were huge years for North Korea’s missile program,” he said on Twitter.

All of the missiles fired so far this year have been small, short-range weapons, such as the KN-24 fired during the last launch on March 21.

‘Strategic weapon’

But Mr. Kim has warned that North Korea is developing a new ”strategic weapon” to be unveiled this year, with analysts speculating that it could be a new long-range ballistic missile, or a submarine capable of launching such missiles.

United Nations Security Council resolutions bar North Korea from testing ballistic missiles, and the country has been heavily sanctioned over its missile and nuclear weapons programmes.

This month’s military drills have been conducted despite a border lockdown and quarantine measures imposed in North Korea in an effort to prevent an outbreak of COVID-19.

South Korea and the United States have postponed some of their joint military exercises because of the coronavirus outbreak in South Korea.

Politically and economically isolated, North Korea has not reported any confirmed cases, though some foreign experts have expressed doubts.

In the past, North Korea has typically conducted military drills, including tests of its ballistic missiles, in March as the wintry weather turns warmer. For the previous two years, however, it had avoided such springtime launches amid denuclearisation talks with the U.S.

Those talks have since stalled, and this year’s string of tests and military drills appear aimed at underscoring North Korea’s return to a more hard-line policy, said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists.

“There is an element of projecting a business-as-usual image amid the COVID-19 situation, but I think it’s not overriding,” he said. “These tests do allow Kim Jong-un to show that he’s sticking to the hard-line policy he laid out in December 2019.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/edkl61/article31201105.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30-NORTHKOREA-LAUNCHOFMISSILE2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/north-korea-fires-2-short-range-missiles/article31201106.ece
37,2020/03/29,Saudi Arabia intercepts missiles in attack claimed by Yemen’s Houthis,"Shrapnel fall on capital Riyadh, border city of Jazan

Saudi Arabia said its air defences intercepted two ballistic missiles on Saturday night in an attack that Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi group on Sunday said it had launched towards the capital Riyadh and southern areas near the Yemeni border.

The attacks come days after Yemen’s warring parties had welcomed a UN call for an immediate truce on Thursday to fight the COVID-19 outbreak. “Two civilians were slightly injured due to the falling of the intercepted missile’s debris as it exploded in mid-air over residential districts,” in Riyadh, the Saudi state news agency (SPA) reported, citing a Saudi civil defence spokesman, Lt. Colonel Mohammed al-Hammadi.

Residents in Riyadh reported multiple blasts around 11.20 p.m. local time (8.20 p.m. GMT), followed by emergency vehicle sirens in some northern districts.

No fatalities were recorded from the shrapnel that fell on Riyadh, and the southwestern city of Jazan, located on the Red Sea directly north of the border with Yemen, SPA said, citing a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition fighting Houthis in Yemen, Colonel Turki al-Malki.

Yemen’s Houthis battling the Saudi-led coalition have launched hundreds of missiles and drones across the border, mostly at nearby military and civilian targets but also at Riyadh.

The last attempted strike on the capital was in June 2018.

Saudi Arabia blamed Iran for a September 2019 drone and missile attack on two oil installations that initially halved Saudi oil output, even after the Houthis claimed responsibility. Tehran denies involvement.

The Saudi-led coalition on Friday said it had also intercepted and destroyed drones launched by the Houthis towards the Saudi cities of Abha and Khamis Mushait.

A military spokesman for Yemen’s Houthis on Sunday said the group’s forces had launched rockets and drones at “sensitive” sites in the Saudi capital Riyadh and at economic and military sites in Jazan, Najran and Asir, near the Yemeni border. Spokesman Yahya Saria said Zulfiqar missiles and Samad 3 drones were launched at Riyadh, and other drones and missiles at the southern areas.

Mr. Saria warned of further “painful operations” against Saudi Arabia if aggression against Yemen continued.

Yemen has been mired in conflict since the Houthis ousted the government from power in the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014. The coalition intervened in early 2015 to restore the internationally recognised government. The Houthis still control most major urban centres.

Yemen had witnessed a lull in military action after Saudi Arabia and the Houthis launched back-channel talks late last year. But recent months have seen a spike in violence that threatens fragile peace deals in vital port cities.

Coalition spokesman Malki said that the firing of missiles at this time by the Houthis and Iranian Revolutionary Guards showed the real threat posed by the group and the Iranian regime supporting it. Malki added that this escalation did not reflect the group's announcement that it was welcoming a ceasefire.

38,2020/03/29,A new wave of the fake news pandemic is born,"Misinformation linked to supposed cures and misleading claims has proliferated on social media

The biggest reputational risk Facebook and other social media companies had expected in 2020 was fake news surrounding the U.S. presidential election. Be it foreign or domestic in origin, the misinformation threat seemed familiar, perhaps even manageable.

The novel coronavirus, however, has opened up an entirely different problem: the life-endangering consequences of supposed cures, misleading claims, snake-oil sales pitches and conspiracy theories about the outbreak.

So far, AFP has debunked almost 200 rumours and myths about the virus, but experts say stronger action from tech companies is needed to stop misinformation and the scale at which it can be spread online.

“There’s still a disconnect between what people think is true and what people are willing to share,” Professor David Rand, a specialist in brain and cognitive sciences at the MIT Sloan School of Management, said, explaining how a user’s bias toward content he or she thinks will be liked or shared typically dominates decision-making when online. Part of the reason is that social media algorithms are geared to appeal to someone’s habits and interests: the emphasis is on likeability, not accuracy.

Changing that would require Facebook, Twitter and other such companies to alter what people see on screen. Prompts urging users to consider the accuracy of content they are spreading on social networks are needed, said Mr. Rand, co-author of a study on COVID-19 misinformation that was published earlier this month.

Using controlled tests with more than 1,600 participants, the study found that false claims were shared in part simply because people failed to think about whether the content was reliable.

In a second test, when people were reminded to consider the accuracy of what they are going to share, their level of truth awareness more than doubled.

That approach—known as “accuracy nudge intervention”—from social media companies could limit the spread of misinformation, the report concluded.

“These are the kind of things that make the concept of accuracy top of the minds of people,” said Mr. Rand, noting that news feeds are instead filled by users' own content and commercial advertisements.

“There probably is a concern from social networking companies about accuracy warnings degrading the user experience, because you're exposing users to content that they didn't want to see. But I hope by talking about this more we'll get them to take this seriously and try it.”

‘Remedy’ kills 300

What is undoubted is that misinformation about the pandemic has been deadly. Although U.S., French and other scientists are working to expedite effective treatments, false reports have appeared in numerous countries. In Iran, a fake remedy of ingesting methanol has reportedly led to 300 deaths, and left many more sick.

Dr. Jason McKnight, assistant clinical professor in the Department of Primary Care and Population Health at Texas A&M University, said the sharing of false information has an impact beyond the immediate risk of the virus itself. “I have seen posts related to ‘treatments’ that are not proven, techniques to prevent exposure and infection that are either not proven and/or filled with a lot of misleading information, and instruction for individuals to stock up on supplies and food,” he said.

Dr. McKnight highlighted two types of danger posed by inaccurate information on the virus: that it “could incite fear or panic,” and “the potential for individuals to do harmful things in hope of ‘curing the illness’ or ‘preventing’ the illness.”

Facebook took a hammering over Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Having been accused on Capitol Hill of ignoring the allegations, Facebook conceded the following year that up to 10 million Americans had seen advertisements purchased by a shadowy Russian agency. As evidence mounted about how Russia had used Facebook to sow division, company CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized.

Facebook has placed authoritative coronavirus information at the top of news feeds and intensified its efforts to remove harmful content, including through the use of third-party fact checkers.

Mr. Zuckerberg also said earlier this month that a public health crisis is an easier arena than politics to set policies and to take a harder line on questionable content.

AFP and other media companies, including Reuters and the Associated Press, work with Facebook's fact checking program, under which content rated false is downgraded in news feeds so that fewer people see it. If someone tries to share such a post, he or she is presented with an article explaining why the information is not accurate.

However, a Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment on the potential for adding accuracy prompts to its platform.

A Twitter spokesman, in a statement to AFP, also did not address whether the company might consider using prompts.

“Our goal has been to make certain everyone on our service has access to credible, authoritative health information,” he said.

“We've shifted our focus and priorities, working extensively with organizations like the WHO, ministries of health in a number of countries, and a breadth of public health officials.”

The COVID-19 misinformation study mirrored past tests for political fake news, notably in that reminders about accuracy would be a simple way to improve choices about what people share.

“Accuracy nudges are straightforward for social media platforms to implement on top of the other approaches they are currently employing, and could have an immediate positive impact on stemming the tide of misinformation about the COVID-19 outbreak,” the authors concluded.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/orujqb/article31200969.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Th30-US-Social-media,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a-new-wave-of-the-fake-news-pandemic-is-born/article31200970.ece
39,2020/03/29,Coronavirus | Beijing sees rise in imported cases as normalcy returns to Wuhan,"Many of them involve Chinese returning from other nations

A growing number of imported COVID-19 cases in China, where the epidemic originated in December, risked fanning a second wave of infections when domestic transmissions had “basically been stopped”, a senior health official said on Sunday.

China, where the disease first emerged in the central city of Wuhan, had an accumulated total of 693 cases entering from overseas, which meant “the possibility of a new round of infections remains relatively big”, Mi Feng, spokesman for the National Health Commission (NHC), said.

Nearly a quarter of those came from arrivals in Beijing. “Beijing, the capital, still bears the brunt of the risks,” said Xu Hejian, spokesman for the Beijing government, told reporters.

“There’s no reason to lay back and relax yet. It’s not a time when we can say everything is going well.” Most of those imported cases have involved Chinese returning home from abroad.

A total of 3,300 people have now died in mainland China, with a reported 81,439 infections.

China was widely accused of a delayed response when suspected cases first emerged in December. But the world’s most populous country has since won praise from the World Health Organization for its efforts to lock down affected areas and isolate patients.

313 imported cases

In the last seven days, China has reported 313 imported cases of COVID-19 but only six confirmed cases of domestic transmission, NHC’s data showed.

There were 45 new cases reported in the mainland on Saturday, down from 54 on the previous day, with all but one involving travellers from overseas.

Airlines have been ordered to sharply cut international flights from Sunday. And restrictions on foreigners entering the country went into effect on Saturday.

No new cases in Hubei

Five more people died on Saturday, all of them in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province. It has reported only one new case in the last 10 days. Saturday marked the fourth consecutive day that Hubei recorded no new confirmed cases.

The sole case of domestically transmitted virus was recorded in Henan province, bordering Hubei.

With traffic restrictions in the province lifted, Wuhan is also gradually reopening borders and restarting some local transportation services. All airports in Hubei resumed some domestic flights on Sunday, with the exception of Wuhan, which will open to domestic flights on April 8. Flights from Hubei to Beijing remain suspended.

A train arrived in Wuhan on Saturday for the first time since the city was placed in lockdown two months ago.

Restrictions have also been eased on people looking to return to the capital, although the procedure still appears much more vigorous as it’s done on an application approval basis.

7,000 return to Beijing

More than 7,000 have returned to Beijing from Hubei by charted trains or private cars, Mao Jun, a Beijing government official, said on Sunday.

On a cold and rainy Sunday, Wuhan streets and metro trains were still largely empty. The Hubei government said on its official WeChat account that a number of malls in Wuhan, as well as the Chu River and Han Street shopping belt, would be allowed to resume operations on Monday.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lj1rhx/article31200928.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30-CHINA-TESTFORVIRUS3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/beijing-sees-rise-in-imported-cases-as-normalcy-returns-to-wuhan/article31200929.ece

While sightings of dolphins in Venice's canals turned out to be fanciful, they have been popping up in ports elsewhere in the Mediterranean as emboldened wildlife takes “free rein to wander our cities and towns”, said Romain Julliard, head of research at the French Natural History Museum.

He told AFP that foxes were at the vanguard of the new urban explorers. “They change their behaviour very quickly. When a place becomes quiet, they're straight in there.”

Animals 'spring of love'

Animals and birds that normally live in urban parks, like sparrows and pigeons are also more likely to venture beyond their usual territories, Julliard said, “freeing a space for other animals”.

While the dawn and dusk choruses have been bringing comfort to many quarantined city dwellers, the museum's acoustics specialist Jerome Sueur said that doesn't mean there are more urban birds than before.

It is more that with reduced traffic noise we can hear them better. Some, however, “stop singing when there is noise, so now they are letting themselves go.”

“Animals are shaking off human noise pollution,” Sueur said. And the timing could not have been better time as they embark on their mating season.

With the hunting season suspended in several European countries, this promises to be a spring and possibly a summer of love for the animal kingdom.

It is certainly great news for species like the common toad and the spotted salamander. The amorous amphibians are being spared from being ""crushed crossing busy roads"" in their haste to find a mate, said Jean-Noel Rieffel, of the French biodiversity office (OFB).

With few dog walkers to disturb them, baby fawns are also getting an idyllic start to life while birds like Mediterranean gulls who nest along the sandy banks of rivers are being left undisturbed.

In the Calanques National Park overlooking the Mediterranean near France's second city of Marseille, wildlife ""is reclaiming its natural habitat with surprising speed"", said the park's president, Didier Reault.

With walkers and boating banned, ""the puffins who used to stay on the islets in the highest protected areas are not gathering on the sea,"" he said.

Birdwatching to stay sane

And it is the same for plants. Wild orchids — which are supposed to be protected — are often picked by walkers when they blossom in late April and May, said Rieffel. This year they will be spared that fate.

And in the cities and suburbs, unmowed lawns will be a source of ""bounty for bees, bumble bees and butterflies"", Julliard added.

But for him, the biggest change is the effect this is having on humans. ""The most important phenomenon perhaps is our relationship with nature changing — with people locked up in their homes realising how much they miss nature,"" he said.

However, there are also down sides to the lockdown for nature.

Work to limit invasive species has been all but halted, cautioned Loic Obled of the OFB, as well as that to help endangered species.

And when the lockdown finally ends, Rieffel warned that ""people will have a need of nature and there is a risk of too many visitors (to natural parks), which won't be good for the flora and fauna.""

41,2020/03/29,German Minister ends life after ‘virus crisis worries’,"“We are in shock, we are in disbelief and above all we are immensely sad,” Bouffier said in a recorded statement.

Thomas Schaefer, the finance minister of Germany's Hesse state, has ended his life apparently after becoming “deeply worried” over how to cope with the economic fallout from the coronavirus, state premier Volker Bouffier said on Sunday.

Schaefer, 54, was found dead near a railway track on Saturday. The Wiesbaden prosecution's office said they believe he died by suicide.

“We are in shock, we are in disbelief and above all we are immensely sad,” Bouffier said in a recorded statement.

Hesse is home to Germany's financial capital Frankfurt, where major lenders like Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank have their headquarters. The European Central Bank is also located in Frankfurt.

A visibly shaken Bouffier recalled that Schaefer, who was Hesse's finance chief for 10 years, had been working ""day and night"" to help companies and workers deal with the economic impact of the pandemic.

“Today we have to assume that he was deeply worried,” said Bouffier, a close ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel.

“It's precisely during this difficult time that we would have needed someone like him,” he added.

Popular and well-respected, Schaefer had long been touted as a possible successor to Bouffier.

Spain awoke to its third week under near-total lockdown on Sunday, as the government met to approve a strengthening of measures and the coronavirus death toll rose by a record 838 cases overnight to 6,528.

Unions welcomed the measures and business groups CEOE and CEPYME said that while they would comply with the new rule, “it will generate an unprecedented huge impact on the Spanish economy, especially in sectors such as industry”.

The Bangladesh Army on Sunday said its troops would continue to carry out the anti-COVID-19 street campaign to enforce social distancing until the government orders them to return to barracks.

Chief of Army Staff General Aziz Ahmed said that his troops would do “everything possible” under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s leadership to fight the deadly coronavirus pandemic as their presence on the streets appeared to have “highly energised” the common people and the civil administration.

The Army will render its service in aid to civil power as long as the government wants, the Daily Sun newspaper quoted the four-star general as saying.

General Ahmed said that the troops’ deployment seemed to have mentally relieved the people and the officials amid fears about the course of the pandemic in the coming days.

Sheikh Hasina

Prime Minister Hasina called the campaign against COVID-19 a “war” as her government has called out the armed forces to assist nationwide the administration in combating the pandemic in the country.

A defence ministry spokesman, meanwhile, said that some 3,000 military personnel and 400 Navy troopers were deployed across the country mainly to enforce “social distancing” while the Air Force was kept ready for ferrying men and medical aid to any part of Bangladesh.

He said that the new batches of troops will replace periodically the personnel already deployed on the COVID-19 duty while the previous ones would be quarantined on return to their barracks for safety.

Defence ministry’s inter service public relations directorate (ISPR) earlier said that the personnel would prepare lists of coronavirus-infected persons, extend cooperation to the local administrations to ensure quarantining of people who returned from abroad alongside enforcing the social distancing.

The troops are seen patrolling the streets in capital Dhaka and other cities mounting megaphones on their vehicles to ask people to stay indoors and disperse usual neighbourhood crowds.

The virus so far has claimed five lives and infected 48 others in the country, according to the official count but the fears of spread of the virus prompted the government to gradual steps in early March.

Authorities apparently ordered a nationwide virtual lockdown shutting offices, businesses and halting all modes of public transports this week days after closing schools and restricting overseas flight operations.

Bangladesh declared a 10-day nationwide holiday beginning March 26 in view of the COVID-19 outbreak, and called in Army troops to enforce social distancing as the World Health Organisation (WHO) called it the most crucial means to prevent the spread of the virus.

45,2020/03/29,Worlds largest glove maker sees shortage as coronavirus fight spikes,"The World Health Organisation warned on Friday that the “chronic global shortage of personal protective gear” is among the most urgent threats to the virus containment efforts.

Malaysias Top Glove Corporation Bhd, which makes one in every five gloves globally, expects a product shortage as demand from Europe and the United States spikes because of the widening coronavirus outbreak is exceeding its capacity.

The company has extended shipping times to cope with the demand surge, Executive Chairman Lim Wee Chai told Reuters by phone on Friday.

Mr. Lim said orders received in the past few weeks, mainly from Europe and the United States, were almost double the companys production capacity. Top Glove can produce 200 million natural and synthetic rubber gloves a day.

There are now more than 600,000 coronavirus cases across 202 countries and territories globally, with the United States overtaking China as the country with the most infections. Europe continues to report the most deaths.

Some customers panic order; normally they order 10 containers a month but now they suddenly increase to 20 containers, he said.

The World Health Organisation warned on Friday that the “chronic global shortage of personal protective gear” is among the most urgent threats to the virus containment efforts.

Definitely there is a shortage. They order 100% more, we can only increase 20% so there is a shortage of about 50% to 80%, he said.

The exceptional buying momentum could last another three months but orders are expected to remain strong for up to nine months even as demand from Asian markets has started to slow slightly, Lim said.

To cope, the company has adjusted its delivery time from as short as 30 days to as long as 150 days.

Mr. Lim said the company was ensuring all its customers get a fair share of extra gloves delivered.

We manage their volume, limit them to buy so much per customer. We have to manage but it's a good problem for us to solve, he said.

Mr. Lim said the company is adding new machines every week, and could increase its production by as much as 30%.

This month, Top Glove stepped up its factory utilisation by 10% to 95% and expects to reach near maximum utilisation in April.

The company is rushing to source about 1,000 workers to keep up. Top Glove normally hires from Nepal but is now drafting workers from Malaysia because of travel restrictions.

We need about 10% extra workers. During this (travel curbs), we are also not able to bring in workers from Nepal. So we have no choice, we have to use some local workers to help out, in the packing especially.

Top Glove said its supply chain is well-diversified and was optimistic it would not have issues sourcing materials in the next few weeks.

46,2020/03/29,"72-year-old elephant, gifted to U.S. by India, euthanised at Washington zoo","Ambika was captured in the Coorg forest when she was about 8 years old and given to the zoo as a gift from the children of India in 1961.

Ambika, a 72-year-old elephant which was gifted to the U.S. in 1961 on behalf of children of India, was “humanely euthanised” by veterinarians at a national zoo in Washington, officials said on Saturday.

Estimated to be the third oldest Asian elephant in the North American population, Ambika was euthanised at the Smithsonian National Zoo.

“Ambika truly was a giant among our conservation community,” said Steven Monfort, John and Adrienne Mars Director, Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.

In a statement, the zoo said Ambika, the beloved eldest member of its Asian elephant herd, was humanely euthanised on Friday, following a recent and irreversible decline in her health.

Ambika inspired generations to care about Asian elephant conservation. For 59 yrs. she was an ambassador and pioneer, teaching us about behavior, biology, repro. and ecology. She changed the way we care for and conserve elephants. Thanks to her, we are able to save species. pic.twitter.com/g7Tqb4ezGo — National Zoo (@NationalZoo) March 28, 2020

Born in India around 1948, Ambika was captured in the Coorg forest when she was about 8 years old. She worked as a logging elephant until 1961, when she was given to the zoo as a gift from the children of India, the zoo said in a statement.

“Elephant keepers have fondly reflected on Ambika’s sense of humour, particularly during mealtimes, when the persnickety eater would arrange her grains to her liking before eating,”it said.

“For the past five decades, Ambika served as both an ambassador and a pioneer for her species. It is not an exaggeration to say that much of what scientists know about Asian elephant biology, behaviour, reproduction and ecology is thanks to Ambika’s participation in our conservation-research studies, Monfort said.

According to zoo authorities, Ambika had undergone treatment for osteoarthritis, a condition that first developed when she was in her late 60s. Although the condition is incurable, animal care staff took steps to ease Ambika’s pain and help slow the progression of her disease.

“Veterinarians prescribed anti-inflammatories, analgesic medications and various joint supplements, the zoo said.

Last week, keepers noticed that Ambika’s right-front leg developed a curve that weakened her ability to stand.

Though she had some good days and some bad days, staff grew concerned when she chose not to explore her habitat as much as she normally would or engage with her keepers or elephant companions, Shanthi and Bozie, the zoo statement said.

Given Ambika’s extremely old age, decline, physically and socially, and poor long-term prognosis, they felt they had exhausted all treatment options and made the decision to humanely euthanise her, the zoo statement explained.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/400aq1/article31196964.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20160323-25am,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/72-year-old-elephant-gifted-to-us-by-india-euthanised-at-washington-zoo/article31196965.ece
47,2020/03/29,Coronavirus | U.S. agency includes gun sellers as ‘critical’ infrastructure,"The designation by the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is advisory. The agency notes that the designation does not override determinations by individual jurisdictions of what they consider critical infrastructure sectors.

A gun rights group is cheering the Trump administration’s designation of the firearms industry, including retailers, as part of the nation’s critical infrastructure during the coronavirus emergency.

The designation by the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is advisory. The agency notes that the designation does not override determinations by individual jurisdictions of what they consider critical infrastructure sectors.

The firearms industry was not part of the federal agency’s original list of critical infrastructure issued just over a week ago. The designation in an update released Saturday follows a brewing legal battle between gun rights groups and California officials.

The group Gun Owners of America says in a statement Saturday that it is encouraged that the Trump administration is not ignoring what it calls “the ability to protect yourself” during the emergency stemming from the pandemic.

Gun rights groups filed suit last Friday after the Los Angeles County sheriff closed gun stores in the wake of California Gov. Gavin Newsom saying that each of the state’s 58 counties could decide for themselves whether to list firearms dealers as nonessential businesses that should be subject to closure while the state seeks to limit the spread of the virus.

48,2020/03/29,Canadian PM’s wife has recovered from coronavirus illness,"""I am feeling so much better,” Sophie Gregoire Trudeau said in a statement on social media. She said she received the clearance from her doctor and Ottawa Public Health.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s wife said Saturday that she has recovered from being ill from COVID-19 disease caused by the new coronavirus.

""I am feeling so much better,” Sophie Gregoire Trudeau said in a statement on social media. She said she received the clearance from her doctor and Ottawa Public Health.

Trudeau’s office announced on March 12 that she had tested positive for the coronavirus after she fell ill upon returning from a trip to London.

The prime minister and his family have been in self isolation at home since then. He and their three children didn’t show symptoms.

Mr. Justin Trudeau has been giving daily news conferences outside his residence. He said earlier Saturday that his wife was in in fine form.

""From the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you to everyone who reached out to me with their well wishes. And to everyone who is suffering right now, I send you all my love,” she said.

The prime minister suggested on Saturday that he would continue to work from home to set an example for Canadians who are being asked to stay at home.

Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, meanwhile, said Saturday that it is prohibiting gatherings of five people or more. The order was effective immediately and replaced one that prohibited public events of over 50 people. It does not apply to households with five or more people, and funerals will be permitted with up to 10 people at one time.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said if the virus is to be stopped, extraordinary measures are needed to ensure physical distancing. The province has already closed all nonessential services.

Quebec announced police checkpoints in eight regions outside the province’s major cities where the population is deemed more at risk. Quebec Deputy Premier Genevieve Guilbault said that only essential travel will be allowed in those areas and that provincial police have also set up checkpoints near the Canada-U.S. border to intercept snowbirds coming back to Quebec to ensure they understand there is a 14-day quarantine.

49,2020/03/29,Hospitals turn to snorkel masks to ease respirator overload,"As hospitals face an overload of COVID-19 patients struggling to breathe, innovative medical staff are turning to snorkelling masks from sports stores to stop their lungs collapsing.

The idea started in Italy, the European country worst-hit by the coronavirus pandemic, with hospitals in other nations taking note and adding their own specific medical parts to make it work.

One such is the Erasme Hospital on the outskirts of Belgium's capital Brussels. It is attached to the city's ULB university — and through it to a private spin-off, Endo Tools Therapeutics, whose knowhow in 3D printing for medical use has proved invaluable.

""They are to be used for patients with severe respiratory problems. The aim is to avoid having to intubate the trachea of the patient and put them on a respirator,"" said Frederic Bonnier, a respiratory physiotherapist at the hospital who also teaches at the university.

He spearheaded the design of a custom-made valve that fits to the top of full-face masks, where the snorkel is meant to go, allowing them to connect to standard BiPAP machines that feed pressurised air into masks.

This helps prevent the collapse of alveoli, lung air sacs needed for the intake of oxygen into our bodies and the exhalation of carbon dioxide. Pneumonia brought on by COVID-19 inflames the lung membrane and fills those sacs with liquid.

Stop-gap solution

In the worst-case infections, patients have to be hooked up to respirators in intensive-care units.

But respirators are in desperately short supply worldwide because of the sheer number of patients.

The snorkelling mask solution could be a stop-gap measure for patients on the brink of intensive-care treatment but for whom no beds nor respirators are available. Hospital masks for the less-intensive BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) machines are also lacking.

Bonnier said that from Monday he will testing 50 of the masks on patients.

They are the same brand as those used by Italian doctors, donated by the French sportswear retailer Decathlon that has stores worldwide. The masks themselves are made in Italy.

He explained they were far more comfortable than the hospital ones that fit over the nose and mouth, biting into the skin. But he cautioned they were not tested to medical standards, meaning they were one-use only, unable to be sterilised between patients.

The Italian design for the 3D-printed valve also needed reworking.

""It seemed fairly complicated to make, pretty heavy, not very comfortable. So we had the idea to go a little further by thinking on it and developing our own connection part,"" he said.

The new plastic valve connectors have now been 3D-printed and are ready to be tested.

Bonnier added that health workers in COVID-19 wards could also use the masks for protection against the virus. But he fears the public will start panic-buying them, thereby depriving hospitals of a potentially life-saving product.

He also said that, even if the tests prove conclusive, there were still questions about how many such masks could be made available by sporting companies, under what conditions.

Retailer cautious

Learning of the emergency use being made of its snorkelling masks, Decathlon expressed ""interest"" — but also prudence.

""At the moment we don't have confirmation that these solutions really work,"" it said on its Twitter account. ""If we see successful try-outs, and these hospitals confirm to us that some tests work, then we'll keep you informed. But in the meantime, beware of unsourced and unverified information spread on social media in recent days.""",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sf9hfx/article31196747.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001Q85XI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hospitals-turn-to-snorkel-masks-to-ease-respirator-overload/article31196750.ece
50,2020/03/29,North Korea launches apparent ballistic missiles into ocean,"This month's military drills have been conducted despite a border lockdown and quarantine measures imposed in the country

North Korea fired what appeared to be two short-range ballistic missiles into the ocean off its east coast on Sunday, military officials in South Korea and Japan said, the latest in an unprecedented flurry of launches this month.

Two “short-range projectiles” were launched from the coastal Wonsan area, and flew 230 kilometres (143 miles) at a maximum altitude of 30 kilometres (19 miles), South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff reported.

Japan's Ministry of Defense said they appeared to be ballistic missiles, and they did not land in Japanese territory or its exclusive economic zone.

They would be the eighth and ninth missiles launched in four rounds of tests this month as North Korean troops conduct ongoing military drills, usually personally overseen by leader Kim Jong Un.

The last test launch was on March 21. Based on photographs released by North Korean state media at the time, analysts identified those weapons as KN-24 short-range ballistic missiles.

United Nations Security Council resolutions bar North Korea from testing ballistic missiles, and the country has been heavily sanctioned over its missile and nuclear weapons programmes.

This month's military drills have been conducted despite a border lockdown and quarantine measures imposed in North Korea in an effort to prevent an outbreak of the new coronavirus. The politically and economically isolated country has not reported any confirmed cases, though some foreign experts have raised doubts over that.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dayfh9/article31020570.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SOUTHKOREANORHTKOREALAUNCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/north-korea-launches-apparent-ballistic-missiles-into-ocean/article31196697.ece
51,2020/03/29,Coronavirus | Mali records first death hours before election,"The kidnapping of Soumaïla Cissé, the leader of the main opposition party, earlier in the week has also cast a pall over the vote, with a security source saying he is “likely” in the hands of a jihadist group.

3924Mali recorded its first coronavirus death on Saturday, a day before the West African country voted in a long-delayed parliamentary election threatened by both the pandemic and security concerns.

The kidnapping of the leader of the main opposition party earlier in the week has also cast a pall over the vote, with a security source saying he is “likely” in the hands of a jihadist group. Several opposition parties on Saturday called for the vote to be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen 18 people test positive since the country's first case was diagnosed on Wednesday.

Health Minister Michel Sidibe said late Saturday — just hours before polls opened the following day — that a patient who had tested positive had died earlier in the day. “We have a death today,” he said, “because the virus was in his lungs.”

Though sub-Saharan Mali has had relatively few cases so far compared to other continents, the impoverished nation of some 19 million people -- where large swathes of territory lie outside state control -- is just the kind of state experts fear is particularly vulnerable.

Jihadist recordings claim abduction

In an unprecedented and shocking twist just days before the vote, veteran opposition leader Soumaïla Cissé was kidnapped while campaigning in the conflict-ravaged centre of the country.

Mr. Cissé, 70, who has come second in three presidential elections, and six members of his team were abducted on Wednesday in an attack in which his bodyguard was killed.

“According to our information, the opposition leader was likely kidnapped by jihadists from central Mali claiming to be from Amadou Koufa,” a security source said. Fulani preacher Amadou Koufa leads the Katiba Macina jihadist militia, a branch of the al-Qaeda-aligned Group to Support Islam and Muslims (GSIM) group active in central Mali.

Mr. Cissé and his entourage are probably now “far from where they were abducted,” the security source told AFP. A source close to Mr. Cissé also said the opposition leader was in the hands of the Koufa's Katiba Macina. “Not only do we have clear indications from our own sources, but there are also recordings broadcast by the jihadists,” the source said.

Since the abduction, recordings seen by an AFP reporter have circulated on social media in the Fulani and Songhai languages spoken in central and northern Mali of men declaring loyalty to Koufa claiming Cissé’s abduction.

‘Difficult times’

Despite the deepening COVID-19 crisis, Mr. Cissé’s Union for the Republic and Democracy (URD) urged its supporters to turn out in even greater numbers. “In these difficult times our country is going through, more than ever, the party's activists are resolutely urged to redouble their efforts for a massive participation in the March 29, 2020 elections,” the country's main opposition party said Saturday.

But other opposition parties -- the National Congress of Democratic Initiative (CNID), Patriotic Movement for Renewal (MRP) and the CMAS movement of influential imam Mahmoud Dicko — called for the vote to be postponed due to the coronavirus emergency. Three candidates also withdrew from the poll, which will see new MPs elected to the 147-seat National Assembly for the first time since 2013.

The current parliament, which is dominated by President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita’s party — Cissé ’s URD has 18 MPs — was supposed to wrap up in late 2018, but subsequent elections were postponed, mostly over security concerns.

Voters will be supplied with hand-washing kits and masks at Sunday’s elections, as well being made to keep separate from each other, the government has said. After Sunday’s first round vote, a second round is scheduled for April 19.

In neighbouring Mauritania, the government announced Saturday that travel between regions would be banned from noon on Sunday.

52,2020/03/29,Saudi forces intercept missile over Riyadh: State media,"There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but Yemen’s Iran-aligned Huthi rebels have previously launched missiles, rockets and drones on the Saudi capital and other cities.

The Saudi-led military coalition intercepted a missile over Riyadh late Saturday, State media said, after AFP reporters heard three explosions in the capital.

“A ballistic missile was intercepted and destroyed over Riyadh,” State-run Al-Ekhbariya television reported. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but Yemen’s Iran-aligned Huthi rebels have previously launched missiles, rockets and drones on the Saudi capital and other cities.

At least three blasts rattled Riyadh, according to AFP. The assault comes after all parties in Yemen’s long conflict offered support on Thursday for the United Nations’ call for a ceasefire to protect civilians from the novel coronavirus pandemic.

‘Immediate global ceasefire’

Saudi Arabia, the Yemeni government and the rebels all welcomed an appeal from UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres for an “immediate global ceasefire” to help avert disaster for vulnerable people in conflict zones.

The call coincided with the fifth anniversary of regional power Saudi Arabia’s intervention in Yemen’s civil war, at the helm of a military coalition supporting the internationally recognised government against the Huthi rebels.

Yemen’s broken healthcare system has not so far recorded a case of the COVID-19 illness, but aid groups have warned that when it does hit, the impact will be catastrophic in a country already regarded as facing the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.

54,2020/03/29,Taliban says no to Afghan negotiators,"The organisation said the government had failed to put forward an “inclusive” team. “We shall only sit for talks with a negotiation team that conforms with our agreements and is constituted in accordance with the laid out principles,” the statement said.

The Taliban on Saturday rejected an Afghan government negotiation team set up to hold talks with the insurgent group in a bid to end the country’s 18-year-old conflict.

After months of delays, the government on Friday announced a 21-member team — including five women — to take part in the upcoming talks, a crucial step in bringing the warring parties to the table and getting a floundering, U.S.-led peace process back on track.

But the Taliban in a statement said the government had failed to put forward an “inclusive” team. “We shall only sit for talks with a negotiation team that conforms with our agreements and is constituted in accordance with the laid out principles,” the statement said.

“In order to reach true and lasting peace, the aforementioned team must be agreed upon by all effective Afghan sides,” it said, adding that the majority of those involved in the “intra-Afghan” talks had rejected the team, without specifying which parties. Under a deal signed by the U.S. and the Taliban last month, the insurgents agreed to resume talks with the Afghan government and discuss a possible ceasefire.

‘American stooge’

In return, the U.S. and foreign partner forces agreed to withdraw from Afghanistan over the next 14 months. The Taliban had previously refused to meet with the administration of President Ashraf Ghani, calling him an American stooge.

The Kabul government said the negotiating team would be led by former intelligence chief Masoom Stanekzai and include Batur Dostum, whose father Abdul Rashid Dostum — a notorious former warlord — is accused of human rights violations.

It is not clear when or where the “intra-Afghan” talks would start, but the Taliban has not heeded calls for a ceasefire, instead intensifying their attacks across the country. On Friday, the militants attacked several districts of northeastern Badakhshan province, capturing three districts and killing at least 10 Afghan security forces, an official said.

55,2020/03/29,Coronavirus | New York delays Presidential Primary; Trump eyes a quarantine,"All 50 U.S. States have reported some cases of the virus that causes COVID-19, but New York has the most, with over 52,000 positive tests for the illness and over 700 deaths.

As novel coronavirus cases kept rising in the national epicenter of New York, President Donald Trump said Saturday he is considering a quarantine affecting residents of the State, neighbouring New Jersey and Connecticut.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Saturday he wasn’t sure what the President meant but didn’t “like the sound of it.” Meanwhile, Mr. Cuomo postponed New York’s Presidential Primary from April to June, and nurses made anguished pleas for more protective equipment and rebuffed officials’ claims that supplies are adequate.

With New York cases expected to mushroom toward a mid-to-late-April peak, Mr. Cuomo took a manual-pump air mask in hand to show what might lie in store if needed ventilators don’t arrive.

A Tri-State Quarantine?

Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House he was weighing the idea of a quarantine to prevent people in the Tri-State area from travelling for a short time.

All 50 U.S. States have reported some cases of the virus that causes COVID-19, but New York has the most, with over 52,000 positive tests for the illness and over 700 deaths. The federal government has the power to take measures to prevent the spread of communicable diseases among States, but it’s not clear whether that means Mr. Trump can order people not to leave their States.

The President cited requests from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a fellow Republican and outspoken Trump supporter who has complained about New Yorkers coming to his State amid the outbreak and ordered them to isolate themselves on arrival for 14 days.

Mr. Trump said he had spoken with Mr. Cuomo, but the Democratic governor said there had been no talk of a quarantine when the two spoke Saturday morning. “I don’t even know what that means, I don’t know how that could be legally enforceable, and from a medical point of view, I don’t know what you would be accomplishing,” Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference, “I don’t like the sound of it.”

‘Elections unwise’

Mr. Cuomo said he was delaying the State’s Presidential Primary from April 28 to June 23, when the State plans to hold legislative congressional and local party primaries. “I don’t think it’s wise to be bringing people to one location to vote” on the April date, he said.

New York joins over a dozen States that have delayed some elections. A smaller group including Ohio, Georgia, Louisiana, Connecticut, Maryland, Rhode Island, Indiana and Kentucky have also postponed their presidential primaries.

The governor’s decision came as election commissioners across New York warned they were “risking” their health and safety to meet impending deadlines for testing machines and preparing ballots ahead of the April 28 date.

Nurses appeal for masks

At a news conference outside city-run Jacobi Hospital, nurses called for more masks and other gear to safeguard themselves against the virus that has so far sickened more than 29,000 people and killed over 500 in the city. At least one healthcare worker, Mount Sinai West assistant nursing manager Kious Kelly, 36, has died of the virus. Others also have fallen ill around the metropolitan region.

Jacobi nurses said managers at the Bronx hospital have been rationing protective equipment, making them unable to change out the high-end particle-filtering masks known as N95s as often as they should. Two Jacobi nurses are “fighting for their lives in the ICUs right now,” paediatric nurse Sean Petty said, blaming a scarcity of equipment.

City officials have insisted there’s enough protective equipment for roughly the next week, though they’re worried for the weeks after. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city delivered 200,000 N95 masks to hospitals Friday, with 800,000 more to come Saturday, along with loads of less-protective surgical masks and other gear. The United Nations announced Saturday it was donating 250,000 face masks to the city.

Reusable air filters

The city hospital system’s president, Dr. Mitchell Katz, said at a news conference Friday that staffers working exclusively with coronavirus patients could conserve supplies of N95 masks by wearing one throughout their shifts, overlaid with surgical masks that can be changed more frequently. Some healthcare workers have chosen to wear helmets with reusable air filters — somewhat like “a Darth Vader mask,” he said.

In some patient-care settings, a surgical mask will suffice, he said, but workers who prefer N95s can use them. Petty said policies on protective equipment were being driven by shortages, not science, and he slammed officials as subjecting medical workers to avoidable risks. “We will not let any health official or government official say that we have enough” protective equipment, he said, “until every health care worker has an N95 for every time they interact with a COVID-19 patient.”

Manual air masks

As the State continues scrambling to try to amass 30,000 ventilators ahead of a projected mid-to-late-April peak in coronavirus cases, Mr. Cuomo bluntly illustrated the alternative-masks with manually operated air bags. “If we have to turn to this device on any large-scale basis, that is not an acceptable situation,” Mr. Cuomo said, “so we go back to finding the ventilators.”

The number of coronavirus deaths in Britain jumped by 260 in one day to pass 1,000, official data showed Saturday, the day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson himself tested positive.

The death toll was 1,019 at 5:00 p.m. (1700 GMT) on Friday, up from 759 at the same time on Thursday, the most recent Health Ministry figures showed. More than 17,000 people have also tested positive for COVID-19, including Johnson and his health minister, Matt Hancock, who are both now self-isolating with “mild” symptoms.

Britain was put on lockdown this week to try to stem the spread of the virus, with everybody in the country told to stay home wherever possible, and all non-essential shops and services shut. The State-run National Health Service has been frantically freeing up hospital beds, and is building a 4,000-bed field hospital in a London conference centre, which is due to open next week.

But there are still fears it cannot cope, and a senior NHS official said on Friday that hospitals in London — the epicentre of the U.K. outbreak — were facing a “tsunami” of patients. Stephen Powis, medical director of the NHS in England, told the daily Downing Street news conference on Saturday that it was coping.

“We have not reached capacity. I'm also confident that capacity is expanding, particularly in London, so that we keep ahead of increased patient numbers,” he said. However, he added that “now is not the time to be complacent”, saying it was vital that everybody followed the advice to stay at home.

“We will see over the course of the next month exactly how that will play out,” he said.

Burberry hospital gowns

Amid anger among many medics at a lack of kit, the government has asked manufacturers to switch to making ventilators, scrubs and personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks.

The Royal Mint is one of those taking up the challenge, switching production from coins to medical visors. Luxury fashion house Burberry also announced it was converting its trench coat factory in Yorkshire, northern England, to make non-surgical gowns and masks for patients.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma said Saturday that the government would speed up the process of testing new PPE. It would also reduce red tape so that new suppliers of hand sanitiser “will be able to bring their products to market in a matter of days”.

‘No gaps in government’

In a video message on Friday from Downing Street, where he lives and works, Johnson said he would continue to lead the government's response to the outbreak.

He remotely chaired a meeting on the crisis on Saturday morning, Sharma said. “There are no gaps in the government. We are collectively all working very hard, led by the prime minister,” the business secretary insisted.

Media reports said Johnson’s pregnant partner, Carrie Symonds, who normally lives with him, moved several days ago to the couple's south London home to self-isolate there. Another cabinet minister, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack, revealed on Saturday that he too was confined to his home after experiencing symptoms, but has not been tested.

England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty, another key player in the UK's response, also said Friday that he was in self-isolation after experiencing symptoms of COVID-19.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/j7fyak/article31195819.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29AFPUK0001Q9051,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-uk-deaths-surge/article31195820.ece

Sri Lanka on Saturday reported its first COVID-19 death, of a 65-year-old patient, who had diabetes and renal health complications, Health Ministry officials said. The island nation has 113 confirmed coronavirus patients so far.

Sri Lanka’s health officials have also detected four COVID-19 positive cases in people who recently returned from Chennai, prompting authorities to term Chennai a “high-risk” zone.

“Two cases detected today and two more cases from earlier this week were all Chennai returnees, Chennai is definitely a high-risk zone” Director-General of Health Services told The Hindu on Saturday. The government has asked all those returned from Chennai in the last 14 days to report to health authorities for quarantine.

Mid-March, Sri Lanka reported four persons — an Indian tourist and three Sri Lankans — who tested positive on arrival from India. With the latest detections, a total of eight cases have originated from India, according to authorities. Nine patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital, according to an official bulletin.

58,2020/03/29,"Coronavirus | France reports 319 more deaths, toll becomes 2,314","The number counts only those who died in hospital — not retirement homes or at home — while only those deemed at high risk are currently being tested.

France on Saturday reported 319 more deaths caused by the coronavirus, bringing the total toll of the epidemic in the country to 2,314.

Prime Minister Edouard Philippe warned that the “battle” against the virus in France was only just starting, warning the first two weeks in April would be even tougher than the last fortnight of March.

There are now 37,575 cases of coronavirus infection in France, up 4,611 on the day before, according to a daily update published by the government. There are now 17,620 people in hospital, with 4,273 of them in intensive care, it added.

Both the death toll and the number of infections are likely higher than the official figures. The number of those who died counts only those who died in hospital — not retirement homes or at home — while only those deemed at high risk are currently being tested.

“I want to say how things are with clarity and frankness. The battle is only starting,” said Mr. Philippe at a news conference with Health Minister Olivier Veran to outline the government's strategy.

“The first 15 days of April will be even more difficult than the 15 days that are coming to an end now,” the Prime Minister said. He said France's twin aims were to increase its intensive care capacities and to flatten the curve of the virus's spread.

Ramping up testing

Mr. Veran vowed that France would ramp up its testing in the weeks to come, promising that there would be 50,000 traditional tests and 30,000 rapid ones carried out daily by the end of April.

He said that after placing an order for five million rapid tests, France would be able to carry out 100,000 such tests daily by June.

With the government criticised for a lack of sanitary masks -- especially for health workers -- Veran added that France had now ordered a billion of them, including notably from China. He said that France was only able to produce eight million masks a week. “Our reserves are not infinite,” he added.

The pair's press conference in Paris was given to just one journalist, who pooled questions from colleagues, as a health precaution. France has been in lockdown since March 17 in a bid to slow the spread of the epidemic and officials have repeatedly warned it will take time for the measures to bear fruit.

59,2020/03/29,Olbers and the discovery of the brightest asteroid,"On March 29, 1807, Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers, a German astronomer and physician, discovered 4 Vesta. Now known to be the brightest asteroid occasionally visible to the naked eye, 4 Vesta is one of many asteroids between Mars and Jupiter. A.S.Ganesh talks about Olbers and the asteroids he discovered...

You must have surely heard about asteroids, a class of objects in the solar system. Small, rocky objects that orbit the sun, these asteroids are, however, much smaller than the planets. Remnants left over from the early formation of our solar system, the current known asteroid count is over 9,50,000. Most of these asteroids exist in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. They vary in size, starting from 4 Vesta, the largest at about 530 km in diameter, to those less than 10 m across.

Titius-Bode law

If we are to look at the discovery of 4 Vesta, then we would have to start from late in the 18th Century. Based on their calculations, German astronomers Johann Daniel Titius and Johann Elert Bode came up with a mathematical expression, known now as the Titius-Bode law.

Astronomers were curious as these calculations could predict the positions of the planets then known. There was one exception though, as the Titius-Bode law suggested that there should be a planet between Mars and Jupiter. When British astronomer William Herschel discovered Uranus in 1781, again at a distance that corresponded to that predicted by the Titius-Bode law, excitement among astronomers reached fever pitch.

Celestial Police

It was no surprise therefore that a group of astronomers got together in Germany to hunt down the missing planet between Mars and Jupiter. With an objective to search the skies for as long as was needed to catch what they were looking for, they started calling themselves Celestial Police.

One of the astronomers in the Celestial Police was Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers. Born in 1758 at a village near Bremen, Olbers was enthusiastic about science from a young age. He studied Medicine at Gottingen and set up practice in Bremen at the age of 23. Apart from his medical practice, he did his astronomical work in the upper part of his house, which he had made up for observing the night sky.

Piazzi finds Ceres

It was Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi, however, who discovered what he believed to be the missing planet on January 1, 1801. Named Ceres, it was tracked down for a while before it went behind the sun.

Back then, it was still unknown as to how to recover a lost solar system object whose orbit was only partially known. Young German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, who would go on to become a close friend of Olbers, showed off his skills by coming up with a method to identify the orbit with limited observations.

Pallas and Vesta

Using Gauss’ method, Olbers was able to observe Ceres later in 1801. He continued to follow Ceres’ movements day after day and on March 28, 1802, he spotted a similar object. Now called 2 Pallas (the number indicating the order of discovery), it can even be considered the first asteroid to be discovered (Ceres, or 1 Ceres as it was called when considered the first asteroid to be discovered, was promoted to the status of dwarf planet in 2006).

After German astronomer Karl Ludwig Harding discovered 3 Juno in 1804, Olbers made an asteroid discovery again on March 29, 1807. He gave Gauss, who had computed its orbit, the honour of naming the asteroid and he called it Vesta after the goddess of hearth and household in Roman mythology. With these discoveries, it became obvious that a belt of asteroids existed between Mars and Jupiter and that this collection of space debris was, in fact, what was considered the missing planet.

Apart from being the largest asteroid in the main asteroid belt, 4 Vesta is also the brightest and can even be spotted with the naked eye on occasions. It is the second most massive body in the main asteroid belt – behind only Ceres – and accounts for almost 9 % of the total mass of all asteroids. With a crust, mantle and core like our Earth, 4 Vesta is nearly spherical, making it almost a dwarf planet.

***

Olbers’ paradox

Apart from discovering two asteroids and working as a physician, Olbers also had time to point out a paradox in 1823.

Olbers asked a simple question: why is the sky dark at night? He reasoned that given there are infinite stars in the sky, the sky should always be bright everywhere as our line of sights would eventually terminate in a star, irrespective of where we look in space.

While there is no straightforward resolution to the paradox, modern cosmologists maintain that as the universe is ever- expanding, the light that was once bright from the early universe might be stretched to other wavelengths by the time it reaches us. They also mention the fact that the universe we perceive is only 14 billion years old and so any line of sight that goes beyond that will not intercept a star.

Even though Olbers wasn’t the first to pose this paradox and there were many before him who had raised this question, it now bears his name and is referred to as Olbers’ paradox.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/9qyzmm/article31106450.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29istbHeinrichWilhelmOlbers2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/olbers-and-the-discovery-of-the-brightest-asteroid/article31106454.ece
60,2020/03/29,Narayanasamy express concern over violation of lockdown rules,"Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Sunday expressed serious concern over the rampant violation of lockdown rules by the locals .

Talking to newsmen here, he said that the markets and meat stalls were teeming with large number of people during his surprise visit to some of the areas.

This should not be permitted as transmission of the virus was now alarming and the disease had claimed the lives of several hundred across the world.

Though Puducherry was now COVID-19 free, this should not mean that we can take the situation for granted, he said.

Mr. Narayanasamy announced that the Big Market located in the heart of the town would be closed and sale of vegetables, fish and mutton would be decentralised in nine new centres from Monday.

Social distancing is the only solution to prevent the spread of the infection. But people of Puducherry are not aware of the strategy and are moving about and swarming around the shops, posing a threat to society and also to themselves, he said.

He said that around 1125 people have been kept under home quarantine in Puducherry. There were reports that some were coming out of there houses and roaming about.

Steps have been taken to trace them and cases would be registered against these persons, he said.

Police have registered cases against 280 persons for flouting the lockdown rules. Around 240 vehicles had been impounded as they were found zooming around for no valid reason.

Mr. Narayanasamy said that he was shocked to see youngsters roaming about on their two wheelers unnecessarily. He appealed to the people to stay at home as isolation was the only effective strategy to protect oneself against the infection.

Meanwhile, the opposition AIADMK has given notice to table a motion to discuss the situation arising out of the COVID 19 during the Assembly session Monday.

Leader of the legislature wing of the AIADMK A. Anbalagan said that he had submitted the motion to the Secretary to the Assembly seeking permission to allow the motion for a detailed discussion on steps the government had taken and should have taken to prevent spread of the infection.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/narayanasamy-express-concern-over-violation-of-lockdown-rules/article31200930.ece
61,2020/03/29,"Govt. opens shelter for migrant workers, urban homeless in Puducherry","The Government has made operational a shelter for migrant workers and urban homeless at Gorimedu and is exploring means to provide refuge to more such labourers who are stranded far away from home due to the nation-wide lockdown to check transmission of the novel coronavirus.

The shelter, which was readied by converting the existing community hall, is housing 69 migrant workers and other homeless people, primarily bystanders of JIPMER patients. Food, bedding and other essentials have been provided to the occupants, who are also under health supervision.

Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy, who made an inspection of the shelter, said, ""We have asked industries to provide shelter for migrant labourers at their sites in industrial areas such as Sedarapet. The Government is ready to open more such shelters if the need arises"".

There are an estimated 3,000 migrant workers employed across various sectors, such as construction, steel and packaging industries in Puducherry.

Though the community centre has a capacity for 200, only about half that number can be accomodated in a situation such as this when there is so much importance on spacing, said Suriya, a volunteer from the Oulgaret-based NGO Virthu, which also runs the night shelter opposite JIPMER.

""We also plan to start skilling initiatives in making sanitisers and incense sticks,"" she said.

The population comprises workers hailing primarily from Odisha, and to a lesser extent, West Bengal.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has allowed States/UTs to dip into the State Disaster Relief Fund for relief measures during the lockdown phase.

63,2020/03/29,Coronavirus | Iranian artistes write open letter on COVID-19 and U.S. sanctions,"The letter, whose signatories include stalwarts of cinema such as Majid Majidi, speaks of the debilitating effect of the sanctions on Iran in the country’s fight against the pandemic saying that ‘its breaths are limited by inhumane global sanctions’

A group of artistes from Iran have written a moving open letter to the artiste community of the world about the despairing COVID-19 pandemic in Iran, aggravated in the light of the U.S.-led Security Council sanctions. The signatories — 302 as of March 28 — include stalwarts of cinema such as Majid Majidi and Rakshan Banietemad, popular actor-filmmaker-writer Niki Karimi, actor Babak Karimi and Shahab Hosseini who won the best actor award at Cannes Film Festival in 2016 for Asghar Farhadi’s celebrated film, The Salesman.

“The people of Iran are facing a crisis today; the Corona crisis you are aware of, as well as the ‘Crisis of Unjust Imposed Sanctions’ you might not be aware of,” the artistes’ letter states. There is implicit hope that their global counterparts would be able to influence public opinion and politicians so that they’d act before it’s too late. Iran is currently fighting the worst Corona outbreak in the Middle East.

The letter starts off by saying that artistes, no matter what their nationality, are “citizens of a borderless utopia called ‘art’ which exists in a world entitled ‘culture’ ”. They strive to improve their nations with their collective works and have talent to influence people and make them understand issues. “Regardless of our religious backgrounds and ideologies, using our individual tastes, styles and cultural characteristics, we all create narratives and images with our works of art; for peace over war, knowledge over ignorance, good over evil, and of course for our salvation and resurrection,” the letter states.

It goes on to say that though global politics and its superpowers have created gaps to keep the artistes separated, they have become stronger and more determined in transferring their collective messages of humanity and peace to the world.

It talks of everyone, regardless of their geographic or political situation, coming face to face with a common enemy — COVID-19. “We are all equally vulnerable to this microscopic adversary. The salvation of one, depends on the salvation of all. Corona is not just a virus, it is a simple and historic question that is waiting for complex answers from the people and governments of the world.” It then goes on to focus on the debilitating effect of the sanctions on Iran in the country’s fight against the pandemic saying that “its breaths are limited by inhumane global sanctions”.

“This crisis shall pass too, with small or catastrophic losses, but the collection of tales will remain as well. The stories of exhausted nurses dancing in contaminated hospital hallways to raise the morale of patients, as they hide their worries about the lack of medicines and basic hospital facilities; stories of physicians who haven’t been home in weeks and are forced to work without masks, gloves, gowns as they search for Corona victims in the hallways of the hospitals. These will all remain in the micro-historical memories of our time, and will be heard by all, sooner or later, either from us or from you all,” it states.

Hoping that it will not be too late for influential and unified artistes of the world to tell the stories of the injustices towards the Iranian people, so that the powerful politicians of the world may make the right choices, it informs them that a large number of infected victims (including the elderly who are the most vulnerable) are facing shortages of medical supplies. It ends with questions posited to the artistes of the world — “What do you think? What do you say? And what will you do?”",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lmr3o5/article31196910.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRAN,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/coronavirus-iranian-artistes-write-open-letter-on-covid-19-and-us-sanctions/article31196911.ece
64,2020/03/29,"Juventus players, coach Sarri agree pay cut due to coronavirus","The agreement comes at a time when many clubs around Europe have had to cut wage bills due to the spread of the virus.

Juventus players and coach Maurizio Sarri have reached an agreement over a wage reduction that will save the Italian champions 90 million euros ($100.26 million), the Serie A club announced on Saturday.

Sarri and the first-team players have agreed what amounts to a four-month pay reduction to help Italy's most successful club during the coronavirus crisis.

The effective one-third cut to the players' annual salaries will mean a huge drop in wages for a squad headed by marquee Portuguese player Cristiano Ronaldo, the best-paid footballer in Italy who is reported to earn 31 million euros a year.

The agreement comes at a time when many clubs around Europe have had to cut wage bills because of the dramatic impact of matches having had to be postponed or played behind closed doors due to the spread of the virus.

“The economic and financial effects of the understanding reached are positive for about 90 million euros for the 2019/2020 financial year,” Juventus said in a statement.

“The understanding provides for the reduction of the compensation for an amount equal to the monthly payments of March, April, May and June 2020”, it added, saying personal agreements with Sarri and the players will be finalised in the coming weeks.

The Turin-based club, in one of the regions hit hardest by the crisis, have suffered in recent weeks with three of their players having tested positive for the virus — forward Paulo Dybala, defender Daniele Rugani and midfielder Blaise Matuidi.

Soccer around the world has been brought to a standstill by the pandemic with Italy having suffered more than 10,000 deaths from the virus, the highest number in any country.

Italy's top-fight Serie A league has been suspended since March 9 with Juventus, seeking a ninth successive title, leading the league by one point from Lazio with 12 games each remaining.

Health emergency

“Juventus Football Club S.p.A. announces that, due to the current global health emergency (which) is preventing the performance of the sporting activity, it has reached an understanding with the players and the coach of the First Team regarding their compensation for the residual portion of the current sport season,” the club statement said.

“The understanding provides for the reduction of the compensation for an amount equal to the monthly wages of March, April, May and June 2020. In the coming weeks, personal agreements with the players and the coach will be finalised, as required by the current regulations. Should the current season's matches be rescheduled, the Club will negotiate in good faith with the players and the coach conditional increases of compensation according to the actual resumption and finalisation of official competitions. Juventus would like to thank the players and the coach for their commitment at a difficult time for everyone,” it read.

Long-standing defender Giorgio Chiellini led the players' negotiations amid reports in the Italian media that Ronaldo had agreed to sacrifice 3.8 million euros of his yearly wage to ease the financial burden on the club while Italy is in lockdown.

The agreement comes the day after leading Spanish club Atletico Madrid took the decision to cut the wages of their staff, including the players, to ease the financial burden on the club.

Atletico joined La Liga rivals Barcelona, who imposed a compulsory wage reduction on their players during the period of lockdown after Spain became the second-most affected country by the coronavirus in Europe behind Italy.

Customers continued to flock the Woraiyur vegetable market on Saturday and Sunday though there was no visible arrangements for social distancing. The market, where vegetables and meat are sold side by side by vendors, continues to function despite the instruction issued by the district administration to close down.

The activities at the market on Sunday could easily prompt one to assume that the 21-day lockdown has been lifted.

Business went on as usual with vegetables, fruits and meat being sold to large crowds at the market, located on Walajah Road near C.S.I mission Hospital.

As the produce bring sold was ‘reasonably priced’, the lack of arrangements at the location did not seem to bother the customers. “We are wearing masks, and will not be affected by the virus”, a customer said.

S. Sharmila, a resident of Ramalinga Nagar, said that the market has continued to function despite the lockdown.

“Early mornings are the busiest time. Some people come in the evening as well,” she says. Residents in Woraiyur area are not unduly worried about availability of fruits and vegetables due to the functioning of the market, she added.

A vendor said that instruction from the administration to close the market was applicable only on March 22. “We did not sell anything that day, and did not earn anything that day. How long do you want us to starve?” she wondered.

Meanwhile, authorities said that small grocery shops and departmental stores were allowed to function while retail vegetable vendors have been asked to conduct transactions at designed spots.

ID cards have also been issued. Four locations- Cauvery Bridge, Anna Stadium, Thennur Uzhavar Sandhai and Madhuram Ground will function as makeshift markets from 6 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. from Monday onwards.

“No other markets are allowed. Those violating the norms will be punished,” District Collector S. Sivarasu said. He also issued a warning to motorists stating that fines will be imposed if more than one person is found travelling on a two-wheeler or four-wheeler. The vehicles will also be seized, he said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/2fnsih/article31200563.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY30WORAIYURTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/its-business-as-usual-at-woraiyur-market/article31200564.ece

70,2020/03/29,Soon robots will serve patients in isolation wards,"A Tiruchi-based private company will shortly hand over 10 robots programmed for responding to voice commands to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital here where the machines would be deployed for serving food and medication to patients at the COVID-19 isolation wards.

A team of 20 engineers from Propeller Technologies, a robotics and artificial intelligence research company, has been manufacturing ‘Zafi’ , a voice-activated robot with built-in internet and other facilities as a learning assistant for school children. It was also being used in hotels and restaurants to serve food to customers.

“We have 10 robots, including a delivery rover, which were to be delivered to a customer. Due to the 21-day lockdown, we could not hand it over. Since we have the robots on hand, we decided to provide them to our district administration as a contribution towards the fight against COVID-19”, said Aashik Rahman, founder and CEO, Propeller Technologies.

A team of engineers, including Mr. Rahman, demonstrated the functioning of the voice-activated robot to Collector S. Sivarasu on Sunday morning. ‘Zafi’ can carry a load up to 7 kilos and can be controlled up to a distance of 250 metres they said. The rover can be used to transport luggage, food packets and other essentials.

The voice-activated function in the robot responds to patients’ queries after finding answers through Internet search. It can also record messages which can be played to the doctor, Mr. Rahman said.

The robots were tested at the MGMGH by nurses and doctors later in the day to understand the functioning in real-time. Speaking to the engineers, Mr. Sivarasu agreed to take the machines after certain modifications.

71,2020/03/29,Coronavirus | Relief for policemen with health complications,"A detailed list of such police personnel has been compiled by the law enforcing authorities in Tiruchi Range encompassing Tiruchi, Pudukottai, Ariyalur, Karur, and Perambalur districts.

With strict enforcement under way at various public locations in the wake of prohibitory order issued under CrPC Section 144 to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the law enforcing authorities in Tiruchi Range have spared personnel above 55 years of age afflicted with diabetes and high blood pressure from patrolling and other kinds of hectic work.

A detailed list of such police personnel has been compiled by the law enforcing authorities in Tiruchi Range encompassing Tiruchi, Pudukottai, Ariyalur, Karur, and Perambalur districts.

Around 60 personnel have been identified in the jurisdiction of Tiruchi Rural Police for being spared from patrolling.

Instead, the identified police personnel have been entrusted with lighter duty such as working in police station and carrying out administrative works, say police sources.

This move has been put in place keeping in mind the health of the police personnel.

Even those found with heart ailments have been entrusted with lighter duties, the sources added.

In Ariyalur district, over 30 such police personnel have been identified, while in Pudukottai over 100 personnel have been identified. The numbers of such personnel in Karur and Perambalur districts were a little over 30 and 20 respectively. A senior police officer said this move was put in place from Friday onwards. Ever since the prohibitory orders were issued, police personnel were being posted in shifts at vantage locations across the range for stricter enforcement.

In Tiruchi Rural Police jurisdiction alone, the law enforcers have created 35 check posts where teams of police personnel have been deployed in shifts to strictly enforce the prohibitory orders and initiate action against the violators.

Similarly, check posts have also been functioning in the other districts in Tiruchi Range where cases for violating the prohibitory orders were also being registered besides carrying out confiscation of vehicles.

Besides initiating action against the violators, the law enforcers were also simultaneously carrying out campaigns in interior parts of Tiruchi and other districts appealing to the general public to remain indoors in order to check the spread of COVID-19 and explaining the reason for promulgation of the prohibitory orders.

Over 200 vehicles belonging to the police, revenue and those provided by the local body representatives were being utilised to carry out the awareness campaigns in the rural pockets in Tiruchi, the sources said.

Senior police officers say a list of senior citizens staying alone in various districts in Tiruchi Range had been compiled and steps were being taken to lend medical-related assistance and others to the aged persons. The list compiled by the police contains a little over 1,600 such senior citizens.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/8fhxmj/article31202017.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY30POLICETRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/policemen-with-health-complications-spared-from-gruelling-tasks/article31199704.ece

A section of people seems to be unaware about the seriousness of COVID 19 outbreak. There are indications there is ignorance in the society on factors such as how social distancing and personal hygiene are linked to community transmission.

More importantly, returnees of foreign countries put under home quarantine need to make sure that they do not venture out, in order to break the chain of COVID 19 spread. This is the time to cooperate fully with the Prime Minister and Chief Minister to arrest the spread of the virus.

Kudos to the administration

Health and Revenue departments deserve to be lauded for taking safety precautions against COVID -19 outbreak in the city limits and 507 village panchayats in Tiruchi district.

The police, revenue, and health departments are ensuring the safety of the people through advocating self-discipline, wearing of masks and washing hands properly. While facilitating the people to purchase vegetables and groceries, the departments have been rightly cautioning the people against getting lulled into a sense of complacency with the warning that the worst is yet to come

Amma Canteens, the sole solace

At a time when the nation is at a war against novel coronavirus, Amma Canteens are providing solace to the poor by continuing to provide breakfast, lunch and supper at nominal costs. People in the lowest rung of the social strata are entirely dependent on Amma Canteens for survival. Hence, it is imperative that the utensils are cleaned with hot water and employees are provided with protection paraphernalia like masks and gloves.

Address nutritional insufficiency

Gaps in immunisation are the cause for all kinds of diseases, and for COVID 19, a need has arisen for the government to provide the poor with nutrients and additional food supplements to improve their immunity level. Mere isolation of the people without proper diagnosis will put entire families at immense mental stress, constant panic, anxiety and fear, and lead to sleepless nights.

The authorities should consider permitting the people under home quarantine to perform last rites of their near and dear friends. Stringent police action was necessary against those spreading rumours.

S. Prakash

Tiruchi

Arrange for food supplies

In the wake of COVID 19 scare, only doctors and other healthcare professionals are found to be on their feet for containment of the spread. The State Government ought to have thought of deploying employees of Cooperative Department to supply essential commodities at the doorsteps in lorries.

Keeping people indoors in healthy conditions is an essential pre-requisite for preventing spread of the virus in the community. While deployment of police force on the streets would indeed help in checking unnecessary movement of people, the administration has to necessarily think of means to ensure food supplies for the public.

Avoid merciless beating

Rather than indulging in merciless beating, the police could as well confiscate vehicles in the event of motorists found violating the prohibitory order issued under Section 144 of IPC.

The lathi charge on the violators only indicates that police are taking law into their hands while dealing with both adults and younger people.

The police need to be reminded that corporal punishment is an offence in schools.

The effectiveness of the nationwide lockdown following the call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a robust indication that the country will be united at the time of uncontrollable crisis despite the diversity of politics, religion, caste and culture.

Prime Minister Modi's clarion call to the nation to stand united in not breaching the Lakshman Rekha of their homes for 21 days with determination, resolve and restraint has infused self confidence and strong hope in the minds of the people to fight the spread of the virus.

Due to strict adherence to the principles of Vedanta, India has preserved its race, hoary culture and valuable traditions.

It is the responsibility of every individual to follow the advice of the Prime Minister strictly, realising that personal distancing must scrupulously be adhered to against the backdrop of the fact that the country does not have the infrastructure to deal with a massive surge in coronavirus cases.

Aid for physically challenged

While the gesture of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to increase the monthly subsistence allowance to priests over 60 years of age who had served for more than 20 years in village temples that are not under the control of HR and CE department is laudable, the government would also do well to increase the monthly assistance to the physically challenged people who have none to lobby and espouse their cause.

It is unfair to equate the monthly assistance for the physically challenged people with the amount given to old age pensioners. The physically challenged people must be given monthly assistance at least on par with the amount given to temple priests.

Focus on sanitation

The Chief Minister's announcement in the Assembly about schemes pertaining to drinking water supply, and drainage projects is heartening. The funds for improving sanitation must be allotted without delay, and the works also must be initiated at the earliest.

More importantly, the government has to make sure that the roads are relaid flawlessly after completing the works.

The sanitation infrastructure must be extended to rural areas, and the progression of the work must be constantly monitored.

The announcement made by the Chief Minister must not just remain on paper.

Speaking to The Hindu on Friday, N.Veerasekaran, coordinator, Ayyan Vaical Pasantharar Sangam, had complained over fertilizer shops in the city and elsewhere in the district remaining closed.

“Farmers need fertilizers and pesticides for banana, sugarcane and blackgram crops. But most of the shops, especially on Thanjavur Road near Ganadhi Market in Tiruchi and other parts of the city, were closed apparently as the police were strictly enforcing the curfew,” he said.

However, senior officials said the Collector, based on guidelines from the Central and State governments, had issued clear instructions that the fertilizer shops could remain open and there was no bar on inter-district transport of fertilizers.

The Collector had also got in touch with the City Police Commissioner and Superintendent of Police, and requested them to instruct police personnel to allow fertilizer shops to function. The Agro Inputs Dealers Association had also been informed of the decision, the official said.

According to the department sources, there were 98 wholesale dealers and 442 retail dealers in the district. Action had been initiated to ensure that the shops were allowed to function. Some dealers may be hesitant to open the shops on account of health concerns, officials said.

According to police, Kadher Masthan, 62, Mansoor 61, Mohaideen, 57, and Siddiq, 62, undertook a ‘Thapleek jamaath’ trip to New Delhi during the second week of this month.

Meanwhile, following the demise of a 54-year-old man in Madurai due to COVID-19 infection, police have been instructed to keep tabs on those undertaking ‘thapleek jamath’ as the Madurai man had organised a congregation in Madurai Anna Nagar mosque by inviting a ‘thapleek jamaath’ from Thailand.

Two members of the Thailand group have tested positive for COVID-19 virus and are under observation at the Government Hospital at Perundurai near Erode.

On receiving a tip-off that the group of four from Muthupettai were likely to return to Muthupettai from Delhi on Thursday early morning, the police tightened screening of vehicles at the border areas of Tiruvarur. The group was found approaching Muthupettai via Adhiramapattinam in Thanjavur district and intercepted at Thambikottai police check post on Wednesday night. When questioned about their trip, the group members gave contradicting replies.

Further enquiries revealed their travel history and when the police asked them to undergo medical tests, they resisted.

When the CSG personnel checked the Koraiyaru estuary on Friday, they found a fisherman bringing in the catch. When intercepted, he allegedly pushed aside the police and moved on towards the fish market.

Authorities have specially purchased Smartphones for this purpose.

Speaking to The Hindu, a senior prison official said the prisoners were visibly unhappy after the main gate of the prison was locked on March 17. “They began to have concerns about their family members, especially about aged parents and grandparents,” he said. Although the prison has a telephone booth, many longed for face-to-face interaction, he said adding, some began to worry that their families were lying about their well-being during phone conversations.

So the authorities decided to buy two Smartphones on Wednesday and have put them for use by allowing the prisoners to talk to their family members on video calls. “We did not want to bother the government for more funds in these troubled times and used the money available for prisoners’ care,” the official said.

The authorities fed the phone with listed and verified phone numbers of family members of the over 1,400 prisoners.

The Excise and Prohibition Department officials have amped up their work across the district in a bid to clamp down on ID liquor. So far, they have destroyed 36,215 litres of FJ wash, a component used in making ID liquor.

They have also seized 897 litres ID liquor, 30 kg of jaggery, nine vehicles, arrested 84 persons and booked 103 cases. The officials have also seized 78.6 litres non-duty paid liquor and 7.8 litres of beer along with 9.15 litres of unauthorised liquor.

Kurnool Deputy Commissioner of Excise and Prohibition G. Chennakesava Rao told The Hindu they had also actively taken up counselling on COVID-19. “There is trend of people across villages to purchase ID liquor. We have been counselling villagers about the disease to make sure that they stay put and follow lockdown rules,” he added.

Talking about hotspots in the district, Mr. Rao said, “We have also identified areas where ID liquor is being sold in a large scale and have been constantly raiding these areas.” Apart from that, the authorities have sealed a few jaggery godowns in the district to restrict production of ID liquor.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/6c24yj/article31196786.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29VJLIQUOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/excise-department-intensifies-raids/article31196787.ece
84,2020/03/29,Tribal hamlets lead the way in social distancing,"Youth put up checkposts; visitors allowed in case of an emergency only after washing their hands

Villagers in tribal areas of Visakhapatnam district are showing the way when it comes to implementing the curfew and social distancing measures enforced by the Centre.

Residents of several villages have blocked the entry and exit points of their villages to prevent the entry of outsiders. If there is an emergency, visitors must enter the village only after thoroughly washing their hands and wearing masks.

Makeshift barricades

The residents of Gottipalle village in Anandapuram mandal have placed wooden logs and bullock cart wheels as barricades to prevent the entry of outsiders into the village.

Locals have also informed all households that residents cannot go out of the village during the lockdown.

“We have taken this decision in view of the rising number of COVID-19 cases in our district. We have also asked women to maintain a safe distance from each other while going to fetch water from the common tap,” said Ram Babu, a villager from Gottipalle.

Villagers of Upparapalle are ensuring that no resident comes out of the house without a genuine reason. A group of youths have teamed up to arrange a checkpost at the entry and exit points.

Whoever wants to enter the village should do so after washing their hands and wearing a mask. “After coming to know about the rapid spread of COVID-19, we are leaving no stone unturned to ensure that our villagers are safe. This procedure will continue till the COVID-19 cases come down in the country,” said a local from Upparapalle.

Many villagers from Padmanabham mandal are spending sleepless night after a local from the same mandal had tested positive for the disease.

Post the incident, heads of many villages have decided to check the entry of outsiders and have erected wooden logs at all entry points of their villages.

Rising to the occasion

A few locals from villages of Pendurthi, Bheemili and Koyyuru are implementing the curfew in earnest.

A number of villagers from Dumbriguda, Araku, Paderu and various mandals in Visakhapatnam Agency have decided to cut themselves off from the mainland.

It was learnt that the villagers also took up awareness programmes on COVID-19 after the police conducted a camp.

A few tribal organisations also created awareness among the locals explaining them how important it was to implement the lockdown properly.

“Tribal people are cooperating well by staying in houses. Villagers from Chinalabudu in Araku mandal and many from Dumbriguda mandal have blocked the entry of outsiders. There were incidents when locals did not allow even government employees after the lockdown. We sorted out the issue. Some people try to come out in the evening, but we have been in constant touch with village heads asking them to inform about the importance of social distancing,” said P. Pydayya, Inspector of Araku police station.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/2idlnj/article31201503.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26-VJ-AGENCYBARRICADE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/tribal-hamlets-lead-the-way-in-social-distancing/article31201504.ece

The Greater Visakha City Committee of the CITU has appealed to Collector V. Vinay Chand to initiate measures to bring back the 34 persons from the city, who left on a pilgrimage on March 16, and were stranded in Varanasi since March 22.

CITU city general secretary M. Jaggu Naidu and president R.K.S.V. Kumar submitted a memorandum to the Collector on Sunday.

“Most of the pilgrims are senior citizens, children and women. They are now staying at Natraj Inn in Varanasi. The family members are worried about their safety as many of them are suffering from ill-health,” they said.

The Janata Curfew on March 22 had resulted in the cancellation of trains and buses and it was followed by the countrywide lockdown from the next day.

“Even as the lockdown has been announced till April 14, it can be extended further in view of the virus threat,” the CITU leaders pointed out.

The CITU also submitted the list of the pilgrims and their cellphone numbers, apart from the contact details of the hotel in the memorandum.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/bring-back-pilgrims-from-city-stranded-in-varanasi/article31201450.ece
86,2020/03/29,Huge turnout at ration depots in Vizag,"2,193 centres are supplying essential commodities to beneficiaries

Long queues were witnessed at ration depots in the city as the government launched supply of essential commodities three days of the scheduled date of April 1 due to the lockdown imposed to check COVID-19 pandemic.

Men, women and even elderly beneficiaries in large numbers gathered at the depots since 5.30 a.m. to collect the essential commodities.

Ward volunteers, VROs were seen supervising the distribution at the ration depots. Elderly persons were given preference at the stores. Rice, dal, sugar and other essential commodities were supplied to the beneficiaries.

The ration depot staff were seen appealing to beneficiaries not to rush, informing that the essential commodities will be given away daily.

Joint Collector L. Shiva Shankar visited a few stores at Ram Nagar and checked the arrangements. He instructed the staff to give a priority to the elderly persons.

Guidelines ignored

While staff at a few ration depots maintained the social distancing norms, many are yet to follow the guidelines. Ration depot at Jalaripeta did not have any markings resulting in beneficiaries standing in a line without maintaining the minimum distance. However, the officials drew markings at many ration depots and asked public to wear face masks.

According to officials, there are nearly 12.45 lakh beneficiaries in the district including 4.19 lakh in the urban limits. About 2,193 ration depots are supplying essential commodities to beneficiaries. Being Sunday, there were long queues at chicken shops. The meat shop owners had drawn markings to implement the social distancing norms. One kg broiler chicken was sold for ₹180 at most of the shops. A few shop owners said people have started believing that coronavirus would not spread by eating chicken.

89,2020/03/29,Police personnel on the job against all odds,"Officials nearing retirement are also on the roads enforcing the lockdown

Eswar Rao (name changed) had joined the police force about 28 years ago as a beat constable. Over the years, he rose up the ranks and is now an assistant sub-inspector with the Armed Reserve. He will be retiring in a couple of years and has seen many emergency situations in the past, but none of this magnitude, he says. His team has been put on surveillance of foreign returnees who are the prime suspects of COVID-19 carriers.

Any policeman is sworn to the motto of service, the day he or she dons the khaki uniform and till our last breath we would do that, despite we not getting the proper personal protection equipment and public misunderstanding us, he says.

Shortage of masks

The 3,000-odd policemen in the city and another 3,000 in the district have been in the frontline from Day One since the COVID-19 protocol was issued, and for the force of 6,000 on ground round the clock in three shifts, the masks provided are only 3,000.

There is shortage of masks, gloves and clothing, and many are seen covering their faces with handkerchiefs, which they are using to wipe their face also, which is considered to be unhygienic, as per WHO protocol.

“We are ready to fight the virus and do our duty, but we request that we be supplied protective gear, as we are directly interacting with the people and others those suspected to have the virus from close quarters,” says Lakshmi (name changed), a constable on duty at Allipuram, where two positive cases were recorded.

Both the Commissioner of Police and the Superintendent of Police agree that there is a shortage of masks, but efforts are being made on war-footing to acquire them.

Motivated lot

Despite the risks and stress level being high, they are a motivated lot. The officers are leading from the front, as all senior officials, supervising the surveillance and clampdown.

“We are trained for bandobust duties, emergencies and crisis situations. And we also know that this situation is different from the rest, but we are confident that we will overcome it,” said Commissioner of Police Rajeev Kumar Meena.

Not only that they have to enforce the clampdown, but the challenge is to deal with the public, as many are violating the lockdown protocol. People need to cooperate, especially the educated persons who are also becoming unreasonable at times, said Rural Superintendent of Police Attada Babujee.

Training

Both the city police and district police have trained a few teams to handle suspected cases and are posted at hotspots and hospitals. But there is a need to train more personnel, as even wearing of protective gear also needs to be told, said P.V.

90,2020/03/29,Some ideas to make your debt MF investment tax efficient,"Investing in the growth option of a debt MF and timing it well can minimise your tax outgo

In the article of March 9, 2020 (https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/some-ideas-to-make-your-mf-investments-tax-efficient/article31011110.ece), we discussed about tax efficiency in equity mutual funds. Now, we will discuss about debt mutual funds (MFs), also known as fixed income MFs.

There are two options in a fund viz. a dividend option where the MF pays dividend to you and the growth option, where there is no payout but the gains remain in the NAV and you can redeem the investment at that NAV when you want. Tax efficiency is better in the growth option, which we will discuss here.

In the dividend option, as mentioned in the Union Budget, dividends are taxable in your hands from April 1, 2020 instead of the earlier system of the MF deducting a dividend distribution tax (DDT) on your behalf and paying the government.

If you are in a lower tax slab, say 5% or 20%, the dividend option is tax efficient but most investors are in the 30% tax bracket.

In the growth option, to get the benefit of a lower tax rate, you have to hold the MF for three years. This is technically called long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax. Upon holding your debt MF units for three years, you become eligible for this levy.

Short-term gains

If you hold it for less than three years, it is short-term capital gains (STCG) taxed at your slab rate. Here again, you are better off if you are at a lower tax slab, but assuming you are in the 30% bracket, it is not very tax efficient. In the LTCG, there is a defined tax rate of 20% on the gains. But there is the benefit of ‘indexation’ by virtue of which the effective tax rate comes down significantly.

The way indexation works is like this — the tax authorities declare an index number, called cost inflation index (CII), every year. As per this, your purchase cost is ‘indexed up,’ hence, the taxable component of the gains comes down significantly.

Now, let’s see how indexation works. Let us say you invested in a debt mutual fund growth option on August 27, 2016 (or any date in financial year 2016-17) at ₹100 and redeemed it on August 27, 2019 (or any date thereafter to complete three years of holding) at ₹121. The CII for financial year 2016-17 as declared by the government is 264 and the CII for financial year 2019-20 is 289. Hence, your purchase cost gets indexed up, for tax purposes, to ₹100 x 289/264 = ₹109.47. Your taxable LTCG is ₹121 – ₹109.47 = ₹11.53. Tax at 20% (ignoring surcharge and cess for simplicity) will be ₹11.53 x 20% = ₹2.31. Thus, the effective tax rate, as a percentage of your gains, is ₹2.31 / ₹21 = 11%.

Now, let’s extend this method. You invested in a debt mutual fund on March 27, 2016 at ₹100 and redeemed it at ₹121 on April 12, 2019. Here, you get the indexation for one more financial year. The CII for 2015-16 was 254, that for 2019-20 was 289 and your indexed purchase cost is ₹100 x 289/254 = ₹113.77. Your taxable component is ₹121 – ₹113.77 = ₹7.23. The tax at 20% (ignoring surcharge and cess) is ₹7.23 X 20% = 1.45. The effective tax rate, as a percentage of your long term capital gains, is ₹1.45 /₹21 = 6.9%.

The data on CII is available through Google. To ensure you are referring at correct numbers, you may cross-check with the numbers mentioned above e.g. 289 for 2019-20. The CII for a financial year is announced sometime around August to October of the year, with reference to CPI inflation of the previous year.

To summarise, you reduce your tax in debt MFs by viz. holding the fund in growth option and for at least three years. If you invest in March and redeem in April after approximately three years, it’s even better.

You may use debt MFs after retirement, called the distribution phase of life, through a systematic withdrawal plan (SWP). That is, you would place your retirement kitty in debt MFs and do SWPs to withdraw as per your requirements every month.

To generate tax efficiency in SWP, you have to start the SWP three years after retirement. For tax purposes, to match against the exit, the NAV of your earliest investment will be considered. This is known as First In First Out (FIFO) i.e. every exit will be matched with the earliest entry in that fund.

Another point to be noted, in the context of availing indexation benefit in debt MFs, is that there is a notion among some people that the benefit of indexation is available by investing in Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs) in March, which will mature after approximately three years in April. While this is correct and gives you the benefit of indexation across four financial years, this is true for all debt funds viz. short duration fund, long duration fund, etc.

You will invest as per your preference, but for comparison purposes, FMPs are not liquid. There is no redemption with the AMC in FMPs and though listed at the exchange, there is no liquidity. If you invest in open-ended funds i.e. the usual short duration fund or banking and PSU fund, in case you require your money, you can redeem with the AMC.

91,2020/03/29,A measure of volatility via prism of markets,"VIX helps predict the overall market volatility expectations over the next 30 days

What is India VIX?

India VIX is an index that serves as a measure of market expectation of volatility in the near term. Simply put, while volatility signifies the rate and magnitude of change in the stock price or index value, the movement in the VIX index reflects the overall market volatility expectations over the next 30 days. So, a spike in the VIX value means the market is expecting higher volatility in the near future.

Why do we have a VIX index?

India VIX index is not the first of its kind in the world.

The VIX index was first created by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and introduced in 1993 based on the prices of S&P 500 index.

Since then, it has become a globally-recognised gauge of volatility in the U.S equity markets. The India VIX was launched with a similar intent in 2010 and is based on the computation methodology of CBOE though amended to align with the Indian markets.

While derivatives contracts were also launched on India VIX, those never really registered any significant volume.

Incidentally, the VIX value is among the important parameters that are taken into account for pricing of options contracts, which are one of the most popular derivative instruments.

How is VIX index behaving currently?

In the current calendar year, the India VIX index has jumped fivefold, from around 12 levels to the current 67 levels, which clearly hints that the market perceives that volatility will only increase in the coming days.

Incidentally, the index is currently trading at record highs and on some days in the recent past, saw a surge of more than 20% in a single day.

The trend has been similar in CBOE VIX as well, having surged from below 15 levels in February to the current 67. It touched a high of 82 on March 16. Interestingly, given the nature of the index, it is also known as ‘fear gauge’ or ‘fear index’.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/i25pez/article31194721.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th27BUVOLATILITY,https://www.thehindu.com/business/a-measure-of-volatility-via-prism-of-markets/article31194722.ece
92,2020/03/29,Policies for pandemics,"While existing policies must cover virus, insurers have unveiled specific products

The world is cowering under the COVID19 threat. Let’s take a look at the insurance cover is available for those who get infected.

The first question that comes to mind is: will my hospitalisation policy pay for a COVID-19-related hospitalisation and treatment?

The answer seems clear, up to a point. Existing policies should cover hospitalisation unless specifically excluded or if epidemics and pandemics are excluded. Read your policy document for clarity. If neither is the case, we can conclude that coverage is available.

(In the case of other covers like property and liability, insurance companies do suspend cover under a force majeure clause which means natural and man-made disasters, including pandemics).

New products

The reason is a high number of claims can devastate the insurance industry. Should this happen, the role of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) to direct and persuade the industry would be much looked forward to. As for health policies, IRDAI has issued a circular that new products cannot exclude pandemics.

Given that cover is available, the next question is, what will be covered. Hospitalisation expenses as well as 30 days pre-hospitalisation and 60 days post-hospitalisation expenses are standard covers on these policies.

COVID-19 test costs should be covered as should quarantine period medical expenses that are admissible. All claims will follow the policy scope and terms.

As it stands, new policies will exclude hospitalisation claims in the first 30 days except in cases where there was unbroken coverage in the preceding four years with no related claims in that period.

As for life insurance policies, death due to COVID-19 would be payable within the overall terms and conditions of the policy.

Coming back to health policies, there are new COVID-19-specific policies launched by some insurance companies, notably Star Health Insurance Company Ltd. and GoDigit. These are timely, if a bit restricted in coverage.

Star Health’s policy is a one-year benefit policy with sum insured options of ₹21,000 and ₹42,000. It pays out a lumpsum on hospitalisation and diagnosis of the COVID-19 infection. It does not provide coverage for hospitalisation expenses as such, but then the hospitalisation costs are being borne by the government.

The annual policy has a waiting period of 16 days from the commencement of cover, that takes care of the incubation period of the virus. Should the insured travel outside India during the policy period, no claim payment will be made.

GoDigit offers a benefit policy for ₹25,000 SI (sum insured) with conditions that the insured or his close family should not have travelled to specified countries after December 1, 2019. Those insured, who had displayed symptoms of COVID-19 in the six weeks preceding the policy, will also not be eligible for a claim.

DBS Bank India has tied-up with Bharti AXA General Insurance Company Limited to roll out a complimentary insurance plan for its customers covering all medical conditions, including COVID-19. The 30-day cover will pay ₹5,000 a day for up to 10 days of hospitalisation.

ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Limited’s COVID-19 Protection Cover is also a benefit policy that pays the sum insured when the insured is declared COVID-19 positive.

Edelweiss General Insurance Company Limited has a COVID-19 policy that will be extended to those quarantined in specified government facilities.

93,2020/03/29,Ask US,"Q. I am 43. I am shifting from a corporate job to the education field. I want to invest about ₹28 lakh of my PF money in a security that will provide me with a regular income (on a quarterly basis). Can you advise me on the right option to invest in? I need the least risky one.

Lakshmi

A. Since you have stated that you need the least risky option, you can look at a combination of bank deposits and post office schemes. Split the deposit with 2-3 banks and make sure you are with at least one systemically important bank (SBI, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank). You can consider Post Office National Savings Time Deposit. This will ensure that you do not compromise on safety. However, it needs to be said that it is not very tax efficient. If you are in the 20% tax bracket or less, then this is just about ok. Else, this will generate post-tax returns of less than 5%. But that is the price one pays for safety.

If you are in the highest tax bracket and are game for some risk, then you can invest a small amount in liquid mutual funds and do a systematic withdrawal plan. This will be more tax efficient but comes with uncertainty of returns (no guarantee) and marginally higher risk than deposits.

Q. I am 32 years old and would like to invest over a period of 25 years to save for my retirement. My goal is to achieve a minimum corpus of ₹8 crore after 25 years. I can invest in SIP at ₹30,000 a month. Please let me know about safe investments. My adviser told me to invest in three different funds, but I prefer your advice. I fear all my investments can go bust if markets collapse after 20 or 25 years. So, please let me know how to proceed.

Patrick Olivera

A.Safety and high returns do not go together. If you are unwilling to take some risks, then only deposits will fit your requirement. But, they won’t get you to where you want unless you have a very high saving rate. For example, let us assume over this period, your average return on deposits is 6%. For you to get to ₹8 crore in 25 years, you will need to step up your monthly savings by ₹10,000 every year. That is ₹30,000 a month in the first year, ₹40,000 in the second year and so on. That will be an average of 10% increase over these 25 years but with significant hikes in early years (since a ₹10,000 per month increase amounts to a 33% jump in savings and then a 25% and so on, given the low base). This is not easy if you have EMI commitments. Use PF, post office schemes and bank deposits, without fear of market collapse. But this is not without nil risk. We had 10-12% interest in the 90s but have steadily declined since. In another 20-25 years, as we become a developed economy, rates can further fall.

The other route is to have an asset- allocated approach to investing, with equity and debt. For example, start with a 50% allocation for post office time deposits, PF, NSC and bank recurring deposits. For the equity part, consider a simple equity index fund and a multi-cap fund. This will ensure, as a portfolio, you are not too hurt by hits such as the present one caused by the COVID-19 pandemic since your debt component will protect you. But here again, you need to step up your monthly investments by at least ₹5,000 every year to make sure you reach your target. As you get comfortable with mutual funds, make it 60% in equity funds and add a mid-cap fund later. The present market fall provides opportunities to enter. But, think long term. Markets can fall from here in the next few months. Test waters now to see if you can handle the volatility. If you do, you know you will survive equity investing. Else, go back to the first option.

94,2020/03/29,Contribution to PM-CARES Fund to qualify as CSR spending: Centre,"“... any contribution made to the PM-CARES Fund shall qualify as CSR expenditure,” Corporate Affairs Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a tweet on Sunday.

Contribution by corporates to PM-CARES Fund will be considered as social welfare spending under the companies law, the government has said amid ongoing efforts to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak.

Under the companies law, certain classes of profitable entities have to shell out at least 2% of their three-year annual average net profit towards Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities in a particular fiscal.

“... any contribution made to the PM-CARES Fund shall qualify as CSR expenditure,” Corporate Affairs Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a tweet on Sunday.

The Corporate Affairs Ministry, which is implementing the companies law, has issued a memorandum clarifying that money donated by corporates to the fund would be considered as CSR expenditure.

The government has set up the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund (PM-CARES Fund) to deal with any emergency or distress situation in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The PM-CARES Fund has been set up to provide relief to those affected by any kind of emergency or distress situation. Accordingly, it is clarified that any kind of contribution made to the PM-CARES Fund shall qualify as CSR expenditure under the Companies Act, 2013,” the Ministry said in the memorandum issued on Saturday.

CSR funds could be utilised for various activities related to COVID-19, including those relating to preventive healthcare and sanitation.

Under Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013, every company having net worth of at least ₹500 crore, turnover of ₹1,000 crore or more, or a minimum net profit of ₹5 crore during the immediate preceding financial year has to make CSR expenditure.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/gm277n/article31173350.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NIRMALA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/contribution-to-pm-cares-fund-to-qualify-as-csr-spending-centre/article31197676.ece

Prof. Arjun spent the better part of his academic life working as a historian at the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT). In partnership with Indira he wrote a number of extremely popular textbooks for the NCERT on Modern and Contemporary India and the World. One of their books, which was discontinued by the NCERT under the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) regime in 2002 was republished by Orient Blackswan as History of the World: From the Late 19th to the Early 20th Century and has remained a very widely read text.

For children

During his tenure at the NCERT, Prof. Arjun had collaborated in the effort to get some of the tallest professional historians India had produced since Independence, like Romila Thapar, R.S. Sharma, Satish Chandra and Bipan Chandra, to write textbooks for schoolgoing children. This was as an effort conceived since the late 1960s to create modern, scientific textbooks, which would replace the ones that had continued from colonial times with their colonial and communal bias. These texts became a great success and became a template for textbook writing globally.

However, a large number of textbooks were being produced which were deeply communal and divisive. Some of these emerged from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-inspired Vidya Bharati and Saraswati Shishu Mandir publications. A National Steering Committee on Textbook evaluation, consisting of a large number of eminent academics from all over the country, and Prof. Arjun Dev as Member Secretary, was formed to look into this. Under Prof. Arjun’s leadership, a report was produced and placed before this committee in 1993 and 1994. The report was explosive as it detailed through long extracts the communal poison and hatred towards the minorities being spread through these school textbooks.

Within the NCERT, the Bharatiya Janata Party, beginning with the Vajpayee government in 1999-2004, made massive efforts to replace the textbooks written by the country’s most renowned scholars with texts by unknown scholars toeing the Hindutva line. Prof. Arjun spearheaded the determined struggle against these efforts but, alas, could not stop them in the end. The New York Times of October 18, 2002, quoted Prof. Arjun Dev’s criticism of this “assault on history” which would promote a “version of the past [which] is crucial to their political…ideology of Hindu supremacy. They will go to any lengths to achieve this, even put forth a fake invented past.”

After retiring from the NCERT, Prof. Arjun took up another major enterprise, the Towards Freedom Project of the Indian Council of Historical Research. It was a project conceived as a rejoinder to the British government-inspired Transfer of Power Volumes which documented the history of the last ten years of colonial rule in India in a manner that did scant justice to our great national liberation struggle. Started under the General Editorship of Prof. Sarvepalli Gopal, the first two volumes came out in 1997 and were published by the Oxford University Press. With the coming to power of the Vajpayee government, two volumes in the press were withdrawn and the project stalled. The project could be restarted only in 2005, and Prof. Arjun was the indefatigable coordinator of the project with Sabyasachi Bhattacharya as the General Editor.

Heart and soul

Prof. Arjun put his heart and soul into the project, and a large number of volumes were published, covering the period right up to 1947. Unfortunately, the second volume covering the year 1941, edited by Prof. Arjun Dev himself and the third volume, covering the year 1947, edited by Prof. Sucheta Mahajan, have yet not seen the light of day, even though they were sent to press several years ago. Prof. Arjun told an online publication, on August 27, 2017, “After the publication of the first two volumes, the BJP had realised that the documents related to the role of the Sangh Parivar will not do it any good. Many of these documents expose its nationalist pretensions and show the communal role played by the Sangh during the nationalist movement.”

96,2020/03/29,Coronavirus | Cases surge; ICMR denies community transmission,"Since the lockdown was announced on March 24, India has added between 75-100 cases a day on average.

India on Sunday reported more than 100 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the overall case load to 979.

“There have been six deaths in the past 24 hours,” said Joint Secretary in the Union Health Ministry Lav Agrawal at a briefing.

“We have identified certain emerging hotspots and [will] investigate, on a war footing, what action can be taken there,” he added. However, none of the officials at the briefing specified the hotspots or the number of cases at these locations.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said testing for new cases has been stepped up to 30% of the nation’s capacity.

Coronavirus | Why are only a fraction of cases tested?

Director-General of ICMR Balram Bhargava had said earlier this month that the country could theoretically test upto 70,000 samples a week.

Head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at ICMR, Raman Gangakhedkar, said there was no estimate yet of whether the nationwide lockdown — now into its fifth day — had managed to check community transmission. “If we all observe the lockdown strictly then there’s a chance that we will soon reach the peak number of cases,” Dr. Gangakhedkar added. The ICMR continues to maintain that there are no instances of community transmission.

Reports from State health authorities put the death toll from COVID-19 at 29, with 1,121 positive cases. Maharashtra reported two fatalities, while J&K and Delhi reported one each on Sunday. Maharashtra and Kerala continued to have the most cases at 203 and 202 respectively. Kerala reported 20 new cases, while 1.41 lakh people are under observation, State Health Minister K.K. Shailaja said. Maharashtra had 22 new cases, with 10 from Mumbai.

Since the lockdown was announced on March 24, India has added between 75-100 cases a day on average. According to district-wise updated figures from the Union Health Ministry, Mumbai recorded the highest number of cases at 81, followed by Kasargod in Kerala with 78. Bangalore came next with 26.

The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority has asked States to coordinate with manufacturers of gloves, hand sanitisers and masks to address shortages in these products. The list mentions 35 manufacturers of gloves, 49 makers of sanitisers and 34 mask makers.

As of Sunday, coronavirus infections have been recorded in 188 countries. There were 6,83,694 cases according to covidindia.org, an independent tracker, and 32,155 deaths globally.

The thrust of the government is to ensure that the lockdown restrictions are strictly adhered to, said Mr. Agrawal. Delhi has seen a surge in migrants packing up and trying to leave the city for their homes in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar mainly but stranded in the city want of transport.

97,2020/03/29,Coronavirus lockdown | Air quality improves in over 90 cities,"Lockdown has reduced vehicular traffic across the country, leading to a drop in PM2.5, NOx levels

With a nationwide lockdown in place, over 90 cities, including Delhi, recorded minimal air pollution in the last few days.

Welcoming the reduction in pollution, environmentalists urged the government to treat it as a “wake-up call” and stop its “obsession” with “development” at the cost of the environment.

India is currently under the biggest lockdown with around 130 crore people asked to stay home in view of the COVID-19 outbreak.

The government has urged people to avoid unnecessary travel, significantly reducing the traffic movement across the country.

According to the Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the measures against COVID-19 have led to a drop in PM2.5 (fine particulate pollutant) by 30% in Delhi and by 15% in Ahmedabad and Pune, respectively.

The level of Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) pollution, which can increase the risk of respiratory conditions, has also reduced. NOx pollution is mainly caused due to a high motor vehicle traffic. In Pune, NOx pollution has reduced by 43%, in Mumbai, by 38% and in Ahmedabad, by 50%.

Gufran Beig, a scientist at SAFAR, said generally in March, pollution is in the “moderate” category (Air Quality Index range: 100-200) while currently, it is in the “satisfactory” (AQI 50-100) or “good” (AQI 0-50) category. “It is the lockdown impact. Local factors like shutting down of industries and construction and traffic have contributed in improving the air quality. Rain is also helping, but the curbs on local emissions are playing a significant role,” he said.

Under the “good” category, pollution is considered to be at the lowest and the air is believed to be the healthiest to breathe.

According to the data of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality in the national capital is presently in the “good” category. In Kanpur, which has high pollution levels, it is in the “satisfactory” category.

Moreover, 92 other cities with CPCB monitoring centres have recorded minimal air pollution, with the air quality in the range of “good” to “satisfactory”.

As many as 39 cities have recorded “good” air quality and 51 cities have recorded “satisfactory” air quality in the last few days, the CPCB data showed.

An AQI between 0-50 is considered good, 51-100 satisfactory, 101-200 moderate, 201-300 poor, 301-400 very poor and 401-500 severe.

Environmentalists believe that the reduced pollution levels should act as a wake-up call for the government.

Jyoti Pande Lavakare, co-founder, Care for Air NGO, said the low AQI and the blue skies proved beyond doubt that a lot of the polluted air was “anthropomorphic, that is, man-made”. “Slowing down the economy to such a degree is not the ideal way to bring down air pollution, but it proves that it can be done. We can achieve the same outcome by doing this mindfully, using technology and low-emission alternatives,” she said.

Ms. Lavakare emphasised on the need to realise that air pollution weakens the lungs, so countries like India with higher pollution and lower nutrition levels will be more affected by COVID-19, and morbidity and deaths are likely to be higher.

Ravina Kohli, environmentalist and part of the #MyRightToBreathe campaign, said it was a “huge wake-up call” for governments obsessed with development at the cost of the environment.

“We the people are the problem. Our communication on solutions now also includes how to reduce pollution at a personal level by being able to understand our behaviour and its consequences on our environment.

“For the first time, I believe our present generation will discover the critical importance and need for a focus on public health and the quality of air we breathe,” she said.

Jai Dhar Gupta, environmentalist and founder of Nirvana Being that sells masks and purifiers to combat pollution, said humans need to figure out if they wish to go back to the normal that was there before or find a more sustainable normal.

“This has been a fantastic wake-up call and I think we had a reality check and we need to figure out a new normal. This is an opportunity, a chance to find a new sustainable life,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/p1h7k6/article31201246.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Nariman-point,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-lockdown-air-quality-improves-in-over-90-cities/article31201247.ece
98,2020/03/29,Coronavirus lockdown sees increased occupancy at Delhi’s night shelters,"223 shelters have the capacity to house 18,478 of the national capital’s homeless people

The 21-day lockdown may have deprived Rambhai, a daily wage labourer, of an income but not a bed and blanket. A resident of Haryana, he works in Delhi and for nearly a year has been sleeping at one of the “porta cabins”, a blue prefabricated hall that houses about 75 people.

Among the shelters managed by the Delhi government are 115 such cabins. Each of them has a common television; mattresses and blankets are made available. Other than the cabins, there are 89 buildings and 19 tents that constitute the city’s 223 shelters. Together, they have the capacity to house 18,478 of the national capital’s homeless people.

‘Fewer allowed’

“In the last few days since the lockdown, fewer people are being allowed because we have been asked to keep the mattresses at a greater distance from each other,” said Mr. Rambhai, who had just finished lunch.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday announced that the government had made arrangements to feed at least 4 lakh poor people beginning Sunday, and free meals were being given at night shelters. It was also part of the government’s attempt to dissuade people from travelling and possibly spreading the coronavirus infection.

Because of the lockdown drying up jobs and the savings of many of daily wagers dwindling, several of them took to walking on foot in an attempt to go home to their villages in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. With buses and trains stalled, many thousands are stuck in the city.

A total of 588 government schools had also been modified into centres where the homeless and poor could be fed, the Delhi CM has said.

Numbers rise

According to records from the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board, there has been increased occupancy in the night shelters.

On March 22, night occupancy in the shelters was 7,671 and this increased to 9,806 on March 25 — the first night of the lockdown — and as of the latest report on Sunday, occupancy rose to 10,784.

“Generally, night shelters witness low occupancy during summers,” said Rajiv Bansal, who is involved in the management of the shelter at Nigambodh Ghat, “But due to the lockdown, we are seeing an upsurge compared to what is normal for this time of the year. Many also see this as a source of meals.”

Food is delivered in a truck and served by a few policemen and social workers. It is mostly a large serving of khichdi, and occasionally the menu changes to puris and a bowl of vegetables. With social distancing norms in effect, residents are expected to line-up inside chalk circles. “Most people don’t understand. There is enough food but people continue to crowd into each other,” said Changan Singh, also a daily wage worker, “The other day, we were given masks but not everybody complies.”

‘Generous patrons’

At one of the city’s oldest shelters, near the Bangla Sahib gurudwara, Kuldeep Yadav, who works as a labour contractor, is miffed. “There is no provision for those who are stranded. These shelters are permanently occupied by a few though the rules say they are to clear out by night. We get by because of food from generous patrons and not the government,” he said.

The gurudwara, which feeds several thousands of people in a day, has now shut its doors. However, ever so often, a car or a van pulls over and a donor distributes bread, butter, pulses and rice. “There is a gentleman who comes with a 100 packets every morning at 4 a.m. We are getting by because there is kindness around, too,” said Mr. Yadav.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/folmp8/article31200966.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30THSHELTER-JACOB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-lockdown-sees-increased-occupancy-at-delhis-night-shelters/article31200967.ece
99,2020/03/29,Coronavirus lockdown | Migrant workers not welcome back home in Bihar,"They are being reported to the police who are handing them over to medical authorities

Many of the thousands of jobless workers, marching from their workplaces to their native villages in States like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh hundreds of kilometres away amid the COVID-19 lockdown, are not being welcomed back home.

In many places in Bihar and elsewhere, those returning back home from even neighbouring countries like Nepal and Bhutan were reported to the police, who, in turn, handed them over to medical authorities for tests and subsequent measures.

Some villages in Bihar have gone into lockdown, refusing entry of people even from neighbouring areas.

“Four of my co-villagers working in Nepal returned home two days ago. But villagers informed the police about them following which they swooped on the village with ambulances and handed them over to the medical team,” a villager told PTI over phone from Alawalpur village near Patna.

“In neighbouring Fatehpur village, six people returned home from Bhutan on Saturday, undertaking part of their journey on foot in Bihar and West Bengal, but were handed over to the police by neighbours,” he said.

In a similar case, nine people returning to their village Jamalpur, near Alawalpur, from Mumbai were handed over to the police and medical authorities, said Luv Singh of Jamalpur village, though they had been examined earlier in Mumbai by medical authorities.

They too were asked to stay at home, he added.

A police officer having jurisdiction over these villages confirmed this trend to PTI over phone.

“Yes, it’s true. Initially over 15 people coming from outside the State were reported to us by villagers and we handed them over to medical teams,” said Inspector Kumar.

Later the medical teams have begun picking them up on their own after getting information about such cases, he said, adding at least 40 people, belonging to various villages like Alwalpur, Fatehpur, Kamarjee, Kandap and Masadhi in the jurisdiction of the Gaurichack police station were reported to the police.

In fact, Piariya village near Alawalpur has locked itself down, refusing entry to even people from neighbouring areas, he said.

“Good for us,” he quipped.

In other instances, some youths, who had recently jumped quarantine in Karnataka and reached their village in West Champaran in north Bihar, were handed over to the police.

The imposition of 21-day nationwide lockdown to break the novel coronavirus transmission chain has triggered large-scale migration of jobless daily wagers, undertaking marches from cities outside their states to their native places, braving days of hunger and fatigue and breaking down on slightest gesture of sympathy.

But the villagers’ stance of reporting them back to the police is not in variance with the stands of various governments, which have been urging workers to stay put at places where they are, assuring them of food and other essentials.

Many have also panicked over rumours that the lockdown would be extended further.

A group of four construction labourers, marching from Gurgaon in Haryana to Badaun in Uttar Pradesh, met this reporter on National Highway 9 in Delhi leading to Ghaziabad on Saturday night.

They said they are returning home on foot itself because “experts say the lockdown period would be further extended by at least three months”, referring to some WhatsApp forward messages they received.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/1qngxt/article31200961.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30THBIHAR-SPRAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-lockdown-migrant-workers-not-welcome-back-home-in-bihar/article31200962.ece

After a night-long ordeal, migrant workers leaving for their native places were on Sunday given the facility of transport in the roadways buses till the inter-State borders of Rajasthan, reducing their agony of walking long distances on foot. Buses brought from various depots were sanitised before the passengers boarded them on the outskirts of Jaipur.

Thousands of jobless labourers from the city’s industrial areas, including Sitapura, Vishwakarma, Mansarovar, Malviya Nagar and Bagru, waited through the night at four pick-up points after being told that arrangements were being made for ferrying them. The labourers spent the night on roads without food and water.

“A police van made an announcement in our area yesterday that those willing to travel by bus could reach Dugrapura, but there was no arrangement. Then we were told to come to this pick-up point,” Irshad Ali, 24, belonging to Bihar’s Supaul district, told The Hindu at Transport Nagar from where the buses left for the Uttar Pradesh border.

Mr. Ali and 20 other labourers were laid off by the cloth factory owner when the unit stopped operations since the nationwide lockdown started. Mahendra Singh, another labourer, said he and his colleagues had no money to pay rent for their rooms or buy ration for cooking food. “It is a matter of survival for us. We can fight the disease if we remain alive,” he said.

600 buses

The Rajasthan Roadways pressed over 600 of its buses into service and also brought private buses for transporting migrant workers to the borders of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh.

A group of hotel management students from Delhi, on an internship at a luxury hotel here, reached Kunda on Jaipur-Delhi National Highway with the hope that they would be able to join their families, which were worried about them.

However, Rajasthan Roadways chairman Naveen Jain said the bus services, which were free, were only meant for migrant labourers who were on roads and wanted to go home. Twenty buses were reserved in each depot across the State for the purpose, while checkpoints were established in the border districts to receive the workers coming from the neighbouring States.

Dinesh Kumar, 34, waiting with his wife and two children at Transport Nagar, said the contractor who had hired him for the building repair work at the Rajasthan High Court had flatly told him that there would be no scope for jobs over the next two months. “As there is no work for us here and we are running out of our savings, we are going to our parents’ home in Dholpur,” he said.

‘Start camps’

Civil rights groups here demanded that camps be started and food, water and resting places be arranged for the unorganised sector labourers at the inter-State borders during the present mass migration. “Children and women accompanying the labourers need it the most, as we have converted a public health issue into a human tragedy,” People’s Union of Civil Liberties-Rajasthan president Kavita Srivastava said.

Migrant workers returning from Delhi and other cities of Uttar Pradesh continued to arrive in Lucknow on Sunday but for many their journey home was not without much struggle, confusion and stress due to change in boarding stations.

Also read | Similar stories, very personal tragedies

Several migrants who arrived in the Uttar Pradesh capital had to scamper from one bus station to another in search of transportation. The situation was stark at the Qaiserbagh bus station where desperate migrants arriving in search of conveyance were chased away by police who allegedly ask them to walk to their homes in Purvanchal, hundreds of kms away, or go to the outskirts of the city. The migrants said they were told that bus services to their native districts were available only on Saturday and early Sunday.

“They are asking us to walk,” said Ramesh Sharma, a carpenter who arrived from Delhi by bus via Kanpur. “We went to the Charbagh station, they sent us to Qaiserbagh and when we reached here, they asked us to walk,” said Mr. Sharma outside the bus station around 12.30 pm.

No advance notice

For reasons known to the administration, the arriving migrants were not given advanced notice about their boarding places due to which many of them turned up at Qaiserbagh from where buses to east Uttar Pradesh usually move. Mr. Sharma got a bus to Gonda but after walking several km to the polytechnic intersection.

Virender Kumar, a wallpaper maker, arrived in Lucknow along with 11 associates after a tedious journey from the Anand Vihar terminus in Delhi. After boarding a roadways bus in Delhi, Mr. Kumar was dropped near Hathras from where he boarded a truck.

“The bus conductor not only charged us ₹300 instead of ₹155 but also made us to sit on the roof of the vehicle. It was cold at night,” said Mr. Kumar.

Packed in truck

After walking for another 15-20 minutes, the group found a truck which dropped them at a nondescript location, from where they had to hike 35-40 km in the night to reach the highway and board another truck towards the outskirts of Lucknow. “We were packed in the truck like cattle fodder,” recounted Mr. Kumar who arrived at Qaiserbagh station after paying another ₹3,000 to an SUV as fare.

Mr. Kumar alleged that not only did police chase them away from the bus station without any directions but some of them also taunted them. “Police wale keh rahe hai ki yeh log jo hai corona leke yahan agaye hai. Jao idhar se jao, udhar se jao [policemen said that we are coming here to spread the coronavirus. Go away from here, go that way, they told us],” said Mr. Kumar.

The group found a bus towards home but only after walking another 45 minutes.

An official of the Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation said police stationed outside the Qaiserbagh and Charbagh bus stations were told to re-direct the incoming migrants towards boarding points near Alambagh and Gomti Nahar on the outskirts.

The change in boarding places was made overnight by the administration after instructions from the government but it was known only in the morning, the official said.

After around 8-10 buses plied from Charbagh all buses were re-directed from the two new points thereafter. “These people must have arrived late but we had placed a person there at 8-9 a.m. to announce the change. Police at the outpost were also told to direct them to Nahariya in Alambagh and Kamta near Gomti Nagar, “ said the official, adding that so far around 1,500-1,600 buses had plied across Uttar Pradesh to transport the migrants.

Police to the rescue

Ankita Singh and her family, however, were among the many who had no clue about the change in route. They had to wait for several hours on the street as they were told all buses had left in the morning. Eventually, police came to their rescue.

“They didn’t even let us sit there [bus station]. Now where do I take these two little children and sit in the sun,” said Ms. Singh, a resident of Hardoi, in the afternoon. She was coming from Kanpur where her husband works in a plywood factory. Stranded without any means of transportation, the family spent several hours on the pavement outside a police station before deciding to walk around 10 km to the Dubagga market where police helped them board a supply truck later in the day.

The Singh family had no option but to leave for Hardoi as they had run out of ration. “We had just returned to Kanpur after the Holi break. How much can a person earn and save in a couple of weeks,” she asked. “We had reached desperation in just one week [of lockdown and curfew], how would we have survived a month?”

The move will enable customers, particularly those who have opted for the electronic clearing service (ECS) facility, to opt for deferring payments for the next three months.

“We will give our customers an option to defer EMIs,” Keki Mistry, vice-chairman and CEO, HDFC, told The Hindu.

HDFC will reach out to its customers via email and SMS, informing them to exercise their choice through a link in their website. The customer will also have the option to continue with the EMIs.

Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank has also communicated through social media that the bank is working on the issue and will inform the customers via email and SMS.

Watch | What is contact tracing?

The other alternative for the borrower to defer EMIs is to instruct the bank from where the EMI is debited to stop the ECS facility.

A borrower who has not opted for the ECS facility can simply avoid paying the instalment for three months.

On Friday, the RBI allowed all banks and financial institutions including non-banking finance companies to extend a three-month moratorium on the instalments falling due between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020 for all term loans.

Consumer loans

This relaxation is also applicable for consumer loans like auto loans, home loans and personal loans, as well as credit card outstanding.

This would mean a consumer may choose not to pay monthly equated instalments on their loans for the next three months.

The move is a part of several measures announced by the central bank to fight the economic impact caused by a nationwide lockdown enforced due to the outbreak of COVID-19.

Lenders will not have to classify the borrower account as non-performing due to the relaxation, RBI had said. There will also be no impact on the borrowers credit score.

Interest to accrue

103,2020/03/29,Coronavirus lockdown | Congress compares situation with demonetisation,"Abhishek Singhvi cites lack of proper lockdown plan that has left many migrants stranded

As images of the exodus of migrant workers from cities because of the 21-day lockdown went viral on social media platforms, reactions of Congress leaders on Sunday varied from outright criticism to offering concrete suggestions, with some party leaders comparing with the demonetisation.

Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi wrote to telcom companies like Vodafone, Airtel, Jio and BSNL to make phone calls and Internet data services free for the distressed migrant workers on ‘humanitarian grounds’.

“It’s our duty to help our countrymen in this hour of crisis. Many people going home have run out of money. They are unable to contact their families. I urge you to make the call facilities free in the relevant areas for the next one month to let them contact their families,” Ms. Vadra said in a letter to telecom companies and urged party workers to help out.

Financial plan

Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, in a series of tweets, argued for an immediate financial assistance plan for the poor.

Watch | What is contact tracing?

“We need a financial rescue package that will transfer an additional ₹5 lakh crore to the people and put the money in their pockets. Otherwise, apart from a COVID-19 tragedy, there will be a livelihood calamity for the poor and vulnerable,” Mr. Chidambaram said.

“What are the PM and FM waiting for when a tragedy is unfolding before our eyes? Just look at the TV images of hungry children and helpless migrant workers. Has the Modi government abandoned them to their fate?” asked the former Finance Minister.

Lack of planning

At the party’s official press conference, senior spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi pointed out the lack of proper lockdown plan that had left many stranded.

Comparing the large-scale exodus of migrant workers with the displacement during the Partition, Mr. Singhvi said, “The lockdown was announced with the same haste with which demonetisation was done.”

“Did you not think about migrant workers, daily wage labourers? Because of your actions, more than 1 crore people are on the streets. How can you then talk about social distancing?” Mr. Singhvi asked.

The Congress pointed out that though Prime Minister Narendra Modi had addressed the nation on March 19 for the first time, the Centre didn’t coordinate with State governments or prepare contingency plans like community kitchen or arranging transportation.

While Mr. Singhvi cited the examples of Congress-ruled States that were providing buses for stranded people, he also complained of party workers being denied curfew passes in BJP-ruled States.

Tharoor’s comparison

Congress MP Shashi Tharoor compared the ongoing situation with the demonetisation days by juxtaposing two pictures on his Twitter handle: crowd of migrants standing in long queues to catch a bus at Delhi’s Anand Vihar and Ghaziabad’s Kaushambi bus terminals with a photo of a queue seen outside banks during demonetisation.

Clueless and incompetent !” tweeted former Union Minister Kapil Sibal.

However, Mr. Sibal’s junior colleague and fellow Congressman Milind Deora tweeted, “Now it’s not time for petty and partisan politicking about which government responded when and how effectively. We should work unitedly with laser focus to contain the spread of the COVID-19 and treat the infected regardless of their economic background.”

“There will be time for politics and rebuilding. At that time, hopefully, we will direct our outrage at those who misled and lied to the world.

The hearings before a nine-judge Supreme Court Bench on the ambit and scope of religious freedom practised by multiple faiths across the country lie in limbo due to the COVID-19 scare.

The Bench led by Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde is hearing this reference on the question of religious freedom in connection with the Sabarimala case.

The apex court complex is completely shutdown in the face of the outbreak. Extremely urgent cases are being heard by judges via videoconferencing. However, none of the Constitution Bench cases, including the challenge to the abrogation of special status to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370, has been listed.

The fate of the reference is also uncertain because the seniormost puisne judge on the Bench, Justice R. Banumathi, is set to retire in early July 2020.

Summer vacation

Usually, the annual summer vacation of the court begins in mid-May. Lawyers have proposed to the judges to cut short the summer holidays and make up for the days lost to the COVID-19 lockdown.

On February 10, the nine-judge Bench had upheld the Sabarimala Review Bench’s decision on November 14 last year, to refer to a larger Bench questions on religious freedom.

On November 14 last year, the five-judge Sabarimala Review Bench led by then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, in a majority judgment, did not decide the Sabarimala review cases before it.

‘Larger issues’

Instead, the Bench has gone on to frame “larger issues” concerning essential religious practices of various religions. It further clubbed other pending cases on subjects as varied as female genital mutilation among Dawoodi Bohras to entry of Parsi women who married inter-faith into the fire temple and Muslim women into mosques and referred them all to a larger Bench.

There is no system in place to check if any of them is already corona affected or not,” said Justice Sanju Panda, Acting Chief Justice of Orissa HC, and Justice B. Rath.

They observed that such large- scale movement may aid the spread of the coronavirus, and that it would also be difficult to attend to thousands of such persons in need of medical attention.

The HC also felt that providing vehicles to aid such a large movement of people would be an uphill task.

108,2020/03/29,Health Ministry issues SOP to guide ambulance staff in transporting COVID-19 cases,"The patient and the attendant should be provided with triple-layer mask and gloves, the SOP said.

The Union Health Ministry on Sunday laid down the standard operating procedure (SOP) for medical staff attending to or transporting suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, saying the SOP is meant to guide and train ambulance drivers and technicians.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

“Ideally, there should be ambulances identified specifically for transporting COVID suspect patients or those who have developed complications, to the health facilities,” according to the SOP.

“Currently, there are two types of ambulances — ALS (with ventilators) and BLS (without ventilators). States may empanel other ambulances having basic equipment like that of BLS and use it for COVID patients,” the Health Ministry said.

It warned against use of the ‘102 ambulances’ for coronavirus patients and said they should only be used to transport pregnant women and sick infants.

The emergency medical technician (EMT), driver of ambulance must wear personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling, managing and transporting identified and suspected cases of COVID-19.

The patient and the attendant should be provided with triple-layer mask and gloves, the SOP said.

The ministry also provided a sample questionnaire to identify COVID-19 cases in its SOP.

List of private ambulance service

The SOP instructed local authorities to prepare a list of all private ambulance service providers in their respective areas. These ambulances should be linked with a centralised call centre to ensure adequate number of ambulances and reduce response time to an average of 20 minutes, it said.

“Orientation on infection prevention protocols and protocols for transporting COVID patients should also be ensured for staff of these ambulances. To ensure response time of 20 minutes, ambulances should be strategically located at hospitals, police stations,” it said.

It said only identified and designated ambulances should be used for transportation and all health functionaries should be made aware to use such ambulance services for COVID patients through toll free numbers.

“Otherwise it might increase the chances of transmission of infection. Every district should facilitate empanelling of ambulances other than those in the public health system even if the present situation may not require using them.

“To minimize the risk of transmission, it is strongly recommended that if other than empanelled ambulances are bringing COVID or suspect patients, such vehicles need to be quarantined for thorough cleaning and disinfection and should only be released after certification by district administration/ district health official,” it said.

109,2020/03/29,"BJP is big party, up to them to take us along: Hagrama Mohilary","Bodoland Territorial Council chief readies for ballot battle after anti-coronavirus combat

India stepped into the COVID-19-induced lockdown beginning with the ‘Janata Curfew’ that Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on March 22, a day after the withdrawal of nominations for the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) polls that were scheduled on April 4.

Also read | I apologise to the countrymen, says PM in Mann ki Baat

Hagrama Mohilary, the 51-year-old chief executive member of the council, who was running down his opponents with rustic wit, changed tack to “combat the coronavirus” to ensure a “safe field” for the deferred battle of the ballots before “reloading my strategy guns”.

Battle within

A former extremist leader who has been ruling BTC since its creation in 2003, Mr. Mohilary is wary of a battle within the battle ahead, after ally Bharatiya Janata Party fielded candidates for more than half of the 40 council seats. This was despite the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), the party he heads, offering two seats for the BJP on the basis of “winnability”.

The BJP rules Assam in alliance with the BPF and Asom Gana Parishad (AGP). There are three BPF Ministers in the government headed by Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal.

“The BJP is a big national party and they can take anyone along. We are too small a party to do anything about it, and what is happening is because of some local BJP leaders. It’s not a question of cheating us. The alliance from our side is on, will remain,” Mr. Mohilary told The Hindu from BTC headquarters Kokrajhar, about 225 km west of Guwahati.

Critical of accord

The BTC chief was, however, critical of the Bodo Peace Accord that the Centre signed with four factions of the disbanded National Democratic Front of Boroland and other NGOs such as All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU).

“This accord is hogwash, based on a draft the ABSU prepared with one of the NDFB (National Democratic Fund of Boroland) factions. We fought for Statehood and got BTC under an amended Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. The new accord, not under any clause of the Constitution, should have elevated BTC to at least an autonomous state, but it downgraded the council instead and potentially reduced its territory,” Mr. Hagrama said.

The BTC, covering 8,821 sq. km. across four districts bordering Bhutan, stands to lose some areas inhabited by non-Bodo tribal people under the new accord.

Mr. Hagrama played down the threat from former ABSU president Pramod Boro, a signatory of the new accord, who joined and took over the leadership of rival political party United People’s Party Liberal. He said Mr. Boro betrayed the Bodo community by pushing for a “meaningless accord” in a bid to appease the BJP.

‘More important’

“But we have a more important issue at hand now. We are ensuring the 5.5 lakh people in BTC below the poverty line do not go hungry during the lockdown,” he said.

The BTC chief has also been going about making people understand the importance of not stepping out of their houses unless for an emergency. “I tell them to avoid touching the feet of the elderly, the most vulnerable, so that they can hug them two months later,” he said.

In the appeal for social distance was a message for the voters of BTC as well as his party leaders and rivals, who hope for the council polls in two months’ time.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xktovb/article31199624.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG20200323154540,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjp-is-big-party-up-to-them-to-take-us-along-hagrama-mohilary/article31199625.ece

111,2020/03/29,"Amid coronavirus lockdown, Gond tribals survive on roti with salt in Panna","High levels of malnutrition, lack of local employment opportunities, and returning migrant workers, is aggravating a hunger crisis

For the third Sunday in a row, Pritiroshan Adivasi waited in vain for his mother’s return from Bamitha village, where suspended transport has left her stranded. The 16-year-old’s responsibility, at a time when the COVID-19 outbreak is shattering families, fraying relations and racking the poor, is immense. To tide his infirm grandmother and younger sister, aged seven, over hunger, a meal of only wheat rotis with salt is what he manages. The threat of novel coronavirus comes later.

‘Torn us apart’

“Mother used to come over every weekend, bringing us vegetables and oil. But the lockdown has torn us apart; hunger may kill us before the illness reaches us,” Mr. Adivasi says in a low voice, while idling with friends at Darera village in Panna district.

Left without work after the lockdown kicked in, Gond adivasis are confronting a familiar, unyielding adversary — hunger, more hideous in its form now as the nation scrambles to contain the virus spread first. With shops shuttered and weekly markets wound up, the two-month advance disbursal of 4 kg wheat, a kilo of rice and salt each distributed to every BPL (Below Poverty Line) family under the PDS (public distribution system) monthly is keeping them alive.

“Mother used to sell wood in Panna market too to tea vendors, after fetching wood while dodging foresters,” says Mr. Adivasi, who is a Class X student. After his father’s death four months ago, the mother’s first step outside the village was to the fields in Bamitha, 35 km away, where she made ₹150 a day for harvesting wheat, before the lockdown. Now, she is stuck there along with 15 others.

‘No work’

“This is worse than demonetisation,” quips Mohan Adivasi, 17. “At least we got back our money at the banks then, but there is no work now and the whole city is closed. And my family’s savings are drained in medical care. We have not a penny to spare.”

His parents worked as construction workers in Panna, making ₹200 each daily, and on the way back in the evening brought groceries to feed five children. Now, he says, there is no public transport for the city, 10 km away, and the police beats up those driving vehicles anyway.

The State government on February 28 ordered the ration be given in advance, not with the aim to preempt the hunger crisis that may follow a lockdown, but to empty granaries for the upcoming wheat purchase from farmers. Nevertheless, the stock is the last bet for most tribals in Panna where 42.3% children under five are stunted (height-for-age), 40.8% are underweight (weight-for-age), 68.2% of children between six and 59 months are anaemic, while 48.7% women (15-49 years) are anaemic, according to the National Family Health survey-4 (2015-16).

No wages

Pushpendra Singh, who owns 25 acres in Lakshmipur village, hasn’t paid wages to ten labourers for two weeks, as the COVID-19 scare collapsed the market, even before the lockdown kicked in. “When traders are no longer coming over to buy our produce, how can we pay the labourers? And the Panna market is shut. There is another eight acres left to harvest,” he said. As a result, most Gond tribals of Lakshmipur, Brijpur and Sunhara villages, being agriculture labourers, are left with no pay. They are alive on wheat, salt and sugar, besides chillies most grow in their backyards.

Yousuf Beg, a social worker in the district, says lack of industries offering employment locally and closure of diamond mines in view of the shutdown had aggravated the hunger crisis. “Moreover, anganwadis are closed for a month now. Earlier, tribals worked in mines now under the Panna Tiger Reserve. After they were shut, construction work, selling wood and agricultural labour, even in other States, were the only options left.”

Workers returning

Migrant workers in droves are returning hungry, which will spike malnutrition levels further, says Sachin Jain of the Right to Food campaign. He points out that hurriedly drawn up government orders, to belatedly cater to the poor after the lockdown, are mostly confusing and contradictory. “Although the State government has decided to distribute free ration through the PDS to every poor person, irrespective of eligibility, there is still no instruction ruling out biometric authentication.”

Moreover, he says, to ensure balanced nutrition to children, anganwadi workers and self help groups must be roped in to prepare food packets.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/t0rs3h/article31199198.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-gond-sy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amid-coronavirus-lockdown-gond-tribals-survive-on-roti-with-salt-in-panna/article31199200.ece
112,2020/03/29,"Coronavirus | India shifts staff in Herat, Jalalabad to Kabul in view of COVID-19 cases","As COVID-19 adds to security threat, operations at Herat, Jalalabad suspended

With a growing number of cases of novel coronavirus infection from Iran and Pakistan, and the worsening security situation within the country, India has decided to suspend operations at its missions in two Afghanistan cities — Jalalabad and Herat — highly-placed sources confirmed to The Hindu. Diplomatic staff and other personnel are being pulled out until the situation improves.

Also read | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

On Sunday, all Indian personnel at the Consulate in Jalalabad, near the Pakistan border were moved to Kabul, and are likely to return to India by special flights coming in to transport Afghan citizens back. Those at the Consulate in Herat near the Iranian border are likely to return later this week.

According to sources, preparations have been made, in case they need to undergo the mandatory 14-day quarantine procedures, at military facilities here as well. In the interim, the consulates will be serviced by local Afghan staff on the premises. Aside from the embassy in Kabul and two consulates in Herat and Jalalabad, India maintains consulates in Mazar-e-Sharif and Kandahar as well.

According to the officials, an influx of Afghan refugees over the porous borders from Iran, which has seen more than 32,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and from Pakistan that has seen a rapid rise to more than 1,200 confirmed cases, has raised concerns about Herat and Jalalabad in particular. Last week, Afghan Health Minister Ferozuddin Feroz had said there were predictions that as much as half the population would contract the virus at some point.

The move to pull out Indian personnel also follows a deep security assessment undertaken by the government on the situation in Afghanistan following the deadly attack by the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) on a gurudwara in Kabul on March 25, in which 25 people, including an Indian were gunned down. A senior official said the government’s view of the security situation and the impact of the pandemic was that it cannot be “business as usual” for the Indian missions.

Watch | What is contact tracing?

In particular, security officials believe that the Indian mission may have been the intended original target for the ISKP attackers, who included an Indian national from Kerala. According to inputs from investigators, the training displayed by the four terrorists, a bomb attack at the funeral for the Sikh worshippers killed, and a subsequent explosion near the gurudwara point to a well-planned attack. According to the investigators, a similar attack on the Indian mission had been foiled, as security there has been raised recently, after a specific threat was picked up by intelligence agencies against the Jalalabad mission by Pakistan-backed groups.

The ISKP, which is believed to be made up of Pakistan-trained fighters has gained prominence in the past two years as attacks by the Taliban were restricted mainly to Afghanistan National Army (ANA) targets while the Taliban was in negotiations with the United States. The ISKP is claiming responsibility for a number of deadly attacks on civilians, particularly minorities like Sikhs, Hazaras, and Shi’as. In March, the ISKP attacked a Shi’a gathering in Kabul, killing 32.

“For Pakistan, Afghanistan has always been about strategic depth, and now the ISI is emboldened to do as it pleases,” a senior official told The Hindu, adding that two-thirds of ISKP recruits are Orakzai tribe members who live on the Pakistan side of the Durand Line.

As a result, India’s assessment is that the month-old U.S.-Taliban deal, which only stipulates that the Taliban will ensure no attacks on American forces and U.S. interests, will lead to an increase in attacks on Indian missions. New Delhi is re-strategising the impact this will have on all Indian missions, installations and projects underway, the sources said.

Since the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24 to deal with the coronavirus epidemic, all business and economic activity has come to a virtual standstill, leaving migrant workers with no work. Most of them are daily wage earners who live a hand to mouth existence in big cities, and cannot afford to pay rent or buy food unless they earn.

“If police open the borders, we can walk all the way to Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh some 100 kilometres away. Due to this lockdown, my work got affected. From past one week, I have nothing to do. I sell fruits, for which I have to go to Ghazipur mandi and police are not allowing us to go there.

“I live in a rented accommodation and it will become very difficult for us to give rent and bear us daily expenses. We can somehow manage these things in Moradabad,” Mr. Singh said.

On Saturday, thousands of daily wagers and labourers from Delhi, Haryana and even Punjab reached Anand Vihar, Ghazipur and Ghaziabad’s Lal Kuan areas after arduous treks on foot in a bid to ride buses to their respective native places.

According to police, around 10,000 to 15,000 people had assembled at Anand Vihar on March 28. Around 60 to 70 buses ferried as many passengers as they could. Till midnight, around 500 more buses were supposed to reach Delhi and evacuate the migrant workers.

However, there is no clarity on how many were actually sent on the buses and how many were dispersed by police.

By March 29 morning, the area had been cleared and Delhi police said no transit is being allowed from Anand Vihar bus terminus. Instead barricades were placed on all entry points into the terminus at a distance of about 500 metres.

Mohammad Anwar (30), who works in a boutique, said he came to Delhi two weeks ago from Sitamarhi in Bihar and had no idea that the situation will turn like this.

“I am alone here in the national capital. My parents live in Sitamarhi. Police are not allowing us to catch a bus. My health is not well and I can’t walk to Sitamarhi. I have no other option and will go back to my room in east Delhi’s Gandhi Nagar area,” Mr. Anwar said.

The distance between Delhi to Sitamarhi is 950 kilometres, which would take around four days to cover on foot.

The death toll from COVID-19 climbed to 25 and the total number of cases to 979 on March 29.

“The situation for the daily labourers like us is becoming worse day by day as we have lost our source of income. We do not have money for rent and food.

According to local MLA, Shantiram Mahato, the labourers had returned on March 27 and were advised self- quarantine for 14 days as a precaution against COVID-19.

“As they did not have enough space in their homes to maintain social distancing, it was decided they will live on trees for the time being,” he said.

Cots were arranged which they tied to the branches and plastic sheets were placed over them to protect them from rain.

Inside the fight against COVID-19 in India, there is no “war room” for a disease that is best fought by maintaining physical distance.

Adequate arrangements for food and shelter of the poor and needy, including migrant labourers, should also be made at the place of their work, for which the use of the State Disaster Response Fund has already been authorised.

“Sufficient funds are available with States in this head,” said the statement.

Essentials exempt

In a separate letter to the Chief Secretaries of all States, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla said the transportation of all goods, without distinction of essential and non-essential, has been allowed.

118,2020/03/29,Coronavirus lockdown | Rahul Gandhi calls for a ‘nuanced approach’,"Complete lockdown could result in ‘catastrophic’ loss of life, says the Congress ex-chief.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to adopt a more “nuanced approach” to the fight against COVID-19 as a complete lockdown could result in a “catastrophic” loss of life.

In a letter to the PM, he said the rush of youth back to villages would endanger the lives of the elderly population. He said the government should take such an approach “that takes the complex realities of our people into consideration”.

Coronavirus | Helpline numbers | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

In his letter, released by the Congress party hours after the Prime Minister's Mann Ki Baat address, he also offered suggestions to deal with the exodus of migrant workers, informal sector and financial institutions as the Congress leader anticipated a further extension of the lockdown.

“It is critical for us to understand that India’s conditions are unique. We will be required to take different steps than other large countries who are following a total lockdown strategy. The number of poor people in India who are dependent on a daily income is simply too large for us to unilaterally shut down all economic activity. The consequences of a complete economic shut down will disastrously amplify the death toll arising from the virus,” Mr. Gandhi said in the letter, released by the Congress party hours after the Prime Minister’s Mann Ki Baat.

“Our priority must be to protect and isolate the elderly and vulnerable from the virus and to clearly and strongly communicate to the young the dangers of proximity to older people,” he said.

“Millions of India’s elderly live in villages. A complete lockdown and the resulting shut down of our economic engine will almost certainly ensure that millions of unemployed youth rush back to their villages, increasing the risk of infecting their parents and the elderly population living there. This will result in a catastrophic loss of life.”

Mr. Gandhi suggested strengthening the social safety net and use of every public resource to support and shelter the working poor as the sudden lockdown had created immense panic and confusion.

He pointed out how closure of factories, small industries and construction sites had forced tens of thousands of migrant labourers to walk home to their villages and were stranded at various State borders.

“It is important that we help them find shelter and provide them with money directly into their bank accounts to help them tide over the next few months.”

The Congress leader noted that the actual economic impact would be felt in a few weeks from now and stressed on the importance of “protecting the financial and strategic institutions from the shock wave that is bound to come”.

“Our informal economy and immense network of small and medium businesses and farmers are going to be vital to any rebuilding effort. It is crucial that we engage them in a conversation, build their confidence and protect their interests with correct and timely action,” he said.

122,2020/03/29,"No fuel crisis in India; enough stock of petrol, diesel, LPG available to last lockdown: IOC","With most cars and two-wheelers going off the road, petrol demand has fallen by 8% in March while diesel demand has been down 16%

India, the world’s third largest energy consumer, has enough petrol, diesel and cooking gas (LPG) in stock to last way beyond the three-week nationwide lockdown as all plants and supply locations are fully operational, Indian Oil Corp (IOC) Chairman Sanjiv Singh said.

Singh, who continued to oversee the mammoth operations of ensuring that fuel reaches every nook and corner despite bereavement of his father on the day 21-day lockdown was declared, said there is no shortage of any fuel in the country and customers should not resort to panic booking of LPG refills.

“We have mapped demand for all fuel for entire April and beyond. We have refineries operating at levels enough to meet all of the demand. Besides all bulk storage points, LPG distributorships and petrol pumps are functioning normally. There is absolutely no shortage of any fuel,” he told PTI.

The nationwide lockdown that has shut businesses, suspended flights, stopped trains and brought almost entire vehicular movement to a halt, has impacted fuel demand with petrol, diesel and aviation turbine fuel (ATF) showing negative growth (degrowth or fall in demand).

With most cars and two-wheelers going off the road, petrol demand has fallen by 8% in March while diesel demand has been down 16%. ATF demand has fallen by 20%, he said.

“LPG consumption however continues to grow and we are servicing all customers,” he said adding refill demand saw more than 200% jump as the lockdown was announced.

The refills sought were a result of panic booking as in the absence of the exhausting existing ones, many could not take deliveries of new cylinders, he said adding even customers with double cylinder connections had ordered for refills without exhausting even one cylinder.

“There is absolutely no need for panic booking. We have enough stocks to meet all demand,” he said. When a customer resorts to panic booking, it puts unnecessary strain on the system as the requirement is immediately transmitted to bottling locations which make additional refills, transport it to bulk location and onward to the distributor.

“Distributors use already stretched delivery boys to physically deliver the cylinder to customer’s home only to return back with the filled cylinder as the customer refused delivery because existing ones hadn’t exhausted.”

Singh said due to lower demand of liquid fuels, refinery run-rates have been lowered by 25-30% - meaning they would produce up to 30% less of all fuel - petrol, diesel, ATF, naphtha and LPG.

Every barrel of crude oil when processed produces a certain percentage of petrol, diesel, kerosene/ATF and LPG. So, lower processing of crude would result in lower production of all fuel.

“To make up for the shortfall in LPG production, we have tied up for imports to meet the requirement of entire April,” he said. “We have mapped requirement of LPG for all of April, including the additional demand that would come from the government’s announcement of free cooking gas for three months to over 8 crore Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana beneficiaries.”

“We may need 850,000 tonne of additional LPG and we have tied up import for all of it,” Singh said. To make lockdown a success, LPG is the key as without cooking fuel people would not stay home. So we have made adequate arrangements to make it available,” he said.

IOC supplies to nearly half of the 27.59 crore active LPG customers.

“The terminals and depots, LPG distributorships and fuel stations are well-stocked customers are advised not to panic or resort to hoarding and panic-buying or visit the showrooms and godowns of their LPG distributorships for obtaining refills,” he said.

For the past 10 days, IOC has been delivering on an average 25 lakh cylinders every day to the doorsteps of its customers. All state-run fuel retailers together deliver about 52 lakh refills throughout the country.

All 119 Aviation Fuel Stations of IOC across the country are operating with optimum strength and full safety precautions to meet the aviation fuel (ATF) needs of defence aircraft, cargo flights and medical ambulances.

Singh said despite the challenges posed by Covid-19 lockdown, IOC is fully geared to maintain smooth supply of petroleum products to its customers. The firm has put in place robust plans for petroleum movement and stocks at upcountry locations.

Even in the face of restricted movement of people and vehicles, IOC is ensuring loading of petrol, diesel and LPG at its bulk storage/distribution points with optimised manpower.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/2uchak/article31168385.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BMLOCKDOWNPEOPLELPGMUMBAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-fuel-crisis-in-india-enough-stock-of-petrol-diesel-lpg-available-to-last-lockdown-ioc/article31197600.ece

Yet another person in contact with the Sangli family, 23 of whose members have already been diagnosed with COVID-19, has tested positive for the virus, taking the total tally in the district to 25 on Sunday.

District authorities said a total lockdown has been imposed in Islampur tehsil — from where 24 of the 25 cases have been reported — for the next three days and the town has been sealed off for a radius of 3.5 km from the residence of the patients.

Authorities fear a further rise in the number of cases in Sangli in the next few days. “The fresh case is of a person who was in contact with the family from Islampur. His reports came in last night and he has tested positive,” State surveillance officer Dr. Pradeep Awate said.

Authorities said 337 people who were in close contact with the family have been placed in quarantine facilities. “Only medical stores will be kept open for a day, while the sale of vegetables and milk, too, would be prohibited till March 31,” Islampur Teshildar Ravindra Sabnis said. A three-member medical committee from Mumbai, under JJ Hospital dean Dr. Pallavi Saple, is already in Sangli to take stock of the situation.

On March 13, four members of the Islampur family arrived at Mumbai airport after travelling to Saudi Arabia for the Haj pilgrimage. Despite being directed to home quarantine, the family interacted freely with guests who came to meet them on their return home, and also threw a dinner party.

Dr. Sanjay Salunkhe, district civil surgeon, Sangli, said, “On March 19, the four started experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. We sent their swab samples to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune, which returned positive. Soon enough, five other members of the family tested positive, to be followed by 14 others and a woman from Kolhapur who was in contact with some of the family members.”

State Water Resources Minister Jayant Patil, who is the MLA from Islampur, had earlier said the area where the family lives had been cordoned off. At the same time, he stressed that all patients in the family, including senior citizens among them, were stable.

After one positive case, the Kolhapur administration, too, has tightened its vigil and has screened more than 51,000 people through home surveillance teams.

Meanwhile, with a fresh case being reported from Pune on Sunday, the number of cases in the district has now risen to 37. “Till date, 795 samples have been sent to the NIV, of which 740 have returned negative and the results of 28 sare awaited.

“I have had to take some decisions that has created hardship for you, especially my poor brothers and sisters... They [the poor] must be thinking what kind of Prime Minister is this who has locked up all of us. I specifically ask for forgiveness from them. But looking at the world, this looks like the only option,” the Prime Minister said.

Striking an optimistic note, Mr. Modi wrapped up his 36-minute address by asserting that India would successfully defeat the challenge posed by COVID-19 and hoped to put it behind by his next radio broadcast in April.

On those violating the lockdown rules, Mr. Modi said, “This is sad...Many people across the world did the same mistake. Those who are defying lockdown are playing with their own lives”.

Referring to reports of social discrimination against patients infected with the virus, Mr. Modi said, while maintaining social distance, there should be an increase in social interaction.

""Social distancing is not about ending social interaction... This is the time to infuse new life in your relationships.... Increase social distance but decrease emotional or human distance,” he urged.

Speaking to patients who had recovered from COVID-19, the Prime Minister urged them to share their stories on social media and “make them viral to inspire others”.

The Prime Minister said traditional Indian knowledge has taught the country to deal with a diseases before it acquires a furious nature.

“Coronavirus has imprisoned the whole world. The virus is challenging everyone — knowledge, science, poor, weak, rich and powerful. It is neither bound by any territory nor region nor weather. This virus seems determined to kill human beings,” he said and urged “the entire human race to resolve to fight [the pandemic] unitedly”.

Describing doctors and nurses as frontline soldiers in the battle against COVID-19, Mr. Modi spoke with two doctors about their experience in dealing with the current health crisis.

The Prime Minister also thanked the nurses and reminded that the current year is being commemorated as the International Year of Nurses to mark the 200th birth anniversary of Florence Nightingale.

Talking about the importance of people who are helping maintain essential services, Mr Modi called them as “Daily Lives Heroes who ensure that your lives are not disrupted”.

Wrapping up his address, the Prime Minister encouraged people to restart their hobies or utilise their time to introspect. “Don't go outside and but use this opportunity to look within yourself,” he said.

Coronavirus | Helpline numbers

Excerpts from Mr. Modi’s first Mann ki Baat amid the 21-day-long COVID-19 lockdown:

“Today, there is only one issue that is gripping the world. I apologise to the countrymen and my conscience says you will forgive me.

When I look at the poor people, they must be thinking what kind of the Prime Minister is this who has put you through this hardship. Some of you may be unhappy with the lockdown.

There was only this option. It is a battle for life and death.

Our scriptures say diseases must be controlled before they go out of check. Coronavirus has imprisoned everyone.

It is challenging everyone and everything.

Coronavirus | Why 21-day lockdown period?

Our scriptures say our good health is our great fortune. Those who are breaking rules are playing with their life.

We have to take inspiration from our frontline soldiers, our nurses and doctors who are battling this coronavirus.”

The PM speaks to Mr. Ram, an IT professional from Hyderabad, who recently recovered from COVID-19. Mr. Ram narrates his experience after contracting COVID-19 on his return from Dubai.

Next, he speaks to Ashok Kapur (73). ""My sons, who have a shoes business, had gone to Italy. And there they got COVID-19. My son in law, who had gone too, tested positive at Ram Monahar Lohia hospital. Then we were advised test and all of us, six of our family members, tested positive. We were transferred to Safdarjung hospital. We are thankful to the doctors, nurses and staff,"" says Mr. Kapur.

PM Modi asks Mr. Kapur to create awareness, and if possible, feed those who are hungry. He also urges him to popularise their experience on social media.

The PM now speaks to doctors, who are the first line of attack against COVID-19.

Dr. Nitish Gupta says: ""Just as the Army fights on the borders, we are also fighting. We have to inspire people that they will be well in 14 days and will go home. People get worried by seeing the figures of expired people abroad.""

Mr. Modi says: ""This is the year for the nurses. I salute them for their sense of dedication.""

The PM also thanks the heroes in our daily lives — those who ensure water supply or electricity, the neighborhood grocers, or the delivery boys of the e-commerce platforms.

""Maintain social distancing but increase social interaction,"" he says while discussing the issue of instances of ill treatment of those who are in quarantine. ""Don't go outside and but use this opportunity to look within yourself,"" he says.

The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented situation and that's why some of the decisions are also unprecedented, he says.

""This is an opportunity to display your humanity. Think of feeding the poor. Our culture advocates this and I am sure we can do this. Next time we when meet again over Mann Ki Baat, I hope we will be able to get over the challenges we face now. Thank you,"" says Mr. Modi as he concludes his address.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uyhq7o/article31163865.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Modi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pm-addresses-first-mann-ki-baat-amid-covid-19-lockdown/article31197188.ece

They stopped motorcyclists who were either going about the town without masks on or had a pillion rider and persuaded them to avoid going out unless it was absolutely necessary and asked them to not step out without taking precautions.

Speaking with The Hindu, Three Town Circle Inspector Md. Thabrej said that they roped in the forum as the people were not responding well to police officers.

The forum members were also spotted carrying placards expressing solidarity with duty-bound police officers who are working day and night to ensure that no one is flouting the rules of the curfew. The event was held at 3 p.m., a couple of hours post the time allowed by the government to purchase essential goods.

Apart from extending their medical services, Mr. Reddy appealed to all the private nursing homes and hospitals to create isolation wards and allocate beds.

While the TTD’s ‘Srinivasam’ pilgrims’ complex is likely to become the major isolation centre, the private doctors would be provided personal protective equipment(PPE) kits and N95 masks.

Meanwhile, Collector Bharat N. Gupta has estimated the number of beds required for quarantine at 5,000 in Chittoor district. The practising and retired doctors, final year medical PG students have been asked to brace up for the task.

Anantapur police intercepted 126 daily wage earners from Madhya Pradesh and Telangana, who were trying to cross over to Anantapur district at Kodikonda checkpost in the early hours of Sunday.

Chilamathur Sub-Inspector Venkateswarlu and other constables noticed several families going on foot at the checkpost and stopped all of them.

Anantapur police officers arranged food for all of them at a location close to the border check-post and late in the night and later talked to the police officials in Karnataka and convinced them to take them back to that State. All of them were sent back in special vehicles arranged for them. They said at many places there was shortage of food at many camps leading to people being fed only once a day.

From Madhya Pradesh 48 persons had gone to Bengaluru recently to work in the apartments for fixing tiles and 28 of them from Warangal in Telangana too had gone there recently to do some odd job and earn a living. Another batch of 50 persons used to sell electrical goods on pushcarts in Bengaluru and all of them used to stay close to Hebbal temporarily and go to their worksite everyday.

With the ‘Janata Curfew’ and national lockdown for COVID-19 implemented, they were asked to vacate their temporary shelters and leave for their homes, but by the time they tried to leave there was no public transport and they set out on foot.

Indian Medical Association (IMA) East Godavari Chapter president V. Ravi on Sunday appealed the State government to adopt the ‘trace, test and treat’ method to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.

Dedicated facilities

“The spread of COVID-19 can be checked only when the positive and suspect cases are separated from general patients at hospitals. The COVID-19 patients should be treated in exclusive and dedicated facilities,” Dr. Ravi said here on Sunday.

Testing kits

Welcoming the move of conversion of various building into the isolation wards, Dr. Ravi stressed that the machinery should be equipped with more screening test kits in order to tackle the spread of the virus in the coming days.

131,2020/03/29,"Investors hail RBI sops, seek more to bail out MSMEs","‘Post lockdown, banks should provide working capital liberally’

Several investors in the city opine that the sops announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will provide the booster dose to them in overcoming the challenging situation thrown up by COVID-19 and the lockdown now observed to contain its spread.

The investors, by and large, say that the announcements made by the RBI and the ₹1.7 lakh crore- package unveiled by the the Union Finance Minister to address the livelihood issues posed by the lockdown will help stabilise the market.

‘Waive power bills, taxes’

Visakha Autonagar Small-Scale Industries’ Welfare Association president A.K. Balaji said that once the industries were opened after lockdown, huge cash would be required to restart. While welcoming the sops announced, he said, to bridge the gap, working capital should be provided by the banks liberally at low interest rates, and, if possible, with out interest.

Power bills and municipal taxes should be waived for a period of three months on the lines of the moratorium announced for the borrowers on payment of EMIs.

Sravan Shipping Services managing director G. Sambasiva Rao said the slew of measures initiated by the RBI such as special lines of liquidity, loan moratorium for three months on working capital and term loans and easier asset quality norms to help the economy tide over the crisis were highly laudable.

The measures would offer some protection against widespread defaults.

“It’s a temporary relief in effect. Banks can allow all customers to not pay their monthly EMIs for a three-month period, and the non-repayment will not hurt their credit score. At the same time, rating of the organisation will remain intact. We need the economy to blossom. It is the only way we can go ahead,” he said.

132,2020/03/29,COVID-19: no takers for famed Ulavapadu mangoes in Prakasam,"Farmers seek cold storage facility and help in marketing the produce

Mango growers in Prakasam district are a worried lot as the country-wide lockdown to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus coincided with marketing of the king of fruits.

The output this year has been quite encouraging as they had a good precipitation, ending five years of consecutive drought. Flowering also occurred at the right time in December/January promising an yield of about five tonnes per acre.

But the outbreak of the dreaded disease has put paid to their hopes of reaping the benefits. Upcountry buyers, who used to make a beeline for the orchards in and around the ‘mango village’ of Ulavapadu in the district, have not turned up yet to confirm orders, a group of farmers from the village said in a conversation with The Hindu.

The market price of the Ulavapadu variety ruled at ₹40,000 per tonne. While the best quality mangoes are first moved to cities such as Chennai, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and from there to the U.S.A., European and West Asian countries. Traders from the north used to first visit Nuzvid in the Krishna district and then to Ulavapadu, where mangoes are grown in over 18,000 acres.

Keeping their fingers crossed, they said, “We are hoping against hope that the lockdown is not extended beyond three weeks as the matured crop has to be harvested and moved to markets swiftly.”

“There are no takers for the pulpy fruit ever since the lockdown was declared,” lamented a trader K. Sudhakar who has put a stall by the side of the Chennai-Kolkata highway in Ulavapadu.

“If the lockout is extended beyond three weeks they will have no option but to allow the most-sought-after mango variety to rot,” feared a farmer P. Nagaraju from Ravuru village.

They wanted the government to arrange for cold storage facility and help us in marketing the produce before they perish, added another farmer Mathaiah from Gudluru village.

Progressive farmers have adopted zero-based natural farming techniques to meet the increasing demand for organically-grown fruit which gets a premium price of more than ₹50,000 per tonne.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/327er5/article31201203.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28-VJ-MANGOES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/covid-19-no-takers-for-famed-ulavapadu-mangoes-in-prakasam/article31201204.ece

134,2020/03/29,"Stand by people at their hour of need, Naidu asks cadre","‘I salute those who are holding the party flag high braving barbaric attacks by opponents’

After suggesting the governments and organisations to use digital platforms more effectively to eliminate physical contact to the extent possible, TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu turned to teleconference to address the cadres on the party’s 39th Formation Day on Sunday.

“Due to the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic, the party has called off all celebrations. It has asked everyone to stay at home and pay homage to party founder-president N.T. Rama Rao. Every worker and leader is celebrating the Formation Day from their respective houses,” Mr. Naidu said.

Stating that the TDP always stood by the people in times distress – be it Uttarakhand floods, or Hudhud and Titli cyclones – Mr. Naidu exhorted the party cadre to rise to the occasion with the same spirit in this hour of crisis too.

‘Be vigilant, safe’

“The TDP is extending support and helping people through the NTR Trust and the Basavatarakam Cancer Hospital. It striving hard to take forward the objectives and ideals of NTR. In the wake of the threat posed by COVID-19, there is a need to instil confidence among the people. Coronavirus spares neither the king nor the common man. Prince Charles too is afflicted by the disease,” Mr. Naidu said, and cautioned on the possibility of relapse of the diseases on the 19th day of treatment.

“Everyone has to be vigilant and adhere to the government’s instructions, maintain social distance, minimise points of contact, and create awareness among all sections of society,” Mr. Naidu said.

Saluting the workers for carrying the party flag and their families braving the barbaric attacks on them by the opponents, Mr. Naidu said the TDP would not forget the services of such workers. A few workers had lost their lives and a few others their properties, he said. Though some leaders had parted ways, the cadre was intact, Mr. Naidu observed.

“We cannot forget their services and sacrifices,” he said in a veiled reference to a few sitting and former MLCs and MLAs who had switched their loyalties to the YSRCP recently.

In a series of tweets, Mr. Naidu extended his wishes to the cadre on the occasion.

Party general secretary N. Lokesh conveyed wishes to the leaders and activists. “Founded by NTR as a sign of self-respect, Mr. Chandrababu has taken the party to the next level by serving the people. I am proud to be part of the TDP, which has been fulfilling the aspirations of the people for 38 years,” Mr. Lokesh said in his tweet.

Earlier, the party workers and leaders sang “Maa Telugu talliki mallepoo danda…” and raised slogans such as “NTR Amar Rahe” and “TDP vardhillaali.”",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/stand-by-people-at-their-hour-of-need-naidu-asks-cadre/article31201117.ece
135,2020/03/29,Count reaches 21as two more testpositive in Vizag,"Two persons, who are contacts of a COVID-19 positive patient in Visakhapatnam, tested positive on Sunday, taking the count to 21 in the State. Of the total 21 confirmed cases, eight persons contracted the virus from their close relatives who returned from abroad recently. Of the 21 persons, only 10 returned from foreign countries recently.

The primary patient, a 25-year-old youth who came from Birmingham of England to Visakhapatnam on March 17, travelled to home from the Visakhapatnam airport by car along with his father who tested positive on March 27, four days after the former had tested positive.

Two more of his close relatives who came into contact with the primary patient on March 17 developed symptoms two days ago and got admitted to hospital on March 28.

Meanwhile, in a positive development, the 65-year-old patient, who tested positive on March 17 after returning from Mecca, tested negative twice as required by the treatment protocol. He would be soon discharged after further observation, officials said.

So far four persons, including two who came back from New Delhi, have caused the infection to eight persons, nearly half of the total count.

136,2020/03/29,Coronavirus the sole topic of debate,"IAS officer makes a gaffe at a high-level meeting held recently

The corridors of power are all agog with the sole topic of coronavirus. While Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has held a series of meetings on the pandemic, a meeting held by Additional Chief Secretary P.V. Ramesh was by far the most interesting. Dr Ramesh, a doctor of medicine, is known for his wide medical knowledge and tremendous articulation of his thoughts.

Those in attendance were left speechless when Dr. Ramesh recounted the story of ‘Patient 31’ who took the coronavirus to South Korea, and was singularly responsible for several thousands becoming infected in that country. While the IAS officer’s narration was striking, he made a crucial error — he referred to ‘Patient 31’ as a man whereas the patient was actually a 61-year-old woman who later died of coronavirus.

A tough fight

A senior IAS officer who was relegated to the sidelines in the wake of the regime change last year, now finds himself in the midst of a high-profile campaign related to the coronavirus outbreak.

The State government recently vested the bureaucrat with the crucial responsibility of taking care of the people from Andhra Pradesh who are stranded in other States and at inter-State borders and put them under quarantine facilities.

138,2020/03/29,Senior citizens bear the brunt of outbreak,"Lockdown takes food, medicines out of their reach

The dreaded coronavirus has sent people scurrying into their homes to escape infections. While the virus is a potential threat to the entire mankind, the senior citizens, most vulnerable of all, are alarmed and worried, fearing the worst.

“We have a large number of old couples living alone as their children are settled abroad. They live in a constant pain of emotional void in their lives and the outbreak of COVID-19 has compounded their problems. The servants they rely on for their food and medicines have all left in view of the lockdown, leaving them high and dry,” says Mothukuri Venkatesawar Rao, associate president of Andhra Pradesh Senior Citizens Welfare Association.

‘Form colony committees’

The office-bearers of the organisation have been receiving SoS calls from some of the hapless seeking immediate supply of food and medicines. “They are in dire straits and the government needs to respond immediately,” says Mr. Rao, who sees an answer in constitution of colony and street committees with the assistance of local NGOs for both, maintaining a constant vigil in the lockdown hours and also to reach out to the needs of the elderly lot. “Workers engaged to deliver food and medicines to them could be given ID cards,” he suggests.

Mr. Rao also expressed serious concern over the condition of inmates in the 40-odd homes for the aged in Krishna district alone. He said though some of them are not registered, but in view of the current crisis, the government should initiate immediate steps for delivery of food and medicines at their doorstep.

‘Supply commodities’

Lockdown has hit old-age homes that largely depend on public donations by organisations like Rotary, Lions and Vasavi Clubs besides other NGOs and individual donors. Keerthy Bollineni, president of Vasavya Mahila Mandali, that runs Dandamudi Veeraraghavaiah and Sarojini Devi Home for the Aged, located opposite Village Secretariat building in Gosala, through her twitter handle on Sunday, urged the government to implement a centralised system for supply of essential commodities to the homes through the Civil Supplies Department.

Kodali Venkataratnam, secretary of Senior Citizens Forum, that runs a partially-funded old-age home at Kanuru, says anticipating a lockdown, the Forum stocked up groceries and other material needed for smooth run of the home for the next one month.

“People have been advising me to send the inmates to their respective homes during the lockdown period. But most of them here are from cities like Chennai and Hyderabad and can’t manage in this difficult situation. So far we have managed things and I hope we would continue to do so,” says Sheela Cherukuri, who runs Amma Old Age Home at Kesarapalli.

139,2020/03/29,Aqua industry in East Godavari district reels under lockdown,"Deputy Chief Minister leading efforts to sort out hurdles in transportation and manpower

The ongoing nationwide lockdown has dealt a death blow to the aquaculture industry in East Godavari district, with fish in 6,000 hectares on the verge of being harvested finding no takers.

Processing of prawn has also fallen from 650 MT per day to 130 MT per day at the 21 processing plants across the district by Sunday. A grinding halt in the supply of 600 million seeds in the 188 hatchers has further paralysed the industry within the past week in the district, which is home to one-third of the hatcheries in the country.

Deputy Chief Minister Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose is learnt to be leading the State government’s efforts to sort out hurdles related to manpower, as many workers have stopped coming to work. The government is also looking to sort out restrictions on transportation of seeds, feed and logistics, it is learnt.

“China, a major importer of shrimp from India, is believed to be willing to import the shrimp now. The problems in transportation and Export Inspection Agency clearances are being addressed on a war footing,” Mr. Bose said at a crucial meeting held with the hatchery firms, feed supply firms and exporters here on Sunday.

According to traders and export agents, nearly 30% of aqua production is exported to foreign countries while the rest of the production in the district is meant for the domestic market.

Mr. Bose and Social Welfare Minister P. Viswaroop on Sunday asked East Godavari Collector D. Muralidhar Reddy to persuade the workers to resume duty, as well as allowing transport activities to resume in order to bail out the industry. On Sunday, nearly 110 vehicles including 28 for feed supply have been permitted to ply across the State.

‘Bleak future’

Joint Director (Fisheries-East Godavari) Jaya Rao said that crop in 17,000 hectares (including whiteleg shrimp or ‘vannamei’), is in various stages of cultivation across the district. “The Export Inspection Agency, Visakhapatnam, has been sought to issue the health certificates for the exports through Visakhapatnam and Chennai ports,” Mr. Jaya Rao said.

Stakeholders such as owners of hatcheries and feed firms warned of a bleak future, adding that any further delay in speeding up the revival of the aquaculture activity would lead to a collapse of the industry, leaving them with insurmountable losses.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/nlg1fl/article31201008.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30VJPAGEAQUA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/aqua-industry-in-east-godavari-district-reels-under-lockdown/article31201010.ece

141,2020/03/29,"With no source of food, animals suffer in silence","Thousands of stray dogs and cattle go hungry as eateries stay closed

The ongoing lockdown is wreaking havoc on animals and birds that have come to depend on human activity for their subsistence.

Thousands of stray dogs and cattle in the city, as well as birds like sparrows, crows, pigeons and parrots, are struggling to find food as all of the city’s eateries, including roadside food stalls, have closed down in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

Exacerbating the lack of food is the onset of the summer, with the stifling heat driving animals and birds to the brink of exhaustion.

“I saw a parrot fall from the sky in my lawn. It must have suffered a sunstroke and was unable to move. I tried my best to revive the bird, but it died after a few hours,” said Hari, a resident.

“Some thousands of street dogs and stray cattle depend on hotels, fast food centres, fruit markets and push-carts for their food. With the city closing down completely for several days, many animals and birds are dying of hunger,” said P. Avinash, a student.

“There are around 200 push-cart vendors doing business in each town in the State. In the cities, there will be more than 5,000 push-cart vendors selling breakfast, snacks, non-vegetarian food, noodles, juice, fruits and other eatables. The stray dogs and cattle depend on the leftovers generated by these push-carts,” an officer of the Health Department said.

“Every year, during the summer, some people will provide water in tumblers on the terraces for birds. Due to the lockdown, residents are not coming out and many birds are dying,” a resident M. Vaishali of Poranki in Vijayawada said.

Meanwhile, animal lovers are worried about the health of their pet dogs, birds and other domestic animals as feed and medicines are unavailable due to the lockdown.

A resident, who was seen taking his dog on a two-wheeler to a veterinarian’s clinic, said his dog was suffering from ill-health and that he was unable to ensure immediate treatment due to the ongoing lockdown.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/obelp0/article31200856.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30VJPAGE2PETS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/with-no-source-of-food-animals-suffer-in-silence/article31200857.ece
142,2020/03/29,Chicken prices bounce back to normal in city,"Long queues witnessed outside poultry shops in several districts

Chicken prices made an astounding comeback in the State, to close at ₹200 per kg on Sunday from a low of ₹40 per kg just a few days ago.

Serpentine queues were witnessed outside poultry shops in Krishna, West Godavari and other districts in the State as customers finally began coming back to the dish that they had so hurriedly swore off in the wake of the coronavirus scare.

Thanks to hoax messages on social media, non-vegetarians swore off poultry products in the past one month. Prices of eggs too crashed to ₹2.50 paise each, with restaurants stopping the sale of non-vegetarian dishes to stem their losses.

Traders were forced to arrange ‘chicken and egg melas’ at different places in the State, and even gave away chicken and eggs free of cost to convince customers that the virus is in no way linked to food. However, the measures failed to have any impact, with prices continuing to spiral downwards.

However, thanks to a spate of awareness drives and assurances by experts that eating meat is perfectly safe, non-vegetarians finally began returning to chicken and mutton shops. Chicken prices returned to normalcy while egg prices too saw a rise. Mutton was sold at ₹600 per kg, while fish sold at ₹150 per kg and prawns at ₹200 per kg on Sunday.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/a47v4u/article31200816.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30-VJ-CHICKENRUSH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/chicken-prices-bounce-back-to-normal-in-city/article31200817.ece

145,2020/03/29,Shopping time cut to 5 hours in urban areas of A.P.,"CM orders check on prices, deployment of additional manpower

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has ordered that the time given for buying essential commodities in urban areas should be restricted from seven to five hours (6 a.m. to 11 a.m. instead of 1 p.m.) to reduce the scope for large gatherings at rythu bazaars and grocery stores, further tightening the measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. People in villages can do their shopping from 6 a.m. to 1 p.m.

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy also instructed the officials to get the price list displayed prominently and to take stringent action on traders jacking up the prices.

He told the officials to focus on cities and towns where the danger still lurked, by deploying additional manpower. He said there should be no impediments for essential and emergency services and action plan be prepared to tackle the menace in potential hotspots.

Survey

Addressing a high-level review meeting on Sunday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said every family should be surveyed by ward and village volunteers, accredited social health activists and ANMs so that the government would be better positioned to deal with the situation.

He laid emphasis on the maintenance of social distance at all public gatherings, pointing out that it was the most effective way to keep the virus at bay.

Further, he suggested that mobile vegetable outlets be allowed, essentials transported in RTC buses and uninterrupted supply of farm inputs ensured.

He wanted the migrant labourers to be taken care of properly.

146,2020/03/29,Wholesale flower market loses sheen,"Vendors down shutters to minimise losses

An unusual silence pervades the city’s iconic wholesale flower market.

Flower stalls have downed their shutters with the market association formally announcing a closure of all shops till March 31. However, vendors say that they have no clue when they will be able to reopen their shops as the lockdown formally ends on April 14.

The coronavirus outbreak could not have come at a more inopportune time — the vendors could not do any business ahead of Ugadi, and are unlikely to do any business on Sri Rama Navami too, which falls on April 2. “These two festivals are crucial for us because after Rama Navami, there are no major festivals for months,” vendors said.

The market again gains momentum only during Sravana Masam, when women come in large numbers to buy flowers for Varalakshmi Vratam. This year, Sravana Masam begins in the last week of July, and it is unlikely that the markets recover by then. This means the vendors will have to wait till Dasara, which is the busiest time of the year for them.

“I am able to do business worth ₹30,000 if I work from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m., that too on some days,” said Qaja, a flower vendor. However, he is quick to add that the flower business is highly volatile and does not go according to expectations.

“Though the market receives jasmine during summer and has good demand, it is unlikely that the vendors would come out of the losses,” said Basha, another flower vendor.

According to information, the flower market receives supplies from Bengaluru, Kolar (Karnataka), Kuppam in Chittoor district, and Tadepalligudem in Guntur district. On normal days, the flower arrivals range between 250 MT and 400 MT. During Dasara, arrivals go beyond 800 MT. There are more than 80 shops in the market, and each shop receives three to five MT of flowers every day.

Wholesale Flower Merchants’ Association president Sheik Jani said that the flower merchants and commission agents are fearing losses between ₹15,000 to ₹20,000 every day due to the lockdown. The daily wage workers at the market and the petty vendors who sell the flowers on the roadside would also suffer. As the market would have to be closed by 12 noon due to the lockdown, the association has decided to close down all shops till March 31.

“Flowers are more perishable than vegetables. We cannot sell the flowers the next day and have no option but to dump them. This is why we have downed our shutters completely with a view to minimising our losses,” he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/nm47wq/article31199674.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30-VJ-FLOWERSHOP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/wholesale-flower-market-loses-sheen/article31199675.ece

148,2020/03/29,Lockdown leisure opens up politicians to their forgotten hobbies,"While for some it is gardening and farming, for others it is books and music; but the common is, of course, some quality time with their families, who don’t seem to be complaining

The lockdown might have brought many hurdles for almost all sections of the society. But it had provided unexpected leisure for public representatives and politicians who are otherwise busy. Almost of all them used to have hectic schedules right from say, 6 am to 10 pm. Now, the situation has changed completely, and they find time for their hobbies, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic.

In the absence of visitors at his camp office, Minister for Roads and Buildings Dharmana Krishnadas is spending time mostly in the agriculture fields in his native Mubagam village of Narasannapeta mandal, Srikakulam district. Mr. Krishnadas, a good sportsman is now concentrating on physical fitness too, according to his loyalists.

Catching up on reading

Former Minister and Srikakulam MLA Dharmana Prasada Rao who loves fine arts, classical music and gardening is spending time with them, thanks to complete lockout in Srikakulam town. “After a gap of many years, I am able to read books including epics intensively. I have watched Harischandra Natakam which teaches many important lessons to us. The lockout also allowed me to concentrate on gardening,” said Mr.Prasada Rao, speaking to The Hindu.

Palasa MLA Sidiri Appala Raju, a doctor by profession is spending time to extend medical services to patients suffering from kidney diseases. “I am able to spend some time with family as well. However, it is an unpleasant leisure for everyone including politicians. We hope people would come out from the scare with the intensive steps taken up by both Union and State governments,” said Dr. Appala Raju.

Srikakulam MP Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu urged people not to visit his home for the next three weeks since everyone should follow the lockout guidelines.

149,2020/03/29,"Psychiatrists foresee spurt in anxiety, panic disorders","Pursue hobbies or cultivate new ones to beat the stress, they say

The highly contagious coronavirus is leaving a trail of infections reducing life to a struggle to cope with uncertainty and the need for rapid readjustment for many. Psychiatrists are sceptical if life will get back on track post-COVID-19, especially for people who already have symptoms of anxiety, panic and major depressive disorders besides those suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).

“The outbreak will have huge psychological ramifications in the days to come. This uncertainty will spell serious trouble for people reeling under anxiety and panic disorders,” says psychiatrist Vishal Indla.

The Director of Indlas Vijayawada Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (VIMHANS) points out that uncertainty fuels anxiety and panic, thus making worse the condition of the patient. He talks about incessant calls he receives from his patients, eager to discuss with him their ‘looming fears.’

“Some of them are in a state of hyper-vigilance with severe anxiety, fear and panic. This may heighten negative thoughts and widen the scope of their relapse, resulting in more difficulties for them and people around,” he says.

Change of scenario

The rapid spread, the terrible fear and the subsequent lockdown may see new cases of psychological problems surfacing, says Dr. Vishal. “The routine of the people leading a healthy lifestyle is broken as they are confined to the four walls of their houses. Unless they fill this gap with activities that give them pleasure as well as enrich them in some way, there is bound to be a negative impact,” he warns.

V. Radhika Reddy, psychiatrist from Pooja Psychiatric Centre at Suryaraopet, echoes similar concerns. “After living in a denial mode for some time, we all now realise that COVID-19 is real and it could affect anybody. Lockdown for a prolonged period could lead to serious mental health issues,” she says.

“This is what pandemics do. People become excessively apprehensive about their health and keep looking for symptoms in their body and become over-sensitive to whatever happens around them. This is not a good thing at all,” warns Dr. Vishal.

He says the lockdown period is the best time for family bonding and to connect with old friends or learn a new skill like music, dance, gardening or even cooking.

“Don’t believe everything that appears on social media and stick to one bulletin a day. Handle life with great responsibility and gear up for a fresh start post-COVID-19,” he advises.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/psychiatrists-foresee-spurt-in-anxiety-panic-disorders/article31199104.ece
150,2020/03/29,"Take over all private hospitals, HRF urges A.P., Telangana govts.","‘Step necessary to meet challenges posted by COVID-19 pandemic’

The Human Rights Forum (HRF) strongly urged the governments of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to take over all private hospitals and nursing homes so as to meet the challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

They should be acquired along with all human resources, available medical resources and must be run by the government. Several State governments have already moved in this direction, said V.S. Krishna. HRF A.P. and TS State Coordination Committee member.

The Union government must follow the example of Spain and nationalise all private hospitals across the country for effective mitigation of the pandemic, the HRF members pointed out here on Sunday.

“Fortunately, so far the COVID-19 has been relatively merciful in the country. One dreads to imagine what would happen in the event of a big outbreak. Will our public health system, as it exists now, be able to meet the contingency?,” questioned Mr. Krishna.

Which is why all private health providers and their facilities should be placed under governmental control in order to enhance our capacity to deal with this crisis, Mr. Jeevan, State coordination committee member, said.

‘Expand testing facilities’

The HRF members also pressed for expanding the testing facilities and enhancing the capacity to produce protective gear, as the supply is inadequate even for the people who are in the frontline.

According to the HRF members, the health infrastructure, as it exists today, particularly in smaller towns, villages and the Fifth Schedule areas is abysmally inadequate.

What we need clearly at the moment is to massively strengthen our health system and improve access to healthcare, particularly for the poor and vulnerable, said Mr. Krishna.

According to reports, even at a trying time like this, some private hospitals are up to the odious practice of profit at any cost and are even offering treatment packages, he alleged.

‘Decongest prisons’

It has been a week since the Supreme Court stated that overcrowding in prisons was a matter of grave concern, particularly in the context of COVID-19. It had directed all States and Union Territories to constitute high-level committees to consider releasing prisoners and undertrials on parole or interim bail for offences entailing up to a 7-year jail term in order to decongest prisons, but both the State has not made much headway in this matter. We demand that this be taken up on a war footing, pointed out Mr. Jeevan.

152,2020/03/29,Textile industry in State suffers a massive blow,"Mills seek immediate relief measures from govt.

The textile industry, reeling under a severe financial crunch, has suffered another massive blow due to the lockout declared by the Centre to check the spread of COVID-19.

The textile industry is heavily dependent on orders for yarn from the USA and Europe and the lockout of 120 spinning mills from March 23 has hit the sector hard.

“As a result, the industry will not be able to recover at least for the next one to two years. Yarn orders are being cancelled by corporate buyers who are dependent on orders from the US and Europe. If US doesn’t recover fast, it will lead to the closure of a lot of textile mills in our State and also across the country,” said secretary of AP Textile Mills’ Association Lanka Raghurami Reddy.

Payments stopped

The textile sector has been facing losses as payments have been stopped by buyers due to the coronavirus impact, and the industry is facing severe pressure from banks. As a result more mills could be declared as Non-Performing Assets.

The APTMA has requested Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to understand the crisis situation and help the units overcome it by announcing immediate relief measures like releasing of outstanding subsidies which were not paid by the previous government for the last four years, deferment of payment of power bills to A.P. DISCOMS for three months without interest and exemption from payment of minimum consumption units and minimum MD charges.

Further, Mr. Reddy urged the CM to recommend to the Union government for waiver of interest payment on all the loans of textile units, including CC limits for six months and moratorium of two years for the existing term loans.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/textile-industry-in-state-suffers-a-massive-blow/article31198946.ece
153,2020/03/29,Workers at spinning mills staring at a bleak future,"The ongoing lockdown and a U.S-China trade war have dealt a double whammy to the industry

Over 50,000 migrant daily workers from Tamil Nadu, Odisha and other States are staring at a bleak future, with 120 spinning mills in the district shutting down since March 25 in the wake of an ongoing nationwide lockdown aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19.

The lockdown comes on the back of an unprecedented crisis that has gripped textile mills as they have declared production holidays owing to a hike in minimum support price and the U.S.-China trade war which has affected exports to China. Now, with exports to China coming to a complete halt due to COVID-19, the spinning industry has gone into a tailspin.

“China has been a major importer of cotton for several years, and the ban on exports has hit the industry hard. The domestic demand has also slackened due to stiff competition. Moreover, the cost of production is also going up,” said chairman of A.P. Spinning Mills Association, Lanka Raghurami Reddy.

Even the prices of candy have gone up by 25% with each candy fetching ₹43,000. The delay in release of power subsidies to the tune of ₹1,200 crore has come as the final nail in the coffin, forcing millers to shut down the mills.

The industry has also been hit due to delay in payments from the U.S. and Europe, and many spinning mill managements are not in a position to repay loan instalments and loan interest amounts.

The spinning mill associations have urged Chief Minister Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy to release outstanding subsidies which were not paid by the previous government for the last four years, and have also sought deferment of payment of power bills to discoms for 3 months without interest and suspend the rule of payment for minimum consumption units and minimum MD charges.

Further, Mr. Raghurami Reddy has requested the State Government to recommend to the Union government a waiver of interest payment on all loans of textile units, including CC limits, for six months, and a moratorium of two years for the existing term loans.

Cotton yarn from A.P. is known for its superior quality, and every day, four million kg of yarn is produced.

The first Sunday after the announcement of the countrywide lockdown to fight COVID-19 raised the spectre of heavy crowds surging to meat shops and vegetable markets. But the spectacle of self-discipline among the crowds, more or less adhering to the social distancing norm, came as a big relief to the police and officials at many places in Chittoor district, which recorded its first positive case last week.

In Chittoor, public started coming on to the streets from early hours to fulfil their requirements, moving towards chicken centres and vegetable outlets at half a dozen junctions. Many of them were seen with masks or handkerchiefs tied to their faces. At all the chicken shops, people were seen standing in queues at marked boxes, inching their way slowly. Violations were discouraged by fellow buyers and vendors. Similar scenes were witnessed at petrol pumps and vegetable markets.

Humanitarian gesture

In a gesture towards elderly people and women, they were allowed by consumers voluntarily to pass them in the queue. Elderly women masking their faces with saris has become a common sight, indicating fear and growing awareness among them. Interestingly, a majority of the public avoided taking their children along while moving out.

Superintendent of Police S. Senthil Kumar, who inspected the public places in Chittoor on Sunday morning, told the media that it was appreciable that the public were slowly but steadily adopting themselves to the social distancing norm. “For the next two weeks, the lockdown will be implemented strictly. We are thoroughly monitoring the foreign returnees who are under home quarantine now. Their movements are under strict surveillance on the app,” he said.

Norms at ration shops

Meanwhile, prompted by the civil supplies officials and the police personnel on patrol, ration shop dealers ensured that beneficiaries washed their hands before collecting their ration from a distance of one metre. This norm was seen successfully implemented at Irala, Thavanampalle, Piler, Bangaruplem and Gudipala mandals.

Rajesh Kumar, who came from Bhopal along with his wife for commissioning a huge equipment in a nearby sugar factory, got held up in the city when the lockdown was announced. With all modes of transport coming to a grinding halt and the borders sealed, he too had no option but to make the period of his stay as comfortable as possible.

Set-back to stay back

Due to the lockdown that came immediately after the ‘Janata Curfew’ after COVID-19 started rearing its head in the country, there are several such families in this pilgrim city that had to stay back. For them, the first set-back came in the form of closure of Tirumala temple. Even before they could comprehend, the curfew was announced, trains and flights stopped and finally the lockdown clamped.

“Though initially we found it difficult to understand the gravity of the situation, it is now very clear. We are ready to stay back here till thelockdown is lifted, if the government offers us food and shelter,” Mr. Behara told The Hindu. After 10 days of stay in a private lodge, the family moved to the TTD’s second choultry compound, thanks to the intervention of district officials. “We arranged rice, pulses, milk, vegetables and a cooking stove to a family for its survival all these days,” chipeed in Sony Duggandla, proprietor of Adarsh Residency located near the railway station.

A win-win deal

Meanwhile, the smart ones among the local lodges have worked out a win-win model with the stranded parties. In view of the huge burden the daily rent can cast on the guests, some lodges have agreed to let out the rooms to the occupants on a monthly rental basis during the lockdown period, which will actually work out to the advantage of both. Rahul, from Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh, decided to extend his stay under this arrangement in the same room, along with his family of seven adults and three kids.

However, most major hotels stopped bookings when the COVID-19 threat was still faint, sensing something ominous.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/kfa1mn/article31198726.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Odishapilgrims,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/starnded-in-tirupati/article31198311.ece
157,2020/03/29,"Lockdown plucks off the bloom, buzz and fragrance from Vijayawada’s wholesale flower market","With few hours to do business and high perishability, the Association has decided to down shutters to cut losses; they are forlonly seeing a dry season until Saravana Maasam or Dasara

In other times it would be buzzing - not of bees - and the air a cocktail of natural fragrances in the city’s ground-zero for the wholesale market of flowers. But it neither has the baskets and baskets of flowers nor the buzz of buyers due to the lockdown. It simply wears a deserted look as the Market Association has formally announced its closure till March 31.

Vendors say “there have no clue” whether they would be able to open their shops even after March 31 in view of lockdown which ends on April 14. For now, they simply have their fingers crossed as Srirama Navami celebrations are expected to be muted - with little or decorations, and hence no flowers - on April 2.

Flowerless and muted festivals

Their worry has a reason: already, Ugadi, the Telugu New Year, passed without any sales as the market was closed since the Janata Curfew on March 22. There are no major festivals after Srirama Navami in the coming months.

The market picks up only during Sravana maasaam, an auspicious month in the Telugu calendar. Hordes of women flock the market to buy flowers for Varalakshmi Vratam celebrated during the Sravana Maasam. This year, it begins from the last week of July. Moreover, vendors would have to wait till Dasara, which is the biggest business season more than Sravana Maasam or the wedding season.

Withered business

Vendors like Qaja say that they do a business of ₹ 15,000 to ₹ 30,000 if they worked from 5 a.m to 10 p.m. But they were quick to add that the flower market is volatile. Sometimes, the predictions go wrong. “Though the market receives jasmine, during summer and has good demand, it is unlikely that the vendors would come out of the losses,” feels Basha, another flower vendor.

According to information, the flower market receives blossoms from Bangalore, Kolar (Karnataka), Kuppam in Chittoor district, Tadepalli in Guntur district etc. On normal days, the flower arrivals would be anywhere between 250 Metric Tonnes (MT) to 400 MT. During Dasara, it would be more than 800 MT. There are more than 80 shops in the market, and, each shop receives three to five MT of flowers every day.

A broken garland

The Wholesale Flower Merchants’ Association president Sheik Jani says the flower merchants/ commission agents are incurring a loss anywhere between ₹ 15,000 to ₹20,000 every day due to the closure. Othere suffers in thye chain include the daily wage workers, petty vendors who sell the flowers on the roadside.

Moreover, as the market would have to be closed by 12 noon due to lockdown, the Association has decided to close down till March 31. “Flowers are the most perishable goods even more than vegetables. Except throwing into garbage we cannot sell the flowers the next day. So, we have downed shutters to minimise the losses,” he rued.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/lockdown-plucks-away-the-bllom-from-vijayawadas-flower-market/article31198041.ece

With most people remaining indoors due to Corona pandemic-induced lockdown, a few are coming onto the streets extend helping to the needy persons, destitutes and animals starving for the last one week.

For instance, despite difficulties in engaging cooks, they are able to prepare food on their own to feed the hungry. Police personnel who are taking serious action against people who are roaming on the streets without any valid reason are, however, welcoming members of charitable organisations and various associations.

Feeding the hungry and the serving

Vizianagaram District Telaga Samskshema Sangham President Pallanta Venkata Rama Rao and their family members are preparing food for nearly 150 persons everyday. The well-packed food packets, along with water bottles are distributed to destitutes, migrant workers and others stranded in Vizianagaram. “I had anticipated big trouble for many people during the three-week lockout. So, I stocked huge quantity of essential goods. With the support of my family members and neighbours, we are preparing food everyday. The service gives me a lot of happiness. I hope the government also distributes food packets for persons stranded in different parts of the district,” said Mr. Rama Rao speaking to The Hindu.

Moroever, the Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) and CV Nagajyoti Charitable Trust are jointly supplying food packets to the needy in Srikakulam. IRCS Chairman P.Jaganmohana Rao said fruits and water bottles were being supplied to police personnel, sanitation workers and others who are busy in extending service to the people at this critical time.

Caring for animals too

Not ignoring other members of the animal kingdom, animal welfare organisation Green Mercy’s team members are providing food to street dogs, abondoned cows, oxen and other animals. “Many people used to provide food to those animals in normal days. But they were forced to be in homes. So, we engaged special teams to provide food and water to those animals,” said Chief Executive Officer K.V.Ramanamurthy.

159,2020/03/29,Regular patients ignored in hospitals in Vizianagaram district,"Forgetting the Hippocratic Oath, some doctors are reluctant; many government doctors have been deployed for coronavirus-related duties; while some are unable to make it to work due to lack of duty passes

Many private hospitals and nursing homes are reluctant to treat regular patients thanks to the fear of Coronavirus and movement restrictions owing to the strict implementation of lock down in areas of Vizianagaram district headquarters and other places.

RMPs have a field day

With this, many Registered Medical Practitioners (RMPs) have been taking ‘care’ of patients in the absence of regular services in hospitals. According to sources, many private hospitals in the district headquarters have stopped new admissions while discharging many In-Patients. Out Patient wings too are not functioning as many doctors and staff are showing little interest to extend their services in their respective hospitals.

Many patients are unable to get treatment in government hospitals too as medical and health staff have been allocated to different isolation wards and quarantine homes which have been were established in 70 places in the nine Assembly constituencies. For instance, an elderly patient P.Ratnamma of Ramabhadrapuram suffered from high blood pressure and could get treatment after running from pillar to post. Many elders and infants need immediate medical assistannce. Pregnant women need to visit hospitals for their periodic check-ups.

‘Doctors ready to work’

Although they are able to convince police personnel to reach the respective hospitals, treatment is not there in the absence of doctors and staff. “All doctors, nurses and staff are ready to work as usual in hospitals if the government issues duty passes. Otherwise, they are unable to reach hospitals. We have conveyed this issue to the district administration,” said V.S.Prasad, President of Andhra Pradesh State Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association. “If the government does not respond quickly, RMPs will continue to treat patients. We noticed that social distancing is not being followed in the premises of RMPs.

160,2020/03/29,COVID-19 | Hyderabad firm builds app to screen coronavirus cases,"It will assess the risk level by listening to the subject’s cough

A Hyderabad-based startup called Salcit Technologies, in partnership with IT firm Zensark Technologies Private Limited, has developed an app that can reportedly screen a large number of people for symptoms of coronavirus.

The founders of the company believe that a critical aspect of containing the pandemic is the ability to rapidly screen and put on surveillance a large segment of the population over an extended period of time.

Keeping this in mind, the firms have developed an app named ‘kAs’ (cough in Sanskrit). It is being tested and is likely to be rolled out for a free launch on March 31.

Giving details about the app, Manmohan Jain, CEO of Zensark, said that it is powered by artificial intelligence platform Swaasa and can play a pivotal role in helping the government combat the ‘once-in-a-century pandemic’, as Bill Gates termed it. The app is developed on the guidelines laid out by the WHO, and asks 15 questions to the subject. The subject is then asked to cough into the microphone of the smartphone. “Based on the answers to the questionnaire and the coughing sound, the app generates a rating on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest risk level. The app then suggests a risk level based on the data,” Mr. Jain said. According to him, assessing the sickness based on the coughing sound is a proven technique and Salcit has an associated patent also called ‘A system for analysing risk associated with cough sounds’. Salcit-Zensark is already in discussions with government health departments, he said. “The app accomplishes screening and assessment, and has the ability to simultaneously screen and surveil tens of thousands of subjects and monitors the condition of individuals,” Mr. Jain said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/94w842/article31196766.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27-VJ-COVIDAPP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/covid-19-hyderabad-firm-builds-app-to-screen-coronavirus-cases/article31196767.ece

Superintendent of Police Siddharth Kaushal said: “People should remain wherever they are when the lockdown is in force as the inter-State as also inter-district borders are sealed.”

While 200 of them managed to sneak into Anantapur district to reach the outskirts of Anantapur city, another lorry, which was at Kodikonda, was stopped by Hindupur Rural police and sent back towards Karnataka. The Chikkaballapur Deputy Superintendent of Police was informed about these migrants through the police personnel posted at the Karnataka check post, the police said.

District Collector Gandham Chandrudu said he got a call from the people in the lorry seeking permission to proceed to Hyderabad on their way to Madhya Pradesh, but as per the Central Government and State government orders, none was allowed to travel and they were asked to return to their place of work, where the employers/ State government are supposed to take care of them.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/axfczu/article31196730.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29VJPG4-MIGRANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/migrant-workers-from-bengaluru-stopped-at-kodikonda/article31196731.ece
163,2020/03/29,Supply chain disruption can lead to shortage of essential commodities,"Farmers are facing the brunt of the cascading impact of the 21-day lockdown though the authorities have announced that transportation of essential commodities will not be affected.

For, vehicle drivers and agents who are part of the supply chain are increasingly reluctant to transport the commodities over long distance as they fear being stranded or they do not want to be at the receiving end of the police enforcing a lockdown. And vegetable farmers are already facing the heat.

Hundreds of crates of tomatoes were left rotting at the APMC Yard in Mysuru and the rates crashed to ₹5 a kg on Sunday as there were no vehicles for onward transportation nor any purchasers. Nearly 200 tonnes of tomatoes were left to rot, said Kurbur Shanthakumar of Karnataka State Sugarcane Growers’ Association.

“Forget haggling over rates, most farmers cannot find a transport agent to take the products to market to reach the consumers as a result of which many cultivators are dumping the produce on roads and markets in case the vegetables are not loaded,” said A. Nagaraj, a vegetable cultivator and member of the Raitha Mitra organisation.

Devaraj, a farmer from Atahalli in T. Narsipur, said transporting vegetables from villages to the APMC yard is fraught with difficulties owing to disruption in the plying of goods autos. Also, many villages in the district have created barricades and dug up trenches to stop the movement of vehicles to and from their respective villages to keep outsiders at bay in the wake of COVID-19 scare, which makes transportation all the more difficult, he added. Basavanahalli, about 3 km from Bannur in Mysuru district, is a major hub for horticultural production. There are not less than 350 to 400 farmers in the area cultivating vegetables and all them are facing uncertainty. Sateesha, a cultivator who owns 7 acres of land, said he used to supply vegetables to all the weekly ‘santhes’ in the taluks. The outgo from the village used to be around 500 bags of various vegetables daily. But in the last one week, not a single bag has been transported, he said, underlining the unfolding crisis.

In the absence of buyers, there was large-scale dumping of tomatoes and other vegetables as only a small fraction of the produce could be loaded on the available vehicles on Saturday. As against nearly 120 to 150 vehicles of vegetables and other commodities that are transported from Mysuru to Kerala and Tamil Nadu, hardly a handful of vehicles are being loaded since the last few days.

There are check posts at Gundlupet and Moolehole in Chamarajanagar, H.D. Kote in Mysuru, and Kutta in Kodagu where the inter-State vehicles get checked and farmers citing commission agents say the drivers are reluctant to transport the commodities even if they are offered a higher transportation charges given the uncertainty over entry and exit. Even the entry to the city is difficult. And there are fears that unless this is streamlined, there could be disruption in the supply of vegetables and essential commodities in due course.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/supply-chain-disruption-can-lead-to-shortage-of-essential-commodities/article31201573.ece
164,2020/03/29,Under pressure: Acts of kindness and cruelty during a pandemic,"Many of the police personnel are working without a break

Over the last few days, the country has been witness to acts of brutality and kindness by the police whose job it is to ensure that the lockdown is a success. Images of constables caning people are a stark contrast to others feeding the homeless or ACPs singing songs with residents of neighbourhoods in their jurisdiction to lift their spirits.

A section of the Yeshwantpur police station has been converted into a kitchen where personnel are deployed to prepare two meals, which they then pack and distribute to beat police personnel, who, in turn, hand them over to the homeless people they meet while patrolling streets. “While enforcing the lockdown we have come across many homeless and daily wagers who are starving. We decided to provide them food which could also prevent them from wandering around,” said Mohammed Mukarram, inspector, Yeshwantpur police station.

At the same time, in Bengaluru, a youth was shot at when he allegedly attempted to escape from the police after being picked up over a fight during the lockdown. In the wake of the backlash and criticism, Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao has directed personnel to not carry lathis while enforcing the lockdown. “We have been instructed to question people who are on the road. People with medical emergencies, especially women, should be treated with utmost care,” Shashi Kumar, DCP (North), said.

The police force is in the forefront in the battle to contain the spread of COVID-19. “If the lockdown is not successful, then the sacrifices others are making will be useless. It is imperative that people stay at home but many are insensitive. We are in the forefront, putting our lives at risk to ensure this lockdown is a success,” a senior police officer said.

Senior police officials who did not want to be named admitted that tensions are running high among personnel. “Since the janata curfew, weekly off for personnel have been cancelled except in the case of emergencies. Many who have been deployed with the enforcement squad have not gone back home and are sleeping in police stations,” said a senior police official.

The acute shortage of masks, which work only for eight hours, and sanitisers means that the police are not adequately protected. “We are working round the clock to make sure others isolate themselves, but we are potentially exposed,” said a police constable.

An added worry is health issues that the personnel suffer from. A majority of the force working as footsoldiers is aged above 50. Many senior police officers The Hindu spoke to said that though there was a discussion not deploying police personnel aged over 50 on the roads, the proposal was shelved because of shortage of personnel.

“My personnel are on the edge. They have been working without a break while worrying about their families whom they have not seen. Soon, we will need counselling,” said a senior police official.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/oeb0t3/article31201249.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGCOVID-19CORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/under-pressure-acts-of-kindness-and-cruelty-during-a-pandemic/article31201250.ece

One of the persons who tested positive (P-52) was an employee of a pharma company, and five others who tested positive later were employed in the same firm. Hence, the authorities have decided to ensure that all the workers are brought under quarantine.

Superintendent of Police C.B. Rishyanth said there were 1,372 employees on the company rolls, of whom more than 900 were under quarantine as on Sunday. The remaining will be by Monday.

Deputy Commissioner Abhiram G. Sankar said that there are instructions to ensure that first-level contacts or the primary contacts (people who were in close or direct contact with those who tested positive) are shifted to a quarantine facility and are not left under home quarantine as many of them live in line or row houses with close contact with other houses. Hence, the authorities will use hostels, yatri niwas, schools and colleges. However, the condition of all the COVID-19 positive patients is stable and there is no need to panic, he added.

Restrictions have been clamped and all entry and exit routes blocked. Only vehicles with essential supplies, including medicines, will be allowed to pass through, with the necessary precautionary measures and under the watch of the police.

166,2020/03/29,"In times of COVID-19, Malnad grapples with KFD","Over 12% of those who tested positive this season had been vaccinated against the disease

While the entire world is gripped by COVID-19, the people of Malnad region continue to grapple with Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, that has claimed three lives in the State this season.

The period from November to May is considered as KFD season. This season, blood samples of 3,971 people having symptoms of the disease were tested at the Viral Diagnostic Laboratory (VDL), Shivamogga, the main arm of the Department of Health and Family Welfare to tackle the disease, of which 123 samples tested positive for KFD. Of the 123 positive cases reported in Karnataka, 102 cases are from Shivamogga district. More than 12% of the ones who tested positive this season were vaccinated against the disease.

Disease has spread

K.P. Sripal, a social activist, told The Hindu that the vaccine against KFD that was developed in 1991 is being administered till date. This tick-borne viral fever that spreads from monkeys to humans is not confined to Karnataka alone. The disease has spread its tentacles to Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Goa and Maharashtra too. It is the right time to take up study and research on enhancing the potency of the vaccine to prevent future outbreaks, he said.

In the previous season (November 2018 to May 2019), 23 persons died and 440 tested positive for the disease in Karnataka. In the wake of the large-scale outbreak, the Department of Health and Family Welfare had planned to vaccinate 5.17 lakh people in the affected areas this season. So far, 3.94 lakh people are covered under the vaccination drive.

Kiran S.K., Director of VDL, Shivamogga, told this correspondent that it was true that many people who had taken the vaccination had tested positive for KFD. However, it should be noted that no person who was administered the vaccine died this year. The intense drive launched to administer the vaccine has succeeded in bringing down the number of deaths this time compared to last season, he said.

Brushing aside the apprehensions expressed on the efficacy of the present vaccine that is produced at the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals (IAHVB), Hebbal, he said that if the primary, secondary and booster dose of the vaccine is availed as per the schedule worked out by the department, it gives 83% immunity against the disease. If there is a failure to abide by the schedule, the person who gets vaccinated may become vulnerable for the disease, he said.

He further said that the tests conducted this year revealed that the viral load in blood samples of the vaccinated persons was less compared to those who were not vaccinated. The possibilities of survival and speedy recovery are high if the viral load is less, he said.

One more death

A 58-year-old woman from Cheeranakudige village in Tirthahalli taluk of Shivamogga district died of Kyasanur Forest Disease(KFD) on Saturday. This is the third death in the district due to KFD since January 1. The deceased is an agricultural labourer.

Ambulances and patients from Kerala will not be allowed to enter Mangaluru or other parts of Dakshina Kannada for treatment, Kota Srinivas Poojary, Minister in-charge of Dakshina Kannada, said here on Sunday even as Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure that no road between Kerala and Karnataka was closed.

Addressing presspersons along with Nalin Kumar Kateel, MP, Dakshina Kannada, the Minister said there was no change in the stand of the State government. The decision to seal borders has been taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 to Dakshina Kannada from Kerala.

“Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is firm on it,” Mr. Poojary said.

“There is no interference from any Union Minister to relax the conditions,” Mr. Kateel added.

Mr. Poojary said that vehicles carrying essential commodities are being allowed to Kerala through Talapady check-post.

Meanwhile, according to a State government bulletin on COVID-19 issued on March 27, the 10-month-old baby from Sajipanadu village, Bantwal taluk, who tested positive on Friday, had been taken to Kerala earlier. But the baby had no foreign travel history.

171,2020/03/29,Farmers dump produce on roads,"While consumers in cities are making a beeline for stores to buy vegetables and fruits even at a premium in the wake of lockdown due to COVID-19, the farmers are finding it difficult to sell their produce as it has become tough for them to reach wholesale markets.

The restrictions on movement is resulting in their crop getting perished. This was evident on Sunday with a few farmers in different parts of the State dumping their valuable produce to express their anguish.

Somu, a farmer from Ganjam in Srirangapatna, dumped three tonnes of sapota on the roadside gobar yard near Ganjam as he could not transport it to the market. According to him, he had to take such a decision as there were no buyers.

Munishamappa, a grape farmer from Chickballapur district, also dumped loads of grapes cultivated at his farm into a compost pit as he could not get any buyers.

A similar act was witnessed in Bengaluru too where some of the tomato farmers dumped crates of unsold produce on Mysuru Road. A young farmer dumped at least two tonnes of tomato near Ingalakuppe lake in Pandavapura taluk on Saturday. Farming activities have almost come to a standstil in Hassan.

Kottur Srinivas, Raitha Sangha leader, told The Hindu that the farmers, who had crops like green chilli and vegetables, were not getting pesticides due to the lockdown. “The farmers, who bring their produce to the market, are being fooled by middlemen. They purchase for a meagre amount citing lockdown and sell the same to consumers for a higher price,” he said.

Meanwhile, Mandya Deputy Commissioner M.V. Venkatesh has appealed to the farming community not to take such steps.

In a communique here on Sunday, the officer said the farmers’ produce was very much required during the present crisis. He said that there will be no restrictions on transporting farmers’ produces and the farmers can sell them to HOPCOMS.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/awv896/article31200981.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BGSAPOTA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/farmers-dump-produce-on-roads/article31200982.ece
172,2020/03/29,Number of COVID-19 cases in Karnataka rises to 83,"While five COVID-19 positive cases each were reported from Gouribidnur in Chickballapur and Nanjangud in Mysuru on Saturday, two new cases were detected in Udupi on Sunday, taking the total number of cases in Karnataka to 83. These include three deaths and five discharged patients.

The remaining 75 patients are in isolation at designated hospitals, and all of them are said to be stable.

The five primary contacts of P77 — a pharma company employee from Nanjangud — who tested positive on Saturday are aged between 21 and 42. All of them worked for the same company and have been isolated in a hospital in Mysuru.

One of the new cases confirmed on Sunday was a 35-year-old resident of Udupi, who had travelled to Dubai and arrived in Mangaluru on March 17. A 29-year-old from the same district, who had a history of travel to Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, also tested positive.

Of the total cases, 41 are from Bengaluru, eight from Chickballapur, and seven each from Uttara Kannada and Dakshina Kannada.

Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education), told The Hindu that “case to cluster transmission” had not begun in the State yet. “All five people from Nanjangud worked for the same pharma company and were in close contact with the employee who tested positive earlier,” he said.

“On Sunday, only two samples from our testing centres in the State showed a high viral load. This is some relief, and strict enforcement of quarantine will further help in containing the infection,” he said.

Contacts of COVID-19 patients who have completed a 14-day quarantine can obtain a medical certificate from government or private Ayurveda/allopathy doctors to rejoin duty, he added.

The Health Department has decided to isolate primary contacts of all the positive cases at government-run quarantine facilities and hospitals, depending on their condition. Health Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey, who issued an order in this regard, said that nearly 25% of the total positive cases were primary contacts. “So far, primary contacts who were asymptomatic were being quarantined in their homes. However, with most of them violating the quarantine protocol, the department has decided to compulsorily quarantine all primary contacts in government quarantine centres and hospitals,” the order stated.

The department has identified 1,095 primary contacts of the 83 positive cases. These include nearly 700 people who have completed the 14-day quarantine.

Those who have not completed this isolation are being classified into high-risk and low-risk patients. Those aged above 60 and who have co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and HIV, and other immunocompromised persons fall in the high-risk group. They will be mandatorily quarantined in hospitals and other government quarantine centres.

Those with no health problems are being grouped as low-risk patients, and they will be isolated in hotels, hostels, guest houses and other centres identified by the government. Adequate spacing will be maintained in these centres, with a minimum capacity to house 50 patients.

173,2020/03/29,Problem of plenty for KMF during coronavirus lockdown in Karnataka,"Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation Ltd. (KMF), which supplies products under the Nandini brand, is facing a problem of surplus. Since the lockdown on account of COVID-19 began, it has been procuring 8-10 lakh litres of excess milk every day.

The main reason is private players are no longer buying milk from farmers. D.C. Sateesh, managing director of KMF, told The Hindu that usually, between December and April, KMF receives 66 lakh to 68 lakh litres of milk every day. However, since the lockdown began, procurement has crossed 70 lakh litres. “In the State, KMF has an 85% market share. After the lockdown, private players completely stopped procuring milk from farmers. One lakh to two lakh farmers, who are also members of societies recognised by their respective milk unions, started supplying to us. We cannot say no to them as they are also members of our societies. This is the primary reason for the increased procurement,” he said.

There have been times the procurement touched 85 lakh litres a day.

Demand down

Furthermore, KMF is no longer exporting to neighbouring States such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, because of the restrictions, and there is little demand from hotels, restaurants and food joints in the State. While exports used to account for 4.5 lakh to 6 lakh litres of milk, the demand from hotels has reduced by 6 lakh litres a day.

Given the situation, the federation has no option but to convert the excess milk into powder. “We have reached a saturation level. Every day, containers carrying 8-10 lakh litres of excess milk reach our dairy units. We have to pasteurise the milk in 28 hours. We are also facing problems acquiring the required material, but the State government is working with various agencies to smoothen the transportation process,” Mr. Sateesh said.

KMF has plants at Channarayapatna, Kanakapura and other areas to convert milk into powder. According to Mr. Sateesh, it is selling milk, curd and other products through 16,000 retailers in the State, including around 4,000 in Bengaluru.

Production stopped

In addition to milk, curds, and ghee, KMF has a multi-crore business manufacturing and selling products such as ice cream, jamun, snacks, and biscuits. It has decided to temporarily stop the production of over 100 products at its unit in Bengaluru. At present, close to 3.5 tonnes of products are lying at KMF manufacturing units.

“KMF does a turnover of ₹60 crore to ₹70 crore a year by selling 100-plus milk-based products, including 22 variants of ice cream. Now, the Health Department has advised people not to consume ice cream. We have temporarily stopped production of these milk-based products,” an official said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/p6hla8/article31200971.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BGKMF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/problem-of-plenty-for-kmf-during-coronavirus-lockdown-in-karnataka/article31200972.ece
174,2020/03/29,Supermarket staff in Mysuru arrested for refusing entry to students from northeast,"A supermarket’s refusal to allow two students from Nagaland to enter their premises to buy food items sparked off outrage on social media, leading to the arrest of four staff members.

Two students from Nagaland — Yokai Johny Konyak and Ali Meren — stood in queue outside More Megastore, a retail chain, on Jhansi Lakshmi Bai Road in Chamundipuram for about 25 minutes on Saturday evening. But when their turn came, they were denied entry. Despite their pleas, the students were turned away as they were dubbed “not Indians”.

In an Instagram post made subsequently, one of the students said they reasoned with the security and staff of the store that they had no symptoms of COVID-19. When they were told by the staff that they were not from India, the students even showed them their Aadhaar cards to prove their nationality. “… but still they said we don’t accept foreigners … we went back home without groceries,” the student wrote.

The video accompanying the post, which went viral on different social media platforms, showed one of the students standing near the entrance of the store and pleading with the staff to be let inside. “Why are you discriminating? We too are Indians. We too are human beings. We too need groceries like you. We have Aadhaar cards. Why can’t you accept us?” he is heard telling a store representative.

Tweeting the video, anthropologist and author Dolly Kikon said on Twitter, “Meanwhile in Karnataka, Naga migrants from Northeast India not allowed to buy food. Shameful. Racism in India is an everyday affair.”

Police action

When the video began doing the rounds on social media, the Mysuru City Police took note of it on Sunday and made arrests, including the store manager. “We have booked a criminal case. We are inquiring into the matter,” said Prakash Gowda, Deputy Commissioner (Law and Order), Mysuru City Police.

Deputy Commissioner Abhiram G. Sankar said a case has been booked against the store for racial discrimination and other shop owners have been cautioned against discrimination on grounds such as race, religion and caste.

City Police Commissioner Chandragupta, in a statement, said an FIR was lodged by the Krishnaraja police immediately after the video was noticed. The store staff have been booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 153B, which deals with acts promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth etc., Section 341 (wrongful restraint), Section 290 (public nuisance), and Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant). Store manager Avinash, 26, Manjunath, 32, Naveen, 30, and Revanna, 30, were arrested after the police checked the store’s CCTV footage.

Meanwhile, More Retail Ltd., in a statement, said it would not accept discrimination of any kind at its stores. “Our stores are open to all the citizens of the country.

It is suspected that he committed suicide by hanging himself. He was working in Mumbai and had returned to his native place for Ugadi celebrations last week. Officials of the Health and Family Welfare Department put him on home quarantine as he had travelled from Maharashtra.

District Health Officer K.M. Sathish Kumar, who visited the village, said he had no symptoms of COVID-19. “On verifying his health records, [we found that] he had other health problems,” he said. Mr. Gowda suffered from asthma and kidney-related problems.

176,2020/03/29,Karnataka CM promises shelter for those stuck outside State borders,"Responding to the demand to bring back Kannadigas stuck in border areas, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Sunday, at an all-party meeting, promised to provide shelter to those stuck outside the State’s borders.

“Efforts to medically screen those who stuck on the borders and bring them to shelters will be taken up soon,” a statement from the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) said. The statement also said that steps would be taken to quarantine those showing symptoms of COVID-19, while those found to be healthy would be sent home. The CMO also said the government had made arrangements to look after Kannadigas in Goa and other States.

The statement came in response to a suggestion from former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah that the government bring back Kannadigas stuck in border areas after screening them thoroughly. The CMO statement pointed out that similarly, migrant workers were struggling to get to their destinations quickly. On another suggestion from Mr. Siddaramaiah — that ration be distributed to beneficiaries at their doorsteps — the government said it would explore the possibility.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Siddaramaiah alleged that there was no clarity from the government on COVID-19. “The screening of those who returned from abroad has not happened properly, and the government data on it is not clear. The government has acknowledged that it is yet to identify 4,500 out of 23,000 people, and they have to be identified quickly,” he said.

He also said that one Minister had said that there has been no community spread of COVID-19. “But how is it that one person in Nanjangud tested positive and one person in Sira died, though both did not have travel history? Efforts have to be made to prevent the spread of infection in rural areas,” the Congress leader said. He also complained of inadequate number, and poor quality, of masks, sanitisers and personal protective equipment made available.

Quality issues

Another former Chief Minister, H.D. Kumaraswamy, asked how doctors and nurses could treat the infected without the essential PPE and safety items. “We do not know when the one lakh kits ordered from China will come. Already there are reports that these China-made kits are of not good quality. The gowns being used by doctors and nurses are of poor quality,” the JD(S) leader said.

He also said while the United States has tested over five lakh samples, testing was not being done well in the State. “In fact, I have information that it requires some kind of influence to get the test done. Also, are you following strict guidelines in handling dead bodies?”

Taking the example of Ramanagaram district, he said four ventilators that had been purchased were yet to be used as the district administration was yet to fix them owing to the lack of availability of technicians.

Suggesting that the government consider the situation a “blessing in disguise”, he said, “Use this opportunity to establish good public health infrastructure. Defer all other works and cut funding to [other] departments. Spend money on improving the quality of government hospitals.”

Life cover

The State government has decided to provide life cover to police and civic workers. Mr. Yediyurappa said that there was no shortage of testing kits, medicines and masks in the State. He also said steps would be taken to supply personal protective equipment, masks and sanitisers to all doctors, nurses and paramedical staff involved in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/qugf9m/article31200919.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BGALL-PARTY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-cm-promises-shelter-for-those-stuck-outside-state-borders/article31200051.ece

K.S. Eshwarappa, Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, has asked the district administration to put in place necessary preventive measures to avoid the spread of COVID-19.

He was speaking at a meeting here on Saturday to review the enforcement of lockdown.

Mr. Eshwarappa said that as social distancing is necessary to tackle the outbreak, the public should avoid unnecessarily venturing out of their houses during the lockdown period.

The Shivamogga City Corporation has been directed to maintain cleanliness at public places and to spray disinfectants regularly, he said.

Araga Jnanendra, Tirthahalli MLA, expressed displeasure that liquor was being sold in an unauthorised manner at grocery shops in rural areas of Tirthahalli taluk during the lockdown. Responding to this, Mr. Eshwarappa asked the officials of Police and Excise departments to take measures to prevent the illegal sale of liquor.

Referring to the disruption in power supply in Shivamogga and Hosanagar taluks from past few days, B.Y. Raghavendra, MP said that the officials concerned have been directed to resolve the problem in an expedited manner.

Mr. Eshwarappa also visited few areas in Shivamogga.

At Gandhi Bazaar, he requested the owners of the outlets selling non-essential commodities to close their shops and cooperate with the district administration to implement the lockdown order. He interacted with the wholesale vendors at the vegetable market of Agriculture Produces Marketing Committee at Vinobha Nagar and took information at the Indira Canteen nearby on the food served there.

However, the presence of large number of supporters of Mr. Eshwarappa during these visits has drawn flak.

Villagers of Honyal collected food packets from residents and distributed them to the travellers.

“Friends in an earlier village had tipped us that these labourers were walking home. At the border of our village, we made them stand at a safe distance and asked them to maintain the distance as they walked. We collected food from families in our villages and gave it to them,” Madhav Patil, a resident, said.

Kannada organisations alleged that the labourers were returning as the government of Goa was asking them to leave the State. “A lot of labourers have been thrown out from Maharashtra and Goa. The poor are forced to walk. This is unfortunate,” said Mehboob Makandar, member of the action committee of Kannada organisations, said.

An isolation ward has been set up in the hospital as per the medical safety norms. Independent medical, paramedical, and nursing staff who are required to provide continuous treatment will be residing on the hospital premises.

The naval authorities have created a system for safe disposal of biomedical waste generated on the hospital premises, in consultation with the district administration, the release said.

Deputy Commissioner of Uttara Kannada district K. Harish Kumar on Saturday night said that all the COVID-19 patients in the district had been shifted to the isolation ward on ‘Patanjali’.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/7qpoxu/article31195573.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGPATANJALI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hospital-ship-patanjali-to-treat-covid-19-patients/article31195574.ece
185,2020/03/29,Karnataka migrant workers returning home killed in road accident,"Eight die as mango-laden lorry rams into truck in Shamshabad

Eight people from Karnataka, including a three-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl, were killed and three people sustained severe injuries on the Outer Ring Road (ORR) in Shamshabad after a mango-laden lorry rammed into the maxi truck they were travelling by late on Friday. The injured were rushed to Osmania General Hospital (OGH) in Hyderabad and their condition is said to be critical.

The maxi truck was carrying 31 migrant labourers who were engaged with a road infrastructure firm at Suryapet. The driver, Hanuma Gowda, had created a partition with planks to accommodate more people and they started around 6 p.m. All of them were returning to their native place in Raichur and Yadgir districts in Karnataka as the road project they were working on has been stalled owing to the nationwide lockdown.

The Shamshabad police reached the accident site and a crane was used to pull out the bodies from the wreckage.

According to inspector R. Venkatesh, the maxi truck took the ORR near Abdullapurmet and was proceeding towards Hyderabad–Bengaluru national highway. When it was near Pedda Golconda toll gate around 11.30 p.m., the mango-laden lorry rammed into the maxi truck. “The 14-tonne lorry was proceeding to Baroda in Gujarat from Nuzividu in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh,” Mr. Venkatesh said.

The impact of the accident was such that five people died on the spot, while three others succumbed to their injuries while undergoing treatment in the hospital. The bodies were shifted to OGH morgue for autopsy.

The victims were identified as Rangappa (27), Sharanappa (25), Amaresh (18), Kolappa (25), Subash Patanshetty (50), Sridevi (8), Basamma (25) and her three-year-old son Hanumanta.

186,2020/03/29,"Blocked roads, elephants make life miserable for Delampady residents","Roads to neighbouring State of Karnataka closed

For the residents of Delampady grama panchayat in the district, life came to a standstill after four roads to the neighbouring State of Karnataka were blocked recently by dumping truckloads of laterite soil. Now, a herd of elephants wandering into the village has made life miserable for locals.

The panchayat situated along the Kerala-Karnataka border has four roads that help people travel to the neighbouring State. The roads from the wards Parappa, Ujjampady, Mayyala, and Delampady in the panchayat are connected to Karanataka.

However, with the outbreak of COVID-19, the road closure by the Karnataka Police has left Delampady residents in the lurch. Aithappa Naika, ward member of Delampady, said a majority of the residents were members of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities, who were totally dependent on Karanataka for most of their needs. They sold their agriculture produce and bought things for daily requirements from the neighbouring State, he said.

But, after the region got disconnected, people were forced to walk through the road that passes through the forest. The presence of elephants had added to their woes, with locals unable to step out even for their basic needs, he added.

Delampady panchayat president Mustafa said the stock of supplies was depleting and the panchayat could hang on for only two more days. With elephants crossing the Mandakol forest in Karnataka and over to the Parappa reserve forest in the State, people would have no access to the nearest town.

“We have written to the Chief Minister to speak with the Karnataka authorities and to get at least one road cleared so that people have immediate access in case of an emergency,” he said.

Kasaragod Forest officials said their efforts to chase away the elephants had been unsuccessful, with the availability of water and food bringing the animals back to the region. They could prevent the pachyderms from frequenting the region by setting up trenches and other facilities only if adequate funds were allocated, said a senior official.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/blocked-roads-elephants-make-life-miserable-for-delampady-residents/article31201522.ece
187,2020/03/29,Stranded family sent back to Karnataka,"Revenue Department officials on Sunday sent back to Karnataka a family of five members, who had been stranded for around 30 hours at Muthanga near the Kerala-Karnataka border.

A Mattannoor native, his aunt, her daughter and her two grandchildren from Bengaluru reached Muthanga at around 7 a.m. on Saturday, ignoring government orders. They tried to enter the State via Muthanga after the highway to Kannur was closed at Makkoottam by the Kodagu district administration, sources said.

However, officials at the check-post asked them to return. When they tried to go back to Bengaluru, their entry was refused by Karnataka authorities. Later, the Revenue Department officials held a discussion with their counterparts in Karnataka and handed over the family to them.

Meanwhile, Wayanad District Collector Adeela Abdulla directed officials to set up a barricade at Muthanga to prevent the flow of travellers from Karnataka by violating lockdown norms announced by governments to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

190,2020/03/29,Doubts over lockdown sops for job scheme workers,"Centre’s insistence of 100-day employment might exclude many from benefits

As much as 94% of families enrolled in the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in the country may be deprived of the lockdown package announced by the Centre if it insists on restricting the benefit to those who have got 100 days’ employment in the current financial year.

As per official statistics, only 6% of the 3,51,2009 families got regular employment for 100 days in the current year and in Kerala 2,35,793 families (17%) completed the 100-day mark as mandated by the law.

Sources privy to the execution of the scheme told The Hindu that 5.42 crore families actively participated in the job scheme in the country in the current financial year and the average number of days they got jobs had been pegged at 47.

Against the national average of 47 days, Kerala registered the active presence of 14 lakh families and provided employment for 55 days. The State had another record of providing jobs for 77 days to Scheduled Tribe families.

Since the scheme was primarily aimed at families below the poverty line and women formed the majority of the workforce, the package was expected to offer relief for those rendered unemployed following the lockdown.

The sources said wages for the scheme were linked to the Consumer Price Index and revised annually. The Centre through a notification on March 23 revised the wage from ₹271 to ₹291 for those in Kerala. Harayana had the highest wage rate of ₹309 followed by three panchayats in Sikkim with ₹308.

Lower wage rate

Still, the wage rate was much lesser than the agriculture minimum wage rate of ₹490 fixed by the State Labour Department in 2017 and the demand for revising the rate had remained a cry in the wilderness.

The Centre needed to clarify whether it would waive the 100-day norm or would strictly insist that the benefit would be extended only those who had completed the mandated work schedule. Considering the intensity of the crisis triggered by the COVID-19 outbreak, the Centre was unlikely to adopt a rigid stance and might not restrict the benefit to a minuscule minority of the beneficiary families, the sources said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/doubts-over-lockdown-sops-for-job-scheme-workers/article31200891.ece
191,2020/03/29,Two under home quarantine die,"One each from Kannur, Kottayam

Two persons who were serving home quarantine for suspected COVID-19 infection died in the State on Sunday. A 66-year-old man was brought dead to the district government hospital in Kannur on Sunday.

According to District Medical Officer Narayanan Nayak, the patient, who had returned from Sharjah on March 21, was screened on his arrival at the Kannur international airport. He had no symptoms and was kept under home quarantine.

He was suffering from diabetes, hypertension, and heart ailments. On Saturday, he was found unconscious in his room and was brought dead to the hospital. “It is difficult to ascertain whether the death has caused by COVID-19. There is a possibility that he died of heart attack,” said Mr. Nayak.

However, his throat swab has been sent to the Kozhikode Medical College Hospital for examination. A request has been made to speed up the result.

The body is kept at the Kannur Medical College Hospital for post-mortem examination.

Driver dead

In Kottayam, a 45-year-old truck driver who had been serving a two-week quarantine period at his residence died on Sunday.

The deceased was identified as Kunjumon of Chethannurkari in Kumarakom. According to District Medical Officer (DMO) Jacob Varghese, the person was engaged in firewood chopping when he collapsed to death.

Swabs to be tested

“Preliminary investigations suggested that the person suffered Myocardial infarction though we are awaiting an autopsy report to confirm it. However, his swab samples will be sent for examination just as to avoid any remote suspicion of virus infection,” the DMO said.

Kunjumon, who worked as the driver of an interstate cargo truck, had been advised to go on home quarantine on his return from Bengaluru last week.

“The person never developed any symptoms of the virus infection when subjected to a medical examination or while under quarantine. He, however, was advised to serve the quarantine period only because he had visited another State,” the DMO added.

The body will be handed over to relatives on completion of the medical examinations.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/two-under-home-quarantine-die/article31200871.ece
192,2020/03/29,"Karnataka stands firm, CM writes to PM","Pinarayi seeks Modi’s intervention to persuade neighbouring State to open its borders to the ailing

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday sought the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to persuade Karnataka to open its border with Kasaragod to allow the inflow of essential commodities into Kerala.

In an open letter to Mr. Modi, Mr. Vijayan said that the Karnataka government feared, without factoring in the ground reality, that opening up the Thalassery-Coorg State Highway 30 route for cargo movement would cause the COVID-19 infection to reach the district of Kodagu.

Ban on freight

Karnataka had also attempted to justify the ban on freight movement along the route, a lifeline for transportation of essential commodities, by pointing out that Kerala had 7,000 people under quarantine in border districts. Mr. Vijayan said Karnataka’s position conflicted with facts. The incidence of COVID-19 in Kerala was seen only in people who had returned from abroad.

Only a few people in quarantine had tested positive for the disease. The others were kept in isolation as a precaution.

Kerala had only asked Karnataka to open its border for freight and passage of ambulances. The alternative route suggested by Karnataka through Gundlupet was closed to traffic during the night when cargo movement usually peaked.

Patient’s death

A patient had died after Karnataka police blocked the ambulance ferrying her to Mangaluru near the border at Thalapady.

The authorities in that State had also constructed mud embankments on arterial inter-State border roads. Mr. Vijayan said “local, partisan and vested interests” should not prevail over the national interest when the country faced an unprecedented crisis.

Mr. Vijayan had made a direct appeal to Mr. Modi after his attempts to get across to Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa failed on Saturday.

Chief Secretaries talk

Back-to-back negotiations between Chief Secretaries of both States and the intervention of Union Minister of Chemicals and Fertilisers D.V. Sadananda Gowda were unable to make any headway.

Mr. Vijayan’s appeal came against the backdrop of widespread public apprehension that Karnataka’s blockade could whittle down shipments of cooking gas, perishables and essential commodities bound for Kerala from other regions.

His letter also reflected the vulnerability of the people of Kasaragod who had traditionally relied heavily on hospitals in Mangaluru to treat their critically ill ones.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala too requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to convince Karnataka to allow the movement of freight into Kerala. In a letter, Mr. Chennithala asked Mr. Modi to persuade the Karnataka authorities to allow passage of ambulances and vehicles transporting critically ill people.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/81igku/article31159697.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24tvgad01-keralGR779JMT23jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/karnataka-stands-firm-cm-writes-to-pm/article31200851.ece
193,2020/03/29,Experts punch holes in rapid tests,"‘Early COVID-19 diagnosis not possible’

Public health experts and epidemiologists are puzzled by the current obsession among administrators as well as a huge section of doctors about the ‘rapid tests’ for COVID 19, which are not a primary diagnostic modality but are useful largely for epidemiological investigations.

The terminology ‘rapid test’ essentially means that the test process is fast, simple, not lab-dependent and the results are rapid. It, however, cannot rapidly detect COVID-19 as soon as one contracts the infection.

“In the middle of an epidemic, when what is required is early diagnosis and treatment, the rapid test has no role. It only results in unnecessary testing and rakes in money for private laboratories,” a public health expert points out.

Detection process

Infectious disease diagnosis relies upon the detection of a pathogen protein (antigen) by ELISA methods or its nucleic acid by Nucleic Acid Tests (like PCR). If these tests are not available, then one can make the diagnosis by looking for antibodies produced by the body against the pathogen as an immune response.

Antigen or nucleic acid is present in the body from the very beginning of a disease whereas the antibodies are produced only after a week of onset of the disease symptoms. Thus PCR tests are preferred for early detection of the disease. Antibody-based rapid tests, on the other hand, can detect the disease only much later.

Repeat test

A person with a possible exposure to COVID-19 will test negative if the test is done just two days after the symptoms start. Thus a repeat test is needed after a week, when the body would have produced enough antibodies, to ascertain if the person actually has the infection.

“We know that 80% of COVID-19 patients have only mild symptoms and that many could be asymptomatic. But they could be spreading the infection in the community. So wherever there is a cluster of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), the antibody-based rapid tests are useful to check if the community has had pre-exposure to SARS-CoV-2,” he explains.

“In case of some diseases like dengue, both antigen detection and nucleic acid detection tests are available. The rapid test for dengue allows rapid detection on the first day of fever, before antibodies appear five or more days later. However, for COVID-19 such rapid antigen detection tests are not available,” E. Sreekumar, a senior scientist at RGCB explains.

In fact, the excitement over the introduction of rapid tests, as though it will change the epidemic scenario in Kerala is not warranted because it cannot help in early detection of COVID-19 and it costs more than PCR test. The cost of PCR test is ₹1,200 per test, while that of antibody-based rapid tests is ₹1,500.

Not available here

On the practical side, none of these antibody-based rapid test kits are available in India now. Given the current situation of lockdowns across nations and restrictions in international travel, none of these are expected to reach India any time soon, says Dr. Sreekumar.

Public health experts also point out that only a small fraction of the PCR test capacity available in the State is being utilised now. Due to the nationwide demand, the PCR kits available at the State’s disposal is limited and these are used judiciously to test only suspect cases with mild symptoms.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/qjoitk/article31079438.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/coronavirusjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/experts-punch-holes-in-rapid-tests/article31200842.ece

The Alappuzha district administration, district medical office and Government Medical College, Alappuzha has joined hands to launch ‘doctor online’ facility in the district. The facility will help people under lockdown to consult doctors without going to the hospital.

The patients should contact 0477 2961576 and give a brief description of the ailment.

The house surgeons will prescribe the necessary medicines and treatment. In case a consultation with a doctor is needed, the contact and other details of the caller will be passed on to the specialist doctor at the Government Medical College Hospital, Alappuzha. The doctor will then contact the patient from a dedicated number.

Officials said that more than 100 calls had been received since its launch on Saturday.

So far 50 specialist doctors of 18 departments at the medical college hospital have come forward to become part of it, said an official. Those serving a quarantine period in view of COVID-19 should not call the ‘doctor online’ facility.

200,2020/03/29,Quarantined persons break norms in Pathanamthitta,"Individuals spotted mingling with community

The apathetic attitude of many who have been quarantined for the COVID-19 disease, especially those came from abroad, has become a matter of concern for the Pathanamthitta administration

The reported reluctance of the 40-year-old man from Aranmula who came from the United Kingdom and the 45-year old man from Adoor who came from Dubai 10 days ago in revealing their itinerary is a pointer in this regard.

District Collector P.B. Noohu told The Hindu that the Health surveillance teams had to fetch both of them to the hospital following a telephonic tip-off received from the local people on their free mingling in the community, posing serious health risk to the general public. The man from Aranmula had entered an ATM cabin in the town even after giving his throat swab sample at the hospital laboratory, sources said.

The Collector said the authorities were trying to identify their contacts by tracking various mobile tower locations and even various CCTV footages of the vehicle that carried them to various places during the past 12 days to identify at least a few of their contacts. All these are avoidable headaches to the district machinery that has been working overnight to contain the COVID-19 crisis, says he.

Mr Noohu said co-operation of the people was a necessity for the success of the ongoing anti-COVID-19 drive. According to him, 900 odd people have come from the affected areas of U.A.E alone to the district in the past two weeks alone. There were also reports of many among them violating the quarantine norms and hence the administration has decided to affix posters, detailing their quarantine period, in front of their residences so that the community too would be made aware of its seriousness, he said.

He urged all panchayats and municipalities in the district to consider the issues of the migrant workforce on a priority basis. Respective tahsildars and village officers should be given the authority to resolve issues related to migrant labourers, Mr. Sudhakaran suggested.

He also warned of stringent action against contractors who leave employees in dire straits.

205,2020/03/29,Govt. sees conspiracy behind migrant workers’ protest,"Police to conduct a probe into the incident

Even though the government has succeeded in arresting the wave of protest that engulfed Payippad village on Sunday, it sees a conspiracy behind the protest that sought to defy the country-wide lockdown.

The possibility of a conspiracy was clearly evident in the statements of officials, Ministers and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

In a statement, Mr. Vijayan sought to identify those who instigated these workers, circulated the messages firing up their emotions and campaigned for the protesters.

“Clear leads for identifying on the powers who provoked these workers to the path of protest and used the Payippad incident for defaming the State have emerged by now. I am requesting these elements to desist from plotting such evil designs in times of crisis. You should not attack an entire State for the sake of some cheap gains. The government will intervene without fail to make sure the guilty are identified and brought before the law,’’ he said.

Food and Civil Supplies Minister P. Thilothaman, who visited the protest site and later held discussions on the issue, pointed to the possibility of a conspiracy behind the incident. “The police will inquire into the efforts that went into organising the protest,’’ he told mediapersons.

According to the Minister, directions have been issued to ascertain whether there were any lapses on the part of the labour contractors or camp owners in ensuring food to the workers. “The officers will submit a report on Monday and based on it, further action will be initiated,’’ he said.

Labour Minister T.P. Ramakrishnan, in a statement, said it was unfortunate that these workers, instigated by some elements, decided to take it to the streets. “Those who have brought these workers here also have the responsibility to ensure their welfare and safety,’’ the Minister said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/govt-sees-conspiracy-behind-migrant-workers-protest/article31200023.ece
206,2020/03/29,Five infected persons test negative for COVID-19,"They were the first persons from Aythala in Ranni

The first five persons from Aythala in Ranni who were tested positive for COVID-19 on March 7 have been cured of the disease and tested negative on Sunday, according to District Collector P.B. Noohu.

The couple in their 50’s and their 22-year-old son had reached the Kochi international airport from Venice in Italy, via Doha, on February 29 morning. All the three, who were reportedly having mild fever, failed to inform the airport authorities or the Health Department officials that they were coming from the COVID-19-hit Italy. They reached their ancestral home at Aythala, later, in the evening.

The brother of the man who came from Italy and his wife were the first who sought treatment for fever at a private hospital in Ranni on March 6. The doctor there found symptoms of COVID-19. The matter was immediately referred to the district authority. Both of them and their three relatives were shifted to the isolation ward at the Pathanamthitta General Hospital in no time.

The clinical examination of their throat swab and blood was tested negative for the viral infection for the second time on Sunday, Mr. Noohu said.

The prescription appeared soon after the government suggestion to give liquor on doctors’ prescription for people, who suffer from withdrawal symptoms.

However, as it became viral in social media, the doctor who prescribed liquor on his letter pad came with clarification. He claimed that it was just a joke.

209,2020/03/29,‘Medical passes’ likely for alcohol-dependents,"IMA says lockdown period is opportunity to treat alcoholics

The Excise Department may suggest introduction of “medical passes” for alcohol-dependent persons from government doctors to buy their favourite drink during the lockdown period.

The department is currently working on a proposal after the Chief Minister's suggestion for prescription-based system for supply of alcohol for the alcohol-dependent persons. However, the idea has not gone down well with doctors, who feel that it would be unscientific and unethical for them to prescribe alcohol.

All retail liquor outlets, bars and toddy shops have been closed down as part of the social distancing campaign following the outbreak of COVID-19. The level of alcohol-dependency and the quantity of alcohol which could thus be allowed shall be fixed by doctors.

The Kerala State Beverages Corporation should open select outlets in all geographical locations for providing the prescribed quantity of alcohol, said a top Excise official. Even while permitting the purchase of alcohol, one would be allowed to keep only the maximum possession limit of liquor prescribed by the State government. The Excise policy need not be amended for the purpose.

The passes of those who are found trading the alcohol will be impounded and legal action initiated. The draft suggestions in this regard would be submitted to the State government soon, he said.

The State government has fixed the maximum possession limit for Indian Made Foreign Liquor in Kerala as three litres. Its 3.5 litre each for beer and wine, 2.5 litre for Foreign Made Foreign Liquor and one litre for Coco Brandy. Ex-servicemen and defence personnel can keep their quota of liquor. But they have to keep the purchase bills or certificates from the canteen officer who issued the liquor.

Abraham Varghese, State president, Indian Medical Association, felt that the lockdown period was an ideal opportunity to treat alcohol-dependency, a disease. No doctor could ever prescribe alcohol as medicine, but would recommend medical treatment. Providing alcohol to addicts would only worsen the situation. Effective medicines are available for treating the disease, Dr. Varghese said.

G.S. Vijayakrishnan, general secretary, Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association, said it was not professionally and ethically advisable for doctors to prescribe alcohol. The State government had the other day reminded the doctors about the treatment protocol to be followed in such cases. Medical treatment and not providing alcohol was the step to be followed, said Dr. Vijayakrishnan.

The association would approach the government with a set of suggestions to address the situation, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/medical-passes-likely-for-alcohol-dependents/article31198542.ece
210,2020/03/29,SHRC enquiry against Yatish Chandra,"Kannur police chief under scanner for imposing corporal punishment on public

The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has taken cognisance on its own of the controversial WhatsApp video that purportedly showed the police making passers-by perform forced squats for venturing out into the open during the lockdown due to the spread of Coronavirus in Azheekal in Kannur on Saturday.

P. Mohanadas, Judicial Member, SHRC, said in his order that the video showed a police officer of the highest rank gleefully punishing ordinary people in public.

Mr. Mohandas said the police had no right to dole out punishments. They should have arrested the curfew violators and produced them in a court of law. The law provides no scope for arbitrary punishment.

Meanwhile, State Police Chief Loknath Behera has sought an explanation from District Police Chief, Kannur, Yatish Chandra.

Officials privy to the process said that Mr. Chandra had told his superiors that he had acted in the public interest.

The police had found it difficult to restrict gatherings in rural Kannur. He thought a token punishment recorded and aired on social media would act as a social deterrent and keep people indoors during the lockdown.

Officials indicated that Mr. Behera had forwarded the officer’s explanation with his comments to Additional Chief Secretary, Home, Biswas Mehta.

They said Mr. Chandra stood the risk of facing disciplinary action, or worse, a criminal case and removal from the current post for sanctioning third-degree treatment of citizens.

Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who condemned the action on Saturday, was poised to take a final decision in the matter. He had said the incident was a blot on the reputation of the force.

The public punishment and shaming had caused an outcry in the State. Scores of people took to social media to express their disapproval.

Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullapally Ramachandran sought stringent action against Mr. Chandra. He said the officer had tread cruelly on the human rights of three ordinary people.

The video showed the officer ordering them people to strike stress positions repeatedly in the sun as their neighbours watched.

Mr. Ramachandran said British colonial police would have shied away from such a brutal act against citizens extremely distressed by the epidemic situation.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/xde29k/article31198173.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/POLICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/shrc-enquiry-against-yatish-chandra/article31198174.ece
211,2020/03/29,Coronavirus | Migrant workers stage protest defying lockdown,"The workers, camping in and around Payippad village, poured into the rural roads on Sunday morning.

High drama prevailed in Payipad town on the outskirts of the Kottayam district on Sunday morning when hundreds of inter-state migrant workers staged a public protest defying the country-wide lock down.

The protests began by 11 a.m when the inter-state migrants, mostly from West Bengal and Assam, staged a blockade on the Changanassery-Mallappilly Road demanding food and travel facility for returning to their homelands. The attempts by the police and the Payippad Panchayat authorities to pacify the protesters are yet to reach a breakthrough.

District Collector P.K. Sudheer Babu and the District Police Chief G. Jaidev too have intervened in the issue.

Eyewitness accounts suggested that the workers, camping in and around the village, poured into the rural roads on Sunday morning in search of essentials, only to find that all grocery stores in the region are closed. Their resentment snowballed into a protest allegedly after the Panchat refused to intervene in the issue.

MHA changes rules: State disaster funds to be used to give food, shelter for migrant workers

“Labours in majority of the camps have been starving since Saturday evening and they are learned to have lodged a complaint to this regard to the Panchayat. But despair gave way to anger as they were denied food on the next morning and afternoon as well,” said a local resident.

A meeting convened by the Payipad Panchayat the other day had directed the owners of the migrant labour camps to provide food to the inmates during the lock down period. The meeting, also attended by the Station House Officer, Thrikkodithanam and the Tehsildar, also asked the building owners not to evict any of the inmates from the camps during the period.

Families must ensure that the elderly persons, those with diabetes, blood pressure and low immunity are in self-quarantine and do not come in physical contact with others in the family.

Around 1.5 lakh pregnant women with the expected date of delivery falling within two months have been identified across the State. Doctors have been instructed to follow up their cases. In case of assistance, helplines 102 and 104 could be contacted, an official release said.

Under the Disaster Management Act, the State government sought formation of crisis management committees, which will be headed by the respective Collectors. Representatives from chambers of commerce, private hospitals, pharmacies, agriculture, veterinary and fisheries departments will be part of the committees.

Government officials and agents and representatives from food manufacturing units, distributors, NGOs and consumer forums would also be part of the committees. Cooperative societies have been instructed to ensure supply of essential commodities so as to ensure social distancing.

Officials were taking efforts to implement the “local containment” plan, the government said and sought people’s cooperation. “Collectors have been instructed to ensure people follow personal distancing in vegetable markets, fish and meat shops,” the government added.

220,2020/03/29,Doctors to offer free teleconsultation,"It will help prevent patients from making unnecessary visits to hospital

Following the Union government’s approval of the long-pending guidelines for telemedicine in the wake of COVID-19, the Telemedicine Society of India-Tamil Nadu Chapter (TSI-TN) has said that it will offer teleconsultation to patients free of cost until the situation improved.

With the lockdown due to COVID-19 affecting patients and doctors from reaching hospitals, K. Ganapathy, past president, Telemedicine Society of India (TSI), said teleconsultation would not only be a boon for patients who are in need of consultation, but also prevent many of them from making unnecessary hospital visits.

“Through teleconsultation, we can do a tele-triage, based on which we can identify who needs to visit a hospital and who need not,” he said.

In a letter, K. Senthil Raj, Mission Director, National Health Mission-Tamil Nadu, asked all district-level health officials to widely publicise teleconsultation being facilitated by TSI-TN so that patients who are in need of consulting a doctor are not deprived of it.

K. Selvakumar, past president of TSI, said even many of the asthmatic and diabetic patients would need weekly changes in medicines that could not be done without doctor’s consultation. “They will be greatly affected in the present situation if teleconsultation is not available,” he said, adding that many psychiatrists are also receiving a lot of requests for teleconsultation now.

Though many healthcare institutions were offering telemedicine facilities, lack of guidelines from the Government of India was a hurdle that prevented many practitioners from providing teleconsultation, mainly because of concerns regarding medico-legal aspects.

“Now, with the Prime Minister and Union Health Minister pushing for telemedicine, there will be a great leap,” Dr. Selvakumar said.

Sunil Shroff, president, TSI-TN, said the society was planning an online training for doctors on the telemedicine guidelines in the next few days. “This training is mandatory as per the guidelines,” he said. He added that while around 40 doctors are already available through TSI-TN to offer consultation, he expected the numbers to significantly go up soon.

Dr. Ganapathy said the plan was to reach out to at least 50,000 doctors through the training. He said that patients could access TSI-TN’s website to know contact details of hospitals and doctors available for teleconsultation. The URL is www.tsitn.org/telemedicine -facilities-in-tamil-nadu. He added that doctors who want to be a part of the initiative can visit the website.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/doctors-to-offer-free-teleconsultation/article31201513.ece

Being run by Tamil Nadu Horticulture Development Agency (TANHODA) through 180 vehicles since Friday, the mobile shops are meant mostly for parts of the State other than Chennai. Among the vegetables being sold are tomato, chilli, small-sized onion, cabbage and gourd, apart from fruits such as water melon and banana. Nearly 1,900 tonnes were, so far, transported from fields of farmers to the points of sale. As for the reason not to run shops in Chennai, a senior official of the Agency, an arm of the Horticulture and Plantation Crops department as part of the State Agriculture department, is of the view that the city is being served by the Koyambedu market and farm fresh consumer outlets of the Cooperation department.

Yet, for the purpose of demonstration, the TANHODA is running retail outlets in Aminjikarai near Anna arch; Semmozhi Poonga on Cathedral Road; Madhavaram (near the entrance of botanical gardens) Thiruvanmiyur, near Marundeeswarar temple.

Folk singer and actor Paravai Muniyamma, 83, died in Madurai on Sunday. The octogenarian had been suffering from age-related ailments for a few years now.

She shot to fame in 2003 with her role in the film Dhool, in which she starred alongside actors Vikram and Jyothika. Her song Madurai veeran became a huge hit and she went on to star in several Tamil films. Among her other memorable onscreen appearances was the one with actor and comedian Vivekh in the film Kadhal Sadugudu. She also starred in the Tamil films Kovil, Devathaiyai Kanden, Thoranai and Thamizh Padam among others.

As a folk artiste, she had given several performances abroad. In an interview with The Hindu in 2004 she had said, “My overseas programmes stand testimony to the fact that human race has an unquenchable passion for folkart and culture. Folk songs cannot be sidestepped by disco, jazz or rock”. She also had a successful stint on television with her cooking show.

Following reports about Paravai Muniyamma’s ill health and financial woes, Chief Minister and AIADMK general secretary Jayalalithaa had announced a financial assistance of ₹6 lakh and a monthly aid of ₹6,000 to her in 2015.

The free Annadhanam scheme kitchens of several temples including Sri Kapaleeswarar and Sri Parthasarathy Perumal temples have been opened to serve food to the homeless and daily wage labourers, who are staying at community halls of the Chennai Corporation.

“The kitchens were kept closed since devotees were not allowed inside temples. However, we have asked the cook, a daily wage labourer himself, to come in for work daily. His work starts at 7 a.m. and is on till 11.30 a.m., when the food is sent to the hall. Our regular vendors supplying vegetables and condiments too have been informed and they will supply the necessary items,” said an official at the Kapaleeswarar temple in Mylapore that supplies sambar rice and curd rice along with a pickle and a vegetable to 60 persons staying at the community hall every day.

The sambar rice has vegetables including beans, pumpkin, drumstick and is prepared like bisibelebath, the official added.

“Initially, we were providing food in silver foil containers, but now we are supplying the food in large containers, which is as per the request of the local body. Our kitchen can supply food for up to 150 persons,” said a staff at the Kapaleeswarar temple.

Across the State, other temples including Sri Ranganathar Temple, Palani Subramaniyaswamy temple, Sri Mariamman temple in Samayapuram and Tiruchendur Subramanyaswamy temple too have begun providing food and they will continue doing so till the lockdown is lifted, said an official of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department.

At Marudamalai, 120 persons in a tribal settlement are being provided with lunch. The food is being supplied in coordination with the local body and revenue department officials and on the basis of requirements.

225,2020/03/29,"T.N. could mobilise ₹17,000 cr. more if Centre approves hike in borrowing limit","State wants to raise ceiling by 33% to be able to spend more on combating COVID-19

The Tamil Nadu government will be able to mobilise around ₹17,000 crore more in the coming financial year if it gets the Centre’s nod to raise its borrowing limit by 33% for meeting the additional expenditure arising out of the COVID-19 crisis.

The quantum of the proposed increase in the borrowing limit is in relation to that allowed for 2019-20, which is ₹51,800 crore. As of now, the limit prescribed for 2020-21 is ₹62,757 crore, which is an increase of 21.15% over the ceiling set for 2019-20. If the Centre concedes the State government’s request, the ceiling for the next financial year, beginning on Wednesday (April 1), will go up to ₹68,894 crore.

In his letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi last Wednesday, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami raised the demand for the hike in the borrowing limit and reiterated the same in another letter on Saturday. His demand was not just for Tamil Nadu but also for other States.

Fiscal deficit

The increase in the borrowing limit, if allowed, will also mean that the fiscal deficit, which should be within 3% of the Gross State Domestic Product, would go up to 4%. The nod of the Central government is required in the wake of the implementation of the Fiscal Responsibility Act.

The State government’s rationale for making the demand is that in the given “unprecedented situation”, the revenue of the government has “taken a hit and the expenditure needs have risen considerably”. The proposed increase in the borrowing limit would certainly help the States to immediately incur expenditure.

At the same time, “the States naturally have a limitation on how much they can borrow in the markets and will be crippled by massive repayment obligations if they borrow too much. But the onus on reviving the economy by fuelling consumption and investment falls on the [State] governments at this time,” Mr. Palaniswami pointed out in his letter.

A senior official of the State government expressed the hope that the T.N. government would be able to tide over the crisis if, besides the enhancement in the borrowing limit, the Union government provides a special one-time grant of ₹9,000 crore, as sought by the Chief Minister on Saturday.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tn-could-mobilise-17000-cr-more-if-centre-approves-hike-in-borrowing-limit/article31201165.ece
226,2020/03/29,Railways to hire medical staff on contract,"Officials are bracing for rush at hospitals

The Indian Railways apprehends an “enormous” rush at hospitals soon and has decided to hire the services of retired paramedical staff. The Ministry of Railways has decided to hire doctors and paramedical staff on contract.

In a note to all General Managers of Zonal Railways and Production Units, the Railway Board on Saturday said “keeping in view the pandemic situation because of the outbreak of coronavirus disease, it is apprehended that extra paramedical staff will be required for handling the enormous rush expected in a few weeks.”

Opening up medical facilities in railway hospitals to all Central government employees, the board also decided to engage doctors on contract. “Presently the country is facing an unprecedented public health emergency with the COVID19 pandemic affecting several parts of the nation. The government is taking necessary steps to contain the spread of this deadly disease. It is time to prepare ourselves well in advance...” the note said.

The Railway Board authorities asked the General Managers/Chief Administrative Officers/Divisional Railway Managers to engage retired paramedical staff up to the age of 65 years on contract basis for one month over and above the sanctioned strength.

227,2020/03/29,Govt. gives go-ahead for resumption of agricultural activities,"Decision taken to avoid shortage, prevent hoarding

The Tamil Nadu government has permitted the resumption of inter-State and intra-State agriculture-related activities and movement of goods, which were restricted as part of the nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. Farming operations are allowed with safety precautions.

The decision was taken following a communication from the Centre to prevent shortage of rice, pulses, vegetables and fruits.

“The objective is to ensure that there is no shortage and to prevent hoarding,” said Gagandeep Singh Bedi, Agricultural Production Commissioner and Principal Secretary, Agriculture Department.

Incidentally, the movement of agricultural and horticultural goods had figured in the list of exempted activities when the State announced its initial lockdown. However, a subsequent notification, issued in line with the Centre’s lockdown notification, superseded it. This necessitated the latest Government Order, Mr. Bedi explained.

“Organisations procuring agricultural products, godowns, fertiliser shops, farm labourers, companies renting out farm machines and equipment, companies packaging and selling seeds and insecticides, movement of farm vehicles between States are exempted from the lockdown,” he told The Hindu.

A G.O. issued by Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam on Saturday said, “Shops, including rations shops (under PDS and FCI operations) dealing with food, groceries, fruits and vegetables, dairy and milk booths, meat and fish, animal fodder and shops for seeds and pesticides and fertilisers” figured in the exempted list.

The order also exempted agencies engaged in procurement of agriculture products, including MSP operations and mandis operated by the Agriculture Produce Market Committee, from the lockdown.

Mr. Bedi, who communicated the decision to officials in the districts, said, “Farmers have already expressed non-availability of labourers. To ensure the availability and movement of farm workers, police and village administrative officers will facilitate them without crowding and with restrictions.”

The government also requested District Collectors to organise vegetable sales in local areas to avoid crowding in markets, he said.

Mr. Bedi said on Sunday alone 6,000 tonnes of vegetables arrived at the Chennai’s Koyambedu wholesale market in 425 trucks and 955 tempos and mini-vans. On Saturday the flow was slow and the market received between 3,000 and 4,000 tonnes of vegetables. “The arrival was doubled because of the efforts taken by the administration and police,” he said.

The G.O. said district authorities should encourage and facilitate home delivery to minimise the movement of individuals outside their homes.

It amended the notification issued by the Revenue and Disaster Management Department on March 25, which spelt out measures to prevent and contain the spread of COVID-19 in the State for 21 days from that day.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aqbqna/article31200959.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30THFARMERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/govt-gives-go-ahead-for-resumption-of-agricultural-activities/article31200960.ece
228,2020/03/29,Over 100 migrant workers from State stranded in Goa,"They hardly have any savings and are running out of rations

Over 100 migrant labourers from Kallakurichi district, who were working at an ice factory in the Malim Fisheries Cooperative in Goa, are now stranded there, unable to return to their home towns as a result of the 21-day nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19.

According to S. Devendran, a migrant worker from Sankarapuram taluk in Kallakurichi district,

the workers, including those from Kallakurichi and Villupuram districts, were employed at the fisheries cooperative in Malim, where the daily catch was loaded into lorries and sent to various destinations. In view of the lockdown, fishing activity had come to a standstill, and the workers had been stranded here for the past few days. “Around 20 to 30 workers have been accommodated in a godown in the fisheries cooperative, while a few others have taken rooms on rent. We have only minimal savings, and with our rations running out, we don’t know how long we can manage. Our request to the government is to help us immediately,” said P. Tamilselvan, another labourer.

Describing their plight, M. Sankar, a migrant worker, said most of them were living in cramped accommodation with poor facilities. “We don’t have any medical assistance in case we fall ill. While we were getting ready to return to Kallakurichi, train services were completely stopped. With fishing activity also coming to a standstill, we don’t know how long we could manage here without wages.”

When contacted Kallakurichi Collector Kiran Gurrala said the administration was in touch with the workers.

“We have requested them to stay back as the Centre has restricted movement of migrants across borders to contain the spread of COVID-19. The administration will take up this issue with the authorities in Goa and ensure that basic facilities are provided to the workers,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/over-100-migrant-workers-from-state-stranded-in-goa/article31200951.ece
229,2020/03/29,T.N. still in second stage of pandemic: Vijayabaskar,"The phenomenon of a cluster of cases has not started here yet: Health Minister

Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar, a qualified medical professional himself, has been leading from the front in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly a month after the first positive case of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the State, he discusses the stage of the pandemic in Tamil Nadu, the containment, treatment and preparatory measures that have been set in motion, and future preparedness. Excerpts:

There seems to be a great deal of apprehension about whether Tamil Nadu has entered the third stage of the pandemic — community transmission…

We are still at stage 2 — local transmission. We are working really hard to stop/slow down the progress to stage 3, or community transmission, where the source of infection cannot be traced. So far, in all but one case, we have traced the infection back to people who have tested positive or those with travel/contact history. We have also doubled our containment efforts in areas where positive cases have been found, by marking out an area around the house/place where the patient is staying. We are also engaged in aggressive case detection. This will help in ensuring that the infection does not spread.

We have also started enquiring with everyone who had been abroad and had returned since mid-February, and are recommending a strict quarantine of 28 days at home for those who do not show symptoms. If they have symptoms, they are tested and, if the result is positive, shifted to a hospital.

Another interesting fact is that the phenomenon of a cluster of cases has not started in Tamil Nadu yet. In some States, it has already begun. But all the work we are doing is to prevent the progression to that stage.

Besides the lockdown and containment, what are the other measures that the government has taken to battle COVID-19?

We have been carrying out a lot of campaigns on respiratory hygiene and surface hygiene. Respiratory hygiene is basically personal hygiene — coughing and sneezing into your sleeve, maintaining personal distance and using sanitisers and soap frequently. As far as surface hygiene goes, we have been regularly disinfecting surfaces of buildings and vehicles using personnel, machines and drones.

This is a key aspect. If you look at the progress of COVID-19 in different nations, you can see this has made the difference. The numbers in nations such as Italy and America, versus, say, Japan and Singapore, tell the story of the impact of better preparation, hygiene practices, disinfection and prophylaxis on the community.

We have also started to upgrade the infrastructure and gear up health systems to be able to tackle a large volume of cases, should they occur. We have converted the Omandurar Multi Specialty Hospital into a COVID-19 specialised unit, and have ensured that there are exclusive units in every district to cater only to COVID-19 patients. We have asked all District Collectors to ensure that provisions are made to accommodate a large number of people under quarantine conditions. We have also increased the procurement of ventilators for the State.

We have also collaborated successfully with private hospitals, some of whom have already allocated beds for COVID-19 patients. The number of testing centres too has gone up.

What about the health status of patients who are testing positive?

We are mainly getting people with mild symptoms. The most significant symptom is breathlessness, and so far, that has been handled by providing an oxygen mask, through a cylinder or a pipeline. As of now, not a single patient needs to be admitted to the ICU.

Only one patient, the 54-year old male in Madurai, who expired, was seriously ill. However, that is because he had co-morbidities. Though we tried hard to save him, it was very challenging, and ultimately we lost him.

Apart from him, only one other patient, a 73-year-old lady from Pammal, was a little ill, but she has now been moved to a government facility and the doctors are telling me she is doing much better.

What are the Health Department’s plans for the future, down the course of this pandemic?

Our biggest strength is that we have been able to adjust ourselves to the emerging scenario. We will continue to do that and be flexible to make changes as and when necessary. If this turns out to be a long-drawn-out process, we are equipped to handle it.

A percentage of our health force is always kept on reserve, at home, so that they can relieve the current workforce after a specified period. This will ensure that fatigue does not creep into our health force and derail our battle. That, I would argue, has been done with foresight and planning, and will help us tide over the worst phase of the pandemic.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/13eey5/article31200937.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30THVIJAYABASKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tn-still-in-second-stage-of-pandemic/article31200938.ece

Commercial Taxes Minister K.C. Veeramani and District Collector, A. Shanmuga Sundaram visited the tepmporary vegetable markets at the old bus stand, Don Bosco School in Katpadi and Government HSS, Thorapadi to seek the inputs from the shopkeepers as well as residents.

Poor crowd management was visible.

While the regulated fish market received a huge crowd, it was managed by maintaining social distancing between the shoppers. Vendors selling fish and mutton near Vishnu cinemas had a tough time in managing the huge crowd that thronged before the shops. The location was not viable for any social distancing arrangements and people had to scamper thorough the small spaces available there.

Revenue officials ordered for sealing a mutton shop in Thorapadi for not adhering to social distancing arrangements.

In Ambur too, there were number of shops which functioned with visible violations such as poor social hygiene and lacking arrangements for people to maintain distance while at the shops.

Ambur Tahsildar, Shenbagavalli ordered for sealing of nine chicken and mutton shops for not maintaining the norms stipulated by the State Government.

Despite the Police taking serious action in controlling those wandering on the streets, the shoppers were creating a situation that led the district administration to clamp a 24X7 curfew for the rest of the 16 days.

She shot to fame in 2003 with her role in the film Dhool, in which she starred alongside actors Vikram and Jyothika. Her song Madurai veeran became a huge hit and she went on to star in several Tamil films. Among her other memorable onscreen appearances was with actor and comedian Vivekh in the film Kadhal Sadugudu. She also starred in Kovil, Devathaiyai Kanden, Thoranai and Thamizh Padam among others.

As a folk artiste, she also gave several performances abroad. In an interview with The Hindu in 2004 she had said - “My overseas programmes stand testimony to the fact that human race has an unquenchable passion for folk art and culture. Folk songs cannot be withered away by disco, jazz or rock”.

She also had a successful stint on television with her rustic cooking show in which she showcased several traditional recipes.

Following reports about Paravai Muniyamma’s ill health and financial woes, former Chief Minister and AIADMK general secretary Jayalalithaa had announced a financial assistance of ₹6 lakh and a monthly aid of ₹6,000 to her in 2015.

In March 2019, she was honoured with the Kalaimamani title by the Tamil Nadu government.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/os0v2x/article31197300.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PARAVAIMUNIYAMMA,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/tamil-folk-singer-actress-paravai-muniyamma-no-more/article31197302.ece
235,2020/03/29,Eleven COVID 19 patients test negative,"They are to be discharged today, announces Chief Minister

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has said that 11 Coronavirus positive patients have tested negative after the expiry of the incubation period on Sunday and they will be discharged from hospitals on Monday.

The final tests on the 11 patients who were all foreign returnees have been completed. This has reduced the strength of patients still under treatment from 69 to 58, Mr. Rao told a press conference here on Sunday.

Answering a question on the death of a person with virus, he said the victim was not under treatment of the government. The virus was detected in post-mortem examination.

There were 25,937 persons still under surveillance of the government from a cut-off date. Of them, as many as 5,046 were in quarantine. They will all be left free from March 30 as per the expiry of 14 days of incubation. If no new cases were detected during the period, he said Telangana will achieve zero cases by April 7 but the government will not relax lockdown.

He expected less possibility of new cases as the airports were closed and there was no way of transmission by foreign returnees. The only possibility of transmission was from local communities. Therefore, the collectors were told at Sunday’s video conference to enforce home quarantine strictly.

The government was building up a pool of doctors, nurses and lab technicians to continue the efforts.

Complimenting the good discipline exhibited by people to check the spread of coronavirus so far, he said the same might go haywire if farmers crowded foodgrains procurement centres from April 1. He appealed to villagers to open up fencing that they had put up to bar entry of outsiders.

He also said the teams that specialised in mounting harvesters on tractors will be identified in a few days to commence mechanised harvesting operations soon. The police will be asked to issue passes to three or four teams from every town for the work.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/90jy1o/article31201012.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy29KCR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/eleven-covid-19-patients-test-negative/article31200932.ece
236,2020/03/29,TS Health officials issue guidelines for home quarantine,"Guidelines also have instructions to family members of persons under home quarantine

Telangana Health Department has issued guidelines for home quarantine for containment of COVID-19, which includes details on who should be kept under quarantine, what should the person under observation do, distance family members have to maintain if they have to stay in the same room, and other details.

While quarantine of persons is separating people who are not ill but who may have been exposed to an infectious agent or disease with the objective of monitoring symptoms and early detection of cases, isolation is separation of ill or infected persons from others so as to prevent the spread of infection or contamination.

The 14 days’ quarantine applies to (1) All people who have a travel history from other countries (symptomatic or asymptomatic) (2) People who are asymptomatic contacts of lab confirmed cases (3) Suspects who are COVID negative before the discharge from the isolation facility.

The Health department officials said that the person under home quarantine should stay in a well-ventilated room with an attached toilet. She or he should not move out of the allocated room during the quarantine period.

“If another family member needs to stay in the same room, it’s advisable to maintain a distance of at least 1 metre between the two. The person needs to stay away from elderly people, pregnant, children, and persons with co-morbidities like diabetes, tuberculosis, heart ailments, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases etc.,” as stated in the guidelines.

They were suggested to change mask every six hours and the used mask should be considered as potentially infected. The masks used by patients, care givers, close contacts during home care should be disinfected using ordinary bleach solution (5%) or sodium hypochlorite solution (1%) and then disposed of either by burning or deep burial.

The guidelines also have instructions to family members of persons under home quarantine, sanitation of rooms, clothes, surfaces in the home.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ts-health-officials-issue-guidelines-for-home-quarantine/article31200620.ece
237,2020/03/29,‘KCR failed to supply food and money as promised’,"Extend interest-free loans to companies to pay salaries during lockdown, says Shabbir

Former minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir has criticised Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao for his alleged failure to supply ration and other essential commodities to poor people despite the lockdown completing more than one week.

In a media statement on Sunday, he said that the people of Telangana, especially poor, daily wage earners, labourers and other weaker sections were living in an extremely poor condition with no food to eat and no access to other facilities.

The Congress leader said that the Chief Minister had promised supply of 12 kg free rice and ₹ 1500 each to nearly 87 lakh white ration card holders. Even after one week, no arrangements have been made to provide the promised help. “We are facing an emergency situation wherein entire population is combating an epidemic. Poor people have lost their livelihood and all sources of income. How does the government expect them to survive without food for over one week,” he said.

He accused Prime Minister Narender Modi and the Chief Minister of trying to convert a tragedy into an event. They are more interested in creating ‘picture’ opportunities for the media than addressing the real issues. The lockdown was not properly planned and its execution was horrible. He said that both Central and State governments did no assessment of immediate impact of lockdown. It was done in such a haphazard manner that it created chaotic situation everywhere, he said.

Shabbir Ali said lakhs of people have lost their jobs due to lockdown. Therefore, the government should announce a package for those who lost their jobs since March 22. Not many companies or small firms would have so much of cash reserves to pay to their employees when their businesses are closed since March 22. Therefore, the government should provide interest-free loans to all such companies, without any collateral, to enable them to pay salaries to the employees for the lockdown period.

He urged the State government to start the implementation of Unemployment Allowance of ₹ 3,016 per month on immediate basis.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/kcr-failed-to-supply-food-and-money-as-promised/article31200270.ece

239,2020/03/29,Customers throng markets for meat,"Police ensure safe distancing between people in queue

On Sunday all chicken centres and meat, fish and poultry market in the weekly market were crowded with customers making a beeline to buy chicken, fish and meat. While observing distance from person to person they formed long queues to give orders and take items of their choice.

Police, who maintained a strict vigil, went round using a megaphone to warn them to maintain distance. At fish market they shouted at the fishermen and also customers for not wearing gloves and face masks. The crowd at meat centre was high and though the policemen asked them to maintain distance they were least bothered.

Closing all roads with barricades police allowed the customers through a narrow path so as to regulate the gathering. Four wheelers were not allowed and strictly only one person was given permission on two wheelers. Gandhi Ganj, the main market, was also closed. Customers were allowed only through a narrow passage. On normal days vegetable vendors who used to sit along either side of roads were asked to shift the outlets inside the market.

Young and old and women remained homes and only youth went to market to bring vegetables and essential commodities. The morning hustle bustle has slowly disappeared before noon. People felt relaxed with police allowing them to come to market for essential commodities.

Meanwhile, the vendors sold non-veg items at double the rates and Korramenu (murrel) fish sold at about ₹1,000 per kg which was ₹600 on normal days earlier. Chicken which was sold even at ₹50 per kg last week was sold at ₹190 per kg.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/vewjvt/article31200189.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY30NZBMEAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/customers-throng-markets-for-meat/article31200190.ece

241,2020/03/29,"Hand over cash to poor, says CPI(M)","‘Poor would not be able to withdraw money from bank accounts’

The CPI (Marxist) State committee has urged the government to take steps to hand over ₹ 1,500 assured to below poverty line families in cash along with rice and pulses rather than depositing the money in their accounts.

CPI (M) State secretary T. Veerabhadram welcomed the government’s decision to provide essentials along with cash to eligible poor in the light of lockdown and restrictions imposed in view of coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. But depositing the assured amount in bank could create problems to the beneficiaries.

The banks which were working with limited staff had expressed inability to handle huge turnout of customers while depositing money could invariably result in big numbers of people thronging the banks.

The ATMs operated by banks were located in mandal headquarters and other major centres. A few which were set up in villages were not functional most of the time. As a result, it could cause inconvenience to people, particularly those in tribal hamlets, to access the ATMs and withdraw the cash.

The government should therefore reconsider its decision and take steps to handover cash to the beneficiaries. In addition, it should also ensure that genuine poor who were yet to get their ration cards were not left out and steps should be taken to provide the benefits to them.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hand-over-cash-to-poor-says-cpim/article31200121.ece

The total lockdown imposed following the outbreak of COVID-19 proved fatal to alcohol addicts and particularly to those who are used to consume toddy adulterated with drugs like diazepam, alprazolam and chloral hydrate.

Neuro psychiatrist Vishal Akula, says he is treating two to four patients suffering from withdrawal symptoms every day. “If the problem is severe patient is likely to die unless he or she is treated promptly. The syndrome is seen both in women and men in the district as they consume toddy daily. Sudden withdrawal of consumption impacts them badly,” he adds.

He also said that he informed about the withdrawal symptoms developing in alcohol and toddy addicts to Collector C. Narayana Reddy and District Medical and Health Officer Sudarshanam. “Both the officers assured arrangements for treatment for such patients at hospitals,” he said.

249,2020/03/29,Parents worried as Odisha govt. hands over children to kin,"State administration has closed seasonal hostels

Migrant labourers from Odisha stranded in brick kilns and construction sites in other States are worried about their children as the government-run seasonal hostels, where they were put up, are closed prematurely following the COVID-19 alert.

About 5,000 children, aged below 14 years, have been handed over to distant relatives and community members in Balangir and Nuapada districts of Odisha while their parents are yet to return home.

Seasonal hostels were introduced in western Odisha districts of Balangir, Nuapada, Bargarh, Kalahandi and Subarnapur from where thousands of families migrate for seven months every year to work in brick kilns in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

Earlier, these labourers used to take their school-going children with them. As a result, they were losing valuable school hours as well as protein food.

In Balangir and Nuapada districts, 62 each seasonal hostels were opened this year. In view of COVID-19 scare, all government-run seasonal hostels have been closed since March 24. While the government claims that children have been handed over to their parents, experts believe not more than 20% of migrant labourers have returned.

“I don’t know the whereabouts of my 12-year-old son Hem Singh who was in hostel at Nangalbod in Nuapada district. We cannot move from here... I am worried,” Bhujbal Singh Majhi, who works in SLV Brick kiln at Pandeswaram near Chennai, told The Hindu over phone.

Indra Bhoi, who had left behind her 11-year-old son in Patalpada village under Muribahal block of Balangir district, said, “We don’t know what coronavirus is. What we are informed is that this is dangerous and could kill many. We had put our son in a seasonal hostel. Now, he is with her uncle. We are really worried.” She added the government should have taken care of him.

About 3,000 workers from western Odisha districts are still in brick kilns near Chennai. Conservative estimate says the number would cross 20,000 if all four States are taken into account. According to Balangir district administration, all children were released after consultation with local guardians.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bghjwn/article31201160.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/nd29-parentsIMG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/parents-worried-as-odisha-govt-hands-over-children-to-kin/article31201161.ece

Zomawii Hrashel is one of very few bakers in Mizoram who have not closed shop after the lockdown. The output of her Zomawi Bakery in Lunglei town has been scaled down, but the ovens have been churning out cakes and biscuits for inmates of the district jail, de-addiction centres and orphanages in the town and outlying areas.

The Lunglei district police have been helping her deliver the packages. “If the more fortunate among us do not help others during such times, who will?” she said.

Far away at Seppa, in Arunachal Pradesh, Dumsap Dada has waived off a month’s rent for 13 shopkeepers in two shopping complexes she owns. This will set the widow back by ₹90,000 for sustaining her large family. “All the shopkeepers are from outside — from Bihar, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh. How can I take rent from people who have not been able to sell anything? But I have told them to pass on the relief to other less privileged, to the best of their capabilities for creating an aid chain,” she told The Hindu.

Ms. Dada also hoped her gesture would help change the mindset of a section of people “who are calling our boys and girls coronavirus” at a time when the “spirit of humanity should reign”.

In the adjoining Sonitpur district of Assam, farmer Ganga Kakati has pledged 20 bighas of his farmland at Gohpur for a hospital to treat COVID-19 or other epidemics. Part of this land had been used for an election rally by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019.

In central Assam’s Puranigudam, businessman Nitul Gayan on Sunday wrote to Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma offering his marriage hall to be used as an isolation centre for those who do not have exclusive spaces at home.

Much before the Tripura government sought donations for a fund to absorb the socio-economic impact of the pandemic, sisters Jui and Munmun Deb had offered 25% of their monthly pay, amounting to ₹5,000 each. Both teach in government schools at Kamalpur in Dhalai district.

“We sought deduction from the current month’s pay due soon. But we transferred the amount as soon as Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb responded to our suggestion and provided a link for payment,” Ms. Jui Deb said.

Bolin Bordoloi, former MLA and son of Assam’s first Chief Minister Gopinath Bardoloi, said the outpouring of help underlined the seriousness of the pandemic although the Northeast has been relatively safe with two out of 39.2 million having tested COVID-19 positive.

“We now have to think of ways of streamlining the process of providing adequate supplies to the people. One way can be using the services of religious organisations and members of namghars (prayer halls) that are found in almost all localities,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/w4rxqt/article31201137.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE30ZOMAWI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/people-pitch-in-to-ease-lockdown-misery-of-others/article31201138.ece

Police Inspector in-charge of Howrah station, Sukanta Karmakar, is a happy man. “The State government arranged for seven buses,” he said.

One set of three buses carried 240 to north Bengal, Assam, Tripura, while the others carried about 140 to Asansol, Jharkhand and Bihar. The packed buses may have a risk of virus spread, but “under the circumstances the options were limited,” policemen said.

“The sad part is the railways did nothing; it was almost entirely arranged by the State government. I assume, the buses will carry the passengers till the inter-State border. The neighbouring States will have to arrange for the drop to districts of Bihar or Assam,” said Mr. Karmakar.

Tip of iceberg

But that was just the tip of the iceberg. More and more — mostly migrant workers from Bihar and Jharkhand — are assembling in Howrah station, hoping that the government will arrange for buses to go back to home town. One such group of six reached the station on Saturday afternoon, replacing another group that came from Mangaluru. Friday’s group of six men, originally from Jharkhand, came all the way walking from Batanagar in South 24 Paraganas district to Howrah station, a distance of 45 km.

“We thought [we] will get buses for Jharkhand,” said Ramsahay Yadav, a construction site worker. He and his fellow workers are unsure after two days’ walk on how to reach the destination. The man, who was rotting in the station, last week, has now been removed but an old woman is lying, half naked, and covered with flies.

While the portico and the shade, where the passengers were stranded, has been cleared, the area outside is filled with women who used to work in the eating joints outside. They all are now staying by the Hooghly river, opposite the Howrah station.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/howrah-station-braces-for-another-batch-of-passengers/article31201099.ece
253,2020/03/29,"Second COVID-19 death in Kashmir, 5 more test positive","Most of the positive cases have a travel history

One person died and five tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday in the Valley, taking the count of the infected to 38 in the Union Territory.

“Another patient from Srinagar died on Sunday morning. Besides, five more positives cases were confirmed in Kashmir, including two from Srinagar, two from Budgam and one from Baramulla,” said J&K spokesman Rohit Kansal.

With most of the positive cases having a travel history, Mr. Kansal said the contact tracing teams were reporting that despite many appeals people were still hiding travel histories. “A couple which tested positive in Srinagar on Saturday hid their international travel history. This is criminal,” said Mr. Kansal.

Meanwhile, eight members of a family including three minors, were quarantined on Sunday after coming in close contact with a relative from Bandipora who was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Saturday.

‘Community spread’

The 52-year-old man, who was reported dead in Srinagar’s Chest Disease Hospital on Sunday, hailed from Tangmarg in Baramulla district and his family said the patient had no travel history.

“This may be the first case to have contracted the infection from community exposure. The deceased had no history of travel or contact with any positive case of COVID-19,” said Doctors Association Kashmir president Dr. Nisar ul Hassan.

Invoking the Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Disease Act, the Pulwama administration has declared many areas as red zones, banning any inward and outward movement of any person.

Meanwhile, the J&K government spokesman said it is taking a number of steps to combat the pandemic. “Our teams have been consistently and aggressively trying to trace out the contacts and test them. Testing in J&K is highest in the country with nearly 10% of surveillance cases being tested,” the spokesman said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/second-covid-19-death-in-kashmir-5-more-test-positive/article31201081.ece
254,2020/03/29,Shelter homes in U.P. to control migration,"Free food and lodging for workers

After the orders of the Union Home Ministry, the district authorities of Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar have decided to establish shelter homes to control the exodus of migrant workers.

“The Ghaziabad Development Authority has decided to convert its 18 community centres spread across the city into shelter homes where free lodging and food would be given. Arrangements are being made to get them ready by Monday morning,” said Kanchan Verma, Vice-Chairperson, Ghaziabad Development Authority. Depending on the size, she told The Hindu, each of them could accommodate 50 to 100 people.

On the dangers of workers facing social stigma as the community centres are situated in residential colonies, she said, the GDA would make sure that the migrant workers didn’t face any problem. “We are in a state of lockdown, nobody should have a problem. We would see to it that things remain smooth.”

Besides, she said, GDA has five shelter homes where the workers could stay. Assked whether the response has come late, Ms Verma said it was an unprecedented situation. “We have already made arrangements for the construction labour working in Ghaziabad. The latest arrangement is for those who have come from other States.”

Similarly, the Gautam Buddh Administration has established 28 shelters homes.

255,2020/03/29,Coronavirus | Lal Kuan is the new epicentre of migrant exodus from Delhi,"There are orders from Delhi and Central govts that lockdown rules be followed strictly, says official

After facing a spate of migrant workers on Saturday night, Kaushambi Bus Depot wore a deserted look on Sunday as the Ghaziabad district administration shifted the buses to Lal Kuan on the outskirts of the city. Across the road, Delhi’s Anand Vihar, which was functional for a while in the morning, suddenly suspended services around noon, forcing hundreds of passengers waiting outside to vacate and reach Lal Kuan.

K.K. Dahiya, Special Commissioner, Transport, told The Hindu: “If we continue like this, it would be a mockery of the lockdown. There are orders from the Delhi and the Central governments that the rules of the lockdown should be followed in letter and spirit. We are sending 296 buses of the Delhi government to Lal Kuan to support the U.P. government.”

The action meant that people who were swarming the Delhi-Ghaziabad border got distributed. The bridge between Anand Vihar and Kaushambi was closed, forcing people to take long detours to reach Lal Kuan, which incidentally is not a designated bus depot. On a busy day, it is just an intersection where buses going to Aligarh, Etah, Kanpur, Lucknow and beyond slow down to fill the vacant seats.

“Last night, at one point in time there were around one lakh people around Kaushambi,” said Neeraj Jadaun, Suprintendent of Police (Rural), who was pressed into service to maintain order. “We thought it would be better to distribute them. By morning, the rush subsided.”

R.K. Tripathi, Assistant Regional Manager, Uttar Pradesh State Roadways Transport Corporation, said, “My guess is 70% to 75% of people boarded the bus last night. We hope we would finish the process today from Lal Kuan.”

On National Highway-51, the good old G.T. Road, one could see a steady stream of people walking down to Lal Kuan.

Workers from Nepal

There were Nepali workers from Loni patiently waiting for a bus to Sonauli on Nepal border. There were adventurous ones, who mounted a milk tanker to reach neighbouring Meerut. Policemen were not as rigid as they were when this walk home started on the day of the ‘janata curfew’.

Food, fruits and water bottles, which were missing all these days, were available for free along the way. Kawin, a hawker in Loni, said: “Had this supply reached home, we would not have been here. Four-five days are okay, this seems to be a long haul.”

One could still see ration trucks brimming with migrant workers moving in the city.

At Lal Kuan, Roshni was washing the hands of her daughter, dressed in a sparkling dress, on the divider. Asked why was she taking the long ride to Farrukhabad with little children, Roshni nonchalantly remarked, “Man kar raha hai (My heart says so). My husband has no work. His supervisor said chhutti hai (holiday), so we are going home.”

When one told her that the PM had apologised to people like her and that she would not have to pay the rent. “Sirf Kehne Ki baat hai (It is just a statement).

256,2020/03/29,Coronavirus | Stranded parents worried over fate of children,"Odisha closes seasonal hostels prematurely and hands them over to guardians

Migrant labourers from Odisha stranded in the brick kilns and the construction sites in other States are worried about the fate of their kids as the government-run seasonal hostels, where they were put up, are closed prematurely following the COVID-19 alert.

About 5,000 children aged below 14 have been handed over to distant relatives and community members in Balangir and Nuapada district of Odisha while parents of a majority of children are yet to return home.

Seasonal hostels were introduced in western Odisha districts of Balangir, Nuapada, Bargarh, Kalahandi and Subarnapur from where thousands of families undertake migration for seven months every year to work in the brick kilns in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

Earlier, they used to take their school-going children with them to workplaces with no one left in the villages to take care of them. Children were losing valuable school hours and protein food. While migrant labourers work outside the State from December to June, these kids stay in hostels.

In Balangir and Nuapada districts, 62 seasonal hostels each were opened this year. In view of the COVID-19 scare, all hostels had been closed on March 24. While the government claims that kids have been handed over to their parents, experts believe not more than 20% of migrant labourers have returned home.

“I don’t know the whereabouts of my 12-year-year son Hem Singh whom I had put up in a seasonal hostel at Nangalbod in Nuapada district. We cannot move from here as there is no train to our home State. I am worried,” Bhujbal Singh Majhi, who works in a kiln at Pandeswaram near Chennai, told The Hindu over phone.

Similar sentiment was echoed by Indra Bhoi, who had left behind her 11-year-old son in Patalpada village under Muribahal block of Balangir district. “We don’t know what [novel] coronavirus is. What we are informed is that the virus is dangerous and could wipe out many. Since we did not have any trusted one back home, we had put up our son in a seasonal hostel. Now he is with his uncle. We are really worried,” Indra said adding that the government would have best taken care of him.

About 3,000 migrant workers from western Odisha districts are still working in the kilns near Chennai. A conservative estimate says the number would cross 20,000 if all four States are taken into account.

According to the Balangir district administration, all children were released after consultations with local guardians. “We have left the children in the custody of their local guardians. When the government wanted all hostels to be shut, we did not have any option,” said Dhruba Charan Behera, Balangir District Education Officer.

The government should have taken a little care while handing over these children. The district-level Child Welfare Committees, the quasi-judicial body constituted to ensure the safety of children, were not even consulted. The Balangir CWC said it did not have any information about handing over of children.

“It is very critical to understand the situation of the children while being handed over to their legal custodian. Children need to be protected mentally, psychologically and also physically till their parents come back. The government should closely monitor their whereabouts,” said Umi Daniel, head of the Migration information and Resource Centre (MiRC), Aide et Action South Asia, an NGO.

Though the COVID-19 had thrown an extraordinary challenge, the government should have been extra cautious in handling these cases, said Mr. Daniel.

Odisha has sent more than 5.5 lakh children staying in different hostels to their natural parents. But the children of the migrant labourers seem to be a little unlucky.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-stranded-parents-worried-over-fate-of-children/article31199424.ece
257,2020/03/29,"Coronavirus lockdown | As inter-State buses dwindle, migrants are stuck on Yamuna Expressway with nowhere to go","Hours of waiting at Zero Point on Yamuna Expressway turns into despair.

Hundreds of people remained suspended between hope and despair at Zero Point on the Yamuna Expressway on Sunday as desperate migrant workers — forced by a sudden and indefinite loss of employment due to the nationwide lockdown — tried to return home to villages in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Haryana.

Zero Point is an unofficially-designated location on the Yamuna Expressway, which links New Delhi with Agra, where inter-State buses usually pick up passengers.

Coronavirus | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

On Sunday, however, only a handful of the several hundred waiting people were fortunate enough to get on a vehicle, most climbing onto the already packed roofs of private buses or squeezing into overflowing minivans.

Many had no choice but to wait endlessly.

Given the near hopeless situation, some decided to return to the rented accommodations they had walked several kilometres and hours, to leave.

Coronavirus lockdown | At ‘Zero Point’ on Yamuna Expressway, flight from hunger beats fight against virus

“I left my rented accommodation at Alpha I with my brother around 8 a.m. We made several stops on the way, making enquiries, waiting for a bus — any bus — to go back home to Allahabad (Prayagraj),” said Sunil Kumar Gupta, who runs a paan shop, adding that he had walked for about an hour to reach Zero Point.

In the four-hour wait that followed, Mr. Gupta and his sibling, Anil, like many others, took turns to rush towards every bus to enquire about its destination. As the crowds surged, the police deployed at the spot herded them into groups depending on their destinations — Agra, Aligarh and Lucknow.

On Saturday, the Uttar Pradesh government had announced that it would arrange 1,000 buses to bring back residents, triggering a massive congregation at the spot despite the lockdown to check the spread of the novel coronavirus imposed last week.

Lack of planning

Videos and photos of the tens of thousands waiting on the Expressway and at the Anand Vihar bus station in Delhi went viral, raising questions on whether the government had been adequately prepared to deal with this exodus even as Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal made repeated appeals to the workers not to leave as they could become victims of COVID-19.

“Our family back home heard about the announcement; we also saw how others were leaving. We were already preparing to travel when we got a call from the family to come back; we thought we would try our luck,” a despondent Mr. Gupta said.

Fewer Uttar Pradesh government-run buses seemed to be in operation on Sunday.

A police official deployed at Zero Point during what was supposed to be a two-day drive to help stranded passengers return home, said, “All those fortunate enough” to board them had done so till midnight on Saturday.

The likelihood of bus services being on offer on Monday was “highly unlikely” he said. “Whoever was destined to go back home mostly went yesterday. From tomorrow, we will begin enforcing the lockdown again using any means necessary,” he added.

After four hours of having run after every passing bus, Mr. Gupta’s roommate, Anand Kumar, was finally able to persuade him and Anil to return to their shared digs at around noon.

“We will go back, what else; there is no point in being stuck here with nothing on either side,” Mr Gupta said as he joined a growing number of disappointed workers returning to the city they sought to leave.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/k26k2p/article31197562.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ZEROPOINT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/stranded-workers-continue-to-wait-for-transport-on-the-yamuna-expressway/article31197563.ece

259,2020/03/29,"Coronavirus: Bengal’s medicine supply dwindling, steps taken to keep shops open, says Directorate of Drug Control","Patients left in the lurch as only 10 of the 500 wholesalers in Bagri Market in Kolkata were open on Friday, cutting supply to retailers

Bhaskar Doshi, the manager of Quality Pharma, is missing his lunches.

“Employees could not come as they are either on suburban train line or had to cross the Ganga on launch boats to reach Bagri market. Both are shut.”

“Besides, they are beaten by police, if they come out,” said Mr. Doshi, explaining why his work pressure increased after the lockdown to tackle COVID-19 was announced.

His shop is one of few hundred wholesaling and distributing points in Mehta Building in the medicine lane of central Kolkata’s Bagri market. With about 500 wholesalers, the market caters for over 30,000 retail outlets in West Bengal and another tens of thousands of retail points in eastern India. But on Friday evening, only about 10 of the 500 shops in Bagri Market were open. Mr. Doshi’s was one.

He said police support was mandatory to keep wholesalers operational, so that the supply line to the retailers was maintained. “If supply line is cut, patients will feel the heat,” Mr. Doshi said.

Patients are already feeling the heat.

Search for medicines

Sudipa Mukherjee, a housewife in south Kolkata’s Mahamayatala with high blood pressure, went to about a dozen shops for two medicines on Saturday. “I got one of the two medicines Strator-20; not the main one, Nebicard-SM.”

Anupam Sen, a chartered accountant and alumni of State’s largest private school South Point, said that many of the retired senior teachers could not access medicine.

“We, under an organisation Pointers Who Care, are supporting our teachers in sourcing and delivering medicines. Procurement is becoming increasingly difficult.”

West Bengal has about 40,000 retailers and 20,000 wholesalers taking care of the needs of millions across east India.

Sankha Roy Chowdhury, the president of Bengal Chemists and Druggists Association (BCDA), told The Hindu that the situation was “somewhat predicted.”

Panic buying

“Patients started panic buying. They stock piled, accentuating the crisis.”

But then that is just the tip of proverbial iceberg, explained Pradip Ghosh, the secretary of te BCDA in North 24 Parganas, the second most populous district in the country. The medicine factories in north and west India have mostly shut down.

“Staff shortage hit them. So they cannot send the medicine to Clearing and Forwarding (C&F) agents in Bengal. C & F’s can’t dispatch to distributors, as their employees are not reporting and 95% of wholesale business has stopped affecting retailers,” Mr. Ghosh explained. Moreover, the retailers of various districts cannot pick up their consignment from wholesalers.

“There is urgent need to provide some travel pass and arrange for the transport,” said Mr. Ghosh. Mr. Roy Chowdhury added that the Bagri market traders narrated the problem to the Chief Minister on Saturday night.

He questioned the Central government’s announcement to provide ₹50 lakh insurance cover to doctors and healthcare workers but not to the staff associated with medicine trade. He, however, said that “police action has reduced after discussions with Gyanwant Singh”, an Additional Director General of Bengal police.

A top official of the Directorate of Drug Control in the State told The Hindu that a comprehensive view was now taken to ensure that the shops were open and staff could reach work place. “Identity cards are being provided and point to point transportation arranged. Retail shops are largely open,” the officer said. Mr. Chowdhury suggested a stopgap solution.

“Patients may request the doctors to suggest more than one brand name. If they do not get one, then they can look for another one.

Any worker or employee infected with coronavirus and in isolation for treatment will get 28 days of paid leave from their employer across Noida and Greater Noida, the Gautam Buddh Nagar district administration has ordered.

In an order passed late on Saturday night, the administration also said that shops, industries and factories closed because of the lockdown will have to give daily wage along with leave to their workers and labourers during the closure period.

The order has come amid reports of thousands of daily wage earners leaving for their homes, towns and villages due to a 21-day countrywide lockdown called by the Centre.

Gautam Buddh Nagar District Magistrate B.N. Singh said the Uttar Pradesh government has already declared the pandemic as a “disaster” and the lockdown has been called with an objective to contain the virus from spreading. “Workers and employees who are infected with COVID-19 and kept in isolation for treatment will get 28 days’ paid leave. This will be done only when such patients produce a certificate of treatment to their employers upon being discharged as healthy,” Singh said.

“All such shops, commercial facilities and factories, which have been closed temporarily because of the order of the state government or the district administration, will provide paid leave to their workers and labourers for the duration of the closure,” he said in the order.

Arrangement should be made by such establishments to dole out the payments to their workers and labourers on March 30 and 31 or April 3 and 4, depending on their situation to make the payment, the order stated.

Singh said he has invoked the powers vested in him as the district magistrate under the National Disaster Management Act 2005 to issue this order and any violation of it would attract legal action against the offender.

Action would be ensured against the offender under Section 51 of the Act which provides for one year of imprisonment or financial penalty or both and two years of jail if violation of the order causes any loss to life or property, according to the order. People can use the administration’s integrated control room number (0120-2544700) to report any related violation, the magistrate said.

Gautam Buddh Nagar has recorded 26 cases of coronavirus of which four patients have been treated and discharged till Saturday, a Health Department official said.

265,2020/03/29,"Coronavirus | Inured to lockdowns, but Valley hit hardest by latest one","Kashmir is now in its ninth day of a new lockdown. If the COVID-19 crisis does not subside by May, around 11,789 tonnes of cherry may be buried in the Valley’s orchards.

Despite being a Friday, the only objects visible on the roads at Khimber village are concertina wires and the only sound is that of rain.

Despite 30 years of militancy, prolonged shutdowns and curfews, the COVID-19 outbreak has proved a greater challenge to the village some 16 km from Srinagar. Forced indoors by the fear of contagion, the lockdown is already taking a toll on the vital strawberry fields and cherry and apple orchards of the region.

Khawaja Ghulam Najar, 82, a regular worshipper at the local Noor-ul-Haq mosque described this Friday as the saddest day of his life.

“Even at the peak of militancy or spells of curfews between 2008 and 2016 or even the August 5, 2019 clampdown, this mosque remained open. For over 40 years, I never missed my congregational Friday prayers. But this virus closed it,” said Mr. Najar, a local shopkeeper.

All mosques, including the Hazratbal shrine close by, have been closed for congregational prayers. There was extra security deployed and the policemen were tough against locals, with many beaten up for not wearing masks and stepping out of their houses without a valid reason.

Kashmir is now in its ninth day of a new lockdown. “We have huddled children and women inside. So far, only the affluent class is affected. God forbid, if lower middle class contracts the disease, it will prove a disaster,” said Fida Muhammad, a wicker-basket maker.

Several localities in Khimber have decided not to allow the elderly to step outdoors. “Only healthy males venture out to buy essentials. But many essential items like flour, sugar etc. have already vanished from local grocery shops. Many shopkeepers are beaten up by the police if they open shops. Where will we get fresh stock now?” said Fida Muhammad, a resident.

In Gasoo, villagers who grow strawberries on around 86 hectares on terraced gardens are worried that the Valley's first crop of fruit after the prolonged winter, may not make it to the markets.

“It’s getting difficult to tend the farms. The plucking will start from the last week of April and it lasts only for one month. The lockdown is already till April 14. What if it’s extended? Most of strawberries will be rotten in orchards,” says Firaq Jan, a farmer.

The Khimber-Dara belt’s cherry gardens are full with hanging buds. “Cherry is the second fruit crop after strawberry. It will be a challenge to ship the crop after plucking starts in May. All inter-district and inter-State transport is banned. This virus may eat up our produce too,” said Akram Khan, a resident of Dara.

If the COVID-19 crisis does not subside by May, around 11,789 tonnes of cherry may be buried in the Valley’s orchards. The lockdown has also hit necessary care of apple trees that require grafting and pruning.

“This is the time to control the spread of diseases like San Jose scale which kills an apple tree in just two years. Pesticides are not available in the market due to the lockdown, and the movement of tractors is restricted. The trees require regular pruning and grafting. If the situation does not normalise normal soon, we may lose early apple crop too,” said Khalid Dar, an orchard owner.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/a43ak1/article31195840.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NEWS1KASHMIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-inured-to-lockdowns-but-valley-hit-hardest-by-latest-one/article31195841.ece
266,2020/03/29,"Coronavirus | Despite U.P. CM’s appeal, migrant workers throng Lucknow’s bus stands","Without work or money, they see little point in staying put.

“Do din ho gaye khana nahi mila abhi (it’s two days since we have got proper food),” said Neeraj Yadav as he trudged along a deserted street, hefting his meagre belongings.

With a small group of friends, Mr. Yadav is heading towards the Qaiserbagh bus station in the heart of Lucknow, hoping for transport back home.

Helpline numbers | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India | Coronavirus - Live updates

A mason, Mr. Yadav had arrived in Lucknow from the Terai district of Lakhimpur Kheri two weeks ago, hired by a contractor to work at a site near the airport.

Abandoned

However, after the nationwide lockdown was announced to check the spread of the novel coronavirus on March 24, the contractor shut down the business, leaving the labourers stranded, without work or food.

Apprehensive that the lockdown would be extended beyond 21 days, the construction workers decided to head home after the government announced that special buses would be run on Saturday.

“What will we do sitting here when we don’t get food or water,” asked Mr. Yadav, who has walked 20 km to reach the bus station, surviving on the biscuits and water offered by some residents and the police on the way.

Coronavirus | Centre tells States to set up camps for migrant workers

The appeal by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday, that migrant labourers should stay on wherever they are rather than trying to return home, was met with little enthusiasm from the workers.

“Had we got basic facilities here, why would we not stay back,” remarked Ravindra Yadav. “After all we had come all the way to work.”

At the Qaiserbagh and Charbagh bus stations, workers were seen frantically boarding the State transport busesto return to their home towns. As the large groups thronged the crowded bus station trying to find the right bus, the protocol of physical distancing ended up getting short shrift. Many had to wait for several hours to find the right vehicle.

Long march, long wait

Ram Prakash, a labourer from Gonda, reached the bus station on Friday evening but had to return as he was told no bus would ply towards his home. He returned on Saturday morning but was still waiting to board a bus at 1 p.m. “I have been waiting here without food since 7 a.m.,” he said, adding that he had only eaten some biscuits.

Coronavirus | Similar stories, very personal tragedies

Mr. Prakash also thought it was impractical for the government to ask labourers to stay at their places of work without any employment or food. Many like him had assumed that things would get back to normal after the janata curfew announced by the Prime Minister for MArch 15. But the subsequent 21-day lockdown left them with no option but to head home.

“Jab paisa jeb mein nahi hai toh kya karenge (how will we survive with no money in our pockets),” asked Mr. Prakash.

The struggle was harder for those returning from cities like Delhi and moving towards their villages in Purvanchal and central U.P. Ramu Rawat, a Dalit labourer working in Ghaziabad, had walked with a small group more than 100 km on the highway before they got a lift in a supply truck, which dropped them about 100 km short of Lucknow on the Sitapur road.

Coronavirus | Narendra Modi sets up new fund to fight virus

Walking towards the Charbagh bus station to catch a bus to his home in Rae Bareli, Mr. Rawat said the local administration in Ghaziabad had not provided any immediate help to the migrants. The only support they had got was in the form of khichdi served to them by policemen and locals on the highway, he said. “Na rehne ka jugaad, na khane ka jugaad, sarkar ne kuch nahi diya (the government did not provide us anything, neither food, nor shelter),” he said.

Ram Bhed Biswakarma, who works at a furniture shop in the Rakabganj area of Lucknow, also decided to head back as he had run out of money and had not received any help from the government for five days.

Police monitor

At Charbagh the bus station, U.P. DGP Hitesh Chandra Awasthi, who was personally monitoring the boarding of buses amid precautions, said the police was trying to prevent an accumulation of the travellers at the boarding places and trying to send them off as quickly as possible.

Raj Shekhar, official in-charge of the U.P. State Road Transport Corporation, said about 200 buses were deployed to transport people stuck at various points in the district bordering Delhi to their destinations. The task would continue on Sunday, he said, adding that the details of the buses were being noted down at the starting points.

It was not officially clear how many buses the government had deployed across U.P. but the State’s publicity team said in a statement that it was using as many as 1,000 vehicles.

Mr. Adityanath had instructed officials to note the names, addresses and phone numbers of the estimated 1 lakh people who had entered U.P. from other States over the last three days. All these people should be kept under surveillance and compulsory quarantine, the government said in a statement quoting the CM.

267,2020/03/29,"Coronavirus lockdown | Ration shops are closed in Maharashtra, says AAP","Party volunteers inspect PDS outlets in different cities

Maharashtra unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday alleged that many ration shops, inspected by the party across different cities, were closed and not distributing supplies to the poor and needy. The party claimed that it inspected ration shops across Pune, Nashik, Aurangabad and found them closed. It has asked the State government to ensure functioning of the PDS system

Since the nationwide lockdown, which began earlier this week on March 25, to tackle the novel coronavirus outbreak, the State government has announced that every person in need will be provided three months’ ration for subsistence. “To ensure that the distribution of rations is smooth, the AAP volunteers went on a quick inspection of ration shops across a few cities. We found that a vast majority of the ration shops are closed, and even those that were open were short on supply,” said Dhananjay Shinde, State unit secretary, AAP.

Mr. Shinde said cities like Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Aurangabad, Nagpur, and Pimpri Chinchwad have a substantial population of migrant labourers and daily wage workers, who are the worst hit due to the lockdown. “It is imperative that ration shops remain open,” he said.

Among the localities inspected by the AAP volunteers include Nashik (Kothe Galli, Panchavati), Pimpri Chinchwad (Akurdi, Pimpri), Pune (Hadapsar, Bhekrai Nagar- Phursungi), Aurangabad (Gulmohor colony, Bhadkal Gate, Jyoti nagar, Satara Parisar, TV Center, Garkheda, Shivaji Nagar), Latur (Manjri villege, Tandulja), Nagpur (Reshim Bag, Medical Chowk, Mahal & Itavari).

The party said that the Delhi government is providing food proactively for four lakh people who are in distress through Delhi Urban Shelter Board and 525 food and relief centres including night shelters and requisitioned schools.

“We therefore urgently request the Maharashtra government to make supplies available at all ration shops across both urban and rural areas and ensure that these shops are actually open. We are a responsible party and are with the government to ensure that we emerge unscathed from this difficult time. We are committed to constructive cooperation at all times, just like our government in Delhi,” said Preeti Sharma Menon, National Executive Member, AAP.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gzxx76/article31195607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BMPUNEMARKET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ration-shops-are-closed-says-aap/article31195608.ece
268,2020/03/29,7-month-old baby in Mumbai tests positive,"A seven-month-old baby was among the 33 people who tested positive for COVID-19 in the State, taking the total count of cases to 186 on Saturday. Mumbai once again recorded the highest jump with 22 positive cases in a day. At least five patients in the State remain in critical condition.

According to civic officials, the baby is admitted at HBT Trauma Care Hospital, Jogeshwari. “The baby’s mother has a travel history to Saudi Aradia and tested positive two days ago. The baby was admitted to hospital on Saturday after the tests results. Samples of six of their contacts have been sent for testing,” said a civic official adding that contact tracing has been carried out in two wards as the mother and child had spent a few days in Byculla and Bandra east. Officials said that sanitisation activities were carried out in the government colony area in Bandra east.

As many as 323 patients are currently in hospital in the State of whom 104 are completely asymptomatic even as they have tested positive. As on Saturday, 26 patients have been discharged from isolation facilities after recovery.

Four of the patients who tested positive in Mumbai on Saturday have an international travel history while the remaining are contacts of patients who had tested positive earlier. The others include four from Pune, two from Nagpur, four from Palghar, Vasai-Virar and Navi Mumbai region, and one from Jalgaon.

The civic body on Saturday also confirmed the death of the 85-year-old surgeon from South Mumbai due to COVID-19. With this addition, the State’s death toll is now six. The deceased’s son, a cardiac surgeon and his grandson who had returned from the UK who also tested positive, are admitted at the Hinduja Hospital. The case has sparked a debate on whether the family of doctors could have taken more safety measures. On Saturday, a few staff members from the Saifee Hospital tested negative while some more reports were pending.

Asked about challenges facing BMC, Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), said, “The biggest challenge is when educated people behave in an irresponsible manner. We are carrying out counselling in slums but learned people are behaving this way.” Elaborating on latest measures being taken by BMC to contain the spread, he said, “We have now undertaken rigorous disinfection of slums and within a week will cover every slum.”

270,2020/03/29,"Youth dies in Maharashtra's Melghat as doctors suspect COVID-19, shunt him from one hospital to another","25-year-old Migrant worker had rheumatic heart disease; could have been treated in Melghat; lack of testing facilities in tribal area is a concern.

In a recent case of panic brought on by the lack of testing facilities in Melghat, a tribal area in Amravati district, a 25-year-old labourer who had symptoms similar to COVID-19 was shunted from one hospital to another, before he died in Amravati. Tests showed he did not have COVID-19 but had died of complications resulting from rheumatic heart disease, which could have been treated in Melghat.

The case has brought into tragic focus the urgent need for testing facilities in the rural areas, especially those that have migrant labourers who work in big cities.

Distress signs

Ajay Tamhane (name changed to protect identity), a daily-wage worker, came home to Zatal village, Melghat, in February, from his work site in an Odisha coal mine. A month later, he reported cough, cold and high fever, and complained of chest pain. On March 21, his brother took him to the Sub District Hospital (SDH) in Dharni, where he was put on pain-killers and intravenous fluids, and then discharged.

But by the next day, his condition turned critical: he had developed severe cough with hemoptysis (nose bleeding), cold, fever and breathing difficulty. News of coronavirus had reached his village by the time, and his brother took him back to the SDH.

The medical officer suspected that Tamhane had COVID-19 symptoms as he was struggling to breathe, and the oxygen level in his blood had dropped to 50% (95% is normal). The nearest referral centre with testing facilities was in Amravati, 150 km and four-and-a-half hours away. But as his condition was worsening rapidly, doctors at SDH referred him to the local MAHAN Trust Mahatma Gandhi Tribal Hospital (MGTH), a charitable hospital, and the only one in the area with an internal medicine physician, apart from other specialists and an intensive cardiac care unit (ICCU).

There, despite being put on a ventilator, his oxygen levels did not improve, and his respiratory distress seemed to be increasing.

The doctors took his travel history, and decided to refer him for coronavirus. Government rules mandate that suspected cases with respiratory distress should be referred to the designated district hospital in Amravati. Though, the patient’s oxygen levels increased to 70% and he was feeling better, the doctors called for a government ambulance and shifted him there.

At Amravati, Tamhane was put in an isolation ward, but he died the next day. His COVID-19 test was negative.

Need for testing facilities

At Melghat, doctors had been monitoring Tamhane constantly. His ECG indicated he had rheumatic heart disease with heart valve issues. He also had pulmonary oedema (swelling) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The ventilator support at Melghat had subsided his pulmonary oedema and ARDS and his oxygen levels had hit 96%.

“If his corona-negative status could have been diagnosed in Melghat, he would have received ICCU care in Amravati and could have been saved,” said Dr. Vipin Khadse, medical officer at the SDH, nodal officer for COVID-19 in Melghat, and volunteer doctor at the MAHAN Trust. “He was stable in our setup but according to the government mandate, every ARDS patient has to be sent for coronavirus testing. If coronavirus cases do indeed come to Melghat and, let’s say, we get a hundred patients a day, who can we refer them to?”

Hard times

Dr. Ashish Satav, chief medical officer at MGTH, and one of the doctors who attended to Tamhane, said villages in Melghat — which has a population of 3 lakh, 84% of whom are tribals — are congested, and homes are often small, without ventilation. Poor hygiene is another issue, leading to increasing cases of rheumatic heart disease in young people. Dr. Khadse said, “People here often don’t clean themselves well after defecation. Streptococci bacteria migrate to the throat, and their colonies move through the blood to the heart.”

In his 22 years at Melghat hospital, Dr. Satav said he has handled over 3,000 critical cases. Heart attacks are common among the tribals and “over 60% of deaths are due to infectious diseases here,” he said.

Dr. Satav said doctors are reluctant to take up posting in Melghat due to poor living facilities. Of the three hospitals in the area, few have expert physicians or trained staff, while one, run by an NGO is non-functional, with doctors being called back for coronavirus duty.

The trust’s 30-bed hospital has received five cases of respiratory distress in as many days, two of whom have been sent to Amravati for testing.

Getting there isn’t easy either, especially for the poorer residents. “These are tribals who earn ₹4,000 to ₹5,000 a month. They have to negotiate forests and mountains to travel outside for treatment and prefer to be treated locally,” said Dr. Satav. “Even if the government does put money into their account, they have no idea how to operate those accounts; they are not literate. I have patients coming to me with ₹1 or ₹2 in their pocket, and it’s difficult to convince them to go to Amravati for testing.”

An added problem is that the two government ambulances do not make return trips from Amravati, and patients’ relatives have to spend up to ₹10,000 to hire private ones.

Yashomati Thakur, State Women and Child Development Minister and Guardian Minister for Amravati, and the principal secretary, Health, did not comment on the issue.

Bleak future

As nodal officer for coronavirus, Dr. Khadse is tasked with looking out for COVID-19-positive cases, in the area, conduct a surveillance of migrants from cities like Pune and Mumbai, trace their contacts, isolate them, and follow up with the home-quarantined.

“We need testing facilities here,” said Dr. Satav. “A PCR machine to test for coronavirus costs ₹20 lakh, which hospitals in the area cannot afford.” There have been no cases detected in Melghat yet. If there are, for Dr. Satav and his colleagues the future will be a hard trial.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/qx2azr/article31195514.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BM-MAHAN-hospital,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/melghat-youth-dies-as-doctors-suspect-covid-19-shunt-him-from-one-hospital-to-another/article31195515.ece

272,2020/03/29,"Indian Premier League | The day you wish it was, and isn't","When the IPL didn’t start and Dhoni didn't take strike

In an ideal world, crowds in Mumbai would have trudged out of a busy Churchgate station, mostly in Blues, with a liberal sprinkling of canary yellow among them making their presence felt.

But this was not an ideal Sunday, as it’s not an ideal world. It’s the COVID-19 world where life doesn’t have life anymore as people struggle for existence.

There wasn’t be any IPL at 8 p.m., there wasn’t a Mahendra Singh Dhoni ambling across the Wankhede turf with a disarming smile, and Rohit Sharma wasn’t pulling a fast bowler with nonchalance.

What would have been...

This IPL would have been Dhoni’s comeback tournament after eight and a half months. He would have again led the side, face giving away nothing but unbridled joy when Chennai Super Kings does something.

This would, perhaps, have been the last year with CSK’s ‘Dad’s Army’ — with a lot of players like Suresh Raina, Harbhajan Singh, Shane Watson unlikely to feature in yellow next year.

This was probably Dhoni’s chance to get back into the groove and show the world why Rishabh Pant and KL Rahul can still be asked to wait for one more global tournament.

If the IPL doesn’t happen, and the World T20 is held this year (subject to normalcy), will we see Dhoni in India blues again? His fans may not like it, but likes of Sunil Gavaskar, Virender Sehwag and Kapil Dev believe he won't — not without reason.

You will miss Virat Kohli’s agony and ecstasy with the Royal Challengers Bangalore.

The capacity crowd at Eden Gardens would have shouted their lungs out. Some for the players, and some for Shah Rukh Khan sitting on the lower tier of the Club House balcony.

Airborne David Warner’s fist pumps can’t be enjoyed with Paradise’s famous biryani, and Hyderabad’s own double ka meetha.

We probably won’t get to know how good Anil Kumble’s third stint as a mentor/coach (after MI and India) would have been, with a passionate owner like Preity Zinta watching every Kings XI Punjab performance.

Pant, on his part, would have liked to rock the IPL stage — something that he had made his own in past few years, with those audacious hook shots even when he is off balance.

How well would have Steve Smith captained Rajasthan Royals? Good enough to force Cricket Australia selectors to hand back the captaincy to him from Aaron Finch? We might never know.

273,2020/03/29,Cricket last thing on my mind at the moment: Shastri,"Advocates cultivating fighting spirit to overcome any adversity

“Stay indoors people. Crucial phase this. Only thing flying around the world like a tracer bullet is this bloody Corona (COVID-19). Stay in before the bugger gets you #IndiaFightsCorona.” A tweet typical of the man!

Speaking to The Hindu from his home in Mumbai, India cricket coach Ravi Shastri said, “there is total gloom at the moment. The thing (virus) is flying everywhere. It would be foolish to talk about cricket in these times. It should be the last thing on your mind at the moment. Safety of the people is most important. Whatever precautions have to be taken should get priority. As said in no uncertain terms by the Prime Minister. We need to understand the gravity of the situation.”

Known for his positive approach in cricket, Shastri said, “You have to be pretty aggressive in your thinking that you can do the job. Failure is the last thing in my mind. Don’t think of failure, think instead ‘I’m going to do it!’ That’s the mindset that allows you to do what you want to do, what you can do.”

He recalled some challenging moments from his career to drive home the point. “The phase between 1982 and 1983, when I got a hundred in Pakistan (Karachi, 1983), and then on to 1992, I did literary everything. Went from No. 10 to No. 1 in the batting line-up. Batted in the top three. Got wickets. Tasted success with the 1983 World Cup, 1985 WCC, 1985 Rothmans Cup, Asia Cup. All because I remained positive. Playing with SMG (Gavaskar) and Jimmy (Mohinder Amarnath), I was like a sponge. Absorbing what I saw and heard. Keeping ears and eyes wide open,” Shastri said.

Fighting fire

Shastri, who was never ever struck on the head during his career, also remembered some frightening spells. “The spell in Antigua (in 1983). Dilip (Vengsarkar) and Malcolm (Marshall) were having a few exchanges just before the second new ball, towards the end of the day’s play. Marshall was spitting fire. He hit Dilip on the helmet. I remember the helmet rolling almost to wicketkeeper Jeff Dujon. Marshall got him hooking. I was the non-striker. Marshall gave it everything,” recalled Shastri.

On India’s recent loss in New Zealand, Shastri was candid. “It was a cycle (of so much cricket). It was decided four years ago. We left India on May 23 and finished on March 20. Most of the boys were home for just 15 days during 10 months. There was so much that we went through. You could see towards the end — injuries, mental fatigue, but they hung in despite missing some key players. It was hard but the guys bit the bullet and soldiered on.”

Expanding the mind

Catching up on lots of things at home now, Shastri counselled, “It’s a good opportunity to expand your mindset. Read a lot, try different things. Basically, slow down the pace of your life. I have not had a break for 40 years. During this fight against the virus, I am not going to be negative. I know India as a nation will beat this Corona. We have to be together in supporting the government,” he said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/l0o3zj/article31200195.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30RAVI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/cricket-last-thing-on-my-mind-at-the-moment-shastri/article31200197.ece
274,2020/03/29,Smith’s leadership ban ends,"The master batsman is free to be Australia skipper again

A two-year leadership ban slapped on Steve Smith after the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa ended on Sunday, leaving the master batsman free to skipper Australia again.

The 30-year-old captained the team until he was suspended for 12 months over a brazen attempt to alter the ball with sandpaper under his watch during a Test in Cape Town in 2018.

Part of his punishment included a further year-long exile from any leadership role, which has now expired. Co-conspirator and former vice-captain David Warner was banned from any leadership role for life.

Not clear

There have been calls for Smith to take over the Test reins from Tim Paine, but it remains unclear whether he wants to, with the 35-year-old batsman seemingly intent on playing on.

Coach Justin Langer last year praised Paine's leadership as “brilliant” and said Smith may not want the “burden” of captaincy on top of batting pressures.

Aaron Finch is the skipper of the T20 and ODI teams.

Focus on staying fit

Smith told Channel Nine television he was focused only on trying to stay physically and mentally fit during the coronavirus shutdown of Australian cricket.

He was supposed to be preparing for a big-money payday at IPL, but the tournament has already been delayed until April 15 in response to the pandemic.

“I am going to use this time to focus on my fitness, sharpen my skills for county cricket as well as for the Australia tour in late 2020,” Vihari, who was part of India’s last tour of New Zealand, was quoted as saying by ‘ESPNcricinfo’.

Though there is a lot of uncertainty over when sport will resume, the middle-order batsman said he has has his “fingers crossed”.

Fingers crossed

“Mentally I am trying hard to keep myself positive and busy. My challenge is: there is no cricket for the next three to four months.

“I do have a summer to look forward to having signed with a team in the English County Championship, where my contract starts from late August. Fingers crossed about that.”

Vihari added that this forced break will ensure he is home for his first marriage anniversary, which might not have been the case otherwise thanks to a busy cricket calendar.

“One good thing that will come out of this break is: I will able to celebrate my first wedding anniversary with my wife on May 19.

“In normal circumstances I might have been busy with cricket. So at least one person is not complaining too much!”

2005 Ashes

With nothing much to do at home, he said he has been repeatedly watching clippings of the 2005 Ashes.

“A few days into this enforced break because of the pandemic, I have begun to realise all the implications: I cannot go out, meet friends or do anything, pretty much. But that is the need of the hour — you have to isolate yourself and make sure things settle down.

“I know boredom will set in easily, but I have a solution for that: watching the 2005 Ashes on video. It is my favourite. I have lost count of how many times I have watched it. Also, I have been planning on taking up yoga. It’s something I have thought of doing for a year, in fact.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/u1769v/article31200069.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30VIHARI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/using-break-to-sharpen-skills-vihari/article31200070.ece
276,2020/03/29,Virus outbreak stands in front of Yashasvi’s dreams,"The teenager had started preparing for his maiden IPL for Royals

Yashasvi Jaiswal is used to hardships. He has lived in a tent, did odd jobs and even sold pani puri for a living. The 21-day lockdown in India due to the Coronavirus pandemic may not be as tough as the thought of not playing the Indian Premier League.

The teenager had a splendid ICC U-19 World Cup in South Africa and he had started preparing for his maiden IPL for Rajasthan Royals but the Covid-19 outbreak stands in front of his dreams.

Safety is important

Hailing from Mumbai, which has recorded five deaths so far due to the virus, it may take a long time for Jaiswal — bought by Royals for ₹2.40 crore — to hit the nets. “This is the situation now and I have to deal with it. IPL would be ideal for me, but as of now it is important to remain safe. I want to improve my game in these times.

“I am very motivated. Cricket is my dream and I will keep pursuing it till the day I can. In life, you won’t get what you should get every time,” Jaiswal told Sportstar.

Warm welcome at Royals

The closest that the left-hander could get to the cash-rich league was the Royals’ camp in Nagpur earlier this month. “It was a great feeling to be in the camp. The Royals’ family really gave me a warm welcome. It was great to meet Zubin Bharucha [Head of Cricket at Royals].

“I had good practice sessions. IPL is all about playing in different conditions and on different wickets. Zubin Sir told me a lot of things,” said Jaiswal, the leading run-scorer (400 runs) at the Colts’ World Cup.

Not complacent

However, he is not complacent. Life hasn’t changed much post the showpiece event. “I got a good start in U-19, but now I have to keep working to do even better so that I can play at the highest level.

“I am doing whatever I can do at home. I am doing my fitness drills and I am trying to remain spirited by constantly talking to my coach, Jwala Singh. Now I have time to play with my little sister, which is a great thing.” he added.

As of now, Jaiswal’s worry lies in buying essentials. “It is really difficult for all of us to get food essentials. Nobody wants to take the risk because anyone can catch the virus.”

IPL is doubtful but Jaiswal’s intent is clear. He may have already started visualising the Jasprit Bumrah yorkers, tackling them in his head.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/lmdxl8/article31200155.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30YASH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/virus-outbreak-stands-in-front-of-yashasvis-dreams/article31198918.ece
277,2020/03/29,Laxman’s 281 among Ian Chappell’s all-time great knocks against spin,"The former Australian captain also remembered Australian batsman Doug Walters’ sublime hundred on a Madras ‘minefield’ in 1969

Former Australia captain Ian Chappell has picked his two all-time favourite innings against high-quality spin bowling and one of those is VVS Laxman’s iconic 281 at the Eden Gardens in 2001.

Thanks to Laxman and Rahul Dravid (180), India went on to win the game against Australia after following-on.

“The absence of any cricket (due to the COVID-19 pandemic) gives me an opportunity to reflect on an aspect of the game I enjoy: watching a batsman utilise good footwork to combat top-class spin bowling. Two innings stand out: one played by India’s VVS Laxman, the other by Doug Walters of Australia,” Chappell wrote in a column for ESPNcricinfo.

Laxman and Dravid shared a marathon 376-run stand to engineer an unforgettable win for India. Chappell was simply in awe of Laxman’s batting as the wristy Indian batsman toyed with the likes of Shane Warne.

“Laxman’s incredible 281 at Calcutta in 2001 is the best I’ve seen against top-class leg-spin. At the conclusion of that exhilarating series I asked Shane Warne how he thought he bowled.

“I don’t think I bowled that badly,” he replied. “You didn’t,” I responded.

“If Laxman comes three paces out of his crease and hits an unbelievable on-drive against the spin and you then flight the next delivery a little higher and shorter to invite another drive and instead he quickly goes onto the back foot and pulls it, that’s not bad bowling. That’s good footwork.

“Laxman regularly did this during his 452-ball stay, in which he hit 44 boundaries. Therein lies a clue to Laxman’s success: he consistently hit the ball along the ground,” said Chappell, also praising Laxman’s temperament.

A Madras minefield

Talking about fellow Australian Walters, Chappell called him the best player against spin.

“Walters scored a Test century in a session three times. There are no complete records regarding this feat but I suspect only Sir Donald Bradman did it more often.

“Walters was the best player of off-spin bowling I have seen; he didn’t just survive against the very best, he occasionally battered them into submission. He scored a sublime hundred on a Madras minefield in 1969, facing the off-spin wizardry of Erapalli Prasanna, clubbing 14 fours and two sixes in the process,” said Chappell.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/htw9z2/article31198254.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VVS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/laxmans-281-among-ian-chappells-all-time-great-knocks-against-spin/article31198255.ece

279,2020/03/29,This battle can be won only by staying indoors: Pujara,"‘We have a responsibility to look after our country and family’

Even as the novel coronavirus continues to cripple major sporting events across the world, India’s Test batsman Cheteshwar Pujara has called on fans to rally around each other.

“These are tough times, not just for our nation but the entire world. The only way we can fight this pandemic is by staying indoors,” Pujara told Sportstar.

“It can be frustrating at times. There will be days when you’ll have to resist the urge to go out for a casual stroll, but we have a responsibility to look after our country and family and the best way to do it is by remaining in self-isolation at home,” he added.

Relaxed routine

Pujara is using the downtime to enjoy a relaxed routine at home with his young daughter. “It’s a welcome change for me,” he said.

“I like spending time with myself, reading a book or watching TV. That said, I’ve a young daughter who is so energetic and wants to play all the time, so half my day goes into taking care of her. I’m also helping my wife Puja with the daily chores.”

Pujara reminded that sport needs to take a backseat for now.

“I feel sport really has the power to bring people together but now is not the time for fans to throng stadiums in support of their teams and players,” he said.

“Yes, you still need to stick together but with your family, in your own homes.

“In the aftermath of a crisis such as this, I feel the biggest fight is going to be the one to be indoors.

“For a sportsman, the fight is out on the field; for a soldier, it’s the war front, but this particular battle can only be won by staying indoors.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/j1qip5/article31194551.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29PUJARA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/this-battle-can-be-won-only-by-staying-indoors-pujara/article31194552.ece
280,2020/03/29,Micro lab in Krishnagiri GH closed on Sunday,"Patient’s swab sample could not be tested

The micro lab at the Krishnagiri Government Headquarters Hospital was closed on Sunday delaying the testing of swab sample of a patient, who was admitted to the COVID-19 isolation ward a day earlier.

A 40-year-old housemaid from Bengaluru was admitted with all but one of the symptoms (fever) of novel coronavirus infection and the duty doctor had recommended testing of her swab sample. She was brought to the hospital by her son on Saturday evening.

According to her son, four days ago, she was taken to a government health centre near his house in Bengaluru for diarrhoea, chest pain, and difficult breathing. They was given tablets but did not recover. He then took her to a private hospital, where an X-ray showed chest phlegm. The private hospital had referred her to a government hospital in Bengaluru requesting “for throat swab for COVID-19.”

However, upon his widowed mother’s insistence he brought her by road to Krishnagiri, her maternal town. She was admitted on Saturday night.

But the swab test could not be done on Sunday as the micro-lab functioning with two technicians was closed.

A medical staff attending to the patient at the isolation ward said, “There are varying symptoms, some may have loose motions, vomiting, fever, throat pain, breathlessness. We’ve been asked to screen, wherever there are 90% of symptoms,” she said.

“The duty doctor who checked in the morning said, Amma’s sugar is very high and BP low. She said, the swab test will be done tomorrow (Monday), when the lab opens,” said the son.

At the GH, the patient was referred to by the sanitation staff as “corona patient” alluding to a doctor’s warning to the hospital staff.

According to Paramasivam, Joint Director, Health, the swabs will be collected and tested both for TB, locally and sent to Salem for COVID-19 on Monday. Asked about the micro lab being closed on Sundays especially now during a pandemic, Govindan, Deputy Director of Health said,

“They are also humans.

P. Rajakumar, Revenue Divisional Officer, Gudalur, said that a team of officials had visited two tribal villages near Thorapalli bordering the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) on Saturday, and distributed rice, pulses, oil and essential commodities to the people living there.

He said that the revenue department was identifying villages where people cannot travel to the towns to buy produce due to the lack of public transport and imposition of prohibitory orders.

On Sunday, teams from the revenue department visited Kanjikolly, Kozhikandi and Srimadurai in Gudalur, and handed over food and supplies to the tribal communities residing there.

Meanwhile, teams from Udhagamandalam visited Anaikatty, Siriyur and Chokkanalli tribal villages in the MTR buffer zone on Saturday evening.

However, many tribal villages still have not been reached by the district administration.

In one such village, Chinna Kurumbadi near Burliar, around 15 km. from the nearest town of Coonoor, residents said that they were unable to leave their villages as there were no buses plying from their village to Coonoor.

286,2020/03/29,Coimbatore Corporation cleans streets using airport’s machine,"Starting Saturday, the Coimbatore Corporation has been cleaning city’s streets using a new tractor-mounted machine, thanks to the Coimbatore airport management.

Sources in the civic body said that the airport management had on Saturday lent the machine which it was using to spray disinfectants on city streets, starting with areas where it had quarantined people. The machine had the capacity to hold around 250 litre.

The Corporation used disinfectant at 20-to-one ratio – a litre of disinfectant for every 20 litre of water in the tank. A motor attached to the tank pushes down the liquid through nozzles attached to a 21-foot horizontal rod.

The sources said that the length of the rod helped the Corporation spray long and wide roads within a short time as the tractor driver would have to just drive the vehicle.

On smaller roads too, the Corporation used the machine as it just had to fold the ends of the horizontal rod.

The rod was in three pieces of seven foot each. And as the nozzle mouths were adjustable, the Corporation could also used the machine to spray the disinfectant for a height of a foot or two – either on compound walls or gates.

The sources said the airport management had not stopped with just giving the vehicle. It had fuelled the vehicle on the first day and sent its driver to help the Corporation as well. And, the airport management had asked the Corporation to use the vehicle as long as it wanted because it was of little use under the current circumstances. The airport management used the vehicle to spray weedicide to control the growth of grass, the sources added.

On Saturday, the Corporation used the vehicle in East Zone and on Sunday in West Zone.

287,2020/03/29,"Personal distancing takes a back seat as people throng markets, meat stalls","Collector urges the public not to venture out to busy places like market unnecessarily

The call for personal distancing and efforts to enforce the 21-day national lockdown to combat COVID-19 took a back seat on Sunday as people thronged in large numbers at vegetable, fish markets and meat stalls in the city.

Though policemen were posted at most of the markets, the rush in the morning was beyond control.

Uzhavar Santhais at R.S. Puram, Singanallur, Mettupalayam and Sulur, and the vegetable market at Somanur witnessed rush on Sunday morning.

The police used hand-held public addressing system to advise people to maintain queue and proper distance while purchasing vegetables at R.S Puram Uzhavar Santhai.

A vendor from the market said that people were reluctant in maintaining queue and one metre distance in the absence of the police.

Meat stalls also witnessed rush in the morning. The police and staff of the Coimbatore Corporation made announcements to maintain personal distancing.

While the wholesale fish market at Ukkadam witnessed moderate rush, limited space and shortage of arrival of fish led to crowding in front of fish stalls at the retail market on Ukkdam-Perur bypass.

Majority of the crowd found in markets and meat stalls were of two persons from the same household, like husband-wife duo, which could have been avoided in the time of a pandemic, according to the police.

“Many people seemed to have come out to get rid of boredom of being confined to their houses,” said a police officer at the temporary vegetable market at Gandhipuram town bus stand.

District Collector K. Rajamani urged the public not to venture out to busy places like market unnecessarily just to get kill boredom.

“District administration is taking all efforts to avoid crowding in markets. People are expected to come out only for essential services and commodities,” he said.

Temporary vegetable markets at Gandhipuram, Ukkadam and Mettupalayam road bus stands were started to increase availability of vegetables and reduce the crowd pull in shops.

The prices of vegetables had sky-rocketed on Sunday.

“The vendors were quoting any rate they could,” said Samy, who had gone to the Mettupalayam Road bus stand to purchase vegetables. The quality of many of the vegetables was also not good, he said.

It was not just vegetables, but prices of meat, chicken and eggs also shot up here on Sunday. While the retail price of chicken went up to ₹ 180 a kg, that of meat was nearly ₹ 800.

An official with the Health Department said that the doctor’s husband was in quarantine at a Government Hospital at Palakkad in Kerala. Her eldest son, two-year-old, was also under observation. The doctor joined the Railway Hospital, Podanur, on March 23 after she was relieved from the Railway Hospital in Erode on March 20.

289,2020/03/29,"Amma Unavagam to the rescue of daily wagers, homeless","The head of the self-help group that runs the Amma Unavagam says since Wednesday morning, the Corporation has asked the groups that run the eight canteens to increase the quantity of food served.

P. Kannan, a native of Sowripalayam, is one among the small crowd waiting outside the budget canteen, Amma Unavagam, near the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital.

He will have to wait for a while till the clock strikes noon to have his lunch. It is his only source of food in the city, which is under lockdown as part of the effort to combat the spread of COVID-19 virus.

“This is where I’ve come to have food because every other restaurant or eatery is closed, including the place where I used to work,” says the casual labourer who usually works in kitchen.

Sixty-seven-year-old Saibaba Colony resident Anwar Basha too waits for the shutter to open. The widower who stays alone usually has his lunch at the Amma Unavagam. And, on Wednesday, too he made it to the place.

“What if there’s no bus. I walked all the way to have lunch here as I usually do.”

For persons like S. Dhanasekar of Thoothukudi the Coimbatore Corporation’s decision to keep open the budget canteens has come as relief. “I’m stuck here since Tuesday evening as inter-district bus service is stopped. I wanted to make it home from Mettupalayam, where I was on an errand, before the lockdown but could not.”

With none to turn to in the district, he spent the night at a bus stand and used public convenience facility to refresh. “The decision to keep open the canteen is good for two reasons – one that it is a source of food and, two, at an affordable cost.”

Kannan’s friend J. Kumar, also a daily wager who sleeps at work place, says he wants the administration to provide food to the homeless. “If the collector takes homeless persons like me to a hall or some place and provide food, he can completely enforce lockdown. This will prevent persons like me from walking on streets for food and stop people from dying of hunger.”

The head of the self-help group that runs the Amma Unavagam says since Wednesday morning, the Corporation has asked the groups that run the eight canteens to increase the quantity of food served.

Increased demand

Usually the canteens cook 1,200 idlis for breakfast for 300 persons at four a person. It is now 1,900 to 2,000 idlis depending on the canteen.

Likewise, the quantity of food cooked for lunch has increased. And, a part of the food cooked in excess is for the Corporation’s conservancy workers, the head adds.

A Corporation officer says the civic body has asked the groups managing the canteens to take a call on providing dinner as well depending on the number of persons waiting. The budget canteens do not usually serve dinner but given the unprecedented circumstances, the civic body has asked them to.

290,2020/03/29,Mahabali keeps his word,"When Lord Mahavishnu took the Vamana avatara and asked Mahabali for land as daana, Mahabali’s guru Sukracharya saw through the Lord’s disguise. The Lord wanted land to be measured with three steps of His feet. But Sukracharya could guess that there was trouble ahead for Mahabali. As a guru, it was his duty to warn the king. Kamban in his Ramayana records the warnings of Sukracharya in a beautiful verse.

Sukracharya tells Mahabali not to trust Vamana. He may be short, but He was the One who kept the universe in His stomach during the deluge, says Sukracharya. He warns Mahabali that if he gives what Vamana wants, he will eventually be left with nothing. If Mahabali were to abide by Sukracharya’s advice, he would have to break his promise to Vamana, and he would be guilty of lying. The Sastras suggest that a lie is justified under certain circumstances, elaborated M.A. Venkatakrishnan, in a discourse. If a man’s life is in danger, it is all right to tell a lie to save himself. If a man’s earnings are under threat, he can tell a lie to save his property. If the life of a devotee of the Lord is in danger, he can tell a lie. Sukracharya knew that Mahabali would lose everything he possessed, if he heeded Vamana’s request. So, to break his word would be a permissible lie.

As against all this, however, the Sastras also say it is a sin to stop a man from giving to another. If a man stops another’s daana, his entire family will suffer without food. Mahabali pointed this out to Sukracharya and picked up the vessel of water, for the daana would be complete only with the pouring of water. Sukracharya took the form of a bee and blocked the spout of the vessel. The Lord pricked one of his eyes with a blade of grass.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/mahabali-keeps-his-word/article31200034.ece

The National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) on Sunday appealed to landowners to waive three-month rent and work on a moderate revenue-share model for the following six months until businesses regain lost foothold.

With the lockdown in place due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the restaurant industry has been battling for survival as the fixed operating expenses of an eatery is very high, the body said.

“We are also mindful that post the lockdown, it will take us several months to become sustainable again. To achieve the twin objectives, we need to bring down our fixed operating costs and its ratio; there is no other way and the biggest components of these fixed operating costs are Rentals and Manpower expenses,” the association added.

The police on Sunday registered an FIR in a case where a fake Unified Payments Interface (UPI) address was found registered under the name of “PM Care Fund”, said an officer.

An officer said they received an online complaint about a UPI address “Pmcare@sbi”. The ID was created to receive donations and the matter was then raised with State Bank of India following which they blocked it immediately, he said, adding that the correct UPI ID is “PMCARES@SBI”.

Mr. Kumar demanded that the Kejriwal government start free testing for COVID-19 in hospitals and mohalla clinics run by Delhi government.

296,2020/03/29,Khari Baoli migrant workers head home,"Uncertainty forces them to take step

A large number of migrant workers living in Khari Baoli — Asia’s largest wholesale spice market — have left for their home town as the shops which employed them are shut due to the 21-day lockdown over the COVID-19 pandemic.

While some complained that they faced pacaucity of food and other essential items following the closure of shops in the area, others said they were heading home due to the uncertainity over the lockdown.

Akhilesh Yaday, a resident of Muzaffarpur in Bihar, had already boarded a bus at Anand Vihar terminal when conacted over the phone. “I came with five to seven others to Anand Vihar yesterday. We spent the night here, and today, we have been able to find a bus,” he said.

Getting ration

Mr. Yadav said he and others worked as shop assistant at Khari Baoli. “We faced some difficulty getting ration as shops were closed, but we managed to find some,” he said.

Another group of migrant workers, who were also making their living working as shop assistant in Khari Baoli, found themselves stuck at Azadpur Sabji Mandi here. “We heard that there will be trucks to take us to our homes in Muzaffarpur in Bihar. But there are none here,” said Sashi Kumar.

Mr. Kumar said he along with seven others had walked on foot till the Sabzi Mandi. “We have no work at Khari Baoli. We don’t want to go back, but what can be done,” he said.

297,2020/03/29,Govt.’s free food facility not found in 2 schools,"Several migrant workers in the city remain unaware of the initiative

Even two days after Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that the government had started distributing free food at 325 government-run schools to those affected by the lockdown, The Hindu found no such initiative in place at two of the three such schools it visited.

Also, several migrant workers remain unaware of the initiative.

Govt. to update list

Notably, these two schools were on the list that was posted in a tweet on Saturday by the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO). On being asked about the issue, a Delhi government official said: “The list is being fine-tuned according to the needs and we will update the list shortly.”

Around a dozen migrants said they did not get any food from any government-run facilities and were unaware of the locations. Kamlesh, a migrant worker, who was not allowed by the police to go to his village in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday, said: “If I knew about getting food here, then why would we go?”

At the two schools, lines and circles were drawn on the floor for social distancing during distribution. At the SDMC-run primary school in RK Puram’s Sector 3, an official said: “The lines were drawn on the floor around three days back, but the food never arrived.”

At the SDMC-run primary school in RK Puram Sector 12, the gate was locked and officials said they might get food from Monday.

Anjali Bhardwaj, co-convener of National Campaign for Peoples’ Right to Information, said information should be put out in the most accessible way to the poor.

“It is a humanitarian crisis and it is a matter of life and death. The government can’t deal with it like business as usual and put out information just via television and social media. During elections, the political parties go out and campaign in different ways. The government should make announcements about the free food and their locations in the slums and on the roads. They should also paste posters everywhere,” Ms. Bhardwaj said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/q7mv9a/article31203021.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29DELPRIYASHELTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/govts-free-food-facility-not-found-in-2-schools/article31201378.ece

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday appealed to migrant workers trying to return to their villages to remain in Delhi and assured them that his government has made all necessary arrangements for their food and shelter.

“We have emptied classrooms and put mattresses on the floor and will even provide accommodation at stadiums if the need arises. But now, despite several appeals, these classrooms are lying empty,” he said, adding that “stay where you are” is the mantra of the lockdown and that we would fail as a county if we do not follow it.

Risking lives

He told migrant workers that so far, COVID-19 has not spread to the villages and warned them that if they head home, they would not only put their lives at risk but also of their family members.

“Yesterday [Saturday] there were large crowds at Anand Vihar Bus depot...even if one or two persons in that crowd had the virus, all those present there would be in danger. We asked people that there were three schools nearby where they could take shelter but they were adamant to leave the city,” Mr. Kejriwal added.

He said the government has made arrangements to provide free food to four lakh people daily as well as distribute 50% extra ration for free to ensure that nobody is hungry. He also appealed to people who are financially well-to-do to ensure that others do not stay hungry.

‘Rise above politics’

He requested landlordsnot to charge money from their tenants if they were unable to pay rent.

“This is the time for humanity. Our entire life we spend earning money and fame but none of this will matter when we die. What will matter is what we have done for others. We must all help each other,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

He added that it was not the time to indulge in politics but for all parties to work together for people before the country reaches a situation like the one in Italy or the U.S. where thousands of COVID-19 cases have been reported.

301,2020/03/29,Cab driver finds it difficult to sustain family of five,"Apart from posing serious health threats, the COVID-19 outbreak also had adverse financial effects, specially after countrywide restrictions were announced.

Mohammad Ahmed, who is a driver with a leading cab service provider, now spends his days staring out of his balcony, in a bid to assess the financial impact caused in his life.

“Since the Prime Minister’s announcement, business is completely down and income zilch. The cab services have been discontinued till further orders. So at this point, we have no clarity on when it will be resumed and more importantly [we] have no idea how we will survive for the next three weeks,” said Ahmed.

With three children, Ahmed has a family of five to sustain.

“As of now we have bought basic grains and pulses. There is not really much that we can stock up. Where is the money for that?” he asked.

While adding that monthly instalments against loans he had taken are due, the 35-year-old said, “The worry of how to sustain is making me so anxious. I still have EMIs to pay for the loan I took to buy the car. The only thing happening these days is the steady depletion of the bank accounts. Even from the company we have not heard a word on whether we will get any kind of compensation for this period.”

“I started driving the cab three years ago. Earlier I used to work in the construction industry. Currently, it simply looks like hassles are about to increase with no solution in the near future. We can’t step out; there is no way to earn anything and a constant threat to the health.

302,2020/03/29,‘Clampdown is nothing short of a ‘calamity’ for me’,"With the country going into a lockdown to control the pandemic, city-dwellers, who depend on a daily source of income, are among the worst hit.

For Govindpuri resident Aruna Mandal (31), a beautician offering at-home parlour services, a three week clampdown was nothing short of a “calamity.”

The sole breadwinner of the family, Mandal said: “It has been a week since I stopped visiting my clients’ houses. For people like me, how can there be any work from home? Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the other day that the lockdown will be for 21 days and some are saying that it might get extended. The entire situation is very distressing. What do I do?”

The 31-year-old added: “I came to Delhi after my marriage and then I took up a beautician course so that I could earn myself and not depend on anyone. My husband has erratic work and so the income is not regular. I even took a loan and bought a flat recently and had plans to shift by April. Now all the plans are gone. The moneylenders are asking for their money back. I have no idea how I will arrange for the money if I am out of work for three weeks.”

Even though the income was “not fixed, it was at least regular and assured,” she rued.

“Usually, my days would start around 8 a.m. and I would come back home around 10 p.m. While there were days when I would earn around ₹3,000, at times it was only ₹1,000. At least there was a flow of income to the family.

“It [providing food] is better than nothing...what pay will we get when we are not working at all?” he said.

Many of his friends had left the city out of fear. Also, they were out of work and running out of money. But Ram thinks it is a bad idea to leave the Capital. “Some people who left yesterday [Saturday] and that too on some expensive bus tickets have only reached Lucknow till now...that’s only half way home,” he explained. Besides this, the task of getting to Anand Vihar bus station itself is difficult, he said.

“They are all now in the middle of nowhere without food or water..at least here there is a roof over our heads and some food,” he said. “Now there is another friend who says he wants to go home but we are telling him to stay put,” he added.

Besides this, Ram is also concerned about transmitting the virus to the people in his village. “What if I take it [virus] to my village and give it to people there...if I fall sick here at least I can stay in the room, there might be some facility,” he added.

While he doesn’t mind staying on for a little while, he isn’t sure how long he would be able to sustain.” If this is just for twenty days or may be a month, I can stay on for sure...but if it goes beyond that I will have to leave,” he said, insisting that he had to be with his family who are already quite tensed.

“I don’t want to stay in Delhi for too long anyway,” said Ram, who was collecting money to eventually return home and fix up his house. “When my family used to live here I liked this place.

304,2020/03/29,People come forward to help authorities,"Volunteers of Red Cross Society, Civil Defence lend a hand

Over 60 people have registered as volunteers with the district administration to help authorities implement lockdown provisions in Gurugram in the wake of spread of COVID-19. Around 300 volunteers registered with the Red Cross Society and Civil Defence are also lending a hand.

District Development and Panchayat Officer Narender Kumar said that volunteers registered with the administration were part of a task force formed for distribution of ration to slum dwellers.

He added that 20 teams were formed with each comprising an ASHA worker, a volunteer and a policeman, besides two more members. Ration packets will be distributed in slums areas of Prem Nagar, Marble Market, and Sectors 12A and 56.

Some of the volunteers are enforcing social distancing norms at grocery and pharmacy shops while others are part of teams spreading awareness on how to prevent COVID-19 infection. However, the district authorities maintained the volunteers in Gurugram were mostly required for distribution of ration in slums, since the delivery of groceries and vegetables was largely being taken care of by e-commerce companies in the district.

Civil Defence volunteer V.N. Tiwari said they were also assisting the police at various barricaded checkpoints.

Gurugram Red Cross Society secretary Mahesh Gupta, however, said that many of their volunteers, especially those above the age of 50, were reluctant to come forward for fear of being infected.

“Many said their families were not allowing them to go out as they are at greater risk. We had demanded that our volunteers get suits that are used by doctors, but they were in short supply. There are a few dedicated young volunteers who have taken the risk and are helping out,” said Mr. Gupta.

The Red Cross Society has been running a kitchen from its premises at Chandan Nagar in Sector 15 Part-II and identified 30-odd places with slums to supply cooked food.

At least 33,000 volunteers have registered with the State government since March 22, including 546 retired doctors, 255 nurses, and 1,100 paramedical staff. Around 4,700 have offered themselves for home delivery services, 5,700 for ensuring social distancing and community communication, and 6,200 will help the District Magistrates.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/people-come-forward-to-help-authorities/article31201205.ece

With alcohol stores shut, Kumar, who runs a tyre repair shop near the Nehru Enclave metro station, said that he is saving some money. But ensuring that food and ration are available is a task. “We are doing with whatever we can, borrowing money from people here and there to eat a meal in a day,” he said, sitting outside his closed shop, along with a few others who has stores nearby.

Stating that no help in any form was received from authorities, Kumar said: “No one came to ask even about water.” Without a source of income, he is not sure how long his family would be able to survive. But he wasn’t too concerned about the pandemic spreading. “When I sleep at night, I hope I don’t wake up in the morning...I have lived a full life. I have seen a lot, done a lot...I never thought I would see such a time as well. But if it gets me, that’s also okay,” he said.

“I have been trying to spend time in some way or the other like feeding the birds and watching the television,” said Kumar, who had also managed to procure cigarettes despite the lockdown. “We make some arrangements for this,” he said.

306,2020/03/29,Delhi police block road at Sarai Kale Khan,"Move gets migrants workers stranded

A large number of out-of-job migrant workers, who were marching towards Anand Vihar bus terminal on Sunday, were stopped by the Delhi police at Sarai Kale Khan here and sent back to their respective houses in Delhi in specially arranged buses.

The Delhi police blocked a section of road at Saria Kale Khan, leading towards Anand Vihar, even for those travelling on foot. This led to accumulation of a large number of migrant workers at the spot.

Special CP R.S. Krishnia, who was at the spot overseeing the arrangements, assured the migrant workers that they did not have to go back home on foot as special buses are being arranged for them.

The Delhi police also made arrangement for meals and water for the migrant workers before sending them in batches to their location in charter buses. Due to the nationwide shutdown of non-essential services imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19 spandemic, migrant workers, most of whom work as daily wagers to support their families, have stopped getting work.

A young man, who was working as an apprentice at a local electronic shop in Dwarka, said he lost the job and now wanted to go back home. “I have nothing here. I want to go back, but you see I am stuck. I don’t know what to do,” he said while standing on the side of the road.

Waiting at the spot were three construction workers along with their wives and children, including an eight-month-old toddler. One of the men said they had walked till Sarai Kale Khan from Faridabad, but would have to head back as the roads ahead were blocked.

“We don’t know if we will be allowed back into the houses we vacated this morning. We don’t know how we are going to feed our family,” said one of the construction workers.

Another group of 11 construction workers, which had walked for four day from a village near Sirsa in Punjab towards Badaun in U.P., also got stuck at Sarai Kale Khan.

“We cannot go back as our employers have stopped taking our calls. And we cannot go forward as the roads are blocked. We don’t know what to do,” one of them said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-police-block-road-at-sarai-kale-khan/article31201156.ece
307,2020/03/29,"Increase picket deployment, police chief tells officers","‘Do extensive patrolling to stop migrants’

Amid exodus of migrant workers from the national capital to their respective hometowns, the Delhi Police Commissioner on Sunday instructed police personnel to stop migrants from moving out of the city by enhancing picket deployment and stopping movement of buses, officials said.

This comes a day after thousands of migrant workers, who have been longing to go home, thronged Anand Vihar bus teminal on the Delhi-UP border.

Police personnel have been instructed to enhance deployment of pickets on all the roads leading to Delhi, including metro tracks and railways tracks.

Many people were seen trying to walk on the railway tracks at Anand Vihar to reach their houses in U.P.

All the district DCPs, ACPs and SHOs have been instructed to do extensive patrolling in their respective areas and deploy maximum vehicles for patrolling. The officers have also been asked to announce that government will pay them full wages and also spread awareness among them about the threat of spread of COVID-19 and warn them that strict action will be taken if they are seen on roads.

The police have also been directed to not allow any movement of DTC buses or any other private buses ferrying migrant population from the national capital. All the DTC buses coming to bus stops and stands should be detained there and not allowed to move outside Delhi, the instructions stated.

308,2020/03/29,Migrants throng KMP Expressway looking for means to go home,"Policemen on e-way, NH-48 flagging down vehicles to arrange for their travel

Families of thousands of migrant workers, including women and children of all ages, who walked long distances along the Delhi-Jaipur Highway carrying suitcases, bags and sacks on their heads, thronged the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway at Pachgaon here on Sunday.

They desperately looked for means to return home in adjoining States after they were turned away by the police on Delhi-Gurugram border.

Stranded at Pachgaon, Chandra Bhan Yadav, a worker at a paints company in Gurugram’s Khandsa, said that he, along with his family members, including his wife and an eight-year-old girl, was walking towards Anand Vihar bus stand in Delhi to catch a bus to Kanpur, but the police turned him away at the Delhi-Gurugram border.

He said he had exhausted all his savings and did not have enough to afford even two square meals a day for his family. “I cannot afford to even pay the rent this month. I have no choice but to return home,” said Yadav, carrying his daughter on the back. He said he was prepared to walk all the way to Kanpur.

Dotting around a 60-km stretch from Delhi-Gurugram border to Pachgaon, the families of the workers, walking in hordes, had a similar stories to narrate. “We have no knowledge about the night shelters opened by the district administration. It is any way, better to go back home than to stay at night shelters,” said daily-wage worker Ashish Mishra. He was part of a group of nine, including a woman and a three-year-old child, which sat under a tree at Jharsa Chowk. He claimed that they too were turned away by the police at Delhi-Gurugram border.

Many workers also feared that the shutdown of non-essential services could be extended well beyond April 14 and it was, thus, “better to leave”.

The Gurugram district administration had pressed into service the buses of Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Limited to drop the workers and their families at Pachgaon. Most of them walked to the KMP Expressway taking little breaks in between. The police too had been flagging down private vehicles at the barricades on the NH-48, pleading with the drivers to drop the stranded workers at the KMP Expressway. The workers had to queue up for screening with thermal scanners before they were allowed to cross over to the other side of the toll plaza on the KMP Expressway at Pachgaon.

Ajay, a resident of Kakrola, said the neighbouring villages had been running community kitchen for the families of stranded workers and also ferrying them to the toll plaza on the KMP Expressway, around 2 km away. “We provide them food, tea, milk and biscuits. The people have been thronging the KMP Expressway for the past two days,” said Mr. Ajay. The district administration teams were also involved in providing food to the workers.

Police teams on the KMP Expressway had been flagging down the trucks and personal vehicles to arrange for the travel of the workers till Palwal.

Meanwhile, the district administration converted 19 community centres across the city into “relief centres”, in addition to the night shelters, to prevent the exodus. As many as 23 volunteer teams were involved in providing food, water and medical support to the workers.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/26dg21/article31201077.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE30MIGRANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/migrants-throng-kmp-expressway-looking-for-means-to-go-home/article31201078.ece

310,2020/03/29,"₹12,000-crore loss to government","Battle against COVID-19 hitting revenue, staff salaries no exception to cost-cutting: KCR

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Sunday said the State government had suffered a revenue loss of ₹12,000 crore since the measures to check coronavirus were launched.

At a press conference, he said the government had become cash-strapped so badly that it was in a tight spot even to pay salaries to its staff. Tough measures were inevitable. The government was assessing its reserves to tide over the crisis. Employees were no exception to cost-cutting measures that the government might consider. The government would bring down its expenditure.

Earlier, Mr. Rao held a high-level meeting to discuss the status of coronavirus, which was followed by a video conference with District Collectors and Superintendents of Police.

Discussing the ensuing purchase of foodgrains in villages in the midst of strict enforcement of social distancing norms to check the spread of coronavirus, he said he had signed a file during the day mobilising ₹ 25,000 crore to the Civil Supplies Corporation to purchase paddy and ₹3,200 crore to the Marketing Federation for purchase of maize. The government stood guarantee to the sum.

He expected a record 1.05 lakh tonnes of paddy to arrive at procurement centres in villages. The government would purchase the stock to the last kilogram. The rice millers were also permitted to lift stocks like the government at minimum support price.

The procurement centres would be open from April 1 to May 15 or 20 but the farmers could dispose of their stocks only on allotted dates. Coupons would be issued to them with the dates.

He said about 70 to 75 lakh gunny bags were required for procurement but the availability in the State was only 35 lakh bags. The government would get the remainder from elsewhere in the country.

He expressed concern that 95% of ‘hamalis’ involved in loading and unloading operations at rice mills were from Bihar and they had all left to their home-state for Holi. They were stuck there after the outbreak of coronavirus. The Chief Secretary was in touch with his Bihar counterpart to bring them back.

The free rice of 12 kg per head which was announced for white card holders in view of the lockdown would be extended to migrant labourers from other States. In addition, they would get ₹500 per head. There was no need for the 3.36 lakh people who would avail the facility to have ration cards, he added.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/12000-crore-loss-to-telangana-government/article31200740.ece

According to police, the accident took place around 4.45 a.m. when N. Anil Kumar was coming to Hyderabad from Madanapalle in Chittoor, around 550 km from here.

“Taking up such a long journey on highways full of heavy vehicles is suicidal as the rider faces sleeplessness and fatigue. Also, lack of driving skills among two-wheeler riders make them vulnerable as they can’t manoeuvre between heavy vehicles and steep curves,” said Cyberabad Traffic DCP S.M. Vijay Kumar.

He added that riders tend to over speed and lose control due to deserted roads following the lockdown. “We advise people not to take up such long rides anytime, particularly during lockdown period,” Mr. Kumar said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/trainee-pilot-injured-in-accident/article31200715.ece

313,2020/03/29,Tech that! Students catch up on lessons through virtual classrooms,"City schools use digital tools to engage students during lockdown period

Every crisis creates an opportunity and pushes people to think differently. The novel coronavirus pandemic may have forced schools, colleges and universities to shut down, but many are active online now thanks to information technology tools and platforms.

The shutdown of schools was ordered by the State and Central governments for the safety of teachers, non-teaching staff and students. However the Union HRD Ministry has written to CBSE, AICTE, UGC and all other autonomous organisations under it to permit the teaching and non-teaching staff to work from home during the lockdown period.

It wanted the faculty and academic staff to utilise the ‘work from home’ period for development of online content, online teaching and online evaluation, development of lesson plans and instructional material for the courses to be offered during next academic year and semester.

Quick response

Several schools like Chirec, Oakridge, Foster Billabong High, Indus, Future Kids which have the IT architecture in place have been quick to implement the government directive.

Says Sunita Rani, director of Foster Billabong, “We have rolled out e-learning platforms for online classes for grade X students apart from activity-based learning to those in lower classes to keep them engaged for at least a couple of hours a day. We are coordinating with our academic heads to prepare online lesson plans for two or three topics in the given curriculum in at least two subjects for every class and enhance the available work sheets with more links from online content. The idea is to make the virtual classroom more comprehensive and interesting for the student,” she says.

The worksheets with recap of basics for every subject for every grade are sent as they enter the new academic year.

Ms. Sunita Rani explains that the school first tried a pilot class with teacher and parents to understand teacher-student coordination, control and technical guidelines. A link was generated for students to log in and take admission into the virtual classroom with the consent of parents for their child’s online study. The principal then ensured that the teacher on duty logged in, and the entire teaching and learning process was supervised and recorded.

In addition, parents of the students are sent links to grade and subject-specific concepts, self learning strategy and links for fun learning at home to enhance math skills, and to enhance listening and pronunciation skills.

Parents happy

The initiative by the schools to conduct online classes has won appreciation from parents, says Neethika, a member of the management committee which helped in coordinating the online teaching process for all classes. “They are happy to see their children enjoying and learning at the same time,” she says.

Shailaja Rao, founder and principal of Future Kids, says they are launching virtual classes for higher classes - 10 to12 from Monday and already have an app for home-based activities and assignments for lower classes. “We are introducing one element each day to keep it interesting and engaging for the children. Parents are happy with the initiatives and some of them say they understand the situation and ask us not to push ourselves too much,” she adds.

Making up later

Virtual classes will not be same as conventional classes, but they will be used to explain basic concepts and once the schools reopen, the lessons can be revised. “We are thinking of using the online platform to complement the classroom teaching hereafter as teachers and students get used to online classes,” she says.

Oakridge International School conducts virtual classes through Google Hangout three or four days a week. The school website provides homework assignments for students in word documents and evaluates them. Jagan, a parent, says that keeps his daughter Hansini, a fifth grade student, engaged for two to three hours a day. But she sure misses her regular school activities that stretch to six to seven hours, and her classmates too, he says.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/mbyske/article31200707.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy29vertualclass1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/tech-that-students-catch-up-on-lessons-through-virtual-classrooms/article31200702.ece
314,2020/03/29,City firm joins hands with NIMS to make face shields and isolation box,"Aimed at protecting front line health professionals

With COVID-19 positive cases in the State climbing by the day, the safety of frontliners becomes paramount. It is this concern that led city-based company ButterFly Edufields, T-Works and the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) to join hands and fabricate an isolation box and face shields which seek to better protect healthcare workers.

The company is all set to deliver as many as 300 face shields to NIMS on Monday. “We got to know that a team of doctors from NIMS wanted help in getting an isolation box. We contacted them and they told us about their requirement. So, we started making it in a workshop in Alwal. The box prevents the aerosol from coming out. In this case, the aerosol is the droplets from the patient and keeps the frontliners safer,” said K. Sharat Chandra, co-founder of ButterFly Edufields. The healthcare professional, through slots in the box, can access the patient.

The isolation box was reportedly designed by a Taiwanese anesthesiologist Lai Hsien-Yung. Certain modifications were made and the box, made of acrylic sheets, was fabricated in around three-and-a-half hours.

Meanwhile, work to deliver the 300 face shields, also to protect medical frontliners, is in full swing. Another requirement of NIMS doctors, the shield is made of an OHP sheet, elastic band and a styrofoam sheet.

According to Mr Chandra, steps were taken to ensure that the shield is affordable and accordingly, the price has been kept between ₹20 and ₹25. “The shield is disposable. We are have made the design open source so that those in other cities can use it,” he said.

The company is now exploring options to ramp up production.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/city-firm-joins-hands-with-nims-to-make-face-shields-and-isolation-box/article31200685.ece

319,2020/03/29,"‘It was traumatic at first, I immersed myself in books’","Telengana’s first COVID-19 patient, who has now recovered, recalls his fight against the dreaded disease

“How did I get it?” Throughout the 14 days of isolation at Gandhi Hospital, this thought constantly played on the mind of the index (first) COVID-19 case of Telangana. The 24-year-old techie hailing from Hyderabad tried to piece together all details from the time he left Bengaluru, where he works for a startup, till he landed in Dubai. He racked his brains, but could not figure out the answer.

Cooped up all alone in the isolation ward of the State-run hospital even as his treatment started, he was bogged down with the anxiety of having possibly passed on the contagious disease to his family members, friends and others he came in contact with. Desperate to break free from the restlessness and the constant news reports and discussions on the novel coronavirus, he turned to fiction books.

During the two weeks of treatment, he finished reading six novels. Now, he has recovered from the disease.

Having completed 28 days of isolation at the hospital and quarantine at home on Friday, he told The Hindu, in an exclusive interview, that he flew to Dubai in mid-February and returned to Bengaluru on February 20. After attending office for a day and then staying back in his room the next day, he returned to Hyderabad in an air-conditioned bus on February 22. When he developed fever, he consulted the family doctor. Four days later, he developed dry cough too and was diagnosed with pneumonia. A corporate hospital referred him to Gandhi Hospital where he tested positive for COVID-19 on March 1.

“At that point, I underwent a lot of psychological trauma. I was shocked to know the results. Then I started to worry about my parents, friends and others who had come in contact with me. Besides, I was anxious as pneumonia was at its peak in the first three days after testing positive. But Krishna Murthy, head of Pulmonology department, was quite supportive. He said I will get well soon since I am young. The duty doctors and nurses constantly monitored my situation,” the techie recalled.

Escaping to another world

While he said that conditions at the government hospital were “okay” with scope for improvement, the youngster said the doctors, nurses and other staff at the hospital “did everything they could”. “Nurses covered in Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) would come into the ward to administer medicines. They would boost my morale every now and then and share tea with me. My family and friends called me up regularly. I kept away from social media and read books to transport myself to another world,” the youngster said.

After testing negative twice, he was discharged on March 13. He completed 14 days quarantine at home.

Speaking about the stigma attached to COVID-19 patients, he said it will keep people from opting for tests which can spread virus in the community. “This [disease] is not anyone’s mistake although I felt guilty that I might spread it to others. People should not kick tenants out of rented houses if they have symptoms. We have to be united as a community and fight the stigma,” he said.

‘Govt. hospital not a dump’

The 24-year-old also urged people to be under quarantine and be proactive in getting tested. “Government hospitals are not unliveable. It might be difficult to live there compared to your home, but it is not a dump. It is not only about you but your family, friends and community. You should not spread the virus to others,” he said.

He also spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday who enquired about the treatment at the hospital and his condition.

320,2020/03/29,Rising to the occasion in testing times,"Syed Amjad and his family are ensuring that people stranded in Sadashivapet do not go hungry

What can any one do during the forced holidays of coronavirus? Watching movies, browsing net, reading books, playing games and sparing quality time with family members! Anything beyond that?

Ask Syed Amjad, a resident and tea powder vendor from Sadashivapet mandal headquarters and his answer is a firm Yes. For the past one week, his eight-member family has been busy preparing food for more than 180 persons twice a day — morning and evening.

More than 50 lorries got stuck at this mandal headquarters town. They reached here carrying raw materials to MRF, a tyre manufacturing industry. As the announcement of lockdown was made all of a sudden, they had no time to return back. Though the management took care of them for one or two days, later it was pathetic. There was no one who could supply food for them.

Town Circle Inspector P. Sridhar Reddy called upon the people to come to the rescue of the people stranded here.

Responding to that, Mr. Amjad came forward and took the responsibility of supplying food for them. While 21 kg of rice is being cooked in the morning, it is 17 kg in the evening. It will take about three hours to prepare the food every time and they are spending six hours a day for that.

Later in the day between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. he distributes food packets to the drivers who have stationed their lorries in the open space adjacent to the industry. Similarly, in the evening as well.

“I am from Bhopal. I got stuck here from March 22 and food is being served by Amjad bhai every day,” said Saleem, a driver from Bhopal, who has a cleaner with him. Both of them are getting food.

When Commissioner H.M. Spandana informed Mr. Amjad on Sunday about a dozen people on their way to Zaheerabad and beyond, he immediately responded and provided them food packets. She herself distributed the food packets for them near the highway and sent them off in a vehicle. He has also been distributing rations for about 80 single women who could not find any work.

321,2020/03/29,Lockdown hits housemaids and newspaper boys,"Fearing infections, many people are not allowing to do their regular duties

The lockdown period has come like an unofficial ban on daily wage earners despite assurances from various quarters. They find the times tough.

Following fears over possible spread of coronavirus and due to social distancing, many people are discouraging house maids, laundry workers and paper vendors from carrying on their routine duties. They are being asked to stay away.

In many apartments, newspaper boys, laundry workers and house maids are prohibited from entering and working during the lockdown period.

U Sambaiah of Ramnagar was found standing in front of an apartment looking disturbed. On inquiry he said he would collect clothes from all apartments and return them in the evening after ironing them. Now customers are saying that as they are going nowhere due to lockdown there are no clothes to be ironed. Also he was asked not to come to the apartment for now. “I lost my daily income and it will be very difficult for my family to survive if this goes on like this. I am clueless how many days it will be like this,” he rued.

An elderly M Narasamma who works as housemaid said she was asked not to come for work by several house owners. Otherwise she was busy cleaning utensils, washing clothes and mopping houses at half a dozen houses during the day. “I do not know if they give me money for this period. But I am bored staying at home without any work for now,” she complained.

Another housemaid Tahera echoed similar feelings. “The people who wait for us are now saying do not come for now. I feel humiliated when they say like that as if we are reason for the spread of virus. Also I do not know if I get wages for this period. Some give and some do not give I know,” she pointed out.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/lockdown-hits-housemaids-and-newspaper-boys/article31200451.ece

323,2020/03/29,Chilli ryots make a beeline to cold storage facilities,"Khammam Agriculture Market closed due to lockdown

Quite a few cold storage units in and around the town witnessed long queue of vehicles laden with harvested chillies for the second consecutive day on Sunday as several farmers made a beeline to these units to store their harvested crop in view of the closure of Khammam Agriculture Market due to the nationwide lockdown.

Notwithstanding difficulties faced by some chilli growers in unloading their harvested crop at the cold storage units due to shortage of hamalies on Saturday, several farmers rushed to the units on Sunday to stock their produce in cold storage facilities. The limited staff manning the cold storages struggled to cope with the rush resulting in long delays compelling the farmers to line up their vehicles in front of the units during daytime on Sunday.

The popular Teja variety of red chilli fetched a record price of ₹ 21,000 a quintal in January this year before crashing to a low of ₹ 13,100 a quintal in February at the local market.

The prevailing uncertainty over the reopening of Agriculture Market due to the threat of COVID-19 has reportedly prompted several farmers to opt for cold storages in view of the peak summer ahead and to get a better price for their produce after the crisis is over.

When contacted, the Selection Grade Secretary of Khammam Agriculture Market Praveen Kumar said that notices have been served on all the cold storage units to allow farmers stock their chilli produce in their units up to their maximum storage capacity in strict adherence to norms.

Presently all the cold storage units put together in the division have capacity to accommodate around 4 lakh bags of chillies as per the latest assessment made on the availability of space in these units, he noted.

The Agriculture Market will remain closed till April 14 as part of the nationwide lockdown to check the spread of COVID-19.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/37aaw1/article31200425.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY30MIRCHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/chilli-ryots-make-a-beeline-to-cold-storage-facilities/article31200426.ece
324,2020/03/29,Migrant labourers from Karnataka left to fend for themselves,"Brought by a contractor to work on a road project, they now find themselves without work or food

Around 40 migrant labourers, including eight children and an eight-month-old pregnant woman from Gulbarga of neighbouring Karnataka state, are a worried lot following the lockdown since last one week.

They could neither secure employment nor go back to their native places and are struggling hard to eke out a living, with little left as savings. Following the lockdown and curfew, they are unable to come out of their makeshift dingy huts fearing police wrath and starving for food along with their children.

These migrants are appealing to the district authorities to provide them some transport so that they can reach their villages in Karnataka State adjoining Kodangal and Tandur in Telangana State. “At least leave us in Hyderabad city so that we can walk to our villages and live safely. We are unable to live in this place because of lockdown and curfew. Especially with the outbreak of COVID-19 virus in the town, we are fearing the spread of virus,” the migrants stated.

Some three months ago, the labourers from Gulbarga district were hired by a contractor and had arrived at Satavahana University on the outskirts to work for laying internal roads in the campus. All was well until the government announced Janata Curfew and subsequently lockdown for 21 days. Later, the contractor left them at the campus by providing their wages.

The labourer community planned to go out of the university but in vain following police restrictions and curfew. An eight-month-old pregnant woman Prabhavathi was unable to go out for medical check-up at the government hospital following the curfew. The children including one-year toddler to 10 years are struggling hard in the dingy huts without ventilation and scared of contracting the virus.

When their plight had come to the notice of this correspondent, they were provided food with the support of a philanthropist Saikrishna Reddy on Sunday. Sharanappa, one of the migrant labourers, appealed to the government to help them reach their native village. “We are scared of the outbreak of the deadly virus and want to be in our own villages,” he stated.

When contacted, Collector K Shashanka said that they would instruct the contractor to provide all the necessary facilities to the migrant labourers during the lockdown period. If he fails to do so, they would take action against him, he said and added that they would provide proper shelter, ration or food to the migrant labourers till the completion of lockdown.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/dncz14/article31200405.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY30KARNATAKALABOUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/migrant-labourers-from-karnataka-left-to-fend-for-themselves/article31200406.ece
325,2020/03/29,Himalayan Ibex a distinct species,"They are divergent from Siberian Ibex, reveals a genetic study

A recent study by scientists of the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) has proved that Himalayan Ibex, distributed in the trans-Himalayan ranges of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh, is a distinct species from the Siberian Ibex.

The paper, ‘Genetic evidence for allopatric speciation of the Siberian Ibex (Capra sibirica) in India,’ has recently been published in Endangered Species Research, an international peer-reviewed journal.

Siberian Ibex is a species of wild goat and is distributed in diverse habitats, ranging from cold deserts, rocky outcrops, steep terrain, high-land flats and mountain ridges to low mountains and foothills.

From Mongolia, its distribution extends towards Altai, Hangai, Gobi-Altai, the Hurukh mountain ranges as well as Sayan Mountains near Russia and scattered populations in the small mountains of Trans-Altai Gobi.

In Asia, Ibex is distributed in the Montane habitats, ranging in elevations from 500 m to 6,700 m in countries like India, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Southern Siberia and China. In India, the Ibex is distributed mainly in the trans-Himalayan ranges of the Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh up to the river Sutlej.

To unravel the complexity in species recognition of Indian Ibex, the researchers, under a project funded through the National Mission on Himalayan Studies implemented by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, undertook field surveys and collected faecal samples from Lahaul and Spiti, Himachal Pradesh.

The genetic analysis conducted with the inclusion of the sequences available from all across the distribution ranges in Central Asia, Tajikistan, Altai Mountains, Mongolia and Russia provided first evidence to claim that Himalayan Ibex is genetically different from all other ranges of Siberian Ibex. The samples collected from India clustered with the sequences from Tajikistan in a phylogenetic analysis, which were adequately different from the other two clades: KZ clade of Tajikistan (which broadly represents one of the clusters in the phylogeny) and AMR clade of Altai Mountains, Mongolia and Russia.

“The results of the genetic analysis surprisingly revealed that I-T clade (referred to as Siberian Ibex) was estimated to have diverged from Alpine Ibex during the Pleistocene epoch (2.4 million years ago) than the Siberian Ibex during the Miocene-Pliocene boundary (6.6 million years ago),” Mukesh Thakur, the lead author of the paper, said.

Lalit Kumar Sharma, who heads the wildlife section of the ZSI and has contributed to the paper. He claimed this study is going to be the breakthrough in the global understanding of the Ibex distribution and evolution. Both the scientists, Dr Thakur and Dr Sharma also hope this study will grab the attention of the global experts so that the species can be evaluated under IUCN. They have already started communication with Species Specialist Group responsible for species assessment. ""The study reveals that Siberian ibex is a polytypic species, plausibly formed by lumping of at least 2 species and or 3 to 4 sub-species,” Dr Thakur said.

The scientists behind the discovery are now working to understand how the mountain oscillations might have led to this allopatric speciation with the inclusion of sophisticated tools of genomics and GIS. They presumed that the ‘montane systems’, formed by a series of climatic oscillations and temporal topographic metamorphosis, have broken up the contiguous distribution of widespread species and accelerated allopatric speciation (speciation because of geographic and reproductive isolation). ZSI director Kailash Chandra said that identification of Indian Tajikistan Ibek as a distinct species will prioritize the conservation of the species at global level.",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/mrc23l/article31201580.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Ibex,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/himalayan-ibex-a-distinct-species/article31201581.ece
326,2020/03/29,"Coronavirus | Densely-packed areas in cities are vulnerable, says biocomplexity expert Madhav Marathe","“You can control COVID-19 via social distancing. You have to decide how effective that mechanism should be. We try and buy time until we have antivirals or a vaccine.”

Madhav Marathe has extensive experience in modelling and studying infectious diseases. His group has supported almost every outbreak response in the US since 2002, including planning for the H5N1 in 2005, H1N1 in 2009, MERS in 2012, Ebola in 2014 and Zika in 2015. In this interview he describes the challenges of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and discusses India’s potential response. He is an endowed Distinguished Professor in Biocomplexity, Director of the Network Systems Science and Advanced Computing (NSSAC) Division, Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative at the University of Virginia, and an alumnus of IIT Madras.

What is the challenge in modelling or studying a pandemic, COVID-19 in particular?

Covid-19 presents a number of new challenges in my opinion. In this case, three things happened: (1) The pandemic started in a densely populated region of the world unlike Ebola, which started near Liberia in West Africa; (2) Unlike West Africa, China is much more strongly connected with the world, in terms of economic activity and human mobility; and (3) the incubation period of the disease is longer than many other flu viruses. Moreover, a large number of people – the silent spreaders – don’t show any symptoms at all while being infectious. This makes it hard to track the spread of the disease . Finally, the social and economic impact of this pandemic will go way beyond any disaster we have seen in a long time. Recovering from this impact will require a coordinated global response.

What does mathematics tell us about pandemic? Some people are of the opinion we need to keep this lockdown for a year to contain COVID-19?

Here is my take. This is open to scientific debate, so one cannot answer these things with certainty. However, this part, I think, everyone agrees – this is a new virus as far as humans are concerned, hence, everybody is susceptible to the virus. The general view [for the lockdown period] is that until herd immunity sets in, which means until enough number of people have already been infected and recovered, or until you have a vaccine (or an antiviral), this disease will keep circulating in the human population.

One way to speed this up is to let the epidemic go completely unchecked but the downside will be many deaths and hospitalisations – as can be seen in China, Italy and even the U.S., whose numbers are rising fast. So this theoretical option is simply not a possibility. The other option of completely shutting down the society for one year is also not a possibility. What we have at hand is a complex multicriteria optimisation problem.

You can control COVID-19 via social distancing. You have to decide how effective that mechanism should be. We try and buy time until we have antivirals or a vaccine. This reduces the mortality and the number of individuals who get critically ill, thereby reducing the burden of the disease on the healthcare system to a manageable level. So the question then is: (i) what sort of social distancing would you put in place, (ii) when would it begin , and (iii) for how long? Each country and its citizens need to decide what the best solution for them is, with two caveats: (i) human life has to be central in these analysis, (ii) one has to understand that we are globally connected so infections in one part of the world will likely have impacts on other parts of the world. You have also seen very different numbers for different regions – in Italy, we have seen approximately 7,500 deaths till now with 74,000 infections. In Germany, the numbers are remarkably different – we have 35,000 infections, and only 185 deaths. Some countries have managed this better.

Perhaps it is not a question of managing the response better but just the way it started, maybe the demographics, maybe they have more immune-compromised individuals maybe the way testing was done or perhaps the way interventions were implemented. Research will have to be carried out to sort this out.

Different countries are responding differently to this virus. So when you are trying to understand it as a scientist, what would you say are the key differences in modelling it?

The way we address how to understand the spread is to build the digital twin of the city. If you want to understand infectious diseases in a large city such as Chennai, then you want to build a realistic social contact network that represents Chennai. In the social network each node is a person and the edge between each person reflects their social connectivity. For example if you and your neighbour come into contact with each other, there will be an edge between you and the neighbour. The problem is the difficulty in constructing these network in the first place. Especially when studying social networks for a large city like Chennai; once the number is more than 15 or 20 nodes, it becomes very hard to synthesise such networks.

We came up with a novel way of constructing a synthetic representation of this network. i.e. a network representation that statistically captures the interactions but need not necessarily be identical to the population. So, what does it mean to build a “digital twin” or a synthetic city? The idea is, in order to build a social contact network of Chennai, I can take all sorts of information, from census pollings, to roads and buildings, to surveys of what people are doing all day, travel schedules, transit availability etc. and build a network which statistically resembles Chennai. But if you look at any one person in particular you cannot find an identical agent, say, yourself, or my professor at IIT Madras. It is a digital replica but it is a synthesised. That is the network we use to study how diseases would spread using simulations and computer models. We have developed methods that can be run on big supercomputers since the methods are computationally expensive. You look at outcomes by running the simulations of disease progression on these networks. Machine learning techniques and AI tools are used to glean insights from these simulations. This includes forecasting, resource allocation, interventional analysis and so on. This way you can capture the social context which is unique for each city. Network for Chennai is going to be very different than the social network for Delhi, or for Washington DC. Their demographics are different, the population density is different, the role of transportation is different – these things will finally affect the digital twin. It is in that sense that we are able to understand how disease would spread from one region to another, or from one city to another.

In fact, my colleagues have shown in a paper that this social connectivity affects how intervention works. If you had the same set of interventions in two different cities they need not work the same way at all.

You say that different methods for halting the spread may be needed for different cities. Can you give some examples?

First, for this pandemic, there is only one broad-based method – there are no pharmaceuticals at all. The only real method to control this pandemic is social distancing. On the other hand, each region or city or community is different. Intuitively, I would say a city that is much denser would require more stringent social distancing measures than the one that is very sparse.

If you take New York City or big cities in India, public transport is the fundamental mode to move around, but smaller cities have very little public transportation. That has an effect because cutting the public transportation down also means cutting the movement or intervention. But shutting down the public transport system in Houston, where it is limited, is not likely to have that much of an impact as shutting it down in New York.

Another example is that some cities might have a lot of people who are elderly. Usually the southern part of this country (US) has a lot of people who are elderly. In India, it is not common to have large sections of the town devoted only to elderly folks. So, cordoning off communities that house elderly people in the US is a different idea than doing it in India.

What are your ideas for India in the case of this pandemic?

I remain anxious about India, although the steps the Indian government has taken so far are very good. I was very happy to hear that they locked down the entire country; they are trying very hard to control it. But the question is how big will the outbreak in India grow to? If it stays at a low level then we are in good shape. It might be that even though people are getting sick there, the death rate is not as high as in Italy, which would be good news. There could be multiple reasons. For instance, the immune system of Indians could work differently from those of Italians. The government is instituting fairly strong measures – they have learnt from the events so far and have instituted the interventions early. This is a challenge for the government, too. You can shut down all the transportation and have general curfew, but for how long can you do it?

The economic engine of the country essentially comes to a grinding halt.

Additionally, I have seen in India that people often do not comply with government orders. But, in times of crises like this, I feel Indians show an amazing level of awareness and compliance. This is what’s amazing about the Indian society. Our leaders, celebrities, administrators all have to work collectively and constantly remind the citizens of downside if they do not follow the orders. I think the next 10 days for India is very critical. If we are able to slow the disease down and keep it at a very low level, then we have a chance to respond to it better. If numbers start growing exponentially, like they did in Italy or US then controlling it will be very hard, because of the density of the population. We also have slum areas in larger cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, which are very vulnerable. These are very, very densely packed. People talk about social distancing – it is not easy to define social distancing in a tightly packed slum areas. In some places there is no distance between your house and your neighbours’ house. It is one big house effectively. We need to make sure that these slums are taken care of.

They also lack livelihoods. It is easy to say, “don’t go to work,” but many of them are daily wage earners. It is hard to ask them to stay at home for months when they don’t even have the means to feed themselves. So, if you have strong social distancing measures, the government also needs to think about how it’s going to take care of all of its people. Furthermore, the lockdown implied that many workers left cities for their villages and hometowns. I suspect many of them are already infected. They also travelled in crowded transportation system. This can potentially have implications, we will know this in the next few weeks.

It is also important to understand that shutting down public transportation, might be a good idea, but also restricts people’s movement immensely. So, I think it is challenging in India, but so far the country, the government, and the citizens have shown strong will. Again, though testing has been ramped up, based on my interactions with scientists from India, I feel India has to do more testing. The more you test, the better you can understand how widespread the disease is as well as give some insight into what the mortality rate is.

Testing is non-trivial, the kits are expensive by Indian standards, some $30 a kit. But I am told many companies have started building these kits for testing so that they can do a high level of testing.

The last part is that if it becomes a pandemic the way it has become in the US and people are critically ill in India, the medical establishment will be stretched thin. The doctors, staff, nurses are all very vulnerable without proper protective gear. Not just [in number of] doctors, nurses, and staff who are very vulnerable but whether there are enough ventilators, beds and PPE. Yesterday, on TV, I saw a hospital in Spain where people were on the floor, they did not have enough space. This is Spain, which is very well developed. In India, this kind of situation is likely to happen if the numbers start exploding. The government needs to plan on emergency treatment places. Tent hospitals can treat a large number of folks. China showed how to build such tent hospitals very quickly. India must start planning now. It might seem like a waste, but it is better to plan now. From an operational perspective I have five things that I would like to suggest: (i) Test as much as you can, it is the best investment you can make, (ii) start building hospitals and producing medical equipment and supplies, (iii) be transparent while communicating the extent of the disease; (iv) take care of old sections of the society, especially the poor and vulnerable, and (v) don’t let the guard down even if you dodge the pandemic in the first wave, it will come back.

Is there a strong reason and strategy for testing?

The fundamental reason to test is twofold. One is to identify all the possible infected folks but the other related reason is to essentially estimate the prevalence of the disease. Right now, it is not easy to tell, even in the US, (the exception is Korea where testing was intensive), to even have a sense for how many people are currently infected – we don’t know that in the US. Some people say it is 1%.

In New York, one estimate is that one in thousand people are already infected. They might not be infectious or may not show symptoms, they may not be critically ill, but that is the number estimated. It is a very weak estimate.

But randomised testing, if you had that many kits, would have addressed this better. That also gives an idea of the burden of the disease. If you had 10% of the people already infected in New York, and the deaths are something like 200 or 300, these numbers are close to influenza deaths caused yearly. If the mortality is closer to what an influenza like disease has, we should be concerned of course, but the concern is much weaker than if the death rate is much higher. Here [In the COVID-19 case] the current estimate of mortality rate is between 2% and 3%, which is a factor of 20 to 30 more than influenza, which is 0.1%. This depends on counting how many people are infected in the first place. We don’t have a good sense for it. Testing can help ascertain how problematic this disease is. Testing also allows us to find out who is sick so that we can isolate them.

Would you be interested in working with Indian scientists?

My group has offered help to Indian scientists. We have just initiated discussions with a number of institutions in India. We would be very happy to work with Indian scientists in their quest to respond and build mathematical models and support the assessment of interventions. India has a strong scientific base and this should also allow us to expose the new class of models and computational techniques we have developed in the Indian context. We will have a lot to benefit ourselves too. Not just perspective, but we may be able to carry out interesting studies in India that can help policymakers come up with better regulations and hopefully better response methods.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/n7an3x/article31195211.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28thmarMadhav-Marathe,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-densely-packed-areas-in-cities-are-vulnerable-says-biocomplexity-expert-madhav-marathe/article31195212.ece
327,2020/03/29,Coronavirus | Can drugs for Ebola be used to treat COVID-19?,"What are the medicines being considered for the novel coronavirus pandemic?

The story so far: Globally unknown till under 200-days ago, the virus SARS-CoV-2, has today, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), caused the world’s largest pandemic. Over half-a-million people are under lockdown, over six lakh are infected and nearly 29,000 dead globally. In India, the numbers stand at a shade below 1,000 cases and 24 deaths (as on March 28, 9 p.m.). The number of cases is growing despite the unprecedented measures put in place by the Central and State governments. With the rise in cases, India has now joined the world in the search for drugs to treat COVID-19. Earlier this week, India approved the use of the anti-malarial drug, hydroxychloroquine, as a preventive medication for people at high risk, such as health workers and immediate contacts of a person who has tested positive for COVID-19.

What is causing death in COVID-19 patients?

In India, COVID-19 deaths have been seen in mostly the elderly population with other health issues including diabetes. Emerging data from China and Italy show that COVID-19 patients have severe blood-clotting disorders that lead to respiratory failure and death. Vaccination has been ruled out as an immediate solution, with WHO noting that even if the process is fast-tracked, a vaccine would take over 18 months to be ready for use. The discovery and licensed use of a drug comes with a long-gestation period.

Hence, WHO and other health agencies are re-looking the efficacy of known therapies and drugs this time to treat COVID-19.

Dr. Raman R. Gangakhedkar, Head of Epidemiology and Communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said India, like the rest of the world, does not have the luxury of time to look for new treatment or vaccines right now, “though five vaccines have gone into animal toxicity tests. Our best bet right now is looking at re-purposed drugs”.

With this in mind, WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, recently announced the launch of ‘Solidarity’, a giant multinational trial for testing therapies that researchers have suggested may be effective against COVID-19.

He said, “It is launched to generate robust, high quality evidence as fast as possible.” India, on Friday, aligned with the study after having so far stayed away due to its small sample size, according to the ICMR. WHO said, “This is now is an all-out, coordinated push to collect robust scientific data from across the world.”

What are the drugs being considered?

WHO is looking at some of what doctors and researchers believe are the most promising therapies including a combination of two HIV drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir (used in India also for an Italian patient in Rajasthan), anti-malaria medications, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and an experimental antiviral compound called remdesivir.

As for hydroxychloroquine, a senior Health Ministry official clarified this by saying: “This drug has been brought in at an experimental level and the general public has been cautioned that it is not for use without a doctor’s prescription. To counter any shortage of the drug supplies we have banned the export of the finished drug and its component ingredients.”

A small study conducted in France found it led to a significant reduction in viral load in COVID-19 patients.

What does the research say so far?

The drug, remdesivir, developed to treat Ebola and related viruses, is being tested to find out whether it can be used on COVID-19 patients. Says WHO in research material it has released: “It works by shutting down the viral replication. This was first tested in a COVID-19 patient diagnosed in the United States, when his condition started worsening, according to a case report in the New England Journal of Medicine. The condition of the patient improved.”

The international health community has maintained that of the drugs in the Solidarity trial, remdesivir has the best potential — the drug shows that it can be used in high doses without causing toxicities.

What about anti-malaria drugs?

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are decades-old anti-malarial drugs. Hydroxychloroquine is being looked at in India and the ICMR has said that it is currently studying the drug action in the Indian population with respect to COVID-19. After being left out from the ‘Solidarity trial’ previously, the two drugs were brought back for consideration when some countries showed interest in its potential.

A study on 20 COVID-19 patients in France who were given hydroxychloroquine showed a significant reduced viral load in nasal swabs. Hydroxychloroquine, in particular, is known to have a variety of side-effects, and can in some cases harm the heart. “People with heart conditions are at higher risk of severe COVID-19,” warns cardiologist Dr. Naresh Trehan, who heads Medanta Hospital.

The combination drug, ritonavir/lopinavir, was introduced two decades ago to treat HIV infections. Doctors in Wuhan, China, gave 199 patients two pills of lopinavir/ritonavir twice a day plus standard care, or standard care alone.

There was no significant difference between the groups as per reports submitted on March 15. Says Dr. K.K. Aggarwal, former head of the Indian Medical Association, “Although the drug is generally safe it may interact with drugs usually given to severely ill patients, and doctors have warned it could cause significant liver damage.”

He added that another combination under testing is interferon-beta, which WHO has cautioned might be risky.

Says Dr. Aggarwal, “15% of COVID-19 needs hospitalised care and of these 5% need ICU care. Now with time running out rapidly for the entire world, re-purposed drugs are being aimed at to contain the problem, reducing hospital load, freeing critical hospital beds and allowing people to swiftly return to normal work. Agencies are also looking at unapproved drugs that have performed well in animal studies with the other two deadly coronaviruses, which cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).”

Is plasma therapy a possibility?

The world health community is also looking at plasma or antibody therapy for COVID-19 with China using it recently on its patients. WHO had recommended its use against Ebola, and issued protocols for its use to treat MERS but its clear-cut benefit to treat COVID-19 cases is still under investigation.

The novel coronavirus hails from a family on which work has already been done worldwide after SARS and MERS. Says Dr. Gangakhedkar, “This really helps in research in the sense that we don’t have to start from scratch. This is vital in our hunt for drugs to contain this virus.”

Why is the lockdown necessary?

Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Union Health Ministry, says, “The lockdown will give us time delay, maybe push back any surge towards community transmission of COVID-19. It is also helping us to re-draw our strategy to cope with this very strong and infectious virus. India has asked all State governments to be prepared in terms of manpower, hospital facilities and care for patients.”

India is now readying its health infrastructure to cope with a virus that has tested the most resilient health-care systems in the world, bringing them to their knees. According to Prof Balram Bhargava, Director-General, ICMR, “This is a crisis like no other and we will have to work together as a nation and an international community. Globally, the problem is being tackled with great urgency. The way out is to find a sustainable solution quickly.”",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/hb0k83/article31194457.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29THiStock-1210176669,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-can-drugs-for-ebola-be-used-to-treat-covid-19/article31194458.ece
328,2020/03/29,Healthcare worker tests positive for COVID-19 in Ernakulam,"1,655 more to be home-quarantined

A healthcare worker in the district turned positive for the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) on Sunday. The person involved in preventive activities developed symptoms on Saturday, following which he was admitted to the isolation ward at the Government Medical College Hospital. His condition is reported to be stable.

On Sunday, 1,655 people were identified to be home-quarantined by the district surveillance team. As many as 903 persons were removed from quarantine on completion of the specified time period. Of them, 889 had travelled by air.

The total number of people in home quarantine in the district is 5,701.

Four new persons were admitted to the hospital isolation ward — three at the medical college hospital and one at the Muvattupuzha General Hospital.

The total number of people in hospital isolation is 29. There are 14 persons at the Government Medical College Hospital undergoing treatment for COVID-19.

As many as 38 samples sent from the district have turned negative, while 26 more samples were sent on Sunday. The results of 45 samples are awaited.

There were 390 calls to the COVID-19 control room on Sunday. They included calls from relatives of quarantined persons, complaining that they had stepped out of homes in violation of norms. There were also calls regarding migrants who were not finding a place to stay.

The police were given details about the calls, and the Labour Department was informed about the migrants’ problems.

Those who called for finding food were provided details of the nearest community kitchens.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/jrip8u/article31203128.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th03-Bindu-ThirGRA72LR5A3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/healthcare-worker-tests-positive-for-covid-19-in-ernakulam/article31201518.ece
329,2020/03/29,Reaching out to migrant workers a challenge,"District Police Chief visits Perumbavoor

Though local bodies in the district have set up community kitchens in the past few days, reaching out to all migrant workers has been a tough task.

District Labour Officer (Enforcement) V.B. Biju said that the Department had been receiving complaints from workers who were running out of food and was directing them to nearby community kitchens and panchayat members. But the situation was complex, he said. “Language is sometimes an issue. Besides, if the community kitchen is far away from where the worker lives, that could be another problem. New problems crop up each day, but it should be possible to resolve them soon,” he said.

Rajendra Naik, who lives at Vazhakulam and works at a plywood factory, said workers at Vazhakulam were unaware of a community kitchen in the panchayat. He had been receiving calls from others in the area who were distressed about running out of groceries and having to pay rent soon.

Workers would have to approach ward members and pick up parcels of food from the kitchen, said a Vazhakulam panchayat official.

A worker who lives near Kandanthara in Perumbavoor said he had received a packet of food two days ago, but nothing after that. He was told that the owner of the building he stays in would help out with food.

It might not be feasible for landlords to provide food to workers for long periods of time, considering there could be several people living in a single building, said Benoy Peter, director, Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development.

Perumbavoor Municipal Chairperson Sathy Jayakrishnan said the community kitchen and camp were largely focused on footloose workers. “Migrant workers employed in plywood companies, hotels, and mills will be provided food by the owners of the companies,” she said. The municipality’s community kitchen was feeding around 700 persons daily and, the numbers were increasing, she said.

In the wake of migrant workers protesting in Kottayam, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K. Karthick, along with other officials, visited Perumbavoor on Sunday and discussed issues faced by workers with them.

Meanwhile, in the city, K.V.P. Krishnakumar, councillor representing Ernakulam South, said a camp for migrant workers would soon be set up at Maharaja’s College.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/m9bocz/article31201461.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29KICOVID-19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/reaching-out-to-migrant-workers-a-challenge/article31201462.ece

A Kochi-based company has developed an application, ‘Tracec’, to track the movements of those who test positive for COVID-19.

Using the application, it is possible to track details regarding the persons’ travel and who had come into close contact with them. The application also helps protect the privacy of infected persons. District Collector S. Suhas launched the application here on Sunday.

The Collector has instructed traders to inform the authorities about the availability of essential commodities.

He said information on the supply position should be conveyed to the District Supply Officer on a weekly basis.

The Collector also issued instructions to ensure that drivers of lorries that brought essentials to the State were taken care of. They should be given food as well as packets containing biscuits and other materials.

331,2020/03/29,Eight new cases in Kannur,"Most of them returned from Dubai

Eight more COVID-19 cases were reported in Kannur on Sunday, taking the total number of corona-infected persons to 34 in the district.

District Collector T.V. Subhash said that of the affected people three hailed from Mooriyad in Koothuparamba, two from Tablegate in Thalassery, one each from Kolayadu in Kannavam, Naduvil in Kudiyanmala, and Mananthery in Chittariparamba.

According to the District Health department, the 30-year-old man from Mooriyad arrived in Karipur on an Emirates EK 568 flight from Dubai on March 22. While another 45-year-old resident of Mooriyad arrived in Karipur from Sharjah on Air India Express IX 354 on March 21. Likewise, the other 52-year-old resident from Mooriyad arrived in Kannur on 20 March from Dubai on Emirates EK 568 after arriving in Bengaluru. All three were later sent to Thalassery General Hospital for the swab test.

The two men, aged 45 and 40, both from Tablegate and a 48-year-old man from Kannavam, arrived in Karipur on Air India AI 938 flight on March 21. All three were sent to Thalassery General Hospital.

Similarly, a 35-year-old man from Kannur, who arrived in Kannur on an Air India Express flight from Dubai on March 20, was admitted to Government Medical College Hospital, Kannur.

333,2020/03/29,"Efforts on to ensure enough supply of milk, vegetables and fruits","Full-fledged online delivery soon, says Horticorp official

The Kerala Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (Milma), Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) and Kerala State Horticultural Products Development Corporation (Horticorp) are pulling out all the stops to meet milk, vegetables and fruits supply requirements in the State as the lockdown to contain COVID-19 spread continues.

Horticorp and VFPCK have joined hands to revive an online order-based supply of fruits and vegetables, and Milma is working to ensure that sufficient milk and associated products are available in the market.

No shortage

Milma chairman P.A. Balan said that there was no milk shortage in the State as of now. With the spread of COVID-19 across the State, demand for milk and milk products is diminishing. However, Milma was engaged fully to ensure that there would be no shortage of products, he said.

Milma was facing a problem of surplus milk procurement, Mr. Balan added. He said that conversion of milk into value-added products was taking place with the help of cooperative units in Tamil Nadu as well as private players. While procurement was in the range of 13 lakh litres per day across Kerala, sales stood around 9.45 lakh litres.

A Horticorp official said that online supply of vegetables and vegetable kits had been revived. It should be fully operational within a few days, he said on Sunday.

Horticorp has a vegetable and fruit supermarket at Kakkanad close to the district headquarters as well as one at Kadavanthra in the city. Fruits and vegetables were being sourced mostly from local farmers and there was big demand for local produce such as nendran bananas and vegetables, the official said. Though prices of produce in the open market had gone up considerably, Horticorp was selling produce with a realistic price tag, the official claimed.

The price of shallots or small onions hovered around ₹100 in many of the retail shops in Ernakulam, the price having risen from around ₹30 a kg ahead of the lockdown.

The official said that Horticorp had also been engaged in aggregating produce from farmers in different parts of Kerala, including from places such as Kanthalloor and Vattavada where cool season vegetables like carrot and cabbage are available.

VFPCK too is now engaged in online supplies of vegetables and fruits with the help of women from Kudumbashree groups. A group that was engaged in supplying cut vegetables before the lockdown, had now started supplying whole vegetables and fruits, said an official. The group was now working out of Kalamassery, she added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/efforts-on-to-ensure-enough-supply-of-milk-veggies-and-fruits/article31199468.ece
334,2020/03/29,When fears of infection denied them access to homes,"Despite readiness to go on quarantine, family from Bengaluru stopped from entering apartment premises

While driving his way back home with family to Kochi with a lockdown imminent, Promy Gangadharan, a lawyer settled in Bengaluru, never anticipated the kind of reception that awaited him.

With news of long queue of vehicles at Walayar, he had taken the route along Mysore, Bandipur Tiger Reserve, and Nadughani Ghat Road to enter Malappuram before reaching his wife’s vacant apartment in the heart of the city last Saturday around 1 a.m.

Though his father-in-law had arranged for the caretaker to leave the gate open, it remained closed when the family reached.

“It emerged that the caretaker had shared news of our arrival with the residents’ association who flatly denied us entry into our own apartment alleging that the virus infection was widespread in Bengaluru. This was despite our four-member family willing to go on self-quarantine,” said Mr. Gangadharan.

Fortunately, his sister was staying at Thripunithura where the family now remains in quarantine. “I was fortunate to have such an alternative arrangement to fall back on. But what if it had happened to someone without that luxury. Where would they have gone with two young daughters in those odd hours,” he wondered.

Mr. Gangadharan fleetingly toyed with the idea of lodging a police complaint against the residents’ association and entering the apartment ignoring objection but eventually dropped the idea. Going by reports, this was not an isolated incident, with its many variants being played out in various parts of the district.

“We have come across a few incidents in which women were denied entry into their homes, including one in which a man turned away his wife who works as a housemaid for fear of getting infected. We contacted the police who in turn got in touch with the family where she works and ensured that none in the family had COVID-19 symptoms, following which her husband let her in,” said M.S. Deepa, Women Protection Officer, Ernakulam.

In another incident, a woman security guard in the city was told by her parents not to return to their home in Kottayam owing to similar fears. She is now being accommodated at her workplace.

“We are capable of arranging alternative accommodation for such stranded women as we cannot possibly lodge them in our shelter homes as that will endanger residents,” Ms. Deepa said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/when-fears-of-infection-denied-them-access-to-homes/article31195771.ece
335,2020/03/29,COVID-19 fight brings out the best in ASHA workers,"They supply essential items to home-quarantined people

Beena A.A., an Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) in Paravur, says she can reel off details of the elderly and those with existing health issues in her ward even in her sleep.

For the past few weeks, she has been on her toes gathering details to add to the ASHA worker’s existing trove of information about her immediate neighbourhood.

After long days of field work checking on people who are home-quarantined and supplying them with food kits and medicines, nights have been spent drawing up specific lists, including those of people over the age of 60 who are dependent on medication for diabetes or hypertension, and people who have ailments and live alone, she says.

“Some figures we regularly report like the number of children below the age of five, number of pregnant women in the ward, and the number of people with fever. But now, our lists have to be updated to include phone numbers and addresses in case somebody needs help,” said Lissy Varghese, ASHA worker at Piravom and district secretary of the CITU-affiliated ASHA Workers’ Union.

In the wake of COVID-19 infections, they could be required to provide information on those who are quarantined and others who could be vulnerable, at the drop of a hat, she says. Records are maintained in handwritten registers, and daily updates are submitted on people in home quarantine.

Suma C.N., an ASHA worker at Vadakkekara, says that with fears of the infection spreading, workers have been on the job all day and all night, with little time for the family. They would receive calls even at night from anxious neighbours reporting somebody’s return from abroad or other cities. “Our eyes and ears are always open and phones always switched on. People in the neighbourhood have yelled at us for having reported their return from abroad to health officials,” she says.

An ASHA worker’s rapport with the people in her neighbourhood has come in handy in this situation, Ms. Varghese says. “People are likely to open up to us. We stand as pillars of strength and support for those who are isolated,” she says. Their familiarity, along with that of anganwadi workers and Kudumbashree groups, leads teams of volunteers and other health officials through localities.

This was the first instance of such a large workload falling upon them all at once, Ms. Varghese said, but the all-women team of 2,372 ASHA workers in the district has got it under control. Over 3,800 persons are in home quarantine in the district.

While some public health centres and taluk hospitals have helped out with masks, most ASHA workers either have to purchase masks and sanitisers for themselves, or are drawing on what they had stocked up during the Nipah scare.

With food being prepared at community kitchens, ASHA workers have also been distributing food packets, particularly to migrant workers, said Latha Raju, an ASHA worker at Thattazham, Kochi. There are 220 ASHA workers in 70 divisions of the Kochi Corporation, while four divisions have none.

Often their honorarium of ₹4,500 per month is delayed by two or three months, which might have led to some women dropping work, Ms. Varghese said. The amount from the past three months was deposited only recently, and the delay usually results in financial problems for women whose families depend entirely on them, she said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/7hu6ng/article31195769.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29-KI-ASHAjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/covid-19-fight-brings-out-the-best-in-asha-workers/article31195770.ece
336,2020/03/29,"Cyberdome, start-up to launch app for door delivery of essentials","Customers can identify shops offering door delivery on Shops App

In their efforts to keep people indoors as much as possible, the Kerala Police, through its Cyberdome, have tied up with a start-up to launch a mobile and web-based application for door delivery of essential items.

Shops App, a shops aggregate platform developed by Inventlabs Innovations, offers separate logins for merchants and customers. “So far, nearly 300 merchants from across the State have enlisted themselves and added their inventories in the app. They also demarcate their respective areas within which home delivery will be available,” said Gopikrishna V.M., founder of the start-up.

As such, customers will be able to identify shops offering door delivery. They will also be able to track the status of their orders with live tracking, which is also on the anvil.

“We were in the process of developing the app, and its launch coincided with the national lockdown following which we decided to work in partnership with the Cyberdome. The services for customers and merchants will be free as long as the association with the Cyberdome continues after which customers will continue to enjoy free service, while merchants will have to pay for the service,” said Mr. Gopikrishna.

The developers are also working towards facilitating a separate login for volunteers, both individuals and organisations like residents’ associations and Kudumbashree, engaged in supplying food or provisions to the needy.

The volunteer login will be subject to verification by the police. Once that service is up, customers can place orders, and volunteers will fetch them and deliver goods at their doorstep.

The app is available on Google Play Store and will be shortly made available on App Store. The web application for merchants is ready, and its customer version will be launched shortly.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/cyberdome-start-up-to-launch-app-for-door-delivery-of-essentials/article31195717.ece
337,2020/03/29,Treatment facilities to be ramped up in Ernakulam,"Collector told to take over pvt. hospital at Mattancherry for COVID-19 treatment

Treatment facilities and monitoring are likely to be ramped up in the district following the death of a 69-year-old COVID-19 positive patient here on Saturday.

At a meeting held in the city, Minister for Agriculture V.S. Sunil Kumar directed District Collector S. Suhas to take over a private hospital at Mattancherry as a COVID-19 care centre to strengthen the availability of treatment facilities in the district.

Health officials will gather details and assess symptoms of all patients admitted to hospitals across the district with fever and breathing difficulties in the past seven days. Henceforth, the Health Department will also take stock of and evaluate all deaths at hospitals in the district. Arrangements are being made at PVS Hospital, which the district administration had recently taken over as a COVID-19 care centre, and it is likely to begin functioning soon.

Meanwhile, the Collector warned that strict action would be taken against private hospitals refusing treatment to patients with fever and cough.

There have been complaints that some private hospitals are directing patients with such symptoms to the Government Medical College at Kalamassery.

338,2020/03/29,"Call for steps to ensure food, safe stay for migrant workers","Govt. decision to entrust employers with the job draws flak

The government’s decision to entrust the responsibility of feeding migrant workers stranded in the State, owing to the lockdown, with their employers or owners of buildings where they stay has drawn flak from a few quarters. A memorandum sent to the Chief Minister signed by prominent personalities like K. Sachidanandan, K. Venu, and Sara Joseph called for practical arrangements to ensure food and safe accommodation for migrant workers. It demanded that the Revenue Department in association with the local bodies concerned ensure supply of food to migrant workers.

A notice issued by a panchayat in the Perumbavoor region, one of the most migrant-intense areas in the State, and accessed by The Hindu put the onus of feeding migrant workers either on employers or building owners. When contacted, the panchayat secretary concerned said the notice was issued on the direction of the District Collector. In fact, when migrants in a ward in the panchayat complained of not receiving food on Saturday, the panchayat and police authorities intervened, ensuring that the building owner made the necessary provisions available.

“There are around 25 lakh migrant workers in the State, and entrusting the supply of food to them with employers and building owners alone may not be practical. For instance, many rent out small shelters to migrants to supplement their income, and they may not be in a position to buy food for their tenants. Also, they now run the risk of facing police cases on that account,” said George Mathew, secretary, of Progressive Workers’ Organisation, which works for the welfare of migrants.

The memorandum pointed out that the task of identifying migrant labour-intense areas and timely supply of food must be entrusted with ward members and local body officials. The services of Kudumbashree members and workers under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme may also be availed for the purpose. The process should be monitored by the District Collector, labour officers, and health inspectors.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/call-for-steps-to-ensure-food-safe-stay-for-migrant-workers/article31195696.ece
339,2020/03/29,Traders unsure of replenishing stocks,"Apprehension over possible community spread of COVID-19

Fears of a possible community spread of COVID-19 have left a section of traders in a fix as they are not certain if they should replenish shelves in the pandemic situation.

Though customers are enquiring over phone about availability of stocks, several traders feel the number of people venturing out of homes may witness a dip in the coming days.

The owner of a retail outlet of a company selling broiler chicken said he was not in a position to take risk by opting for replenishment of stocks. “I had downed shutters as the situation worsened over the past one week. Sales too had dipped. But I am getting calls from customers enquiring about the availability of the product, especially after the bird flu scare subsided,” he added.

He is one among the many traders who are apprehensive about how the COVID-19 situation will emerge in the next two weeks. “I have come across reports on the likelihood of community spread as well as those ruling it out. In the absence of clarity, I am yet to decide on ordering fresh stocks,” he said.

Fruit vendors too seem reluctant to re-fill stocks. “We are already facing a decline in supplies from wholesale dealers. I am planning to clear the available stock before placing fresh orders. Moreover, the demand for fruits has come down,” said a vendor at Aluva.

Meanwhile, vegetable vendors on Saturday said there had been a minor improvement in the arrival of stocks from Tamil Nadu. Several shops have started displaying price boards as directed by the authorities. But small-time vendors demanded that the authorities ensure availability of adequate stock and that steps be taken to check price rise.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/traders-unsure-of-replenishing-stocks/article31195631.ece
340,2020/03/29,Steps being taken to control overpricing in Kozhikode,"Civil Supplies officials inspect shops following complaints from public

The Department of Civil Supplies and civic bodies have a hard time controlling overpricing of commodities in the district and are taking desperate measures to bring the situation under control.

Despite repeated warnings to traders against increasing prices by more than 20% of wholesale prices, the department is still receiving complaints from the public. Fluctuation in wholesale prices do not help either.

Kozhikode Mayor Thottathil Raveendran had met wholesale merchants at Valiyangadi on Saturday to discuss the matter. And, the merchants had agreed to submit the wholesale price list of commodities every morning to the corporation. The lists will be exhibited in front of all supply stores. Middlemen can sell supplies by charging 3% to 5% more than the wholesale prices. Grassroots-level vendors can sell commodities by charging 15% to 20% extra. The civic body will take action based on the list every day, Corporation Secretary Binu Francis said.

Meanwhile, Civil Supplies officials are conducting regular inspections at independent shops and market places on the basis of complaints. The department has instructed merchants not to charge more than ₹30 per kg for banana, ₹60 for green chillies and ₹38 for Kuruva rice. Chicken should not be charged more than ₹120 per kg, the Vadakara taluk Civil Supplies officer said in a press release.

Panic buying down

Panic buying in the district following the declaration of the national lockdown has largely come down thanks to market intervention by the district administration to ensure sufficient stock of essential commodities in wholesale and retail markets.

Revenue officials said special squads comprising officials of Civil Supplies and Legal Metrology departments were on the field to closely monitor market trends. Since grocery shops and bakeries function till 5 p.m., there is also no major rush, they pointed out. Besides, two special control rooms are functional in the district to ensure sufficient availability of commodities and their trouble-free transportation from other districts or States.

Customers who have complaints about unfair pricing can contact the district-level helpline (9188527400) for spot action.

Though the heightened regulations on inter-State boarders were a cause for concern in the initial days of the lockdown, they were relaxed to a great extent to facilitate uninterrupted movement of goods carries. The shortage of vegetables and fruits too has been addressed, officials claimed.

A wholesale grocery shop owner near West Hill in the city said the unhealthy trend of purchasing huge quantities of essential commodities, especially rice and other food grain, had largely come down as customers were convinced of the availability of sufficient stock in the market. “We are also not short of any items as inter-State goods movement is smooth,” he said.

Vendors too expressed satisfaction over the availability of essential commodities from wholesale suppliers. Padmanabhan, a retail rice trader at Puthiyangadi in the city, said customers who earlier depended on supermarkets were now happy to approach even smaller shops.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ualg35/article28394341.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Copyof11ctasG7P651ODG3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/steps-being-taken-to-control-overpricing-in-kozhikode/article31201541.ece

342,2020/03/29,Activists seek bail for political prisoners,"‘COVID-19 outbreak an occasion to look at overcrowded prisons in country’

A group of activists and intellectuals has sought bail or parole for political prisoners lodged in various jails.

In a letter to the Central and State governments, eminent persons such as writers Arundhati Roy, K. Satchidanandan and Meena Kandasamy, journalist B.R.P. Bhaskar and academics Dilip Menon and Benjamin Zachariah pointed out that the COVID-19 outbreak was also an occasion to look at the overcrowded prisons in the country.

Quoting the India Justice Report 2019, they said that the national average of occupancy in prisons is 114% of their capacity. The outbreak of a pandemic will have disastrous impact in a closed environment such as a prison even in normal conditions. The report also stated that over 67% of prisoners in the country belonged to the category of under-trial prisoners, those in custody awaiting “investigation, inquiry or trial”.

Citing the Supreme Court direction to the State governments to consider granting bail to remand prisoners accused of committing crimes punishable with a maximum of seven years imprisonment, the letter said that the apex court had also asked the State governments to form a high-powered committee to examine the possibility of releasing convicted prisoners and other remand prisoners on parole.

Noting that many of the political prisoners have served more than five years in prison without any clarity on commencement of trial in these cases, it said that in Maharashtra, former Delhi University Professor G.N. Saibaba, poet Varavara Rao, Shoma Sen, and Sudha Bharadwaj and several others elderly and afflicted from ailments were in jail. In Tamil Nadu, Padma and Veeramony, also suffering from various illnesses and old age, were in jail, the letter stated, adding that a number of political prisoners in remand who had got bail in a number of cases were still imprisoned.

For example, 65-year-old Ibrahim, a chronic diabetic also suffering from cardiac problems, has been in jail in Kerala for more than five years. Danish, another prisoner in the high security prison at Viyyur in Thrissur suffering from acute urinary infections, was still in jail despite gaining bail in all cases, the letter said.

Poor facilities

Many jails in the country do not have proper hospitals, adequate doctors or treatment facilities, and the prisoners have no option other than the overstretched public health system outside in case of an emergency. The Central and State governments should initiate steps to provide bail or parole to all political prisoners on a priority basis along with other prisoners, the letter added.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/activists-seek-bail-for-political-prisoners/article31195712.ece

Collector Prashant M Wadnere on Sunday said that so far 50 out of the 53 patients who had symptoms of COVID-19 have tested negative. Results of three more patients were awaited.

Meanwhile, there were three deaths reported in the Asaripallam Government Medical College Hospital on Saturday.

While the patients had underlying conditions, they were kept in isolation rooms and wards. The hospital had exclusive rooms to treat and observe patients with respiratory infections. The doctors kept such patients in SARI (severe acute respiratory infection) wards

Stating that even the hospital authorities were awaiting the reports for the death of three patients of isolation ward to know whether or not the death was due to COVID-19, he expressed concern over satellite television channels and social media saying that the death was due to Corona Virus.

He appealed to the media persons to cross-check on such sensitive issues with officials designated for this purpose before making it public.

The Collector further said that elaborate arrangements had been made to test all the persons who crossed the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border. Special check posts manned with round-the-clock health workers kept monitoring on the persons. He urged the public to cooperate with the health teams.

The district administration had also formed nine committees headed by officers in the rank of deputy collectors to monitor COVID-19 related issues, which include coordinating with private hospitals for earmarking exclusive wards for admission of patients who had symptoms of COVID-19 virus, distribution of food and other relief materials to the needy in coordination with NGOs, to send daily status reports to the State Control Room on the progress and movement of people in the district, Mr. Prashant Wadnere said.

To a query, he said that with curfew in vogue, many motorists were seen on public places without any purpose. Hence, the police have booked cases against 237 persons.

Workers of Manjolai tea estate, who have already received the essential commodities through the ration shops in the hilly region, would get their quota of essential commodities for April soon along with the relief measures announced by the government, officials here said.

Senior revenue and civil supplies officers said the essential commodities meant for the month of March had been disbursed to 700-odd cardholders in Manjolai tea estate area through 3 ration shops there and the stocks for the month of April had already been sent there. Along with the relief announced by the government, the essential commodities would be given to the ration cardholders as decided by the Collector.

“Private grocery shops in Manjolai tea estate area had exhausted their stocks. As transport had been stopped everywhere in the wake of COVID – 19 scare, the public cannot get the grocery items now. Since the tea estate administration has come forward to organise a vehicle to transport the grocery items to Manjolai tea estate, this problem may be sorted out within a day or two depending upon the convenience of these shopkeepers,” the officials said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/tea-estate-workers-will-get-essential-items-for-april-soon/article31199836.ece

Stating that the employees in the public distribution system (PDS) outlets may be at a great risk, Tamil Nadu PDS Employees Welfare Association State president Palraj said that they would hence not distribute ₹ 1,000 cash relief and essential commodities to the cardholders from April 2 as announced by the Chief Minister.

Speaking to reporters here on Sunday, Mr. Palraj said that there were 31,640 PDS outlets across various districts in the State. Around 40,000 employees worked in these outlets.

When the COVID-19 pandemic was threatening the mankind, the salesmen at the PDS outlets may be at a very big risk exposing themselves to the people. The crowds may throng the outlets and a meagre number or presence of fewer police personnel would not be sufficient to maintain personal distancing.

Hence, Mr. Palraj appealed to the government to postpone the decision to distribute doles to the people after the curfew was lifted. In the event of the government's insistence, he hinted that they may approach the court for relief.

The State government had announced to give away a cash relief of ₹ 1,000 and other essential commodities, including rice, dhal through the PDS outlets to rice card holders from April 2 to 15.

A Collector of one of the southern districts said that the government’s announcement was in public interest.

Elaborate arrangements had already been made to avoid crowding, steps taken to issue tokens street wise/ward-wise in every ration shop.

As a measure to reduce the crowding of people while buying vegetables at Uzhavar Sandhais (farmers’ market) to prevent spread of COVID-19 pandemic, ‘vegetable kits’ were introduced on a trial basis at two markets in Theni district on Sunday.

The kits were introduced in the Uzhavar Sandhais organised at John Pennycuick Bus Stand and C.P.U. Higher Secondary School in Cumbum.

Each ‘vegetable kit’ consisted of a total of 18 vegetables weighing around five kg. It was sold at ₹ 150 and had all essential vegetables, including tomato, onion, potato and other green leafy vegetables.

A. Albert Robinson, Deputy Director of Agriculture, said that every day around 3,000 customers walk into each of these markets to buy vegetables.

“We took this initiative as we thought that customers need not visit multiple shops to buy all the essential vegetables. Also, this will help in faster movement of customers and thereby prevent any crowding inside the market,” he said.

Mr. Robinson added that 20 ‘vegetable kits’ were introduced at these two markets on Sunday and half of them were sold. “We are planning to continue selling these kits and gradually will increase the number of kits depending on the demand from customers,” he said.

R. Paneerselvam, Administrative officer of the Uzhavar Sandhai at the bus stand, said that circles and squares had been drawn using white chalk in front of shops to maintain personal distancing between customers.

Collector R. Kannan said all the residents within a radius of 5 km around the house of the COVID-19 patient are being covered by the survey.

Around 100 workers, including village health nurse, urban health nurse, anganwadi, malaria and sanitary workers, have been engaged in the survey. The exercise is likely to be completed by afternoon.

The workers have been provided with masks as a precautionary measure.

Adequate stock of masks have been given to them for distributing among people found having cough to further prevent spreading of the virus.

Similarly sanitary workers from Rajapalayam municipality and neighbouring panchayats have started disinfecting work.

Mr Kannan said that the officials has narrowed down that the infection caused to the the middle aged man from Rajapalayam was from a few guests who had arrived from Amsterdam and Germany to attend his family function. The guests had stayed in his house.

349,2020/03/29,People throng markets; neglect COVID warnings,"Authorities appeal to them to stay home

Tirunelveli

Even as the district administrations of Tirunelveli, Tenkasi, Thoothukudi and Kanniyakumari, ably supported by doctors, para-medical teams and health workers were working hard to save the people from the COVID-19 pandemic and appealed to them to stay in their homes, large movement of public on Sunday, shattered the officials and kept the police on toes.

Brushing aside all the precautionsair, residents thronged meat shops in Tirunelveli from as early as 7 a.m. As a result, a very few police personnel, who were on duty at that hour, remained helpless. Though some of the shopkeepers attempted to regulate the crowd, it appeared to have fallen on deaf ears, a policeman said.

If it was bad here, the situation looked worse in the neighbouring Thoothukudi district, where the residents surrounded fish markets. All the circles and boxes, which were formed on the ground as part of personal distancing were neglected by the consumers.

When police personnel attempted to regulate, many consumers, not in a mood to obey, only tried to move forward and thronged the shops. For at least, three hours, the residents were seen arriving in large numbers on two-wheelers and in their cars.

The consumers were heard telling the police personnel that they had come out only to purchase essentials and the curfew was lifted from 6.30 a.m. to 2.30 p.m., However, when police explained to them to maintain distance, they refused to do so. Only at around noon, did the crowds disperse as the meat and fish were sold out.

Health workers were concerned about such a huge turnout and hoped the administration took a stern action. Expecting the public to adhere to self-discipline would not work. The officials should deploy more policemen and impose fines on the shopkeepers for allowing such crowds in the markets.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/1dvd88/article31199461.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA30TVL-MARKET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/people-throng-markets-neglect-covid-warnings/article31199462.ece
350,2020/03/29,Freshly plucked ‘Madurai Malli’ goes to compost bin,"Farmers are clueless as the Mattuthavani flower market remaining closed since Sunday

Madurai

In the last two day, P. Ganapathi, a farmer in Madurai district's Mela Urulikundu village, has plucked and thrown 60 kg of ‘Madurai Malli’ that was harvested from his field into his compost bin.

With the flower market in Mattuthavani being closed since Sunday, farmers growing a variety of flowers including jasmine, samandi, arali say that they are clueless about what to do with the flowers blooming in their fields.

Several farmers from Dindigul and Sivaganga lament that the flowers are turning brown and losing their fragrance. Since flowers last a maximum of three days in cold storage, they say that they are going to face nothing but losses this season.

S. Chandra, a farmer from Sivaganga district's Melakadu village near Nattarasankottai, says that she is yet to pluck the ‘samanthi’ flowers in her field. “The Tamil month of Chithirai is when there are several temple festivals and weddings. I am frustrated because some small-scale weddings are taking place in and around our district but we are unable to transport and sell our produce because of the strict restrictions,” she says.

She adds that since the announcement of the lockdown, she has had no income to support her family of four.

Mr. Ganapathi says that those producing jasmine need to pluck the flowers everyday. “The plant will not produce as much as it currently does otherwise. We cannot let it sit,” he says.

“To see all our labour and handwork literally going into the bin is heartbreaking,” he says.

Another jasmine farmer A. Jeyakodi says that almost all farmers had borrowed heavily when they began cultivation. “How will we ever repay our debts?,” he asked.

President of Madurai Meenakshi Sundareswarar Malar Makkal Nala Sangam, 'Pookadai' S. Ramachandran, says that the Mattuthavanai market on a regular day, used to receive a total of 20 tonnes of flowers.

“From Chandra's village alone, we would get 1,000 kg. This is usually the time when the market is upbeat. But now all of us are at home. Authorities are asking us to value our lives over our flowers but flowers only give us life,” he says.

He adds that arrangements must be made by various district administrations in South Tamil Nadu to ensure that flowers can at least be transported to scent factories.

An official from the Horticulture department in Madurai said that talks were on to ensure that three trucks pick up flowers from Usilampatti and Tirumangalam areas and transport it to two scent factories in Nilakottai, Dindigul district. “However, we have to get permission from the Tamil Nadu government to ensure that the factories can run with minimum staff and that the pick-up trucks can cross borders. Another problem is that scent factories pay very poorly compared to market prices. Farmers must prepare themselves for some difficult times,” the officer says.

Mr. Ramachandran says that three trucks can only carry three tonnes of flowers. Some farmers may not even have an equal shot at getting a meagre income. “If there are 10-15 trucks that function, we can somehow arrange for the farmers to transport their flowers to a common drop location each day and get enough to earn for our families,” he says.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/fqb9ep/article31198882.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA30CITY-FLOWER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/freshly-plucked-madurai-malli-goes-to-compost-bin/article31198883.ece
351,2020/03/29,Major fire at Madurai godown put out after three hours,"An electrical short circuit is suspected to have triggered the blaze at the three-storey building near Sarveswar Temple

A major fire broke out at the godown where pain balm and consumer goods were stocked in huge quantity in Anna Nagar in Madurai here on Sunday morning.

Fire and Rescue services personnel fought for more than three hours to put out the flames.

Though the exact cause of the fire is not known, an electrical short circuit is suspected to have triggered the blaze.

The police said that thick smoke emanating from the ground floor of the three-storey building near Sarveswar Temple.

“We noticed smoke billowing out of the godown around 8.00 a.m. When we tried to open the shutter, heavy smoke started coming out and we immediately alerted the fire service personnel,” said N. Palanivel Murugan, 45, a resident one of the houses in the building.

Fire and Rescue services personnel led by district fire officer S. Kalyanakumar rushed to the spot but because of heavy smoke caused by chemicals the men could not go near the source of fire, the DFO said.

The firemen drilled holes on the walls and used smoke extractors to get rid of the black smoke before using fire tenders and foam tenders rushed from Madurai, Tallakulam and Anuppanadi fire stations.

The fire was put out around 11.30 a.m.

352,2020/03/29,‘Waive interest on working capital’,"The Madurai District Tiny and Small Scale Industries Association said that although the Reserve Bank of India has announced the moratorium for repayment of term loan and EMIs, they are yet to waive interest on working capital and term loan at least for another six months.

In a press statement, the association said the current time period set for the deferment of interest on working capital is three months. However, no micro, small or medium industry has been functioning for the past 10 days and they cannot resume a regular production at least for another three weeks.

“We are compelled to pay full salary to our workers which we accept as our moral responsibility. In these circumstances mere deferment of interest will not be sufficient to rejuvenate the ailing MSMEs.”

Since the CoVID-19 pandemic has had a serious impact on the MSME sector, it needed a special incentive package.

Otherwise it would adversely affect the economy and lead to large-scale unemployment.

Moreover, big business houses and distributors must help small units continue their business for their mutual benefit and extend the credit time limit by 60 days so that they can settle their purchase bills, the statement added.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/plea-for-waiver-of-interest-on-working-capital/article31196608.ece
353,2020/03/29,‘Kerala should make arrangements totreat its patients within its borders’,"‘China carried out cluster lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19’

Employed in Mangaluru, A. Balan is worried that he can’t bring his father, a heart patient, from Payyanur in Kerala for further medical check-up at a hospital here as all 21 border places in Dakshina Kannada have been closed down in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Even ambulances from Kerala are being turned away.

“My father underwent an angioplasty in a hospital in the city a decade ago. Another angioplasty was done at the same hospital about three months ago. He came here for a check-up about 10 days ago. I have to bring him again to the same doctor for another check-up this week. I am worried now,” the told The Hindu pointing out that the Talapady check-post on National Highway 66 has been sealed for passenger vehicles, as only goods vehicles are being allowed to operate.

“How do I take him to another doctor now, as the doctor here has been treating my father for the last one decade?” he asked. “It is unfair that even ambulances are not being allowed to enter the borders to reach Mangaluru,” he said.

Mr. Balan said that after an ambulance was turned away on Friday at the Kerala border a woman was delivered of a baby onboard. An elderly woman died in a hospital in Kasaragod on Saturday after the ambulance carrying her was denied entry at Talapady, he said.

There are many heart and cancer patients from North Kerala who regularly visit Mangaluru to meet their regular doctors. Now, such patients are being denied entry at the borders to prevent the spread of COVID-19. “Many people like me are worried,” he said.

Govt. move justified

Justifying the government’s decision, a senior physician, who has been in the forefront in the fight against communicable diseases in the city and who did not want his name to be mentioned, said that the government is taking steps similar to what China did in Wuhan.

“China carried out cluster lockdown to prevent the migration of people from regions which reported positive cases. The Karnataka government is doing the same thing here by closing down the borders as a precaution,” he said.

Another private family physician in the city who concurred with the government’s ban said: “You don't know whether the patient or his caretakers are infected. To save the life of such patients, we cannot run the risk of endangering the lives of others,” he said.

The two doctors said that Kerala should make arrangements for cardiac, cancer and other patients from North Kerala requiring regular treatment within its borders. The follow-up treatment can be devised by doctors in Kerala in consultation with doctors from Mangaluru who have been treating such patients.

“This is a scientific way of looking at the issue, which unfortunately is being politicised,” a physician said.

Dakshina Kannada Member of Parliament Nalin Kumar Kateel and Minister in-charge of Dakshina Kannada Kota Srinivasa Poojary told reporters here on Sunday that the State government will not allow even ambulances from Kerala to enter Mangaluru. There is no change in the stand. “Even Chief Minister B.S.

The closure of Karnataka-Kerala State border at 21 places has now taken a controversial turn after an ambulance from Kerala was denied entry into Mangaluru resulting in the death of an ailing woman, later in a hospital in Kasaragod (Kerala) on Saturday.

The ambulance was not allowed to enter Mangaluru at Talapady check post, about 17 km away from Mangaluru city, on Kasaragod-Mangaluru national highway No. 66 on Saturday evening.

It was shifting a 70-year-old woman from Kunjathur in Kerala to a hospital in Mangaluru as she needed medical help urgently.

Kunjathur in Kerala is closer to Mangaluru in Karnataka than Kasaragod.

The woman, Pathumi, a native of B C Road had been to her grand daughter’s house in a village near Kunjathur in Kerala, the ambulance driver Aslam Kunjathur told The Hindu on Sunday.

“I reached Talapady check post at 6 p.m. where I was denied entry. Then I went to Kedambady to enter Karnataka where the natives blocked the movement. I dropped the woman back to her granddaughter’s house around 7.30 p.m.” he said.

Sources said that the woman was later taken to a hospital in Kasaragod where she died.

Dakshina Kannada district administration has sealed the Karnataka-Kerala borders to prevent the spread of COVID-19 cases. In many places soil has been dumped across the road to prevent the movement of vehicles.

The movement of trucks and lorries carrying essential commodities between Karala and Karnataka are allowed only through Talapady check post on NH 66.

358,2020/03/29,Coronavirus | Why has Kerala sought a relaxation of Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management rules?,"When can norms of the FRBM Act be flexible? How will it help?

The story so far: Kerala was one of the earliest States to announce an economic package of ₹20,000 crore to mitigate the impact on livelihoods and overall economic activity from the sweeping steps taken to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, including the latest 21-day nationwide lockdown. Explaining the rationale for the package, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote in the The Hindu (March 27, 2020): “While we enforce the lockdown in all its seriousness, we should not lose sight of the other major challenge in front of us. India has a high share of poor in its population, most of whom suffer from multiple economic and social deprivations. They earn their livelihoods from the informal and unorganised sectors, where there is neither job security nor continuity of income flows. Their livelihoods have to be protected through the lockdown period.” To help fund the emergency relief package, the State proposes to borrow as much as ₹12,500 crore from the market in April itself and the Chief Minister has urged the Centre to provide Kerala with flexibility under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act so as to ensure that the State’s finances are not adversely impacted in the rest of the financial year starting on April 1.

What is the FRBM Act?

Enacted in August 2003, the legislation is aimed at making the Central government responsible for ensuring “inter-generational equity in fiscal management and long-term macro-economic stability”. In other words, the current generation of the country’s administrators must ensure that their management of the country’s finances, both in terms of expenditure and revenue, does not leave future generations saddled with the burden of having to service unsustainably high levels of inherited debt that would in turn affect their ability to provide a stable economic environment for contemporary society. To achieve this, the Act envisages the setting of limits on the Central government’s debt and deficits as well as mandating greater transparency in fiscal operations of the Central government and the conduct of fiscal policy in a medium-term framework. The rules for implementing the Act were notified in July 2004 and since then every Budget of the Union government has included a Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement that specifies the annual revenue and fiscal deficit goals over a three-year horizon. The government also uses the Budget to spell out the longer-term glide path to achieve the key objective of reducing the fiscal deficit to 3% of GDP within a specified time frame — one that has shifted from the initial goal of March 31, 2009, to March 31, 2021, when the rules were amended in 2018, and most recently to the setting of a target of 3.1% for March 2023.

To ensure that the States too are financially prudent, the 12th Finance Commission’s recommendations in 2004 linked debt relief to States with their enactment of similar laws. The States have since enacted their own respective Financial Responsibility Legislation, which sets the same 3% of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) cap on their annual budget deficits.

Why is Kerala seeking flexibility under the FRBM?

Kerala’s current fiscal position means that it can borrow about ₹25,000 crore during the financial year 2020-21. Now, given that it proposes to raise half that amount of debt in the very first month of the new financial year, the State government is understandably concerned that the stringent borrowing cap under the fiscal responsibility laws should not constrain its borrowing and spending ability over the remaining 11 months — a period when it would not only need to continue with its COVID-19 mitigation measures but would also have to meet other expenditure for routine affairs related to the running of the State’s socio-economic programmes as well as the post pandemic recovery.

How does a relaxation of the FRBM work?

The law does contain what is commonly referred to as an ‘escape clause’. Under Section 4(2) of the Act, the Centre can exceed the annual fiscal deficit target citing grounds that include national security, war, national calamity, collapse of agriculture, structural reforms and decline in real output growth of a quarter by at least three percentage points below the average of the previous four quarters.

Given that the ongoing pandemic could be considered as a national calamity — which in conjunction with the ongoing lockdown to combat it is in all likelihood going to cause a severe contraction in economic output as well — the current circumstances would be apt for suspending both the Centre’s and States’ fiscal deficit targets. This would allow both the Union government and States including Kerala to undertake the much-needed increases in expenditure to meet the extraordinary circumstances.

When have the FRBM norms been relaxed in the past?

There have been several instances of the FRBM goals being reset. Most recently, presenting the Budget for 2020-21 in February, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had cited the recent reductions in corporate tax as structural reforms that would trigger the escape clause enabling the government to recalibrate the fiscal deficit target for 2019-20 to 3.8%, from the budgeted 3.3%. The spillover impact of the reforms would also necessitate a reset for 2020-21: from the earlier deficit target of 3% to 3.5%.

But the most significant FRBM deviation happened in 2008-09, in the wake of the global financial crisis, when the Centre resorted to a focused fiscal stimulus: tax relief to boost demand and increased expenditure on public projects to create employment and public assets, to counter the fallout of the global slowdown. This led to the fiscal deficit climbing to 6.2%, from a budgeted goal of 2.7%.

Simultaneously, the deficit goals for the States too were relaxed to 3.5% of GSDP for 2008-09 and 4% of GSDP for fiscal 2009-10.

The precedents are there and given the unprecedented nature of the pandemic and its devastating impact on the global economy, another significant deviation from the FRBM norms is very likely in the current and next fiscal years.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/5apg8h/article31194487.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29THiStock-931658480,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/coronavirus-why-has-kerala-sought-a-relaxation-of-fiscal-responsibility-and-budget-management-rules/article31194488.ece
359,2020/03/29,Coronavirus | Why has the stock market been so volatile?,"How long will the bear phase last?

The story so far: On Friday, even after the Reserve Bank of India announced a slew of measures to boost the economy in the time of a pandemic, shares fell 1% to close at 29,416 points. The stock market has seen a lot of volatility with the benchmark Sensex having fallen as much as almost 40% from the highs it touched in January.

Where was the Sensex in January?

On January 20, the Sensex touched an all time intra-day record high of 42,274 from where it fell a massive 16,635 points to touch a 52-week intra-day low of 25,639 points on March 24. This assumes significance as a fall of over 20% is typically looked upon as a bear phase in the markets. While the 30-share barometer has recovered 4,177 points or 16% from the lows, it is still experiencing a lot of volatility with underlying weakness. Incidentally, the India VIX index, which is considered a measure of near-term volatility in the market, has surged more than six times this year, rising from 11.7 in December to the current levels of 70.4. The intensity of the fall can be further gauged from the fact that the current month has seen the indices hitting their lower circuit breaker of 10% on two occasions while registering some of the biggest single-day falls as well.

What is the reason for the huge plunge?

The single biggest reason of the ongoing volatility and fall is the global coronavirus pandemic. In India, the number of coronavirus cases stand at a shade below 1,000 (as on March 28) even as the country is in the midst of a 21-day lockdown as part of the government’s attempts to curb the spread. The pandemic has led to concerns that global economic growth will get deeply affected. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has already said that the world has entered a recession that is as bad or worse as 2008 when the global financial crisis happened. In India, investor concerns have led to foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) selling equities worth nearly ₹60,000 crore in the current month, the highest ever single month sales by overseas investors.

Is selling happening across all sectors?

An across-the-board selling frenzy has gripped the markets with no sector insulated from the sell-off. Banking and financials, however, have borne the brunt as investors believe that the economic impact of the pandemic will lead to a rise in bad debts of such entities. Sector heavyweights such as HDFC, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, State Bank of India, IndusInd Bank and Bajaj Finance, all part of the Sensex, have fallen significantly with some currently trading near multi-year lows. Automobile stocks have also been among the worst hit as most plants are shut on account of the lockdown. Some of the pharmaceutical and fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) stocks have been able to stem the fall to a limited extent though they are currently significantly lower compared to their highs.

Is anything being done to address investor concerns?

Globally, governments and regulators are taking initiatives in the form of stimulus measures to support the economy. For instance, the U.S. Senate and House have approved a $2-trillion coronavirus relief package. Earlier, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a $700-billion stimulus package. In India, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the key interest rate sharply by 75 basis points and allowed equated monthly instalments (EMIs) to be deferred by three months. The repo rate has been reduced by 75 bps while the reverse repo rate has been cut by 90 bps. Further, the cash reserve ratio has also been reduced that will release ₹1.37-lakh crore liquidity. Cumulatively, the RBI measures will lead to an infusion of ₹3.74-lakh crore into the banking system. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), on its part, has relaxed many compliance requirements while tightening the norms for short selling and margins to ensure the smooth functioning of the equity markets.

What is the outlook?

The consensus estimate is pessimistic due to the lack of any positive triggers. While policy makers worldwide are trying to provide stimulus, the uncertainty around the pandemic has made investors risk averse. They feel that since the current crisis is not due to a liquidity crunch, as was the case during the Lehman crisis, it is difficult to counter it with mere liquidity infusion. Most analysts expect the pandemic to affect corporate earnings over the next few quarters. Global financial major Morgan Stanley has lowered its year-end Sensex target by a little over 11% to 32,000, from the earlier 36,000, even as it believes that the current bear phase in the stock market is close to its bottom. Analysts are unanimous in their view that the pandemic will hit India’s growth rate and hence risky assets like equities are seeing a sell-off from investors across categories.",markets,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/8r3c9i/article31194420.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29THiStock-1212665854,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/coronavirus-why-has-the-stock-market-been-so-volatile/article31194421.ece
