Ways to stay less distracted while working from home

Visual arts and chat session to spread awareness about COVID-19

Government of India releases comic book to educate children

In the midst of these gloomy times, art has been a voice of reassurance for many. And artists around the world are finding different ways to create more awareness about hygiene as well as spread cheer and positivity among the young and old. We bring you a string of artworks that are both quirky and informative…US-based illustrator Nivya Kuriakose’s comic strip reflects on the current situation. “As an artist, I think, this is the least I could do to spread some awareness. So, I decided to present the basic tips to prevent the spreading of COVID-19 in a fun manner, which will attract people’s attention. So far, a lot of people have responded to it, saying it’s both useful and funny,” says NivyaThe work-from-home scenario amid the pandemic serves as the inspiration for Bengaluru-based illustrator Alicia Souza latest artworks. Interestingly, she has been working from home for almost a decade now. “There are so many people I know who are struggling to work from home amid the lockdown, because they are not used to this regime. Since I have been doing this for a while, over time I have developed habits that help you become less distracted and more productive. My latest illustration focuses on those easy-to-acquire habits,” explains Alicia.Artist-activist Baadal Nanjundaswamy, who is known for his pothole art, recently took to social media to spread awareness about COVID-19. “My art talks concentrates on the fact that the coronavirus recognises no border, and that it can affect anyone. As an artist, I feel, it is easier to spread awareness through visual art, since the message gets across more quickly and convincingly. It is one of the best ways to educate people, especially kids, who are more attracted to visuals.”Even the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has found a way to educate kids through comics. They have released a book, titled Kids, Vaayu & Corona. The narrative follows the life of a superhero, named Vaayu, who helps kids to understand what coronavirus is and how it can be kept away. In the book, Vaayu repeatedly tells youngsters not to panic and educates them about social distancing and maintaining hygiene. This book has been conceptualised and written by Dr Ravindra Khaiwal, Additional Professor of Environmental Health — PGIMER — Chandigarh, and Dr Suman Mor, Associate Professor and Chairperson, Department of Environment Studies, Panjab University, while the illustrations are by Sonali Verma and Shruti Govil from Panjab University.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/artists-across-the-globe-raise-awareness-about-covid-19/articleshow/74828951.cms
1,['27/03/2020'],"I’ve been in quarantine since I returned home, says Nidhi Subbaiah","When Nidhi Subbaiah went to New York earlier this year, she was looking forward to enriching her craft by attending a few intensive courses, among others, and was all set to return home in time for the Ugadi celebrations. But then, the coronavirus pandemic took hold of the world, and all her plans went topsy-turvy. The actress was hopeful of sticking to her original travel plan, but had to make last minute changes when she heard of flight operations being suspended in India.“I was in New York on March 19, when I heard about restrictions on international flights landing in India from March 22. That meant that I just had one day to find a flight and return home before the ban. I frantically looked up flights and found two Air India flights with lots of seats available. But by the time I got to the payment page of the booking, there were only two seats left on one flight, while the other was no longer available. Luckily, I managed to get a seat,” she says.The rest of the day, adds Nidhi, was nothing short of a blur, as she went into a mad rush of packing and weighing bags. “At the airport, the Air India gate was packed, the line was pretty long, but fast moving. After 15 long hours and lots of controversy theories about how they won’t let people out of the Mumbai airport and how they’re being shipped to government quarantine facilities, all by a medical intern based out of Mumbai who is also a neighbour and made me write down the ‘nicer’ hospitals where I’d be more comfortable, I landed in Mumbai. Nervous and jetlagged, we got off the flight, not knowing what lay ahead,” says the actress.What happened next, took her by surprise. “Everyone was asked to queue up with their masks on. There was a separate queue for people with immediate connecting flights. A medical supervisor would check our temperature, following which we had to cross a barricade, form another queue, where in the most disciplined fashion, nurses were questioning each passenger if they, perhaps, had symptoms of the coronavirus. If none, they would let each out with a stamp on the left hand for mandatory 14-day home quarantine, which specified the date we could step out again, and another on the right hand that said HQ,” Nidhi explains.Before being allowed to proceed for check-in for her connecting flight, the actress, along with other passengers, were also counselled by a doctor about the importance of quarantine and isolation . “We were asked to keep our phones on at all times, as they would be making follow-up calls to check on us,” she says.Since returning home, Nidhi has isolated herself, considering that she lives with her mom, who is nearly 60 years old, and grandmother, who is in her 80s. “Thankfully, my room is on the first floor and has a separate entrance. Food is sent up on a tray and when I want to talk to my mother, we do so by maintaining six-feet distance from each other. I understand the importance of following rules at this time. And no, it’s not about what’s going to happen to you, it’s about what might happen to others because of you. This is our time to protect society and our loved ones and help the country fight this virus, by staying indoors. Stay in, stay safe,” she signs off.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74829380,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-249675/74829380.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/ive-been-in-quarantine-since-i-returned-home-says-nidhi-subbaiah/articleshow/74829380.cms

Mysuru artists Yoganand L and Hari Prasad are leaving no stone unturned to educate common people about the need to stay at home to contain the spread of coronavirus . A day after Janata Curfew, it was business as usual in the heritage city, which prompted the artist duo to raise more awareness about social distancing . Equipped with masks and their specially-designed installations, both Yoganand and Hari visited several localities in the city — including Devaraja Market, Nanju Malige Circle, KR Circle and Devaraj Urs Road — appealing common masses to stay indoors.Yoganand says, “We had initially started the campaign on March 18. At that time, not many people were aware of extremity of this deadly virus. Even though the knowledge and awareness has increased now, many are still too stubborn to acknowledge the gravity of the situation, and that is why things are slowly going out of control every passing day. We want to tell people the urgent necessity to remain indoors.”",mysuru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74829171,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-255479,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/mysuru-artists-put-up-unique-installations-about-social-distancing/articleshow/74829171.cms

Here are a couple of things that keep the actor busy...Doing workouts at home is nothing new to me as whenever we have outdoor shoots, I work out in the hotel room or use the space outdoor. So, during this quarantine period, I am using my space on the terrace. I skip, do ab crunches, pull-ups/push-ups... then, there are dumbbells.Since I’ve always been shooting outdoors, I get very less time to spend with my family. My kids, too, are having online classes. So, I sit with them and help them out. I also play indoor games with my son and daughter. My son has also been playing a spa game with me, where he applies lotion and cream on my face.

6,['27/03/2020'],The world steps up to help the elderly during lockdown,"Counted among the most susceptible lot during the coronavirus outbreak, it is important that elderly people stay at home to ensure they are in the best of health. However, being by themselves, having to tackle household chores and, at the same time, keeping themselves engaged and entertained can be taxing for many. Let’s take a look at how people around the world are doing their bit to make sure that the older generation is cared for at this time…In Spain, military personnel were spotted helping an old woman who was struggling to carry a heavy bag of groceries back home. Meanwhile, in Yorkshire, people have been asked to hang red-coloured flags at their windows to indicate that they need help with essentials — shopping, medication or transport. Many are also using social media to reach out to senior citizens who need assistance. In Bengaluru, too, a group of volunteers in Whitefield is reaching out to the elderly and helping them as and when required.With outsiders refrained from visiting the elderly at a healthcare facility in Belgium, an AI firm has instead sent robots equipped with video-calling software to help them interact and stay connected with their near-and-dear ones during the lockdown.Games and other activities being organised at care homes is not unheard of, but people playing Hungry Hungry Hippos sitting in their wheelchairs at this nursing home in the UK makes for a heart-warming sight.At a facility in Japan, the elderly residents reportedly continued with their fitness sessions by following videos on the internet. In India, actor Rishi Kapoor, too, featured in a video keeping up with his workout session in a similar manner.Times are tough, but if you’ve got a goofy significant other by your side, anything can be handled. At least, that’s the mantra of this quirky elderly couple. Twitter user, @janeytrill, shared how her parents, who’d planned to head out on a cruise, turned their quarantine into an experience. They watched a video of the sea on TV, got into their bathrobes, sat back and relaxed, sipping on a glass of their favourite drink. Janey even commented later that the response has been so overwhelming that her parents want to work on a satirical follow-up video of them ‘arriving at the destination’.Physical presence means a lot, even if it is separated by a glass window. A youngster in the US was seen hanging out with his dad from outside the window of a care centre. An employee at the centre took a picture of them and shared on social media, captioning it: “My assisted living is on lockdown so he comes every day to see his dad and they talk through the phone, sweetest thing ever. (sic)”Similarly, in the Netherlands, people gathered outside a nursing home to sing for the elders. In other countries, people wished their aged neighbours on their birthday by singing for them, and on one occasion, placed a cake in front of their home.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74828499,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-276328/74828499.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/the-world-steps-up-to-help-the-elderly-during-lockdown/articleshow/74828499.cms
7,['27/03/2020'],Parenting trends that may become popular in 2020,"While every parent wants to be the best parent for their children, it’s not easy balancing career and family, juggling responsibilities and managing the needs of children and self. However, today’s parents are more invested, conscious and savvy about their parenting choices and are taking cues from everyone — environmental activist Greta Thunberg to celebrity couple Harry and Meghan. Here’s a look at the parenting trends that may pick up momentum this year…Till recently, not many were aware of the possibilities of environment-friendly parenting, except for going for wooden toys. However, millennial parents have started substituting baby wipes and cloth, using home-made food instead of canned food products and replacing plastic toys with those made of wood and natural colour.This can be a fitting trend for 2020, with parents ready to set aside 20 minutes every day to sit with their children and talk to them about everything under the sun.A pronounced trend in the West, gender-neutral parenting has been on the rise in India. These parents are letting their boys and girls choose the type of toys they want — no more cars for boys and dolls for girls, as urban millennial parents want to break the norm that pink is for girls and blue is for boys. These young parents are also dividing the household chores among themselves to show that there are no gender-specific chores at home. They also choose to narrate stories of inspiring women to tell kids that there is no concept called the weaker sex.The old practice of sitting together and watching television is increasingly being replaced by family games. Many families are finding time to play traditional games and are also buying multi-player gaming equipment for a family bonding session.Harry and Meghan made headlines when they announced to the world that they will stop at two children to help save the planet. Now, many families are gung-ho about the idea— a conscious decision not to have more than two kids so that they refrain from creating a negative impact on earth.Harry and Meghan announced to the world that they will stop at two children to help save the planet. However, the Anti-Natalist movement is all about forcing people to volunteer to not have have kids at all. In a bizarre announcement, a 27-year-old Mumbai businessman, Raphael Samuel, said last year that he plans to sue his parents for giving birth to him without his consent.Though the first menstruation cycle of a girl has been celebrated in India since yore, the West is now trying to emulate the same. There is an increased interest in celebrating their daughter’s first period with red-themed food and drinks to remove the stigma associated with menstruation, and this is an idea that’s likely to become more popular in the UK.Greta Thunberg was noticed by the world when she went vocal about the environment. Many parents have now started encouraging their children to raise their voices about the causes they believe in. Instead of only listening to adults, these children are making sure that their voices are heard by all. No wonder, companies are looking to hire children as consultants and ambassadors to talk about climate change and environment.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74831284,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-981856/74831284.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/parenting/parenting-trends-that-may-become-popular-in-2020/articleshow/74831284.cms
8,['27/03/2020'],"Mamta Mohandas: When I found fame, I didn't take it for granted","While for the majority in the country, lockdown started on March 25, actress Mamta Mohandas has been in self-quarantine mode at her home in Kerala since March 17. The actress had travelled from Los Angeles (LA) to Kerala with a halt in Dubai to shoot a music video in the midst of the Covid-19 outbreak.When we catch up with her over a telephonic conversation, she is halfway through with painting her house – a “messy” project to keep her busy during the isolation. Mamta talks to us about her experience filming amid elaborate precautions, tips to make the most of the lockdown time, completing 15 years in the industry and about the much-anticipated Big B sequel, Bilal It wasn’t so bad when I left for Dubai, because my doctors in LA had asked if I wanted to travel at this time. I said as of now there’s no change because I spoke with (director) Amal (Neerad) and he said everything was going as per plan and Bilal's shoot would start on March 21. But the day after I landed in Dubai, everything seemed to have changed. Suddenly, there were talks about places getting locked down and flights getting cancelled.The music video’s director Sachin Ramdas and team had taken permission to shoot in several places and it was very difficult to pull that off. But we did. We had minimum crew. We were also shooting mostly in contained places; we did have outdoor shots but thankfully there weren’t many people at those locations. We avoided public locations such as those close to the Dubai Museum.I am kind of used to functioning when there are few people because where I am living now in LA, there aren’t a lot of people. It wasn’t a shock for me but for those in Dubai it was a big deal, not seeing people around and the roads being less busy.I have been through that phase of cancer multiple times and also had to be in isolation for 30 days through my bone marrow transplant process. Few people would have had to go through that and it teaches you too many things; I wouldn’t ever wish that on anybody. But the least the authorities are expecting from people right now is to take some sort of responsibility, for themselves and those around them. I don’t understand why it is hard for people to stay indoors and find constructive ways to spend time.These are questions I have even asked my mother. She is cleaning all the time and it gets to her so much that she keeps telling others, she cleaned this and that. That is her way of venting all her frustration. I think you need to find a way of giving life to all that energy inside you. There are so many beautiful things that you can do by yourself at home.When I come to Kerala, people always ask me why is it that I find it easier to be in LA than here where I have all the attention and everything I need. It’s because of the chaos in the environment, and it gets into your system as well. As much as we speak about things like yoga and resilience, we haven’t really incorporated that into our lives. This is the right time for it. This is the universe’s way of telling us that it’s time for the entire world to come to a pause.Also, something bad is happening on one side that we have no control over. What we can do is practise washing hands with soap and using sanitisers. Also, to be active you don’t have to go outside or to a gym; all it requires is some self-motivation.It’s a non-film project, so that’s great. Its music director Sachin Warrier approached me, asking if I could lend my voice to the song. I am always happy to sing. A lot of people ask me why I don’t sing. I feel it’s because not many have taken the liberty to approach me for songs. Also, I don’t think it’s right to take up all the offers, I have to be careful about where I go and sing and with whom I record. Singing is something I do purely out of love, and I told Sachin this. I also said that I want to take complete ownership of the project and that they don’t have to picturise it on anyone else but me. We then got a Bollywood team back us and they helped us make the project much bigger.I am a little private about the things that I absolutely love to do. I sing at home for everybody, I sing for myself and even shoot videos of myself singing but I might have posted only 5% of what I have shot. It’s the same with writing. I somehow feel that internalising those experiences makes it way more meaningful for me than putting it out there. That’s probably why you don’t see much of my music. My parents always tell me that everything has a life. Even as an actor, you have a shelf-life in terms of how long you can put yourself out there, but music will be there with you till you die. So, I guess that sort of keeps me complacent.I think perseverance and consistency. There’s also no point in doing a job without self-respect. That’s something you need to maintain in the industry and that promises you longevity. I am a little shy to say this, but my career has never been just mine alone. I have always had my parents fully involved in my activities. I am an only child and so, they do the filtration process for me and keep in touch with everybody. People in the industry say that if Mamta has to know something, her family has to know it too. That has often been the case; I have had my health issues and those times it is my mother that people would end up talking to because I am inaccessible. So, until I bloom again, she’s in the forefront. That has helped me get stronger over time. I didn’t find fame overnight. I don’t think my first few films were even successful. I just maintained the fame, tending to it carefully and not taking it for granted.The script itself had what it took for me to understand Rithika’s character. The film’s co-director and scriptwriter Akhil Paul had also taken a lot of interest to ensure that the character reached me. Apart from that I had the complete script with me and had two months of prep time before the shoot. Taking that long break in 2019 also helped and I was ready for the next big character. There is a way of portraying a Malayali female cop as a rough and tough person. I didn’t want that because a woman is a woman in her position. She is someone else at home and someone else at work. I wanted to maintain that balance.I am thoroughly excited. Big B was Amal’s first film and I am sure once we start shooting we are all going to go back to crazy nostalgia. It’s going to be an experience for us to relish at location. We are all looking forward to it and are excited about the new addition to the cast in Bilal. After all it’s a franchise movie, so Rimi is going to be Rimi, just a few notches better, matured and a little more part of the Kurishingal family. She’s one of them now, rather than being looked at asan outsider.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74827413,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-76375/74827413.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/mamta-mohandas-when-i-found-fame-i-didnt-take-it-for-granted/articleshow/74827413.cms

As the world fights an uphill battle from their homes during this tumultuous time of the Coronavirus pandemic, daily routines have gone out the window. With the country currently under lockdown for the next 19 days, educational institutions, including colleges, have been shut indefinitely. While classes have moved online, calls for social distancing has upended college life and camaraderie. The students, however, who have a half-glass-full philosophy, march on. We caught up with a few, who gave us a rundown on their days.I’ve been home for over a week now and to be honest, I’ve lost my mind. But because I’m in my final year, and we have our final submissions going on, I’ve gotten time to sit down and finish my work properly. The quarantine has made me finish things I never had time for. I’m finally ticking off the movie and book list that I’ve been putting off for a while. Films like Contagion and Pandemic keep things relatable and real. My friends and I have started playing a lot of online games together, like Psych and Quiz Up. We video call each other every day through this app called House party, where we play games and even snack together. Since my dance classes and my cross fit spaces are shut, I am trying to work out at home a little bit.I have never been this idle for the longest time. So, this lockdown period has been really hard. I have been looking up useful ideas to beat this boredom and ended up finding a couple of chores to keep myself busy. I began allocating a lot of time for music and art. Since I am not much of a reader, I binge watch shows including Grey’s Anatomy and Rizzoli and Isles. Apart from learning to paint on canvas, I’m also trying my hand at photography along with my brother.Apart from final-year assignments and submissions, I rely on Instagram and streaming platforms to keep myself busy. Shows like Grey’s Anatomy and Fleabag are keeping me hooked. I’ve also been trying to be more social these days. Whenever someone posts something about the quarantine period, and I reckon they have an interesting take on something, I make sure to hit them up and ask them about the same — something I usually don’t do. While this does come at a bad time given that submissions and exams are right around the corner (especially for final-year students), I think this does reflect a lot upon the education system. This is the first time in many months we’ve had a breather. Basically, it took a global pandemic to get us some time off.Since I am a photographer, I am using this time to edit and collate hundreds of photos that I have clicked. While it is a bit unfortunate that I cannot venture out and click pictures, something that is almost second nature to me, I am trying to look at the positives. Usually, when we look at YouTube videos to learn new things, we hardly pay attention, thanks to hundred distractions. But due to the lockdown, I have come to understand the value of my privilege. So, I am using this time to learn new techniques. My current read is Agni Siragugal. I would normally read around five pages a day. But now I am finishing more than 35 pages a day. This lockdown is really putting things into perspective.This lockdown has had no effect on my classes. It has just shifted from physical classrooms to online classrooms. That is the only difference. On the positive side, I am able to pay even more attention from the comfort of my house. As an architecture student, we have site sheets and plans to submit as part of our assignments. While it is quite tiresome to depict complex site plans digitally, we are slowly trying to get the hang of it. As far as my hobbies go, I have picked up gardening to kill time. I have also dug into Kalki’s five-volume series Ponniyin Selvan. That should keep me busy for quite some time.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74831194,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-965700,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/here-is-how-chennais-college-students-are-dealing-with-lockdown/articleshow/74831194.cms

11,['27/03/2020'],#CoronaLockdown: Actors happy that they are back with their families in Delhi,"At a time when a nationwide lockdown has been announced for three weeks to contain the spread of Covid-19, there are many who feel lucky to be with their families. Among those are also a few TV actors who managed to fly from Mumbai to their hometown Delhi soon after their shoots got suspended (March 19 to 31). ""To be trapped alone in a home in Mumbai would have been a terrible feeling,"" say these actors, who are using this time to bond with their families. For some, this is the longest time they have got to spend with their families in years.On March 15, when it was announced that the shoots will be cancelled, the first thing Karan Vohra did was to book his tickets to Delhi. ""That was the time when situation had started getting bad in Mumbai and I knew that if I don't get out of the city right then, I would be stuck. Even though planning a travel was a risk, I decided to take the last (Mumbai-Delhi) flight on March 16 and came to Delhi. The flight that I took was almost empty and it was quite scary to see the situation at the airport,"" says Karan. He adds, ""Being with family right now is such a relief. Ever since I started acting, I never really got to spend quality time with my family. So I am making the best use of this time.""It's been over a week now that Mohit Malhotra has been at his Delhi home with his mother. More than anything, he says, it was important for him to be in Delhi to take care of her. ""I have been reading so much about coronavirus and precautions that we all should be taking. I didn't want my mother to be alone at such a time. If I would have stayed in Mumbai, I would have only thought about her, so it’s better that I came home to be with her,"" says Mohit, who has been using this time at home for learning cooking. ""I always wanted to learn my mom's recipes, but there was never enough time. Though we are bound to be at home because we are facing a pandemic, I am glad that I am getting to do things that I wanted to do. Chilling at home with my mother is a good experience, too. I have been reading a lot and there are so many movies I have to watch,"" he adds. Krishna Mukherjee had to come to Delhi to attend an event on March 18. Keeping in mind the growing number of coronavirus cases in the country, she decided to stay back at her sister’s place in Gurgaon. Now that the lockdown has been announced, she will be here for the next three weeks. ""I did my dance course from Delhi and stayed here for three years, but in the last six years, I have only come to Delhi for a day or two,"" she says. She has plenty on her hands to remain busy. ""There are no house helps coming now. So my sister and I get up early in the morning and do cooking and cleaning. There's so much work to be done,"" she says. Arjit Taneja had planned a vacation in the US with his parents from March 17, but due to travel restrictions and considering the spread of coronavirus worldwide, he cancelled his vacation five days before the trip. ""After I cancelled my holidays, it was announced that shoots will also be suspended. Social distancing was advised and I thought that if I had to just stay at home in Mumbai and self-isolate, I would go crazy. So, I decided to come home to Delhi and it was no less than an ordeal to get a flight from Mumbai to Delhi on March 17. I spent almost four hours at the Mumbai airport. The flight that I had booked initially was cancelled and the other flight, which I managed to take finally was two hours late,"" says Arjit, who has been at home for the last one week, He hasn't stepped out at all. He adds, ""I spend time with my dog. Since I am home, I am eating a lot and to burn those extra calories, I workout on my terrace. I moved to Mumbai in 2013 and since then, this is the longest time I have got to spend at home.""",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74830383,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-171741/74830383.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/coronalockdown-actors-happy-that-they-are-back-with-their-families-in-delhi/articleshow/74830172.cms

With the whole nation coming to a standstill because of the Coronavirus scare, parents are facing a tough time keeping their kids engaged within the four walls of the house. While some are giving cooking classes to their kids, others are resorting to gardening. Parents in cities across the state shared with us some unique ideas to keep the kids engrossed during this lockdown period.Lucknowite Ishna Agarwal Potdar, who has a son aged nine-years has made it a point to keep her son engrossed in productive activities during the time of this lockdown. She says, “It’s very difficult to engage kids these days. They can’t be allowed to watch television shows or cartoons all the time or be given other gadgets to play with. So I’m teaching Vardaan (her son) to sew buttons, ironing small clothes and do other small chores around the house. He’s also learning gardening from his grandmother and his father is teaching him how to wash the car.” Adding further Ishna says, “I’m glad that he wakes up in the morning everyday and does yoga along with his grandmother.”Hema Bhatia, a businesswoman from Kanpur, is teaching cooking to her 10-year-old son Prajit. “I initially started with teaching him how to make tea and some salad. Now that he has learnt to cut salad, I have taught him to make different types of sandwiches. What makes me happy is that Prajit has also shown a lot interest in cooking,” she says.(L) Aarav is learning meditation from his parents (R) Devaagyh is learning fireless cooking (BCCL)Shubhi Tiwari from Lucknow, a homemaker in the city with a seven-year-old son Shivraj, says, “Normally we people whine about scarcity of time or the fact that we aren’t getting to spend quality time with our families. Now that we’re following the lockdown, everyone is actually getting to complete the list of things which we always wanted to do but never found the time for. I’m teaching my son origami these days. Along with this, he does aerobics and yoga with my husband and me every morning. I’m teaching him how to make tea and since the new school session will start soon, he’s also learning how to put covers on the books.”Even for Prayagraj’s Sameeksha Singh , a research scholar, managing her two and a half year old son Aarav is something she doesn’t have to worry about. “My son had joined a play school recently, so after the lockdown the play school has sent some very interesting assignments to be completed by the kids.The students are supposed to do basic yoga asanas like pranayam etc, for which they have sent website links and we in turn have to make a videos of the activity and send to the school. The other activity includes talking to the grandparents making a video call, colouring, etc. So it is quite fun doing all this”, she says.Hema Bhatia with her son Prajit Bhatia (BCCL)Isha Gupta, a research scholar from Banaras, says that apart from my daughter Apramiti, who is four-years-old , my sister in law‘s sons, Atharva and Aarav, both below 10-years, are currently staying with us, so to keep the kids engaged in such a scenario is tough. So I came up with a novel idea and asked them to use one of the walls of the toy room as a canvas. So the kids are painting away to glory. In just few days the wall is covered with their creativity. At the same time we are also asking the kids to help us in household chores, especially cooking. The other night when my daughter felt hungry, I told her to make a French toast and I must say, she did a splendid job. The kids are also being encouraged to tidy their room and clean around the house, with the household staff being on leave, this is also making them appreciate the contribution of the staff,” she says.Kajal Gautam, a home maker from Banaras, who has twins, Saksham and Samriddh, both 10-years old, says, “I try that my kids are not glued to the TV or engaged on their phone all the time. So when their schools got closed, I dug out their guitar, which was lying unused for sometime. Now I make sure that they practice for sometime on the instrument. In case they get stuck on some note, they make a video call to their teacher to clear out things. I also join and sing along, whenever possible.”(L) Meenakshi Srivastava with her daughter Amaya (R) Shiv is learning yoga and meditation (BCCL)Kanpurite Meenakshi Srivastava is also making efforts to keep her four-year old daughter Amaya entertained and busy during the lockdown period. “Amaya has a lot of interest in dancing and I am utilising this time to teach her classical dance. Both Amaya and I first watch some videos of classical dance and then we try copying the dance moves. Earlier, Amaya used to mostly dance on Bollywood numbers but now she is grooming herself in classical dance and she is really enjoying this change,” shares Meenakshi.Rashi Dixit Ahuja, a Lucknowite, is making use of the time by giving her kids lessons in Hindu mythology. “Kids are full of energy at this age. So for keeping them engaged not one activity is enough. So apart from giving my six-year old son some lessons in gardening and fireless cooking, every day, both my husband and I also read out lessons from the Ramayana and the Mahabharat turn by turn. I don’t think he would have otherwise got these lessons from us had it not been for the lockdown.

In case they get stuck on some note, they make a video call to their teacher to clear out things. I also join and sing along, whenever possible.”(L) Meenakshi Srivastava with her daughter Amaya (R) Shiv is learning yoga and meditation (BCCL)Kanpurite Meenakshi Srivastava is also making efforts to keep her four-year old daughter Amaya entertained and busy during the lockdown period. “Amaya has a lot of interest in dancing and I am utilising this time to teach her classical dance. Both Amaya and I first watch some videos of classical dance and then we try copying the dance moves. Earlier, Amaya used to mostly dance on Bollywood numbers but now she is grooming herself in classical dance and she is really enjoying this change,” shares Meenakshi.Rashi Dixit Ahuja, a Lucknowite, is making use of the time by giving her kids lessons in Hindu mythology. “Kids are full of energy at this age. So for keeping them engaged not one activity is enough. So apart from giving my six-year old son some lessons in gardening and fireless cooking, every day, both my husband and I also read out lessons from the Ramayana and the Mahabharat turn by turn. I don’t think he would have otherwise got these lessons from us had it not been for the lockdown. But now after getting tired doing gardening and cooking, he relaxes hearing some good mythological stories from us,” she shares.— With inputs from Yashi Agarwal",kanpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74830932,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1004919,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/from-cooking-to-gardening-parents-in-up-look-for-unique-ways-to-keep-kids-busy-during-lockdown/articleshow/74830965.cms

While the actor is ecstatic about the birth of his bundle of joy, he cannot forget the long hours of anxiety preceding it.Ruslaan told BT, “It was a normal delivery and the baby was born at 4 am on Thursday. Around 9 pm on Wednesday, Nirali went into labour and all of us panicked because we had to rush from our Juhu home to the hospital, which is located at Marine Lines. Due to social distancing, we didn’t take any of our family members with us. We did not see a single person on the road and it was quite eerie. I was scared that we might be stopped by the police, but luckily, nothing happened and we reached the hospital in half an hour. Nirali’s father, who is a radiologist at the hospital, was already waiting for us when we reached. The hospital was also empty, with only the staff members present. Thankfully, everything went smooth and we are parents to a lovely baby boy.”He added, “We will be in the hospital for two days. Due to the lockdown, my parents and other family members will not be able to see the baby. We had finalised a nanny, but now, due to the lockdown, we are planning to do everything on our own. The hospital staff was very efficient, but I was extremely worried about how we are going to manage it.”The actor is happy that he was home when his wife needed him the most. He said, “I was shooting for a film in Karjat when the lockdown happened, and I returned home on March 13. Otherwise, Nirali would have had to call me from Karjat when she went into labour. My mom (actress Anjana Mumtaz ) is at home to help, but I want to be a hands-on father. I was feeling bad that I could not be with Nirali in her last month of pregnancy, but now that I am at home, I will make the most of it. We plan to watch online videos to learn more about handling a newborn.”In an earlier interview, Ruslaan had said that Nirali and he had decided on names for a baby girl.

25,['27/03/2020'],Regulatory recall of defective vehicles to attract penalty for manufacturers,"NEW DELHI: Mandatory recall of defective vehicles or components will not only cost the manufacturers or importers as they will have to rectify or replace them, they will also face a risk of paying up to Rs 1 crore fine, according to a draft notification issued by the road transport ministry.

For example, recall of six lakh plus two-wheelers or one-lakh plus four wheelers will attract the maximum penalty of Rs 1 crore, as per the draft norms. If the manufacturer or importer identifies the defect and starts voluntary recall process, it won’t face any penalty.

Though the trigger point for regulatory recall is yet to be defined, sources said there will be two parameters. For high end or less manufactured or imported vehicles, complaints or reports of defects in ""certain number of vehicles"" will be the trigger point to initiate mandatory recall process.

For popular models where the number of vehicles produced is very high complaints equivalent to 10-12% of production would trigger authorities to initiate recall policy.

The ministry, in the draft norm, has defined the detailed process for investigation into complaints, designating authority who can order recall based on investigation report and suo motu as well. However, there will enough checks and balances including giving enough time to the manufacturer or importer to respond before any penal action or mandatory recall is ordered.

“Necessary precautions have been taken to ensure that rivals or competitors among industries can’t use mass compliant trick to target each other. All those lodging complaints will have to provide several details. The entire process will be online for greater transparency,” said an official.

The proposed norms also specify how the authorities and testing agencies would ensure that the manufacturers and importers of vehicle models or components are adhering to compliance of production (COP), which means the products are as per the approved prototype.

26,['27/03/2020'],Khichdi becomes the star of #lockdown kitchens,"They say, when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. But what are you supposed to do when you’re locked down for weeks on end with bare minimum kitchen essentials to survive through a global pandemic? We say, make khichdi. After all, when cooking has become a necessity for even the uninitiated, what can possibly be a better bet than the companion for all seasons — fasting or feasting. Its versatile nature, high nutritional value and bare-minimum ingredients make the humble comfort food a one-stop dish to keep Indians across the length and breadth of the country united in this hour of acute crisis. So, at a time when many are grappling to stock up on basic food items to keep their kitchens running while several others are making the most of their self-isolation days cooking up a storm in the kitchen with #khichdi flooding oursocial media timelines, let’s understand why this one-pot meal is our saviour.The word khichdi often conjures up images of a rather simple dish made of rice and dal. But its journey is far more complex. While rice and lentil remain the basic ingredients for this versatile dish, almost every part of the country has a unique way of cooking it and those variations make it all the more interesting. From the spicy bisi bele bath in Karnataka and the quintessential Bengali khichuri to the Haryanvi khichdi with pearl millets and the comforting Gujarati khichdi served with kadhi — this wholesome dish is your go-to option when pantry stocks are limited but you are in no mood to compromise on taste as well as nutrients.Pongal: This variation of khichdi is popular in the southern states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. It’s made using moong or toor dal and rice or millet. There’s a sweet version as well.Khichuri: Usually prepared using Gobindobhog rice and moong dal, khichuri is often served with dollops of ghee in Bengal. During monsoon, it is accompanied by ilish maachh bhaja, making the dish nothing short of a delicacy.Bisi bele bath: A favourite in Karnataka, it is said to have originated in the Mysore Palace and Vellore Fort. This hot and spicy rice-lentil preparation goes well with boondi, potato chips and chutney.Adahengu khechidi: This ginger-asafoetida version is popular in Odisha and also served at the famous Jagannath Temple in Puri.Vaghareli khichdi: This popular Gujarati variant is served with kadhi.Khichdi is considered to be a healthy dish as the main ingredients — lentil and rice — offer protein and carbohydrates. “Khichdi is a great option if you are looking to maintain a balanced diet. Pulses have amino acids and rice gives you carbs. Also, it is easy on the tummy since the dish is low on spices. But that is applicable only for the vegetarian variation. The non-vegetarian options are heavier,” says dietician Sohinee Seal.According to Mumbai-based food consultant Rushina Munshaw Ghildiyal, having a dal-rice meal once a day is important. “This is a staple food for Indians since ancient times. I suggest adding a handful of veggies in your khichdi. I am making khichdi every three-four days. Also, this quick and nutritious meal fits the budget. It is the easiest meal to jazz up with pickle, papad and so on,” she says.“What makes khichdi this popular is the wide availability of rice and dal all over the country,” says Kolkata-based chef Sambit Banik, adding, “Areas that yield less rice replace it with millet, jowar, bajra or dalia.” Health-conscious millennials swear by khichdi made of oats to avoid gluten. “And these are just the basics. In case you want to add meat in it, make khichra. When it comes to being imaginative, sky is the limit with this dish,” he exclaims. Tanu Mehra, a Bengaluru-based home chef, sais, ""For me, khichdi is like going back to basics. Not only does it require limited pantry resources, it also saves time, fuel and energy. This one-bowl meal has all the nutrients your body needs.""If you’re bored of having the same khichdi over and over again, it’s time to add some twist. According to chef Ritabrata Biswas, you can give this traditional Indian recipe an Italian touch and turn it into risotto. “Since we all are judiciously using the ingredients at hand, make do with what you have. Get some aromatic short-grain rice like Gobindobhog. Put mustard oil in a pressure cooker, add kalonji (nigella seeds) and dry red chilli. Then add rice. Stir for a while before adding water — one ladle at a time to get the risotto texture. Once the rice is almost cooked, add pre-boiled urad dal to it. Season it well. You may want to add a bit of cheese or butter on top,” the chef explains.The British kedgeree — a rice dish cooked with flaked fish, parsley, hard-boiled eggs, curry powder, butter or cream and raisins — is thought to have its origin in khichdi. It is widely believed that the dish was brought to the UK by British colonials returning from India, who had enjoyed it here and introduced it as a breakfast dish in the UK in Victorian times, part of the then fashionable Anglo-Indian cuisine.One serving of khichdi (approx 225 gm) cooked with 40 gm raw rice, 35 gm pulses and a dollop of ghee will have:485 calories15 gm protein12.5 gm fatLast year, Kareena Kapoor Khan had revealed that khichdi is her comfort food and she likes to have it frequently.On the occasion of Gudi Padwa on Wednesday, Bollywood filmmaker Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari took to her Insta profile to share this pic of sabudana khichdi along with a detailed post explaining how ‘#stayathome has made me realise the warmth of ingredients’.

NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore package focused on emergency cash transfers into bank accounts of the poor, along with providing free foodgrains, pulses and cooking gas for three months in a bid to cushion them from the impact of the coronavirus lockdown and economic disruption caused by the disease.Announcing the relief measures, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman , however, did not touch on loan concessions or support for the corporate sector and middle class, saying other concerns would be “considered separately”. It is expected that more measures aimed at helping business could be on the anvil. Two days ago, an extension in compliance deadlines relating to GST and income tax filings had been announced.The elements of Thursday's announcement, such as free grains, is a departure from the government’s usual stand against handouts but is seen as a response to an unprecedented crisis caused by the Covid-19 spread on the Indian and global economy and the displacement caused by the ongoing 21-day national lock down. “We have first tried to reach the poorest of the poor so that they don’t have to worry about how to feed their families,” the minister said, adding that as things develop the government will come back with more steps.With most elements of the package in place for three months, the government seems to expect that the coronavirus crisis will stabilise by end-June. Recognising the contribution of medical professionals in the current crisis, there will be a special insurance scheme for doctors, nurses, other health workers, safai staff and Asha workers dealing with coronavirus cases with a Rs 50 lakh cover in case they meet with an accident.Earlier, the government limited the first exercise to easing compliance burden for individuals and companies, while waiving some of the fees that banks charge.

NEW DELHI: The government said on Thursday that the rate of increase in positive cases of Covid-19 has “relatively stabilised” in the last few days even as it stressed that there was no room for complacency and alertness had to be maintained with determined implementation of a national lockdown.The health ministry reported 43 new cases and four additional deaths in the last 24 hours, taking the number of confirmed cases to 649 so far, of which 593 are active cases and 42 were cured and discharged, whereas one case was migrated. Total deaths due to Covid-19 now stand at 13.“Though the number of cases is increasing, we are seeing a relatively stable trend in the rate at which cases are increasing or a little bit of reduction in the rate of increase,” joint health secretary Lav Agarwal said. He added that the country was “fully geared up” to fight the virus.In an indication that the Centre continues to view the threat as grave, health minister Harsh Vardhan held a detailed review with state counterparts in the afternoon that lasted more than two and a half hours. The discussion centred on states with high numbers, with others gleaning tips on how to prevent and combat such situations.The discussion drilled down to preparedness of hospital facilities and the efficacy of the contact tracing and quarantine exercise. At the government briefing, Agarwal emphasised it was too early to read a clear trend, requiring the government as well as citizens to maintain alertness and full adherence of the lockdown.Besides, compliance of guidelines and protocols issued by the government for social distancing and other measures will help maintain the trend and overcome the problem, he said. The government also said that there was no “hard evidence” of coronavirus pandemic having reached the community transmission stage in India and added that India continued to be in stage 2 of localised transmission.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74838088,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-208426,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rate-of-rise-in-positive-cases-relatively-stabilising-govt/articleshow/74838090.cms

NEW DELHI: Many Indians have been praying for an early onset of peak summer this year in the light of some studies that have shown that transmission of Covid-19 infections may slow down in high heat. That hope may be dashed, with met department forecasts showing that the chances of summer setting in early are low.Temperatures across most of India are likely to remain below normal at least over the next two weeks, the India Meteorological Department ’s extended range forecast reveals. The forecast, which gives weekly outlooks for the next 28 days, shows that the probability of the mercury hitting 40°C, even in central India, are low till the second week of April.Summer arrives earlier in south and central India than the north because these regions are closer to the equator. “Several parts of north and central India rainfall are likely to get rain over the next two-three days under the influence of very active back-to-back western disturbances (WDs). Again, next week, some rain is expected in north India, particularly over the Himalayas ,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, head of IMD.Mohapatra added that temperatures aren’t expected to rise significantly over most parts of India over the next two weeks or so.

33,['27/03/2020'],"Day 2 of lockdown: Truckers abandon vehicles, delivery boys fret about safety","NEW DELHI: Two days into a 21-day lockdown, India’s hugely disrupted supply chain for essential commodities struggled to get going in the face of a fresh set of challenges — truckers abandoning vehicles on highways, manufacturers running out of inventory and delivery agents of e-tailers refusing to venture out for fear of police harassment — even as state governments and local authorities appeared to remove some of the roadblocks that had stalled the distribution network on the first day.Transporters’ associations and members of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee said the Centre's decision to exempt goods trucks from highway toll had made little difference because drivers and helpers had started abandoning stranded vehicles in anticipation of a prolonged logjam.With trucks unable to reach their destinations, wholesale markets have been hit by a shortage of agricultural produce. “Drivers have started abandoning trucks and hiking back home, even if these places are 200-300km from where they are. We request the Centre to urgently ask the states, particularly collectors, to supply food and water to our stranded drivers,” Bal Malkit Singh, chairman of the All India Motor Transport Congress, said.“We are also under lockdown, otherwise we’d be making arrangements for our drivers.” The All India Transport Welfare Association estimates that about 30 lakh trucks are stuck on highways. In the FMCG sector, Britannia CEO Varun Berry flagged the risk of the packaged food industry run ning out of stocks in a week to 10 days if the supply chain wasn’t normalised immediately.“The food industry supply chain is disaggregated and dependent on interstate movement of goods. Due to the nature of the materials, inventories across the chain are low. If even one link in the supply chain is broken, the country could run out of stocks of packaged food in the next 710 days,” he said.Many staples have already vanished from the shelves of supermarkets and local kirana stores. The movement of raw materials has been curtailed too, forcing firms like Britannia, Parle and Unibic to cut production. Britannia CEO Varun Berry’s remarks have been one of the strongest by an FMCG firm. Parle had expressed concerns, and Metro Cash & Carry India had said it was unable to open its wholesale stores because of police threatening its employees.Biscuit maker Unibic, whose sole factory on the outskirts of Bengaluru has been shut since Sunday, has been facing problems in transporting raw material such as palm oil, flavours and cashew nuts for its cookies. In Assam and some other states, many migrant vegetable vendors have returned home as it is unprofitable to set up shop when there's a severe shortage of produce and no capital to buy what's available. Prem Chandra Shah, a wholesale vendor in Guwahati, returned to Bihar on Thursday.“First there was disruption due to anti-CAA/NRC protests and now due to coronavirus . Too many losses in a short span of time,” he said. V R Soundarajan, president of the Koyambedu Wholesale Traders' Association in Chennai, told TOI that about 350 trucks arrive from Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala on a normal day. “Today, only 150 trucks came; everywhere we are hearing stories of vehicles being stopped at state entry points. About Rs 1.2 crore worth of flowers from Karnataka were dumped today on the Bengaluru-Chennai highway With vegetables, we can't even quantify the loss,” he said. The Centre is setting up acontrol room and coordinating with states for entry of vehicles, sources said.A taskforce has been set up to work with state governments on faster issuance of passes inside city limits, and for speedy entry of vehicles through inter-state borders. For e-comm players like Amazon, Flipkart, BigBasket, Grofers, Swiggy and Zomato, getting curfew passes to resume operations is no longer the only challenge. While the police authorities in metros like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru have assured them of curfew passes, these companies are now facing issues in taking new orders and fulfilling the existing backlog.

Reason: No communting and industrial activities led to better air quality.At a time when the novel coronavirus has wrecked a havoc on human health and lives across the globe, the efforts to check its spread has brought a positive impact on environment particularly after the lockdown.“We can notice a significant improvement in air quality not only in Varanasi but other places too due to the imposition of lockdown in the country. The vehicular exhausts and industrial pollutants, which are the major source of air pollution, have been stopped. Obviously, it resulted in improvement of air quality, which is good to human health to fight against the coronavirus,” said noted environment scientist of Banaras Hindu University Prof BD Tripathi The data of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) suggests that the air quality in most of the cities, which used to breath in bad air, has witnessed a significant improvement. Varanasi, which had witnessed 378 Air Quality Index (AQI) in very poor category in the beginning of January, recorded 135 AQI (moderate) on Thursday. A day after Janta Curfew the city’s AQI was 99 (satisfactory) on March 23.More or less similar was the condition in other cities including Kanpur and Lucknow, which were in the categories of ‘good’ and ‘satisfactory’ respectively. Kanpur’s AQI was 50, while Lucknow recorded 91 AQI. Out of 102 cities in CPCB’s AQI Bulletin only two cities -Muzaffarpur and Guwahati had ‘very poor’ air with AQI 216 and 214 respectively. While 22 cities were in ‘Good’ category, 14 were in ‘moderate’ and 64 cities were in ‘satisfactory’ categories. Mandideep was the cleanest with 29 AQI in the country.The ‘Good’ AQI (0-50) has minimal on health, ‘Satisfactory’ (51-100) category suggests minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people, ‘Moderate’ (101-200) causes breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases. The ‘Poor’ AQI (201-300) makes breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure, while ‘Very Poor’ (301-400) AQI causes respiratory illness on prolonged exposure. The ‘Severe’ (401-500) category AQI affects health people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases.Prof Tripathi said that such a situation came after the restriction on public and private transport, including autorickshaws, taxis, and all inter-district and inter-State transport buses, railways and air service.",varanasi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74841132,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-302815,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/corona-curfew-on-bad-air-pollution-levels-decrease/articleshow/74835888.cms

VADODARA: Even before the ashes of his brother’s pyre turned cold, police sub-inspector P K Jadav was back at his post, hiding emotions under the starched uniform to answer the call of duty.

During lockdown in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, tragedy struck Jadav, posted at the Garbada police station in Dahod district, when the news of the demise of his elder brother in Ahmedabad reached him.

Jadav, who was extensively involved in duties pertaining to the lockdown imposed by the state government, did not think twice before embarking on a seven-hour journey to and from Ahmedabad and attend the last rites in the remaining few hours.

On March 24, Jadav’s brother Hardevsinh (63) passed away at 3 am in Ahmedabad after prolonged illness. Jadav informed his seniors and left Garbada at around 5am for Ahmedabad, and rejoined duty at 3pm on the same day.

Also consider this, it takes around 3.5 hours to reach Ahmedabad from Garbada. Out of the around 10 hours that Jadav was out of Garbada, he spent around seven hours travelling.

Jadav’s commitment to duty did not go unnoticed as Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani appreciated the gesture in a tweet. Rupani also called up Jadav to appreciate him.

Talking to TOI, Jadav said, “I had to return because of the prevailing conditions due to the coronavirus outbreak. My family too understands that a policeman has to give priority to his duty.”

Jadav said that the cremation was attended by only a few close relatives owing to social distancing and lockdown. “We were looking to hold a ‘besna’ later, but the lockdown was extended till March 31. It may not be possible to hold it now,” he added.

Gujarat Police is actively involved in ensuring the lockdown in a success. The force is also trying to ensure that the supply of essential commodities is smooth and those living on the streets or shanties are supplied food, water and other essentials. Dahod police are also handling the mammoth task of ensuring workers from Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh reach home.

India is under a lockdown after the coronavirus pandemic started spreading fast. PM Narendra Modi, ordered a 21 day lockdown from Monday night to end on April 14, ambushing most businesses.

The Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) which employs seven lakh people across factories in India, with high concentration in Noida and Sriperumbudur near Chennai has decided to shut down all manufacturing activities as it did not want its workforce battle a pandemic, besides moving people and materials to the factory gates would be tough considering the complete shut down of public transport. “We have decided to follow the collective wisdom of the prime minister and all the units have decided to shut down operation for the 21 day lockdown,” said Pankaj Mohindroo, founder and national president of Indian Cellular Association, the apex body of mobile handset industry in India. “Noida (NCR) is the biggest cluster followed by Sriperumbudur with nearly 25% to 35% of the all workforce.”

“We have shut our factories in Chennai (MEPZ) and other locations. All the employees will be paid their full wages for this lockdown period,” said Sreeram Srinivasan, CEO of Syrma Technology. The company employs nearly 2,500 persons across its Chennai and NCR factories.

The lockdown in EMS is bound to impact the supply chain of several handset makers including Apple and Xiaomi. Early in the calendar year, manufacturing operations sputtered due to lack of parts supplies from China due to the Corona pandemic there. Just when China is getting back, India has announced a shutdown, forcing factories to down shutters.

As per state estimates, TN ranks third in India in terms of electronic exports at $1.27 billion in FY 2017-18, with Chennai home to two Electronics and Hardware SEZs in Sriperumbudur (486 acres) and Oragadam (348 acres).

Suffering a slump after the exit of its key patron Nokia in 2014, TN’s electronic manufacturing sector, which is the second largest hub in the country after UP, has received a booster shot with Foxconn getting the go-ahead to set up a smartphone assembly plant at Sriperumbudur.

US electronics maker Flex is another large job creator in the state. Salcomp India, the manufacturer of chargers for smartphones and other devices, has agreed to take over the now defunct Nokia factory.

42,['27/03/2020'],Ashok Leyland cuts current year spends,"Chennai: Hinduja group flagship company Ashok Leyland Ltd (ALL) has cut back its current fiscal capex by 40% from Rs 2,000 crore to Rs 1,200 crore. In an analyst call, company CFO Gopal Mahadevan said that although the company had announced a capex of Rs 2,000 crore at the beginning of the year, it had spent only Rs 960 crore (till February) and will finish the year at about Rs 1,200-Rs 1,300 crore.

“We have been really looking at how to get capex down over the last few months and we have been able to achieve that,” he added.

Given the slowdown in 2019-20 and the ongoing turmoil due to Covid-19 the first half of next fiscal too is not going to be in top gear. ALL will use this opportunity to scale down company operations even further, said Mahadevan. The plan is to “resize” the organization to the level it was 3 years ago.

Apart from cutting back capex, ALL has also pared down its debt by 37%. “As of Q3, we are less than Rs 2,000 crore of debt and last quarter, we were Rs 2,736 crore of debt,” he said. “Given a very tough quarter, we have done some very skewed cash flow management, reduction of inventory, all of which has resulted in cash flowing in,” he explained.

Sonu’s statement was recorded on Thursday after his relatives took up the matter with senior police officers.The three constables — Rajnish Kumar, Anirudh and Babloo — were arrested after an FIR was lodged with the Danapur police station against them on the directive of IG, Patna zone, Sanjay Singh. Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma rushed to the site and inquired about the incident, which took place around 10pm on Wednesday.Surprisingly, the three cops were not on duty on the site where the mini truck coming from diara area to Patna was intercepted by them. During investigation, it came to light that the trio was deputed at the sub-divisional court in Danapur and had reached the spot just to extort money.“Had locals and shopkeepers not intervened, the cops would have killed the driver on the spot. He was rescued from the clutches of the constables after the intervention of local shopkeepers and some drivers,” said a close relative of Sonu at the PMCH.IG Sanjay Singh said the constables were booked under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 386 (extortion), 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation).SSP Sharma said the accused constables were put under suspension and departmental proceedings initiated against them.

PATNA: A 48-year-old man was found murdered in the courtyard of a temple near Sita Ghat in the city on Thursday morning.

The deceased, Ram Babu Choudhary, was found with gunshot wound on his body and blunt injuries on his head which suggests he was attacked in his asleep, police said.

The Khajekalan SHO, Anwar Khan, said, “Injuries on the deceased’s head were found during police inquest and bullet injuries were also spotted on the body, which suggested that he was shot after being hit with a blunt object on the head.”

Police are trying to retrieve CCTV footage from nearby shops to ascertain the identity of the suspects involved in the crime. “Locals said Choudhary had been sleeping on the temple premises for the last two months,” the SHO said.

In another incident, a 25-year-old newly-married woman died under mysterious circumstances at the Patna Medical College and Hospital on Thursday. She was admitted on Wednesday evening after she complained of vomiting and stomach pain.

The victim, Snehlata, got married to Veeru Mahto, a resident of Pirbahore police station area in the state capital, about a fortnight ago. She was sent to her in-laws’ house after marriage but soon returned to Patna after being harassed for dowry, the victim’s father, Dilip Prasad Gupta, told the police.

Gupta lodged a case of dowry death at the Kadamkuan police station against Snehlata’s husband on Thursday. The deceased woman, a resident of Saidpur Road number 2, had fallen in love with Veeru earlier and they got married barely 15 days ago.

The Kadamkuan police station SHO said the post-mortem report is awaited. “Action will be initiated against the accused on the basis of the autopsy report,” he added.

Many real estate projects may also bear the brunt of the lockdown.State road construction minister Nand Kishor Yadav said the projects were stalled keeping in mind health of workers. “Thousands of workers and engineers work day and night together to construct a road or a bridge. It is obvious that we will face loses. However, our only concern under the present circumstances is the safety of our workers,” he added. Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited (BSRDCL) managing director Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said the construction work would remain suspended till the lockdown continues. Some of the key projects which have been put on hold are listed below.Road projects: Work on several roads in Patna, including Digha-Danapur elevated road, R-Block Digha road and Lohia Path Chakra, was in full swing before coronavirus reared its ugly head in the city. The much-awaited Lohia Path Chakra project, under which short elevated roads and multiple underpasses are proposed to be made at prominent traffic points between Lalit Bhavan and Vidyut Bhavan on Bailey Road, was expected to be completed by the end of this year.AIIMS-Digha elevated road and R-Block Digha road were targeted to be completed by May or June. A BSRDCL official said more than 98% of construction work had already been completed on AIIMS-Digha elevated road.The Saguna Mor-Danapur road was to be converted into an eight-lane road by August this year. Other stalled road projects are Ganga Path or Ganga expressway and Bihta- Sarmera road.Bridges and flyovers: The rehabilitation of Mahatma Gandhi Setu and construction of a six-lane Kachchi Dargah-Bidupur bridge have also been halted. Work on construction of R-Block flyover connecting Mithapur ROB to Bhikhari Thakur ROB has also been suspended.Patna Metro project: Chief minister Nitish Kumar had on March 17 approved the alignments of Patna Metro Rail project. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), which is executing the project in a joint venture with the state government, had started conducting soil test. However, the lockdown has hit this project too.Smart City projects: A slew of Patna Smart City projects were to be inaugurated in March and April this year. However, these projects will now be delayed for at least a couple of months due to the lockdown. Earlier this year, Rahul Kapoor, director, Smart Cities Mission, Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, had suggested grand launch of a 72-foot-high mega screen at Gandhi Maidan. He had also asked PSCL officials to complete work on Adalatganj pond redevelopment before the upcoming Assembly elections in October-November this year.Underpasses and foot overbridges: Pedestrians in the state capital will have to wait for another few months to see foot overbridges and underpasses at different places in the city. Bidding process for foot overbridges at Rupaspur, Rajendra Nagar and two underpass escalators near Samrat Ashoka Convention Centre was initiated by Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited and Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited this year. However, the projects aimed at easing traffic and pedestrian movement on busy roads, are now likely to be delayed.Ropeway at Rohtasgarh hill: Work on installation of ropeway at Rohtasgarh hill in Rohtas district and Mundeshwari hill in Kaimur district , which was likely to commence in March this year, would be delayed again following the countrywide lockdown. Similarly, Science City at Rajendra Nagar in Patna, interstate bus terminus near Zero Mile and Bapu Tower projects may also get delayed.Real estate projects: Several real estate projects are also bearing the brunt of lockdown.

47,['27/03/2020'],FY21 GDP growth may crash to 3-decade low on Covid-19,"CHENNAI: The impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the consequent 21-day countrywide lockdown will push India’s GDP (gross domestic product) growth to 2.6% for FY21, the lowest in nearly three decades, according to an estimate released by SBI group chief economic adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh. Moreover, ratings agency Crisil has slashed its forecast to 3.5% from the earlier 5.2%.The total cost of the ongoing lockdown will be at least Rs 8 lakh crore in nominal terms — an income loss of Rs 1.77 lakh crore and a loss in capital income of Rs 1.7 lakh crore, said Ghosh. Estimates showed that, over a 60-year period, global GDP declined only once annually in 2009 by 1.7%.Assuming that global GDP declines at nearly a similar rate in 2020 and, given India’s share in global GDP at 3.5%, it implies a contraction of 2% of real GDP in FY21. This is due to India’s integration with the global economy through trade and social consumption channels, research by the country’s largest lender showed.“We estimate another 1.7% impact on real GDP because of the 21-day lockdown in FY21 resulting in at least 70% of the economy at a standstill. We thus peg our FY21 GDP estimate at 2.6%, with a clear downward bias, with Q1FY21 GDP numbers witnessing a contraction. FY20 GDP estimates could also see a downward revision from 5% to 4.5% with Q4GDP growth at 2.5%,” the SBI note said.Crisil said the advers effects that will follow can dwarf the gains from the sharp drop in crude oil prices. Said Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist, Crisil, “We have slashed our base-case GDP growth forecast for fiscal 2021 to 3.5% from 5.2% expected earlier.This assumes two things: A normal monsoon, and effect of the pandemic subsiding materially, if not wearing out, in the April-June quarter. The slump in growth will be concentrated in the first half of next fiscal, while the second half should see a mild recovery.”Several research houses, economists and brokerages have slashed the country’s GDP growth estimates against the backdrop of the Covind-19 outbreak as several sectors of the economy have been hit hard and businesses have come to a grinding halt due to the 21-day lockdown.The Indian economy was already facing a slowdown and the government had unveiled a series of measures to boost growth but the impact of the virus outbreak will prompt the government to unleash more measures to reverse the slowdown and help the poor and business. Before the outbreak, the government had estimated growth to slow to an 11-year low of 5% in 2019-20 and the economic survey had forecast it to recover to 6% to 6.5% in 2020-21.Crisil said it had reviewed 120 corporates most-affected by the situation in sectors such as airlines, hotels, tourism, malls, organised brick & mortar retail, multiplexes, and restaurants. It has negative rating action on 81 companies out of these, while ratings on remaining 39 have been retained at existing levels. “The actions are largely driven by near-term challenges to liquidity, which could impact financial flexibility,” Crisil’s note said, warning on the impending stress on corporate profitability.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74843886,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-178576,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fy21-gdp-growth-may-crash-to-3-decade-low-on-covid-19/articleshow/74837011.cms

These companies also want a definition from the Centre on what are essential and non-essential items so vehicles of these companies are not stopped unnecessarily.Flipkart group CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy said executives of e-commerce and logistics firms had a meeting, via video conferencing, with commerce minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday and briefed him on the challenges online platforms have been facing while delivering essentials to consumers.To get these passes, the companies also have to deal with police commissioners in over 600 districts of the country, which could also further delay the shipment of essential products even.Making a physical pass could also involve collecting photographs of delivery personnel besides some other information that might not be readily available. “Physical passes are a problem. It’s time-consuming and not scalable. A better solution is to use ID cards,” said an executive at one of these companies, who did not wish to be named.While the Delhi government has said that it will issue e-passes, the Karnataka government is also expected to experiment with digital passes starting Friday. “It’s not completely physical everywhere. Delhi is issuing digital passes, while Gurgaon is in the process of doing it. Maybe some people did not have the time to immediately build an app, while some states are more prepared. As long as the government is helpful, the issue of the nature of the passes is not a matter (of concern),” said T A Krishnan, co-founder and CEO, Ecom Express, a third-party logistics company catering to online platforms.He said his fleet would be largely used for hyper-local deliveries within large cities now and there was no clarity on running vehicles interstate. According to him, interstate movement is a critical issue, as serving tier-2 or -3 consumers would be a challenge otherwise.Some executives have also said the definition of essential against non-essential should be allowed an industry self-certification, based on demand for goods and the ability to fulfill the orders. “A lot of products in transit which are pre curfew lockdown . The definition of non-essentials is limited as many have also ordered routers and laptops which are needed to work from home. Some have ordered blenders to cook at home while others have ordered toys for kids staying at home,” said a senior executive at one of the top e-tailers.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74845401,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-81618,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/issue-e-passes-define-essential-goods-e-tailers/articleshow/74837833.cms

However, there was respite on Thursday as most of the stores were not crowded and goods had been restocked.Cooking gas suppliers were also seen delivering LPG cylinders. Tripurari Singh, a deliveryman, said that the number of orders had gone up drastically. “We faced no problem from police.

I hope the situation doesn’t worsen and we keep getting supplies,” he added.A resident of Malviya Nagar, Anurita Sinha, said basic items like milk and bread were over by Wednesday afternoon. However, I got what I wanted today and the queue was shorter. Chemists had adopted an innovative way to keep distance from people by putting nylon ropes at the entrance.

But the online food delivery company has said it is willing to start delivering groceries in up to 150 top cities across the country if the supply chain starts opening up. Swiggy currently delivers food from restaurants, but also has a grocery delivery service called ‘Stores’ in two cities — Gurugram and Bengaluru.The company is willing to leverage its fleet of 2.5 lakh across 500 cities to deliver essentials as the country remains in a lockdown till April 14, so that consumers can stay at home as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has recommended. The government also said that online delivery of both cooked food and groceries is an “essential service”, which should be allowed to remain open.“This is wartime. We can open in as many cities as needed as it will take 1-2 days,” said Swiggy COO Vivek Sundar. He added that the pathway for it needs to be cleared — grocery stores should remain open, delivery fleet must operate without harassment, and supply chain of groceries from factories to shops must not get disrupted. Of Swiggy’s entire fleet, 80-85% is currently idle right now, according to Sundar, which can be leveraged for grocery delivery. During normal operational days, Swiggy was doing over 1.5 million deliveries a day until earlier this month.Swiggy and rival Zomato have been struggling with operations as local authorities in major cities have shut down restaurants, stopped trucks supplying materials to kitchens and delivery personnel have also taken a beating from the police.Sundar said Swiggy has been in discussions with police commissioners, political leadership and bureaucrats in all the cities where they are operational to get deliveries started.The appeal to these state governments has been to allow anyone who is associated with the making of food — staff of cloud kitchens & restaurants, delivery personnel, and vendors supplying raw material like vegetables & meat — to be allowed to operate. But Sundar optimistically estimated that food delivery operations may normalise by the weekend.“Our cancellation rates were 10x normal rate as restaurant staff was stuck or the delivery boy was not allowed to move. We are still struggling with beat cops on the ground even in cities like Bengaluru, which is in the best operational state in the country right now,” he said.

These included hospitality, aviation, banking & financial services and automobiles.As a result, the sensex, which had risen rallied nearly 1,600 points to over 30,000 in anticipation of an overall economic package, shed about 1,000 points. However, short-covering late in the session led to a rally that helped the sensex close with a gain of 1,411 points, at 29,947.In just three sessions, from its recent low at 25,639 on March 24, the index has gained nearly 17% or about 4,300 points. It was the best three-day rally for the Indian market since May 2009, data showed.Market players said with the March derivatives contracts expired on Thursday, it needs to be seen if the rally continues on Friday.The day’s gains came despite selling by foreign funds who recorded a net outflow figure of Rs 485 crore. Domestic funds, which were net buyers for over three weeks now, turned net sellers on Thursday at Rs 770 crore. According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka, the FM’s economic package aims to protect the poor from the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. “It would entail both cash transfer and food security, will cover about 80 crore poor people, while direct cash transfer would include farmers, MNREGA, poor widows, pensioners and divyaang, select group of women and some other needy people.

By the time curfew ends on April 14, the peak period of cashew yield will be over.Besides distillers, around 30,000 cashew farmers would take a hit, with ripe cashew applies lying unpicked as the distilleries are not functioning.The trade predicts there will be little feni production in the financial year 2020-21, as the cashew apple, a perishable fruit, is only available from March till May. The production of cashew apples slows down from mid-May.Even if curfew is lifted next month, traders say it will not be easy to start production. As per conservative estimates, 3 lakh litres of feni are produced in the state annually, apart from another 3 to 4 lakh litres, which are not accepted by distillers, who emphasise on premium in quality.Hansel Vaz, a feni distiller, said he is more concerned about daily wage earners who are dependent on them. “They must be provided for,” he stressed.With the Covid-19 threat, Vaz said the production process could not have been undertaken, even if the curfew was not in place. “Production involves working in close proximity to each other, thereby raising the risk of transmission,” he said.He said they (premium feni brands) will not able to sell their old stock, if any, with the collapse of the tourism industry. “It will take six to eight months for the tourism industry to get back on its feet after the curfew is lifted,” he said.Gurudatta Bhakta, president of the Cashew Feni and Distillers Association, said they are looking at staggering losses, but the labourers and farmers will be, by far, the worst affected.A top distiller from North Goa, Tukaram Haldankar said his industry cannot be an exception with the Covid-19 threat. “We are with the country in the fight against this disease, that has paralysed countries across the world,” he said.This comes as a big blow to the industry, at a time when it is striving to gain a foothold by trying to establish feni as a premium alcohol. By elevating the quality of their product, a few distillers have stepped up their efforts to export Goa’s traditional spirit over the past decade.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74842961,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-193492,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-cashew-apples-unpicked-bleak-season-for-feni-industry/articleshow/74837923.cms

Even as many branches are not able to operate because of a staff shortage, banks are warning of large crowds in branches as Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) account beneficiaries, unfamiliar with debit cards, approach branches for withdrawal.Meanwhile, ATM service providers say their employees are not being recognised as ‘essential services’ by police at the ground level. “If the government is going to put in more funds through DBT accounts, the last-mile reach is provided by the ATM network. Government agencies should help ATM service providers and cash-in-transit companies to do their job,” said NCR India managing director Navroze Dastur.He said that the ATM employees should be given curfew passes to be able to attend to the cash machines. “Our employees are doing a diligent job. But if they are beaten on the streets, they will say, ‘Why should we go out?” he added. ATMs are the backbone of cash disbursement as they can store up to Rs 20 lakh and enable over 200 withdrawals a day. “Law enforcement authorities should be able to identify people providing essential services and provide protection so that they can continue to provide services. These are not normal times and there is a need for everyone to get together to make things work,” said Electronic Payment and Services founder-director Mani Mamallan.While bank branches have been instructed to operate with a skeletal staff of manager-cashier and sub-staff, even this is proving to be a challenge. Banks are getting staff to take turns in attending office. In some regions, the managers have taken a call to operate branches on alternate days, but there is no instruction from the head office allowing for closure of branches. Most banks have exempted people with disabilities from attending office and are treating this as paid leave.For SBI, which has been at the forefront of distributing government benefits, another issue is government pension payouts. Pensioners collect their money from the branches and do not use the ATM as they are required to be present at the branch for life certificate verification.“Next week will be critical because of the salary and pension payment. The state government treasury prohibits banks from issuing ATM cards to pensioners. This needs to be amended forthwith so that pensioners can carry out their transactions through ATM,” said Maharashtra State Bank Employees Federation general secretary Devidas Tuljapurkar. He added that crowding at branches not only puts branch employees at risk but also increases the risk of a contagion.The government has said that it will credit Rs 500 every month for the next three months into PMJDY accounts held by women. Banks were asked to give the number of such beneficiaries on Thursday, following which the transfer date would be announced. They have already been instructed to ensure that there is enough cash with branches, ATMs or business correspondents across the country.

PATNA: Power consumption in the state capital has marginally declined with the closure of commercial and industrial establishments due to the 21-day lockdown.

An energy department official said the city’s peak power demand has declined by 13.61% since January 22 when the country observed ‘janata curfew’ to prevent spread of coronavirus.

Maximum power demand in the city on Wednesday was 311mw in the evening hours (between 7pm and 9pm) against 360mw on Saturday, a day before the of ‘janata curfew’.

A senior Patna Electricity Supply Unit (PESU) said there was slight fluctuation in power demand in the city, mainly because of closure of malls, restaurants, hotels and coaching classes, hostels, educational institutes (schools and colleges) and industrial units.

“The power demand generally remains low during this time of the year because most consumers use only lights, bulbs and fans. However, there is more than usual decline in demand this time due to closure of commercial and industrial units,” the official added.

BSPHCL CMD-cum-principal secretary of energy department Pratyaya Amrit refused to comment on decline in power consumption.

According to BSPHCL sources, the maximum power demand in the state was at 3,716mw on Saturday, 3,842mw on March 22, 3,905mw on March 23, 3,838mw on March 24 and 3,970mw on March 25.

A National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) official said power was being supplied to people uninterruptedly. “The total demand of power from Bihar is around 2,300mw and we are supplying around 2,200mw. In the evening hours, the peak demand goes up to 3,000mw. Accordingly, we supply up to 90% of total power demand. There is no shortage of power in the state. We have enough coal stock,” NTPC’s public relations manager Vishwanath Chandan said.

One of them, a Munger native (38), died on Saturday. Two more positive cases — a 45-year-old woman, whose son had returned from Italy, and a 25-year-old youth, who had come back from Scotland — were reported on Sunday. The fourth person, a 29-year-old who had returned from Bhavnagar in Gujarat, tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday night. Two fresh cases were reported on Wednesday night. The first is an 11-year-old kid and the other is a 35-year-old woman.Earlier in March, medical journal ‘Lancet’ had stated that the average age of those, who died of coronavirus, was 69 years.As the deadly disease is spreading in Bihar and infecting young people, health experts claim that youngsters are not immune to the virus. Last week the World Health Organisation had also pointed out that young people were not immune to Covid-19.Dr Hira Lal Mahto, professor of microbiology at the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital , said it was a myth that the virus did not affect youngsters.“The risk is higher in older people because of underlying diseases like diabetes and heart problems. Also, their immunity is not as high as that of young adults or teenagers. Hence, no matter what age group an individual belongs to, the impact of the virus will depend on the seriousness of their underlying health conditions,” he told this newspaper.Sharing similar views, Pratyush Kumar, a health specialist at the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), pointed out that although the highest mortality rate was among people above 65 years of age, it was possible for young adults to get infected by the virus.“Any underlying or genetic vulnerability can worsen the chances of death in younger adults if they are tested Covid-19 positive,” he said.Talking about precautions to be taken by young adults, a senior doctor at the PMCH’s virology department, said, “People should not step out of their houses and maintain distance even with family members in order to prevent the spread of the virus.

CHANDIGARH: Like the first day, the second day also remained chaotic as the UT administration failed to streamline supply of vegetables and fruits in the city.

Even as the UT hired services of the CTU buses, door-to-door supply was missing. There was chaos in sectors where these buses moved, as a large number of people gathered to buy the items.

Of the planned 150 CTU buses, 69 plied on Thursday.

The police presence was negligible at many places, which made things difficult. On the first day, CTU buses covered only a few parts of the city and a big portion, including many sectors, colonies and villages, was left out. Source said the number of CTU buses would be increased in the coming few days, so that they covered all areas of the city.

Raj Malhotra, a resident Sector 43, said, “No bus carrying vegetables and fruits came to our sector. I even called up the officers concerned of the Chandigarh administration, but got no reply. The situation is serious as we are not getting essential commodities for the past few days.”

Hitesh Puri, president of Chandigarh Residents’ Associations’ Welfare Federation (Crawfed) said, “There was no supply of vegetables and fruits in the southern sectors of the city, and people waited till evening. I have written to the officers concerned of the municipal corporation, but in vain.”

Baljinder Singh Bittu, president of Federation of Sectors’ Welfare Association of Chandigarh, said, “Vegetables and fruits were supplied to some sectors of the city, but it was completely mismanaged. There was no door-to-door delivery as buses were stationed at one place and residents gathered to make purchases. There was no proper distribution.”

Flouting the orders, many vendors were seen on cycle carts. A senior officer in charge of the supply said, “Though vendors on cycle carts are not allowed, they reached the Sector 26 apni mandi early morning and took vegetables and fruits from there to sell in the city. From Friday, they won’t be allowed to enter the market.”

Mandi mess

Like Wednesday, chaos was witnessed on Thursday morning too at apni mandi in Sector 26. The MC employees and officers were seen struggling to manage the situation by streamlining vegetable and fruit vendors and providing them CTU buses to sell their stuff in different parts of the city. UT administrator VP Singh Badnore also took stock of the situation and assured that in coming days, things would improve.

Dairy supply better

The supply of milk, curd, butter and other dairy items was much better on Thursday as compared with Wednesday. The supply came to booths across the city and was then distributed in majority of the sectors. Moreover, at some places people purchased directly from the booths.

Four policemen, including the Rupoh police station SHO, were injured in the attack on Wednesday night. A named FIR was lodged against 40 persons.

The policemen had visited Mansagar Patori around 8pm and requested the villagers assembled at a place to stay indoors and follow the lockdown rules in view of the coronavirus threat.

Coronavirus live updates

“After patrolling in Pande Gangot, Fareda, Patori and other villages to convince people to stay at home, the police party reached Mansagar Patori around 8pm. Around 40 persons were sitting outside their houses in four to five groups. When we asked them to go back to their houses, they initially refused saying they did not believe in the PM’s appeal. But, later, they reluctantly obeyed,” Rupoh PS SHO Santosh Kumar said on Thursday.

“However, when the police party was moving out of the narrow bylanes, a crowd of around 200 people attacked us with stones and rods. Three constables, namely Bachcha Paswan, Ritesh Kumar and Gopal Singh, and myself got injured. Paswan’s skull was fractured and the Sadar hospital doctors referred him to Pawapuri Medical College and Hospital in neighbouring Nalanda district . The others were admitted to the Sadar hospital,” the SHO added.

He said Pakribarma SDPO Mukesh Sah visited the injured cops in the night.

A large number of the migrant delivery workforce is afraid of venturing out or has fled to their hometowns fearing police action, besides the spread of the coronavirus and lack of income. And the skeletal workforce still present in the cities has faced hostile policemen in the last two days. Delivery executives especially have been beaten up, which has discouraged them from starting their two-wheelers for new assignments.Prashant Devkar, 26, an executive for online food delivery platform Zomato in Mumbai, said he was stopped by the police in the city a few days ago. But he was lucky to escape without any injuries while on his way to deliver food. “I came to Sangli (his homtown in Maharashtra) a couple of days ago as I wasn’t sure of my income and food arrangement. On my way to the village, I was stopped thrice by the police. Even If I want to go back, I can’t right now,” said Devkar, who has been delivering food in Mumbai for three years.At least two of his colleagues have also returned to their village. Most of the co-workers are gone and are largely out-of-touch due to the national lockdown. The effect is visible across online platforms even when orders are reaching a new high.“We have launched a big exercise to get our people back. They all left for their hometowns when we had to shut. And they are still a bit scared after seeing what the cops did to their colleagues. We are even talking to their parents. They are slowly coming back,” said Bigbasket CEO Hari Menon . Bigbasket has a fleet of about 25,000 personnel.“It’s fear on the ground of both police-beating and the virus. They still don’t have full confidence to venture out. And newspapers aren’t reaching them. So some confidence-building stuff is needed on the ground to bring them back,” said a senior e-commerce industry executive, who did not wish to be quoted, adding that serious public messaging by the government authorities can solve the issue.Some of the platforms, like meat-delivery company Licious, have reached out to blue-collar staffing firm TeamLease to on-board new delivery executives, a person aware of the matter said. On Thursday, for example, only 30% of the delivery staff was active for medicine delivery platform Medlife. The company’s delivery capabilities were down by 60% in the last two days and it might take another few days to clear the backlog.More than personal safety, it’s the police action that has caused delivery personnel to stay away from fulfilling new orders, said Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder and EVP of TeamLease, one of the largest companies providing blue-collar staffing in the country. “In Bengaluru, till the day before, there were no major disruptions. The coronavirus-led restrictions have been there for some time now, but largely the harassment has caused this. Employers are also asking why take the risk: What if something happens to the person delivering?” she said.According to her, fulfilling the rising demand for delivery personnel from online platforms currently would be a challenge as many of them can’t easily return to the large cities. “They are quite shocked, and many are shying away from going out, fearing further backlash from the police because this issue was escalated on social media,” an executive of a medicine-delivery platform said.Mohammed Shaukat Ali, 43, who runs a medicine shop in Hyderabad, said three out of his four delivery staff had gone back to their villages. “I have to do the deliveries now along with the other person who has stuck around. We have seen issues happening in other cities, but it’s relatively better here, so far. The bigger problem is — some of the larger outlets are shut or being told to shut, that will hit availability of medicines,” he added.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74845033,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-162309,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hostile-cops-hit-food-pharma-delivery-biz/articleshow/74837818.cms

PANAJI: In a welcome relief to citizens under lockdown, fair price shops (FPS) will keep their shutters open April 1 onwards. Only four essential commodities — rice, dal, sugar and oil — will be sold. Owing to the prevailing situation, even non-ration card holders will be permitted to purchase from FPS.

Gaude said he has spoken to chief minister Pramod Sawant to work out a mechanism to keep stores open during the lockdown with notified timings and the list of items that will be sold. “We are planning to permit non-card holders to purchase ration from 8am to 11am till the lockdown ends. We will give directions to grocers and traders to follow this,” he said.

There are approximately 450 licenced fair price shops in Goa and over 3,39,348 ration card holders.

Currently, the godowns have a quota of 10,000 tonne of food grains, Gaude said. “We will collect food grains from the Food Corporation of India (FCI). These will be distributed among the FPS so that they can start selling them from April 1,” he said. Vendors running FPS have to apply for the curfew pass with the collector.

Yavatmal: Police in Pandharkawda in Yavatmal district intercepted five containers transporting over 350 migrant labourers from Telangana, near Pimpal Khuti check post on Thursday. All the labourers are from Jodhpur .

While the vehicles were turned back, the labourers have decided to walk 1,500 kms to their homes. TOI learns that they do not have enough money to even buy a meal along the way.

The labourers were working in Hyderabad and staying in rented accommodations. After the lockdown was announced, their house owners forced them to vacate immediately.

The labourers then made a deal with the drivers of five containers which were being driven to Jodhpur. The container was apparently meant to transport essential goods amid the nationwide lockdown.

The journey started from Hyderabad on Wednesday. The labourers were packed into five containers.

When the vehicles reached the Pimpal Kuti check post in Yavatmal on NH 7, the police stopped them and asked the drivers to open the container doors. Expecting cattle heads, the cops were shocked to find them packed with humans.

Yavatmal SP M Rajkumar said as the containers had not entered Maharashtra, police sent them back.

Distributors themselves have started supplying less after Delhi government advised against hoarding, he added.On Tuesday, Delhi government asked druggists and chemist shops not to sell hydroxychloroquinolones (HCQS), chloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and related products to anyone without a prescription “from a registered medical practitioner having a MD general medicine degree/a pulmonogist”. In a letter addressed to the All Chemist Association of Delhi, the drugs control department said, “It has been observed that some of the consumers/public are buying the above medicines for preventive use.”But the owners and employees of chemist shops across the city TOI spoke to echoed the problem of shortage, especially of these drugs. Commuting is also an issue, most of them said.“We have given employees an ID card so that the cops know that they work in a medical store, one of the essential services. Still they are being stopped.

Sources said a group of five youths who were marching from Madhya Pradesh’s Gwalior towards their native place were made to crawl and jump by a constable at Nawada crossing of Budaun district on Wednesday morning for allegedly violating the lockdown. In the viral video, two persons could be seen crawling while carrying their bags on their back and a constable who was armed with two lathis could be heard telling them to jump. Three more youths crawling at some distance could be seen in the video.

“A group of youths who are in their 20s came from Gwalior and were humiliated by a constable on duty. The youths who were migrant workers were walking towards Bareilly city,” said a police official.

Budaun SSP Ashok Kumar Tripathi said, “The incident occurred at Nawada crossing, which connects five roads, under Civil Lines police station of Budaun. An under-training constable, who is also under probation, posted at Civil Lines police station did it. Apart from this constable, a few senior constables and sub-inspectors were also on duty there and were checking other vehicles at Nawada. When these senior cops learnt about the constable’s act, they scolded and stopped him and removed him from duty.”

He added, “Being police chief of Budaun district, I feel sorry and am ashamed because such an act should not have been done. The SP (city) will probe the matter and action will be taken accordingly.”

Like these group of youths, many migrant workers, mostly daily-wage labourers, are forced to walk hundreds of kilometres to their native villages after nationwide lockdown. Most of them are walking on an empty stomach in the heat. On Thursday, 17 migrant workers who covered a distance of over 300 kilometres on foot from Ghaziabad and reached Shahjahanpur beating hunger and restrictions laid down by police. However, their journey is still long as they have to cover a distance of nearly 400 kilometres to reach their hometown in Basti.

Vijay Kumar Gautam, 23, who started marching on Tuesday, told TOI, “After our factory got closed following lockdown, we had no food and no medical facility near our premises. It is better to fight against the pandemic disease with our family members rather than living alone and dying of hunger.”

He added, “During our journey, we receive mixed treatment from police as we were welcomed with batons at someplace while we were offered bananas and biscuits at a few locations.”

Another worker Rajesh Kumar said, “We didn’t get much help on way here as a a few people thought we might be infected with novel coronavirus because we came from Ghaziabad.”

Later on Thursday afternoon, this group entered the border of Lakhimpur Kheri district where police provided them lunch and ensured their medical check-up with the support of medical teams.

Lakhimpur Kheri CMO Manoj Agarwal said, “We have screened all the migrant workers and no suspected case was found so far. We are screening all the labourers who have recently reached to make sure that no one is carrying the symptoms of the pandemic.”

PUNE: Revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat on Thursday said publication of this year’s Ready Reckoner (RR) rates has been postponed in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak in the state.

“Revenue department officials are busy with their health department counterparts tackling the coronavirus crisis. The Ready Reckoner rates will be published only after the state is free of Covid-19,” Thorat told TOI.

“The revenue department had almost finalised the Ready Reckoner rates. It needed a fortnight more to wrap up the procedure. The existing Ready Reckoner rates will continue till the new structure is announced,” he added.

The Ready Reckoner rates, which are prices of a residential property, land or commercial property for a given area, are published on March 31 every year and implemented from April 1. All calculations related to real estate, such as stamp duty, registration, premiums and tax collection, are based on the Ready Reckoner rates.

Referring to the developers’ request to the government to not increase this year’s Ready Reckoner rates, the minister said the rates would be rationalized.

“This is likely in areas with high rates,” Thorat said, though he refused to divulge more details.

A senior official in the revenue department said though the rates have never been brought down in the past, the state government was working towards rationalization of the prices. In the last two years of the previous BJP-Shiv Sena government, there was no hike in the Ready Reckoner rates. The last time the Ready Reckoner rates were hiked in Maharashtra was in 2017-18.

Property registrations at 27 offices in the city and Pimpri Chinchwad have already been stopped as a part of the social distancing strategy to check the spread of coronavirus. Realtors have written to the state government about the overall slump in the sector and also how the Covid-19 outbreak has affected real estate sector.

Thorat has, in the meantime, told the district collectors to ensure that agriculture work was not affected during the lockdown period.

“Harvesting machinery have reached the state from Punjab. There should be adequate fuel supply for the functioning of the machines. The administration has to ensure that movement of vehicles with essential goods remains hassle-free,” he said.

CHANDIGARH: UT adviser Manoj Parida on Thursday took to Twitter to ask the city residents about improvements required in services rendered by the administration in the wake of 21-day lockdown. He wrote, “Hi Chandigarh, any improvement in service? Bad news can be given in polite words too.”

Soon thereafter, complaints started pouring in.

Navdeep Sharma from Dhanas wrote, “No improvement in Dhanas (Milk Colony). I am still waiting for vegetables and announcements for their delivery through police van or other medium.”

The DIG traffic replied, “For peripheral areas, special teams have been constituted. They are loading supplies. Delivery will be done in a short while.”

A resident of Sector 28, Anubhav wrote, “Vendor for Sector 28 is unresponsive. Not able to procure milk, vegetables and ration. It leaves us with no choice except going out of the house, which I don’t want to! Please help.”

The residents also raised the issue of limited stock available with vendors. “Although the lockdown is a good idea, there is a shortage of vegetables with the vendors and no fruits are available, eg vendor for Sector 35 has only limited supply of potatoes, onions and taro root (arbi). Also, he is not able to distribute properly,” wrote Nishant Alhawat .

Sanjeev of Sector 56 said, “No vegetable and essential item supply in Sector 56 since imposition of the curfew. I have to collect medicines for my parents from CGHS dispensary in Sector 45, but not able to do so.”

A resident of Sector 41, Nikhil, said there was no improvement in his area as he got only two packets of milk after standing for an hour in queue.

From Butrela village Pradeep Chaudhary wrote, “Please provide multiple vendors for Buterla village as in one building almost 31 families are living on rent. A single vendor cannot serve the purpose.”

While describing the situation of Sector 40C, Abhishek Vashishta said, “Bus stopped at one place and remained there for over an hour while people stood in lines without maintaining distance.”

On soaring prices, city resident Amit Garg said, “Black marketing is going on, vegetable vendors are selling at soaring prices. Those delivering groceries are asking for a minimum Rs 2,000 bill. This is absolute chaos. My suggestion would be to give curfew passes to all grocery stores else it will become a nightmare.”

PUNE: A looming haze on rail services after the lockdown has left people in two minds about booking or re-booking tickets for dates post April 14.

Private firm employee Kumaresh Prasad cancelled trip to his hometown in Patna this week amid lockdown and is now confused about booking the tickets for later dates. “I had booked two-way tickets on the Pune-Danapur Express to travel on March 18 and 30. However, in the wake of the lockdown, I am not sure about booking tickets for later dates. I believe staying at home is the best option for now,” he said.

Though the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) website states that people could book tickets for dates after April 14, Railways officials were not sure if train services would resume completely after the 21-day lockdown period. “We don’t have any information on whether the lockdown will end on April 14 or be extended,” an official from the Pune rail division said.

The IRCTC said people need not cancel their e-tickets as full refunds would be generated. The Pune rail authorities requested people to not rush to cancel tickets purchased from the counters as refunds would be issued till June 21.

“We had planned a trip to Shimla in May and had booked tickets accordingly. We have decided not to book tickets even if the lockdown ends,” Koregaon Park resident Shridhar Adkar said.

Sources in the IRCTC told TOI that future bookings were expected to be on the lower side. “After the coronavirus scare is over, no one will immediately get into their regular routine. Travel will take a back seat unless it is urgent,” a source said.

After a meeting at the lieutenant governor’s office with officials on Thursday, the state government decided to allow e-commerce platforms to deliver essential supplies, including food, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, to homes.The government has started issuing colour-coded e-passes to allow easy movement for those engaged in essential services. The 1031 helpline number for electronic passes was heavily congested on Thursday. The government, therefore, created an online platform, epass.jantasamvad.org/epass/init/, for the purpose. Former Delhi University teacher and football commentator Novy Kapadia, 67, who lives in Naraina Vihar, was among those who couldn’t get through on 1031. “I called over 10 times and also tried the online platform, but didn’t succeed in getting a response. My medical helper needs to travel from Wazirpur to my house every day and needs an e-pass,” the ailing Kapadia said.The number of total lines available on the helpline has been increased to 30. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, mindful that even this wouldn’t be enough, said, “We have requested police to allow essential service providers without e-passes to proceed while the government works to provide the passes to such people.""At a press conference with LG Anil Baijal, the CM instructed the SDMs and area ACPs to ensure shops selling medicines, milk, vegetables, groceries and other essential items were kept open. “We have also asked these officials to ensure that the factories manufacturing essential goods are kept operational,” Kejriwal said.Delhi government announced that there would be no restrictions on movement for e-commerce platforms providing essential services. “The company ID cards of their delivery executives will be accepted as proof and they will be permitted to travel,” the CM said. The LG has directed the district magistrates and DCPs to facilitate e-commerce operations.Kerjriwal also said that doctors and medical workers involved in managing Covid-19 cases will regularly undergo screening. The number of testing centres in Delhi has been increased. The mohalla clinics will continue to provide healthcare services in neighbourhoods too. Referring to a doctor at one of the clinics testing corona positive along with his wife and daughter, the CM said, “While it is a sad incident, the rumour that because of this every mohalla clinic will be closed is completely false information. We will ensure each mohalla clinic is fully functional at this challenging time.”He continued, “The central government, Delhi government, police and the residents of Delhi are working together to combat this pandemic. Most of the people are following the instructions and staying indoor, but we have seen cases of violations of the lockdown orders.

NEW DELHI: Amid erratic supply of items in the hour of crisis, several retail stores and vendors are selling the essential commodities at inflated rates. People, who are forced to buy these items at double the prices or even more, are complaining that the vendors are cashing in on the lockdown. TOI takes a look at the situation across the city.

“As no delivery services were available, I had to step out of the house to get some vegetables on Wednesday. All supermarkets were closed, and with great difficulty I was able to locate one greengrocer in the entire Acharya Niketan market. Potato that I bought at Rs 20 per kg a few days ago was available for Rs 50 per kg,” said 25-year-old Isha Banerji, a resident of Mayur Vihar Phase I.

“I had gone to buy vegetables and foodgrains. The store did not have long queues, but I was shocked to see that the prices of the items had been doubled. When I asked him about it, he chose to ignore the question. Whoever objected to the inflated rates, he told them that they could either buy the item at the revised price or leave it. We could afford it, but what about those who can’t,” questioned Jyoti Yadav, a resident of Janakpuri B Block.

The poor are in for trouble as many are not able to pay for basic items like pulse and rice. The problem is severe in west, east, south and southeast areas where several people shared instances where they were charged double the usual price of the item.

Rohan Sharma, a resident of Alaknanda, said, “A pack of 20 cigarettes is for Rs 300 on a regular day. Now, they are being sold for Rs 400 at some places. The local vendors are closed because of the lockdown, so it's only available with a few departmental stores.”

Statistics available with health departments of Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur and Solapur indicates that the number of people, who arrived in their jurisdiction, is on a decline as compared to last week.

The government has made it mandatory for all those moving towards their native villages to register their names with local authorities. In addition, village-level committees have also been instructed to keep a watch on the movements of guests.

Officials involved in this exercise said that stoppage of public transport, including ST buses and railways, had indicated to people that they had to stay put wherever they were. Screening at all entry points and police action has curbed temporary migration.

In many villages, people have blocked the roads by putting up barricades or boards, sending strong message that guests were unwanted in the village. Such incidents, even though not welcome, have had impact, said the officials.

Administration, however, is concerned as it is a tough task to monitor the movement of thousands of people, who have shifted to their native places. In Kolhapur district alone, more than 41,000 people have registered themselves. All of them were taken to the nearest primary health center and those with symptoms were further admitted to hospital.

People coming from outside Kolhapur district have been asked to stay in home quarantine for 14 days even if they do not show any symptoms of COVID-19. Health teams were putting stamp of home quarantine on their hands so that they can be easily identified to ensure social distancing. In 89 villages of Gadhinglaj taluka of Kolhapur district, 5,671 people have been registered till Wednesday night. Kagal, 30 km away from Kolhapur and close to Karnataka border, as many as 3,500 people have been identified in the category. Around 3,000 people in Shirol taluka have registered their names with local authorities.

In Mahabaleshwar, district administration has set up a separate cell considering large number of people coming for medical checkup. Many people from Jawli and Wai are settled in either Mumbai or Pune for employment and majority of them have returned.

Solapur municipal corporation has started a facility under which guests can fill their online information. Kolhapur municipal corporation has also started an app for the convenience of such people.

But for the last five days, this shopping arcade has been wearing a deserted look.The mall, which on any other day is abuzz with hundreds of visitors, now has a handful of people who are looking to stock up essentials from the super market, the only store which is open.Helping visitors load their items into their cars is Abdul Rahim, a 25-year-old guard . Most of the visitors thank him, not just for helping them but also continuing his service when the entire country is in a lockdown The strength of guards at the mall has been brought down to less than half. “I had a choice. My employer had asked me if I would like to stay home, but that would have meant a pay-cut. Moreover, somebody has to do this job. As far as I am physically fit, I would not want to sit back,” says Abdul, who admits that being the only earning member in a family of five, pay-cut was not something he could afford.“I have two sisters and elderly parents to take care of. But seeing people, particularly the elderly, queue up and struggle for essentials, I am glad I am here and can help them in whatever small way I can. It feels nice when people actually compliment for my service,” he said.Helping customers is not part of his duty, but Abdul likes doing that. When TOI was interacting with him, Abdul spotted an elderly couple with a trolley full of grocery items. He rushes towards them to help. “Itna saman hai, gaadi main rakhva ke aata hun (Lots of goods, let me help load it in the vehicle),” he said. The elderly couple was grateful for his help.For the first three days of the lockdown in the state, Abdul walked 10 km from his home to reach the mall. “I did not have a vehicle pass then, so I had to walk in the mornings and again at night after a 12-hour duty. Cops had stopped me on a few occasions, but seeing my uniform and I-card they let me go.” he said.Adjusting his mask, he added, “People are scared and puzzled. They will spend their time at home provided they get basic things including grocery, milk and vegetables. As the grocery stores are open and my employer needs me here, there is no way I will stay away from duty.”Abdul always wears a mask and makes it a point to wash his hands several times a day. “I make it a point not to shake hands with anybody. After duty hours, I wash my hands and feet with soap before entering and head straight for a bath. Even dinner comes after that,” he said.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/virus-couldnt-stop-this-mall-guard-from-helping-people/articleshow/74837568.cms

104,['27/03/2020'],State proposes rapid test but ICMR not keen,"Kochi: Kerala government has requested Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) to grant permission to conduct rapid test to check if there is community spread in the state.

However, ICMR has reservations about permitting rapid test as even a Covid-19 infected person in the initial stage may test negative. Besides, there may also be lots of false positives. “In the rapid blood test, the results come positive much later and it remains positive for many weeks. So we have not yet started it,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, ICMR. At the moment, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are done.

Rapid test, on the other hand, is a surveillance test and is not for diagnosis of Covid-19. And Kerala government has been consistent in its argument that such a test is essential for epidemiological study of the disease spread in the community. They plan to test common persons who have recovered from bout of respiratory infection.

Kerala has started community screening using PCR tests but government officials admit that it is not possible to do large number of PCR tests. “Since ICMR has not yet permitted us to do rapid test, the state government through Rajiv Gandhi Biotechnology Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, has already started tests in the community,” said Kerala state planning board member Dr B Eqbal.

Indian Medical Association (IMA) has also been requesting that rapid test should be made available pan-India as the disease has been declared a pandemic. “Since the entire globe is affected, it is better to identify the hot spots and community spread at the earliest so that focused aggressive measures can be taken in that particular region to prevent further spread,” said former IMA president Dr VG Pradeep Kumar.

“Rapid test is far easier to do and doesn’t need technical expertise. Also, the cost involved is much lesser. For rapid test you require blood and for PCR secretion is required. Large number of tests can be done using the rapid test method,” said Healthcare expert Dr K P Aravindan.

Meanwhile, as the number of people in quarantine increases in the state, there is excess burden on the approved testing labs with a government official admitting that often the waiting time for test results now is 3 to 4 days. Despite the increasing burden, the state government is not too keen on granting permission for private labs to test for Covid-19.

These patients are facing difficulties in maintaining normal oxygen saturation level. While other 38 patients do not have such complaints so far, the 69-year-old Covid-19 positive Italian tourist, who died of cardiac arrest last week, had pre-existing lung ailments.According to doctors, virus has infiltrated into the lungs of the two patients and caused hazy lung opacity.One of the two patients is a doctor who was rushed from Bhilwara where he was finding it difficult to maintain oxygen saturation. When his condition deteriorated, he was admitted to SMS Hospital two days ago. However, doctors claimed that his condition is improving. “In radiological investigation, it is found that he has patches on his lungs due to lung infiltrate,” a senior SMS Hospital doctor said. He is also living with diabetes and taking insulin.Another patient, who was also brought from Bhilwara and was working as a nurse in the same hospital where 17 persons contracted Covid-19 infection, has also reported bilateral lung infiltrates. He is also finding it difficult to maintain normal oxygen saturation levels. However, he does not have any co-morbidity such as diabetes or hypertension, which may help him in recovery, the doctors said, who are keeping a close eye on the patients.However, doctors claimed that the condition of the two patients is improving.However, SMS Hospital additional superintendent Dr Ajit Singh said, “No patient is on ventilator support.”Apart from antiretroviral therapy, the doctors are providing them antibiotics for helping them overcome from pneumonia.

Tens of thousands of desperate people, mainly migrant labourers reduced to joblessness by the lockdown and with little or no money or food, have been streaming out of India’s major cities for the past few days, trying to walk hundreds of kilometres to reach their homes in small towns and villages.These tides of men, women and children, driven by the uncompromising arithmetic of survival and fear of contracting the coronavirus , pose a new challenge to the government’s all-out attempts to contain the spread of the disease. “Some 26,000 people have reached Ratanpur, on the Gujarat-Rajasthan border , in the past two-three days. Our teams are first listing them before medical teams screen them. Those who have been advised quarantine are stamped and then transported to their villages on buses arranged by the administration,” according to Dungarpur collector Kanaram.There are thousands leaving the Delhi-NCR, trudging down the Yamuna Expressway and the expressway to Meerut. Raj Kumar is one: he has set out for home with just Rs 1,000 in hand. But home is Chhapra in Bihar , 1,050 km away. And he has a toddler in his arms while his wife walks beside him. He is hoping he could hitch a ride, or several, home. Police checkposts on the outskirts of Jaipur are coming across people walking back to their villages. TOI visits the Jaipur-Agra highway and finds hundreds walking on the road, carrying bags.“My village is 110 km from Jaipur. I have no option but to go back. The police stopped us at a few places but, when convinced that we had no other choice, they let us carry on,” says Kishan Mahawar a daily-wage labourer.The scale of migration was so large that it frightened senior officers at the Jaipur police commissionerate when told by subordinates that hundreds of workers were walking towards Transport Nagar. “A migration is on… We have spoken to many of them who said they are left without any money. Yesterday we helped some of them reach their villages,” said Jaipur commissioner Anand Srivastav. On the Gujarat-Rajasthan border, patwaris were preparing lists of the arriving population according to the areas to which they belong and medical teams of 20 doctors and 40 nurses have been working day and night screening them. Most of them do not have money and had not eaten properly, Kanaram, the collector, said, adding though it was a large number of people, they were adhering to the social distancing protocol “as far as possible”.“Around 16,000 had reached till Wednesday and some 12,000 were reported to have reached in seven hours on Thursday, between 6 am and 1 pm. A large number is expected in the next two days,” Kanaram said, adding that 50 buses had been arranged by the district administration to transport these people to their homes. In Maharashtra, a man walked 135km, from Nagpur to Sindewahi, and was stop ped by the police about 25km from his village.Separately, police in the state’s Pandharkawda district prevented a tragedy when they intercepted five container vehicles stuffed with over 350 migrant labourers from Telangana. All belonged to Jodhpur. Yavatmal SP M Rajkumar said since the vehicles had not entered Maharashtra, the police had sent them back. But the labourers, forced out of their places of residence by their employers in Telangana, decided to walk on to their homes 1,500 km away.In UP, over 160 daily-wage earners travelling from Delhi and its surroundings in three vehicles, including a water tanker, were stopped by police. After medical examinations determined they were not suffering from Covid-19, they were sent on to their villages in Bahraich, Kaiserganj and Huzooprur. In Hyderabad, about a dozen labourers from a slum had set out on a journey of about 600km, to a village in Visakhapatnam.By Thursday they had walked and hitched rides to Kodada, on the Telangana-Andhra Pradesh border. Gujarat was no different. Thousands left Ahmedabad for their homes in MP, Rajasthan and UP, while police tempted them to stay back with promises of shelter and food.

Sanguem deputy collector S Ajay Gavde told TOI that he has issued 15 permissions to fair price and grocery shops and two to milk outlets. This will cover the entire taluka of Sanguem, including municipal area and all panchayat areas.

He said volunteers have been identified with the help of Sanguem MLA Prasad Gaonkar. Each team of volunteers will be given vehicles to facilitate door-to-door delivery, free of cost.

Garbage collectors roped in by the Sanguem municipality have been tasked with taking lists of essentials from each household while they are on their door-to-door garbage collection rounds. These lists will then be given to the respective grocery stores, Gavde said.

In Quepem, residents queued up outside the town’s Sahakar Bhandar outlet to get essentials after deputy collector Rohit Kadam issued permission to keep the store open through the day. Kadam also issued passes to around eight volunteers for home delivery services.

Quepem mamlatdar Ramesh Gaonkar requested customers to maintain a metre’s distance from one another while waiting in queue outside Sahakar Bhandar. The volunteers took down each customer’s list and instructed them to return home, assuring free delivery by evening.

Kishore is a software engineer working from home. “Since my shift is from 2pm to 11pm, I volunteer between 6am and 1pm,” he said and added that since he lives with a joint family, he has a bath outside the house when he gets back and does not go anywhere near family members without a mask.The Cyberabad police has recently started working with volunteers on several fronts including checking travel permits, helping raise awareness and ensuring distance is maintained among people at public spaces. “Today (Thursday), two cops came with me as I made my rounds in Attapur, Hyderguda and Upparpally. Our focus has been on supermarkets, banks and medical stores where people are still gathering in large numbers,” said Kishore, who is volunteering with the Rajendranagar police station. The 30-year-old said that while people were being cautious, several preventive measures were being forgotten.“For instance, supermarkets are providing hand sanitisers inside but that serves no purpose when people are ignoring the 6-ft demarcations outside and no temperature checks are being done,” Kishore said. He added that he had called up the managements of several stores and ensured demarcations were followed outside as well. According to Kishore, ATMs and medical shops were problem areas where people have been seen falling over each other to get service.Doing a similar job is another software professional, Teja Alimilli, who has been volunteering with the Miyapur PS. “Besides identifying crowded areas and ensuring preventive steps are being taken, we are also ensuring limits are maintained on purchases. Only people with permission are being allowed to buy in bulk,’ he said. Another local, Hareesh Jayini, too has been volunteering but with the Kukatpally police. He has been manning the checkpost at Usha Mullapudi junction. “We are checking permits for people travelling across this junction to ensure no one is on the roads unnecessarily. Tomorrow (Friday), a vehicle with speakers will be assigned to us. We will be making announcements along with Kukatpally PS personnel about implementing social distancing. After that, we will go back and inspect whether businesses have implemented social distancing or not,” he said.Getting volunteers together are Sai Teja and Ramanjeet Singh who have been pivotal in organising the effort. “We are handling the back-end work, noting down the complaints that come in and creating a database to help the cops address them,” said Singh, an IT professional. “We hope to ease cops’ burden. Even before the crisis broke out, I was volunteering with the cops to man traffic. Now I will double my efforts,” Teja said.

112,['27/03/2020'],Fireworks industry workers seek urgent aid in tough times,"Madurai: Employees working in cracker units reeling under the lockdown have urged the government to provide monetary assistance to them till the units resumed functioning.

The cracker industry at Sivakasi in Virudhunagar district employs nearly eight lakh workers directly and indirectly. R Pandi, a resident of O Sankaralingapuram village, said an employee would earn an average of Rs 350 to 400 per day by working in a cracker unit and the salary is disbursed every weekend.

“Since all units are closed, the employees would have received the salary for working during the last week with which they would be able to manage their family expenses for nearly 10 days. As the units would be closed for the next 21 days, we will start facing difficulties after 10 days,” noted Pandi.

He said when the employees are in need of money, they used to request for advance salary, but they are not sure they would get it now. Another employee, K Sundaram from Maraneri, said the rise in prices of essential commodities will affect them severely. To make matters worse, they are all forced to stock up essential commodities. Hence the government should provide them monetary assistance, he said.

The district secretary of Fireworks and Matches Workers Association affiliated to CITU, M Mahalakshmi, said they will meet the owners and submit representation to the district administration to protect the livelihood of the employees during the lockdown period. The president of Tamil Nadu Fireworks and Amorces Manufacturers Association P Ganesan said that though the fireworks industry would come to a standstill during the lockdown period, instructions have been given to the members of the association to take care of the welfare of their employees by proving monetary support.

They are the everyday heroes from Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Orange City Water (OCW) who work hard to ensure scheduled water supply to Nagpurians.Ashwin from Nehru Nagar zone, who operates a valve from 4am to 12 noon at various places, said, “I ensure that I stay fit and fine so that I continue to play the vital role of supplying water to all Nagpurians.”“Our responsibilities have increased as compared to normal working days. Even our seniors also encourage field teams especially supervisors and valve men. Amid coronavirus scare, we started feeling proud that we are real field soldiers who are supplying drinking water at Nagpur’s every tap,” he said when TOI spotted him operating a valve by wearing safety gear like mask. He also carried a pass which mentioned that he is part of discharging essential services.“Valve men play a vital role in the water supply system. Their day starts at 4am and continues till midnight as they operate around 182 valves across the city for smooth water supply to every household,” said an OCW spokesperson.Likewise, Badal, a tanker driver from Wanjari Nagar ESR, said, “We feel proud as we supply water to slums wherein there are no taps. We have been provided masks and other safety gears. We visit people’s home during lockdown to supply water so that they stay indoors,” he said as NMC-OCW provides water in many non-network areas through tankers.The NMC-OCW pressed 293 tankers and all the drivers into service and similar number of helpers too have been provided with masks to stay safe while providing water through tankers.Similar precautions are also being taken by 150-odd plant operators deployed at five water treatment plants – Gorewada (Pench-I, II, III), Kanhan WTP and Godhni WTP with safety masks etc.Even NMC-OCW zonal teams deployed for maintenance and leakage repairing works are working or remainign alert in resolving no-water or polluted water complaints of consumers.OCW CEO Sanjoy Roy said, “We stayed at work to provide clean and safe drinking water at your taps.

118,['27/03/2020'],Panic buying subsides but supply bottlenecks remain,"Nagpur: Covid-19 outbreak has made even bulk traders at the agriculture produce marketing committee’s (APMC) yard at Kalamna, from where the city gets it supply of grains, vegetables and fruits, apprehensive. They fear that the market yard, where people from different parts of the country congregate, makes them more susceptible to infection making many to join the lockdown.

Despite an assurance by the APMC secretary, traders in vegetables have downed their shutters till Monday. From Tuesday onwards, the business will continue only from 4am to 11am. The fruit traders at Kalamna have already declared a closure throughout the lockdown period and will be sticking to it, they say.

The impact could be seen down the line at the fruit and vegetable stalls across the city. The traders whom TOI came across said their stock of vegetables would not last beyond a day or two. There were carts laden with fruit, but the vendors said they were not getting any fresh supplies. Meanwhile e-tailers have also stopped supplies. Big Basket has sent a mail to its customers it may take a day or two to start supplies in Nagpur as the chain has been affected due to curfew and heavy demand.

“Kalamna market can turn out to be the most dangerous place. We have people coming from different parts of the country. anybody can be a carrier of the virus, This is why traders have preferred to keep away from the markets,” said Rajesh Chabrani, former director of APMC. Chabrani, a fruit trader, said his guild had decided to shut down also due to lack of demand due to the lockdown. He said there may be assurances that shops will remain open but traders under his association had decided to keep shut.

Even as grain traders are continuing their business, sources said there was a dearth of labourers for whom traders have approached the police to issue curfew passes.

The resident deputy collector Ravindra Khazanchi told TOI supply of essential items in the city was normal on March 26. He said the collector had asked police not to stop workers engaged in unloading food items from going to work. Police said that 3,459 curfew passes were issued on March 24 and 4,157 on March 25 for persons engaged in providing essential services.

At grocery shops, some item or other were running out. The traders said there was a major shortage of branded food items. The stocks at our godowns in the city are fast getting depleted and there was no fresh supply, said representative of a multinational company.

The promoter of a major food processing industry based at Nagpur said, requesting anonymity, that even as milk and bread production was continuing, the company’s unit making packaged snacks had closed.

At Purushottam Stores near Ram Nagar Square, the shopkeeper said he had run out of wheat flour and sugar. The wholesalers may be having the stock but it cannot reach the retailers either due to transport being blocked or labourers not turning up due to the curfew.

Atul Denge of Durga General Stores, a kiosk at Bharat Nagar, said he was not getting fresh stock of bread and butter. Another storekeeper at Dharampeth said the supplies had only resumed on Tuesday.

Prabhakar Deshmukh, president of Nagpur Chillar Kirana Vyapari Sangh , said the panic demand had receded on Tuesday but the labourers were still not able to make it to the market. Even transportation of fresh supplies had been held up due to the curfew.

Manoj Rathore, a wheat trader from Sehore in Madhya Pradesh, said Maharashtra was a major market for traders in the state. However, consignments that started for Maharashtra had been held up midway.

Sources said this had led to shortage of wheat flour. The wheat from MP also goes to the flour mills here. Pawan Poddar, who has a flour mill in the city, said even if supplies from outside were not available there was enough grain in FCI godowns here to meet any exigency. The millers were ready to provide any service to the society.

Pratap Motwani, secretary of The Itwari Grain and Seeds Merchants Association, said they had taken up the matter with authorities and passes would be issued to workers engaged grain and other markets too. Motwani said he had written to the police commissioner that truckers should be given curfew passes on WhatsApp so that transportation was not held up.

Rajesh Jejani and other wholesale traders in sugar said there was enough supply of sugar in the market and retailers need not worry. This could be judged from the fact that rates had remained stable.

Sources in Big Bazaar said even as the chain had started door-to-door delivery throughout the country, mobility of staff has been affected with even logistics of perishable items sourced locally hit in parts of the country.

45 grocers to home deliver provisions

Forty-five grocery shop owners have agreed to home delivery of provisions to customers in the city to reduce crowding at their shops. This was decided in a meeting between municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe and shopkeepers.

A list of these shops along with their addresses and mobile number of owners is being circulated by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on WhatsApp. Mundhe has appealed to the citizens to take advantage of the facility and avoid going to grocery stores.

The announcement by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to increase quantity of cereals at ration shops led to long queues at the shops near slums. Ambazari police dispersed people in Pandhrabodi. District civil supplies officer Chetan Tayade said written orders in this regard were yet to reach him.

CALANGUTE: Plans by the Parra panchayat to have essential grocery items delivered to citizens have failed to take off as grocery shops that were to supply items have no stocks. To cope with the unprecedented crisis, many have started bartering with their neighbours and friends, parting with any excess items in exchange for immediate requirements that they don’t have at all.

Panchayat members said they’re making arrangements for home delivery of essential items by roping in grocery shop owners and providing their phone numbers to citizens. Citizens have to phone their order in and the items will be delivered by volunteers without people having to come out.

“The problem is that the grocery shops themselves don’t have any stocks. I’ve spoken to all the grocery shop owners in Parra and nobody has any stocks. The government needs to allow supply vehicles to enter Goa and distribute essential items to the distributors,” Parra sarpanch Delilah Lobo told TOI.

The police have also launched several security measures including asking all apartment complexes to maintain a register at the gate, in which the details of an inmate leaving the complex will have to enter his name, details of the vehicle and purpose, that will be checked by the beat police periodically.

If anyone is found moving around and his/her details are not found in the register, police have warned that not only the person, but also the office bearers of the apartment association will be booked.

This will be applicable to such workers in the private sector as well. He said that those working in such sectors are part of essential services.

All policemen, engaged in vehicle checking, should mandatorily wear masks and gloves. The responsibility of ensuring that all personnel are obeying instructions will be on respective district police chiefs, he added.

Behera also instructed that not every vehicle should be checked for documents leading to a long chain of vehicles waiting on the road. Instead of concentrating on one or two junctions, police should split and concentrate on several places, he said.

NEW DELHI: With the daily distribution of wheat, rice and sugar at fair price shops likely to begin from March 30, the food and civil supplies department on Thursday asked ration dealers to make adequate arrangements to avoid crowding.

Following a review meeting, food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain said the distribution should be carried out smoothly without any inconvenience to the beneficiaries. He also asked 2,000-odd fair price shops across the city to stay open seven days a week in public interest.

In the wake of the novel coronavirus spread, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal last week enhanced the monthly quota of ration by one and a half times and made it free for about 72 lakh beneficiaries — 18 lakh families — for April.

Issuing a slew of directives, Hussain told the dealers to observe necessary precautions to ensure their own safety as well as that of the beneficiaries while distributing ration items. “They should ensure that beneficiaries don’t make rush at shops. The beneficiaries should be informed in advance that sufficient stocks are available and they should come later in case of crowding,” the minister said.

In case of queues, beneficiaries will have to maintain one-meter distance and they must also be encouraged to use masks and hand sanitisers. One civil defence volunteer will be deployed at each shop to assist the dealer while senior officers will ensure proper distribution.

Expecting a huge rush, the ration dealers early this week asked the government to make arrangements to ensure social distancing at their shops. In a letter, they requested the food and civil supplies department to devise a mechanism so that the beneficiaries do not have to sign the register.

The minister also asked legal metrology department officials to ensure availability of masks and hand sanitisers in market and take strict action against those overcharging or hoarding these items.

To their shock, massive police force was found at the bridge. Police had blocked the entry of vehicles from Telangana three days ago.

A similar situation was seen at Putlur toll plaza where students from both the states were stranded. While students of Telangana undergoing coaching for bank examinations in Nandyal of Kurnool district wanted to reach their native places after the hostels were closed, the students and techies from Hyderabad wanted to reach home in Rayalaseema districts. A good number of women devotees returning from Srikalahasthi in Chittoor district to Hyderabad were also stuck up at the toll plaza as the police refused to go ahead.

In the initial stage, cooked meals will be given to the poor families free of cost at noon. The local body authorities also plan to extend the services and deliver food to all those who demand.

The plan is to start the kitchens at Mattancherry town hall, Palluruthy town hall, Ernakulam town hall, Vyttila and Edappally from Friday. “We plan to procure rice from Supplyco, groceries from Consumerfed and vegetables from Horticorp. We have held discussions with the officials with these agencies. We expect that Supplyco may give rice free of cost, and vegetables and grocery may get at bulk purchase rates,” mayor Soumini Jain said. “We have given Rs 10,000 each to health inspectors as mobilisation funds. So, they can procure rice and other items required immediately without waiting for the arrangement which we plan in association with Supplyco, Consumerfed and Horticorp. Noon meals will be provided to poor and needy in each area. Division councillors and health inspectors should decide the beneficiaries,” the mayor said. “Initially, the food supply will be limited to destitute, elderly and those who live an isolated life in their homes,” she said.

The corporation will make arrangements for delivering the meals to the beneficiaries. Besides the councillors’ service, NGOs also would be roped in for delivering the food.

148,['27/03/2020'],"Make that social call digitally, say experts","Kochi: Social distancing can cause distress to most people who are happy being in touch with fellow-beings. With ‘stay at home’ or ‘work from home’ being enforced, psychiatrists say that people will have a tough time dealing with staying indoors and no socializing .

When TOI spoke to psychiatrists on how people can deal with this, the common advice was to stay in digital communication with people. “This distancing can cause distress to socially-inclined people. When enforced as a public health measure, one needs to accept it. Like in a crisis, there is a need to develop resilience to this loss of face-to-face contact with people in social and job situations,” said Dr C J John, a renowned psychiatrist.

He said that there are two sections of people staying at home — one is with family and other without family. “When you are working from home and the family is with you, the family needs to give you a private space for work and also distract them during their free-time. In a way, one should say that they are better off and more blessed,” he added.

One of the most disturbing aspects is the situation of people who are alone at home because the offices have requested them to be on standby. “Living amidst an information overload alone can be a problem. Processing information is also important. Better rely on official sources only. The option for digital connectivity can be effectively used here too. It’s important to share feelings with someone when there is a perception that things are going out of control. Social distancing should never be transformed to loneliness,” Dr John said.

The cornerstone for psychological health is physical health, said Dr U Vivek, a city-based psychiatrist. “Don’t neglect physical activity. Exercise for half an hour. It is a must and can be done indoors along with a nutritious and balanced diet. Make sure you get an undisturbed sleep of 6-8 hours. This is a prerequisite for psychological well-being.”

This is the time to teach and make your young ones understand that discipline matters. “When the government, as an authority, tells you to stay inside for keeping the rest of the society safe, you have to respect that. And when you do it properly, you are passing on a very important lesson to the younger ones in your home,” said Thrissur-based psychiatrist Dr Shailaja Ramkumar.

She said that this is the best time to make those communications in the family. “If you have elderly, let the children spend time with them. Couples can sit and spend time talking or doing all the pending work which has been postponed due to busy schedules.

AMARAVATI: The state cabinet chaired by chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy will meet at the secretariat on Friday. The cabinet will give its nod for the ordinance to clear the budget for first quarter of the next fiscal. Jagan has decided to go for the ordinance route to clear the budget in the wake of the health emergency following the outbreak of Covid-19.

Initially, the CM wanted to conduct the assembly session and clear the vote-on-account for the first quarter of the fiscal. The situation changed after Prime Minister declared a nation-wide lockdown till April 14. Secretariat Employees’ Association president K Venkatramireddy also urged the CM to suspend the assembly session and opt for the ordinance route to clear the budget. He cited a previous instance when the government secured permission for the budget through ordinance.

Subsequently, the CM held discussions with the ministers, senior officials and advocate general S Sriram. Taking their views into consideration, the CM decided to bring an ordinance to clear the budget till June 30.

Sources said that senior officials have advised that cabinet too could be deferred by taking the signatures of available ministers on the file as there was no sufficient space in the cabinet meeting hall to maintain the social distancing.

However, the CM decided to convene the cabinet meeting and directed the officials to shift the venue of the meeting to the spacious conference hall in the first floor of the block-I in the secretariat instead of regular cabinet meeting hall.

Sources said that the finance department had almost drafted the annual budget thinking that the budget session would commence in the last week of March. As per sources, the finance department had reportedly put the budget outlay at Rs 1.95 lakh crore. The government approved the previous budget with Rs 2.27 lakh crore.

Apart from clearing the budget, the cabinet would also review the measures being taken to combat Covid-19 in the state.

LUCKNOW: Hundreds of people, whose kin were undergoing treatment in the King George ’s Medical University (KGMU) and now have been discharged, are facing a tough time these days. Because of the lockdown they are not able to return to their homes in other districts and are forced to stay under sheds or 'rain baseras' outside KGMU wards.

They are not only facing problems in getting essential supplies, but are also living under constant fear of catching infections.

Because of the curb on inter-city movement, most of the people are unable to return to their homes in other cities. Private ambulances or taxi drivers are available to drop them to their destinations, but they are demanding hefty amounts. Usually people of weak financial background visit KGMU for treatment from different cities. In most of suh cases only an attendant stays with the patient during the treatment, while rest of the family takes refuge in open space outside wards or 'rain baseras'. For food and other essential items they are fully dependent on vendors outside the KGMU campus.

However, after the lockdown most of the nearby eateries are closed and these people are finding it difficult to get raw material for cooking food. A reality check by TOI found scores of people outside the Trauma Centre, Gandhi ward and Shatabdi Hospital, following no social distancing norm.

Nibhi Devi (24), who had severe infection in her legs due to the diabetic foot, had come to KGMU trauma centre on March 18 after being referred by doctors at her native place in Gopalganj , Bihar. She was operated upon recenlty and was discharged on Sunday.

But as no public transport was available due to restrictions, she along with her husband was forced to take shelter under a shed outside Trauma Centre.

KGMU chief medical superintendent Prof SN Sankhwar said that he is aware of the problem and will inform district administration about it.

CHANDRAPUR: A person working at Ahmednagar had to walk for over 135 kilometres from Nagpur to reach his home in Saoli teshil of Chandrapur district following the travel ban due to coronavirus scare. He was rescued by Sindewahi police some 25km from his village.

Narendra Shelke is resident of village Jambh in Saoli teshil and works as a labourer at a sugar factory in Ahmednagar. The 7-day lockdown announced by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray from Tuesday caught all the labourers off guard. Being desperate, the labourers from Nagpur along with Shelke took a private vehicle immediately and started for Nagpur on Tuesday morning. However, by that time PM Modi had announced national lockdown. As their taxi reached Nagpur on Tuesday night, entire nation went into complete lockdown.

PSI Gopichand Nerkar, who rescued Shelke in Sindewahi, informed that labourers from Nagpur went to their home and taxi returned to Ahmednagar. Shelke was left stranded in Nagpur. Having failed to find any help and nobody to give him a lift, Shelke decided to walk back home during wee hours of Wednesday.

He took Nagpur-Nagbhid road and started walking towards his destination. He was intercepted by police in Umred. The cops helped him get lift in a truck but it took him for just a few kms and again he was dropped, PSI Nerkar quoting Shelke informed.

Shelke again began to walk on foot towards his destination and reached Sindewahi tehsil headquarter still 25km away from his village by late in the night. He had travelled over 135km on foot by the time cops stopped him at Shivaji Chowk in Sindewahi. As an exhausted Shelke narrated his woe, police took him to local rural hospital and brought him some food from their home, said PSO, Sindewahi Nishikant Ramteke.

He stated Shelke survived on just water for two days after starting from Ahmednagar. As soon as he recovered his strength, police took help of local NGO and arranged his transport to village Jambh in Saoli teshil, Ramteke said.

Sindewahi police informed the local authorities in Saoli about Shelke’s arrival and he was put into home quarantine immediately after arrival at his village, Ramteke said. Shelke himself could not be contacted.

I gave my samples and was sent home to self-quarantine. But unfortunately, after a day, I was tested positive for Covid-19 and was moved to the isolation facility on March 22.The first few days were tiresome since I was put on strong medications. Once I started regaining my strength I tried to get to know about the ‘angels’ who were taking care of me. They were always around, wrapped in body suits, day and night, to ensure that we are well taken care of. And people outside have no idea about the things they go through. Everyone has been busy complaining about how hard it was to spend 21 days at home, but they are not aware about the fact that many of these healthcare workers have not been able be with their family as well.When Covid-19 struck the UK, my parents tried their best to get me back home. Authorities were imposing travel restrictions and I knew I had to reach India before March 18. I managed to book a flight to Chennai via Dubai on March 16. I had developed a sore throat by then. From Dubai airport I booked a flight to Kochi but by the time I reached Chennai, I had only half an hour left to catch the Kochi flight. The long line for immigration clearance made things even more horrible. I got clearance but unfortunately by the time I reached the gate, my flight had taken off. I was panicking, and my health had deteriorated completely.But I was determined not to lose hope and booked a morning flight to Kochi. I was forced to spend 10 hours at the airport. There was panic in the eyes of everyone I saw there. And I had to make sure that I did not fall asleep in the airport or be near others as I was worried about getting infected with coronavirus. My body had given up on me, my head was pounding and I experienced a burning sensation in my head. Those 10 hours felt like 10 days. I somehow managed to kill time and it was time for me to board the next flight. Landing in Kochi made my heart pound for some reason and my eyes welled up. Finally, I was home.While they were screening me for coronavirus at the airport, I made sure that I informed the authorities about my complete travel history and provided them with all my flight details. I was asked to self-quarantine for 14 days.

In 2019, the first quarter sales stood at 5,400 units, show data compiled by Anarock Property Consultants. Among other factors, experts attributed this slowdown to the Covid-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown , which, they said, has led to a drop in site visits, impacted the sentiment of buyers and pushed them into a “cash conservation mode”.“Given the ongoing global healthcare calamity, housing sales and new project launches across India’s top seven cities decreased both on yearly and quarterly basis. As expected, monthly data trends reveal that March –when most advisories and lockdown were imposed - saw a decline in both new launches and housing sales against the preceding two months,” said Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock, adding, “The government has taken an inarguably necessary hard-line stance to curtail the spread of the virus. The lockdowns have stalled construction activity and will lead to project delays in the future.””As per the report, new launches in Hyderabad dipped by 11% during the first three months of 2020. The city saw 3,380 (approx.) launches during this period. “While Ugadi is a usually the time for new project launches, this year many builders refrained from it. But, I still think it is too soon to gauge the impact of Covid-19 on the realty sector. It has only been a week since work has stopped,” said R Suresh Kumar, senior vice president (business operations), Prestige Group. He added, “There were other factors, including logistical issues, that led to a slowdown of the sector.

On the roads leading to the city, truckers who came with loaded vehicles are not able to take them further to their destinations. Those who have unloaded their cargohere, are also stuck.

For nearly a week, the trucks have become home to their drivers and helpers who are managing with the rations they carried. As cash is running out, even ATMSsin the outer areas are dry, said the drivers along the Nagpur Amravati highway. The dhabas have also closed.

“One of our vehicles was supposed to reach a consignment of medicines to Lupin’s warehouse at Kalmeshwar but now the truck cannot move further. There are some empty trucks of our company too which cannot return,” said Balkrishna Pandey, who was resting with other drivers in one of the vehicles.

“Food has not been a problem so far as we carry rations along. To start fires, we use diesel from vehicles. We are buying supplies from shops in nearby areas but are running short of cash. We hope to get some help from the company’s office soon,” said Pandey who hopes the lockdown would not go beyond 21 days. “Even the police are offering help, but we have been able to manage so far,” he said.

Pandey and other drivers had come from Mumbai and are working for a Gujarat based transport company.

Manikchand Tiwari, a native of Allahabad, said he could not find cash in ATMs close by and has run out of money. “There is no money left and I cannot find cash in ATMs too. The wait seems endless,” he said.

Nanhe Soni, a worker who applies grease in the trucks, is jobless these days but says he can manage. “I am on fast due to Navratri,” he says. A little ahead Afsar and Salman said they were helped by locals yesterday.

Kukku Marwah, president of Nagpur Truckers Unity, said, “there is a longer queue at the Pardi Naka. Members of our association had gone there to distribute food but the police stopped us a kilometre away and allowed only one driver at a time driver to pick up the meals from a distance. We have not reached out to them again.”

Meanwhile, Pandey and others are happy they can recharge their mobile phones at nearby shops and talk to their family members. “We have charging equipment with us too,” he said.

Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe along with the collector Ravindra Thakare were directed by the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Monday, to verify the claims made in a media report which was submitted by petitioner’s counsel Ram Heda while hearing a PIL (No10/2020) by businessman Subhash Zanwar on Monday.

The petitioner had prayed for a slew of directives, including activation of the disaster recovery task force for every district to respond to the threats emerging due to deadly virus.

Highly reliable sources from the corporation told TOI that the woman was taken in the NMC vehicle to the GMCH after being referred by her family doctor. But, the GMCH authorities didn’t entertain her after she denied any contact with any foreign nationals or having visited abroad ever.

Raising concern over a media report, Heda had pointed out that the woman from Hindustan Colony, who was suffering from cough, cold and was running high fever, had visited the GMCH for coronavirus testing, on advice of her family doctor.

“At this stage, we can’t make any comment about the genuineness of the report. But, we can certainly say that this report raises a serious concern over the safety of all those persons who have happened to come in contact with any of such patients since last few days and who were likely to come in their contact in days to come,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote said.

The bench added that it would be therefore, necessary for the collector and commissioner to get this report verified for its correctness. “If it’s found upon verification that the report is correct, the authorities would have to take necessary steps in the matter. Needless to say, verification report shall be placed before this court,” the judges said, before adjourning the hearing till April 7.

They asked the petitioner’s counsel to hand over the media report copy to additional government pleader Deepak Thakare and NMC counsel Sudhir Puranik.

Earlier, the court expressed satisfaction over steps taken by the civic body and district administration for containing spread of the deadly disease and effectively treating the confirmed patients. “However, some concerns still remain there. We’re of the view that they need to be addressed effectively and as quickly as possible,” the judges said.

The difficulties in travelling forced many workers engaged in waste collection to stay indoors, thereby affecting door-to-door collection of garbage in the city.According to the officials with the corporation, they have given instructions to their workers to turn up and ensure smooth collection of garbage. Most of the workers come from distant places such as Aroor, Kuthiyathodu and Vaikom. “We have made arrangements for picking the workers living within corporation limits. We can’t conduct trips to distance places for picking the labourers as we will have to spend an entire day for the purpose,” said Anu R, secretary, corporation. “Residents also will have to adjust with the situation for the time being,” she said.Though the residents call up the councillors in each area, they also are unable to do anything to solve the problem. “In our area, collection of waste has been affected for the past two-three days. Contingency workers and other workers who are engaged in waste collection don’t turn up,” said Vijayakumar, councillor from Devankulangara division. Councillors are exploring options to bring the labourers from distance places so that the waste collection can be removed. “In our division, plastic waste is being collected every Wednesday. But, today few workers reached and so, there were problems in collecting the waste. I called up many of the workers and promised them help in their transport. Some of them have agreed to come from Friday after we reminded them of the gravity of the situation,” he said. “Some of them are not coming as they are afraid of police checking while another group doesn’t have motorcycles.

Officials with health department in the district raised concerns regarding the chances of communicable diseases spreading in the city. “We are already in the middle of a crisis following Covid-19 spread.

But when the lockdown came, it was clear that Danish and his family will not be able to come with ‘baraat’ to Patna.

With the consent of elders and clerics, the marriage was solemnised. A big reception ceremony would be held after the things would get better,” said a close relative of Sadiya.Their wedding ritual video went viral on social media on March 24 in which the bride and groom in their wedding fineries were seen sitting in front of the screen.

The same care would also be extended to those people from outside who are trapped in Bihar.

“The government will make arrangements to provide food and stay facility to persons from Bihar who are trapped at Patna or in any other town in the state as well as in other states due to the lockdown,” the CM said. “Nobody will be allowed to become a problem,” he said.

The decision was taken at a high-level meeting attended by deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, water resources department minister Sanjay Kumar Jha, chief secretary Deepak Kumar, DGP Gupteshwar Pandey and disaster management department (DMD) principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit.

This is the second bunch of the ameliorative steps that the CM has announced in the last couple of days. The sum was released to the disaster relief fund (DRF) under the state’s DMD with a direction to all the 38 districts to create their own DRF with the fund provided to the department.

The fund is meant to take care of the rickshaw-pullers, daily wage and construction workers who have been rendered jobless due to the lockdown. “The government is making the food and stay arrangements at its own level,” the CM said, adding that “social distancing” norms would be followed in all these activities.

The state’s resident commissioner at Delhi would coordinate with those states and the district administrations concerned to track the Biharis trapped and provide them food and stay facility. The governments of other states would also make suitable arrangements to address problems facing people from Bihar who are trapped there, the CM also said.

167,['27/03/2020'],Social distancing move in Vadodara ignored,"There was a sudden rush at the market in Padra taluka as it was closed for 4 days

VADODARA: Vadodara civic body’s aim to create social distancing backfired with a bang on Thursday when the Polo Ground witnessed a massive rush of citizens jostling one another to get fresh veggies at Khanderao market prices.

The historic Khanderao Market – city’s largest vegetable market – located in Vadodara Municipal Corporation’s backyard - has traditionally been Barodians’ favourite place for farm-fresh greens at affordable prices. But looking at the lockdown, VMC decided to shift the vendors here to the Polo Ground on Thursday as Khanderao market is too congested.

But the decision proved costly as it defeated the entire purpose of lockdown with hundreds swarming at the sprawling ground near Kirti Stambh to buy veggies after word spread like wildfire across the city.

After vendors reached the Khanderao market premises at about 4.30am on Thursday, they were asked to shift their stalls to Polo Ground. “We were baffled as the authorities didn’t inform us in advance of the plan. A few policemen told us that we need to shift to the Polo Ground and so we did accordingly. But what ensued was total chaos,” said Jitu Kachhiya, who has been selling veggies in Khanderao for the past 45 years. Kachhiya questioned the justification of bunching all the vendors together at one place. “When the government is advising social distancing,I don’t understand why all of us had to be shifted to a single spot. What was seen at Polo Ground was exactly opposite of what we are being told to do,” Kachhiya alleged.

Another vegetable vendor, Priyank Kachhiya alleged that while Khanderao has a good parking space and many gates to enter, Polo Ground had only a single gate leading to overcrowding at one spot. \

Many vegetable vendors also claimed that the cops were intercepting them at different points in the city and questioning them.

PANAJI: Chicalim-resident Hombal Yadavendra, who works as manager for a private firm, has been travelling regularly to Mumbai for a company project since October 2019. Earlier this month too, he left as usual to Mumbai, promising his wife and young child that he would return on March 23.

But while he was still in Mumbai, first the nation-wide Janata Curfew was announced, he then saw all local bus and train transportation stop and later the 21-day lockdown was announced.

“I was preparing to leave the day after the Janata Curfew, which was a Monday. My wife and young child are by themselves in Chicalim. Thanks to the kindness of neighbours they are surviving. But in this time of difficulty where the entire neighborhood is suffering, for how long will people be able to help,” said the 41-year-old.

Hombal is now worried that if the lockdown period is extended, his wife and child may be staring at worse conditions. “I am more worried how they will manage in the current situation in Goa. In Mumbai, there are proper systems in place and all essentials can be purchased from 9am to 11am. But it is in Goa that my family is suffering,” he said.

Margao-resident Dattaraj Lotliker, 30, has been working as a marketing executive for some time now in Rajkot, Gujarat. “I had a window of opportunity to leave for home. But, from Rajkot, there are no direct flights to Goa. It is a 4-5 hour bus journey to Ahmedabad, to be able to take a flight. If I had gone ahead with the journey, I would have put the lives of a lot of people at risk back home. I did not want to do that,” said Lotliker, who now only has his guitar and a few kind neighbours for company.

“On the day of the Janata Curfew, I made a wholesome meal for myself and overate not realising that a longer lockdown will be declared. I don't even have a kitchen here, only an induction cooker. There is a supermarket open nearby where only the essentials are available. But since I don't have a fridge, I have to plan carefully what I eat. I have to consume whatever I cook quickly,” said Lotliker.

A 70-plus neighbour, whom he calls Dadi, and an 80-year-old bachelor are providing him solace during this tough time, said the marketing executive.

“I am surviving thanks to their kindness. They allow me to store things in their fridge and share food with me. Otherwise, I am only reduced to spending my days cooking meals and washing the utensils. I am someone who goes crazy about a workout but I cannot exercise either now. Because there is no nutritional food to eat after the workout,” said Lotliker.

The Covid-19 fear has griped not just the common man but government officials as well who have to continue reporting for duty.

They are apprehensive about leaving their families at home during the 21-day complete lockdown. Speaking to TOI, at least two officers with government jobs expressed fear and concern that when their families are unable to move outdoors, their presence at home was the need of the hour.

One of them said he has small children at home who need many things which he is unable to provide. “It’s easier when you are in a city, but for people in rural areas it’s difficult to get access to provisions,” he said.

The other officer has turned to religion for solace at a time like this. He was envious of those who get to work from home, unlike him. “We do not have holidays and our families long for our presence. I am aware that my subordinates too feel this way,” he said.

170,['27/03/2020'],"Over 1,000 in home quarantine, stamp ink coming off next day","Nagpur: Even as several reports came in of home quarantined persons not adhering to guidelines, the stamps on the hands of these persons have been coming off the next day itself.

The district administration has so far stamped over 1,000 flyers, who have been either sent home with the compulsory advice of self-isolation, or held back at MLA Hostel. To ensure the flyers are not venturing out of their homes, health officials had stamped their hands, with what was supposed to be indelible ink, and stay on for the 14-day isolation period.

Sub-divisional officer Shekhar Ghadge claimed that inedible ink — used during voting in elections — had been used in the stamps. When told the ink came off, he said he will have to cross check with doctors who have been stamping passengers for any such complaints.

District collector Ravindra Thakare didn’t answer TOI’s calls and messages.

One of the flyers, who landed at Nagpur last week, said he was stamped in Mumbai. “I have to stay in self isolation till April 4. But after I took a bath, the stamp came off. Now, there is no way anyone can realize that I have been advised home quarantine, though I wouldn’t be going out till that period ends,” the flyer said.

During this period, several complaints have come in of home quarantined people found out of their homes. A woman had also fled to UP while she had to stay in her Nagpur home.

The home quarantine stamp has proved effective in recent days as people have been easily able to identify those having travel history to affected nations.

TOI had reported how a Germany returned woman was identified and her neighbour called up the police to make her comply with the norms. Another woman has been booked by Sonegaon police for flouting home quarantine guidelines. The penal action invites imprisonment for several months.

Meanwhile, a couple of home quarantined flyers continue to risk the health of others.

A medical college employee told TOI that a woman who had travelled to Mumbai and had a stamp on her hand had directly entered the private hospital premises in Hingna area. “Now, the college gates have been locked and entry restricted. But the woman was not ready to listen when she was reminded about the stamp,” the employee said.

Currently, 138 have been quarantined at MLA Hostel. Total 1,123 passengers have landed in Nagpur since March 6 from different countries. Of these, 855 were allowed to go home but stay in self isolation. On Thursday, 47 of them completed the 14-day period.

KANPUR: The district administration has taken a number of steps for smooth door-to-door delivery programme during the lockdown period which will conclude on April 14.

In a meeting on Wednesday evening, nodal officers were appointed to ensure the supply of various essential commodities.

The nodal officers will not only receive requests for items and ensure their supply, but also record reports of black marketing and will take action accordingly.

In another step, DM Dr Brahma Deo Ram Tiwari activated the command and control room located in Kanpur Municipal Corporation building.

The commonad & control room will work round the clock and ensure disposal of complaints on priority basis.

Nodal officers and assistant staff have been appointed and trained there.

Additional DM Virendra Pandey will be nodal officer of the control room and additional municipal commissioner will be his deputy.

The control room has a capacity of 20 lines, and therefore, it will only receive 20 calls at a time.

The administration has so far arranged as many as 450 e-rickshaws and pick-ups, and 1350 carts for door-to-door delivery.

The supply will also be done on foot and through provision stores.

The district administration has invited requests from provision stores interested in door-to-door delivery.

Vyapar Mandals have also been asked to make a list of traders willing to join hands in this crucial period.

A list of shopkeepers will be prepared area-wise and passed on to the concerned police station in charge, who will then ensure the supply of commodities.

The administration has also collaborated with adjacent district authorities to maintain proper supply line between districts.

For home delivery, the listed provision stores will distribute their contact numbers in their respective areas so that consumers can book required items.

The district authorities conceded that it would be a difficult task to deliver goods to the homes of 50 lakh citizens, and the execution of it will take some time.

Dr Ram also stressed that the pay of healthcare workers must be protected during a crisis like this, when they are at the forefront of the war against the novel coronavirus. “Every hospital has a nodal officer and it should be his/her duty to empower healthcare professionals in the hospital. This exercise will enable these personnel to be better prepared when the time comes for them to perform,” he said.

LUCKNOW: Wholesale markets of medicines in Aminabad and Chowk have been shut for five days due to shortage of workers and inadequate supply from manufacturers. As a result, retail chemist shops in the city are running out of stock.

Wholesalers said that while some employees are not coming out of fear, others are finding difficult to move out due to curbs. “Passes issued by the district administration for some of their employees will help in restarting the operation, but the larger issue is supply of medicines from manufacturers based in other states as well as from other parts of UP,” they said and added that authorities concerned have assured them of solving the problem at the earliest. TOI reality check found that retailers at many places have closed down their shops after their stock dried up. Some big retailers have a backup of 10-15 days but the high demand due to stockpiling by people is adding to the problem.

Ramesh Chandra, a distributor of medicines in Chowk, said that he has staff strength of 18 workers apart from daily wagers whom he deploys to pick up and drop consignments. But only four of them are coming to office. Similarly, Mohammed Nasir, wholesaler of surgical goods in medicine market in Aminabad, said, “Neither we are getting supply from outside nor our local brands are able to meet the rising demand.”

He said that he had placed an order to a company located in Transport Nagar on March 21, but the order is yet to be executed.

Most of the wholesalers said that they have informed senior district officers about the crisis and they have assured help at the earliest.

182,['27/03/2020'],Fireworks industry workers seek urgent aid,"Madurai: Employees working in cracker units reeling under the lockdown have urged the government to provide monetary assistance to them till the units resumed functioning.

The cracker industry at Sivakasi in Virudhunagar district employs nearly eight lakh workers directly and indirectly. R Pandi, a resident of O Sankaralingapuram village, said an employee would earn an average of Rs 350 to 400 per day by working in a cracker unit and the salary is disbursed every weekend.

“Since all units are closed, the employees would have received the salary for working during the last week with which they would be able to manage their family expenses for nearly 10 days. As the units would be closed for the next 21 days, we will start facing difficulties after 10 days,” noted Pandi.

He said when the employees are in need of money, they used to request for advance salary, but they are not sure they would get it now. Another employee, K Sundaram from Maraneri, said the rise in prices of essential commodities will affect them severely. To make matters worse, they are all forced to stock up essential commodities. Hence the government should provide them monetary assistance, he said.

186,['27/03/2020'],"No jobs, no money... please, bring us home: Students stuck in Australia","Nagpur: The Indian students in various universities in Australia are stranded, facing not just fear of corona infection but also struggling for basics after losing their part-time jobs. Stuck due to corona lockdown, students are running short of money and demanding to be brought back to India.

On Thursday, TOI spoke to two such students pursuing masters in Project Management from Melbourne. Living in a rented apartment, the students first came to Melbourne early this year for further education.

It was around Holi (March 10) that the deadly coronavirus started spreading in Australia. “We booked the ticket back to India when we realized this situation is going to get serious as public places in Melbourne were shutting down. First universities, then cafes, restaurants, clubs and gyms, everything closed down,” said 23-year-old Sharad Rao.

Originally from Nagpur, Sharad and his friend Hiranya Bhagwat had booked an Air India flight to India for March 30. However, with the government banning all international flights, many students like them are desperate to return home.

While officials of Consulate General of India, Melbourne, did not reply to TOI’s queries, Rao and Bhagwat claimed there were around 1 lakh Indian students stranded across Australia.

With most of them not having jobs, they are struggling for basic needs. “I was working in the housekeeping department of a local hotel. I went to work only for two weeks as after that, the hotel stopped getting check ins and I was asked not to come,” said Sharad.

He added that like him, many Indian students lost their part-time jobs following the outbreak of the virus. “A few days after I came here, our university converted this semester online due to corona virus. The next week,the government closed down all cafes. Part time jobs are not available here and it is getting very difficult to survive,” said Hiranya.

Sharad added that looking at dollar rates, it was getting harder to manage each day. “Our monthly expenses easily go up to Rs 50,000. As students, we are not able to sustain here,” he said.

With the number of positive corona cases rising to over 2,800 in Australia, the students are feeling unsafe. “The number of positive cases here are increasing day-by-day. We want to come back to India before a complete lockdown happens here,” said Hiranya.

The students have appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and union external affairs minister S Jaishankar to bring them back. “The Indian high commission in Australia informed us that they have been talking to the government regarding our wish to come back. We request the government to act urgently before the situation gets worse here. We are living in constant fear as well as financial crunch,” said Sharad, who is unsure if he would be boarding the March 30 flight to India.

When contacted, the Air India officials based in Melbourne told TOI, “We are following the instructions issued by the Indian government and there will be no flights till April 14. Resumption of flight will be only known as we come closer to the date.”

However, back home, families of the students are demanding immediate rescue operation of their kids. Sharad’s mother Padma Rao has appealed to the government to evacuate all the Indian students stuck in Australia . “I fear that even if our country opens incoming international flights after April 14, the Australian government might have already locked down by then. Our children are away from home and it would get very difficult for them to survive for so long. I request the government to please bring them back home,” she said.

194,['27/03/2020'],Social distancing new norm for shopkeepers,"White circles

Bhopal: With the country going into lockdown amid the fear of coronavirus, social distancing seems to have become the norm for shopkeepers in Bhopal.

Whether imposed by law enforcement officials or voluntarily followed, traders are making sure people to do not crowd at their stores on the second day of the nationwide lockdown.

In Katara Hills, for instance, shops on Thursday were opened as usual at around 8 in the morning. However, to avoid herding of people, shopkeepers are drawing their shutters down by afternoon. Those not wearing any protective mask — or even a simple handkerchief — are being told to get one or stay away from the shops. And of course, keeping a distance of at least one metre has become a necessity of sorts.

“We are making sure that not too many people rush to our stores because people seem to be panicking over availability of essentials. In such a situation, these white circle marked by the authorities are helping us,” said one shopkeeper in Katara Hills.

The white circles seem to be another common thing. On Thursday morning, police making rounds of their areas are making sure that these markings are drawn in front of every shop — to enforce a minimum of one metre distance between customers. Those not wearing masks are also asked to ensure they cover their faces.

In Bagmugaliya as well, grocery and medical stores followed the “one-metre rule” diligently. But, people were seen standing outside the designated circles marked by police.

However, for some shopkeepers social distancing seems to not be the only issue. In Bagmugaliya, police asked one vegetable vendor to move his shop at least 50 metres away from another hand cart right next to him.

“I understand that maintaining a safe distance is important at this time, but if we move our carts away from the usual spot people may not come. It is better that we shut shop for the day,” said the vendor, who did not wish to be named.

Jitendra Raghuvanshi, who owns a grocery shop in Katara Hills, said that availability of stocks is another issue. This, he said, is also the reason for many shops shutting down for the day early.

“You can see how people are buying most of their essentials in bulk. We are not sure how long this will last because none of our distributors have been able to deliver stuff over the last two days. The last time we got any stuff was before the janata curfew on March 22. I am not sure when we will get fresh delivery next. Once our stocks run out, we will have to shut down as well,” said Raghuvanshi, who kept his store open till 2pm.

Massive crowds are seen at most of these shops, which may adversely affect people’s health. Under such circumstances, it has been decided that these establishments be granted permission to carry out their businesses for 24 hours a day,’’ Thackeray said.At a meeting attended by chief secretary Ajoy Mehta and bureaucrats, Thackeray reviewed the state’s preparedness to fight the virus.The state government also appointed three senior IAS officers to ensure that essential supplies arrive uninterrupted. Principal secretary Anoop Kumar has been assigned to ensure smooth despatch of vegetables and fruit from APMCs.

LUCKNOW: The demand for power in the country has taken a sharp dip of 20% following a nationwide lockdown. In a letter sent to the PMO on Thursday, the All India Power Engineers’ Federation (AIPEF) said that demand had crashed following a complete shutdown of industrial and commercial units and railways and would affect state power utilities/distribution companies as their major source of income was blocked.

According to the federation, power demand nationally has plunged from 1,54,045 MW daily to 1,21,937 MW. Likewise, supply has crashed from 3,565 million units (MU) per day to 2,975 MU.

AIPEF chairman Shailendra Dubey said consumers, too, cannot make payments to discoms as door-to-door billing had been suspended and online payments were also hit.

“There will not be any fund flow left to meet the monthly salary of power sector employees in the coming days,” the federation said in a statement.

VADODARA: Around 18 railway staff members working in two trains were left to fend for themselves after passenger trains came to a halt on the midnight of March 22.

Soon after the announcement, a group, comprising coach attendants, housekeepers and air-conditioner mechanics in the Dehradun-Kochuveli Express and Sri Ganganagar-Kochuveli Express trains, got stuck in a yard near Vadodara railway station since the wee hours of Wednesday as these trains had already started journey from Kochuveli and had reached their destination stations. The trains, operated by Southern Railway , were returning with empty rakes to Kochuveli with these employees who did not even have any food or water stock with them.

Their miserable condition became public only after a video was shared by some relatives in Kerala. In the video, the staff members were heard speaking in Malayalam that they have not eaten food nor had drinking water for two days. They also mentioned that the toilets in the train too did not have water forcing them to live in unhygienic conditions. Diasporic Keralites living in city leant about it through their relatives in Kerala. Locals contacted railway officials and through intervention of divisional-level officers food and water could be provided to staff members.

“The trains were returning to Kochuveli and since these were point-to-point staff they were there in the train,” said western railway PRO Khemraj Meena. Point-to-point staff includes those employees who do not have fixed working hours. Their work starts when the train departs the origin station and continues till the train returns to the same station.

“As everything was closed down we contacted NGOs and ensured that the staff gets food,” he added. Members of Team MSU, Baroda Kerala Samajam and Samaj Seva Team and provided enough fruits, water bottles and snacks to the employees which can help them sustain during their entire journey. The two trains started their onward journeys later on Wednesday.

202,['27/03/2020'],Cameras &amp; AI are revolutionising the retail biz: Intel's Joe Jensen,"Joe Jensen is Intel ’s vice president of the IoT (internet of things) Group, with specific responsibility around retail, hospitality, education and banking. But retail is what we mostly discussed; that’s where his teams are combining cameras, computer vision, IoT and AI to create some fascinating solutions.

Take digital advertising boards in front of large stores. They can show a variety of offerings, but the one it shows as you pass by may be irrelevant to you. So now comes those technologies we mentioned. They can figure your gender, your approximate age, and if it is connected to the inventory system, it could show you something you might want to buy.

Suppose it was an unusually dry season and the store has two new raincoats in stock. Instead of waiting until it is forced to put the raincoats on a deep discount, the screen could show the raincoat with a small discount as someone passes by. “The system can tell not just my gender but also my size. I'm a pretty big guy, so if the raincoats aren’t extra-large, it will not show me the raincoat, it will show me something else it has in stock,” Jensen says.

In Australia, one of Intel’s grocery store partners was losing $5 million a month because people buying bulk products often put the wrong product code on the bag – the code for, say, peanuts, when they had bought macadamia nuts (often cheating, sometimes accidentally). Today, cameras detect the nuts and automatically label the bag.

Retailers are also using such systems to handle queues, estimating the walk-ins, and predicting when the queues are likely to get too long, so that staff can be proactively redeployed. Safeway in the US, Jensen says, used the system to reduce the number of staff in the store.

Kiosks at restaurants, which have become very popular, are being equipped with these tech to get people to buy more than what they otherwise would. In a fast-food place like McDonald ’s, if you order only a plain hamburger, the outlet may lose money. If you add cheese, fries and drinks, they make good money. So kiosks display some lovely looking dessert or drink while you order. If you are male, it could display an energy drink (almost all energy drinks are sold to men). “By adding cameras and analytics, you can actually optimise the experience customer by customer,” Jensen says.

Walmart, he says, has been spending about 5% of revenue on IT for almost five years, almost three times of what is considered best-in-class in retail, of 1.7%. “They are at a point where their base infrastructure is fully ready to bring in new innovations. They are rolling out robots, each with 14 cameras that can even read the labels of products. They go down the aisles to measure the shelf inventory real-time, find empty spots, wrongly placed products,” says Jensen.

AHMEDABAD: Ravindra Yadav, working in a wood furniture factory in Odhav, has embarked on a long journey to Barabanki in UP with merely Rs 12 in his pocket. ""We have heard that the government or NGOs will help us reach the border. It is our only hope as our sheth told us to leave for homes as there will be no work or salary. I know the trip home is going to be arduous, but I am a worker and do not want to beg for my food,” said Yadav.

Ever since Gujarat was locked down on Tuesday followed by pan India lockdown from Wednesday, thousands of migrant workers have embarked en masse on long journeys on foot to their homes.

With their plight hitting national headlines, police, NGOs and other stakeholders jumped to their rescue offering vehicles to drop them to nearest border posts and food packets. However, with three weeks of lockdown and uncertainty looming over their heads, most insisted they would rather go home to their families in such difficult times.

Ram Prasad Kori, 32, a furniture polisher hailing from Unnao was seen walking barefoot, handkerchief wrapped around his feet and broken slippers stuffed in his pockets. ""I don't have money to buy new slippers and no cobbler to mend the slippers. I have left for home with a prayer on my lips and resolve to go back to my family,” said Kori who has his wife and three children in village.

“What if they die or I die? I want to be with my loved ones and not survive on charity,” says Kori.

Sunil Gamit, a handicapped man on a wheelchair with his family, was also seen on the road with his family moving towards Dahod. “My sister works in a primary school but it has been shut and she was not given any salary. We want to escape to our village as the uncertainty in the city is very unsettling,” said Gamit.

Meanwhile, the queues of migrant labourers marching home became a cause of concern for the authorities who fear for their health and possibility of infection spreading to remote villages across India if carried from cities.

DCP, Zone -5, Ravi Teja said they are trying to convince the labourers to stay back because if only one labourer infected with coronavirus reached his or her village, local chains of infection will form in remote areas. DCP Zone-4, Neeraj Badgujjar said they are taking care of migrant labourers, but they are not ready to stay back at any cost. “They are so desperate they have started heading to their village on foot,” he said.

To contain any possible spread of infection, the Gautam Buddha Nagar administration sealed the entire building where she lived for two days besides putting her husband and daughter into isolation. On Wednesday, the woman’s husband tested positive to the infection whereas on Thursday, her daughter and two others were added to the list.The fact that the woman had no travel history had left health authorities in panic. However, the family had hosted two guests from London around Holi.“So far, all Covid cases in India have travel history, which is being cited as one of the important reasons for fewer cases and deaths in the country compared to the rest of the world. A positive case without travel history could mean that the pandemic virus has spread to the population, which can be an impending disastrous scenario as in the case of China or Italy,” explained a senior health officer.“The possibility is that visitors from London could have been asymptomatic carriers of the infection and left behind the virus which the family members contracted. However, this can be cleared only if the visitors from London test positive,” an official added.State surveillance officer Dr Vikasendu Agarwal said: “We have provided the contact details of the guests to health authorities in London.

After four days in the hospital, on Wednesday morning, they (doctors) told him to go home saying, he was fine,” he said.Surprisingly, the hospital didn’t think it prudent to send an ambulance to pick up the patient even after his status was known. “A relative of ours drove him to the hospital and he has been quarantined as well,” he said.Health minister Vishwajit Rane said that the information being circulated about the patient in question was not true and that GMC had not faulted. “I will check all the details and let you (TOI) know,” he said, when asked about the case.Six members of the patient’s household, including two children and a maid, have been quarantined in the sub district hospital, while his aged parents are home-quarantined.The relative said since the news became viral, a lot of rumours have been spread about his family. “I want to state that except one member of our family, nobody has tested positive for Covid -19,” he said.The patient’s relative also travelled to India from overseas on March 14, and he was also not asked to be in home quarantine immediately. “I got a call a day after my return, asking me not to go out,” he said. “They (health department staff) only called me over the phone asking how I was feeling, but nobody came to check on me physically, or to ensure that I was actually staying home.Nothing was explained to me even when they told me to be in home quarantine,"" he said.He complained that the rooms in the hospital where he has been quarantined, along with other family members, were not clean and their maid (also in quarantine with them) had to clean them.Chief minister Pramod Sawant said that 35 close contacts of the three patients who tested positive for the virus have been placed under isolation already.“We are making all efforts to identify each and every person who has come in contact with the three patients, and keep them in isolation,” Sawant said.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74839522,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-97073,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gmc-discharges-patient-calls-him-back-after-ve-test-result/articleshow/74837992.cms

NEW DELHI: The shutting down of the Ghazipur slaughterhouse and a restricted supply chain has severely impacted those reliant on chicken and mutton from their nearest butcher. Also, the temporary closure of shops during Navratri has resulted in prices shooting up by 25-30% at several places.

E-commerce websites, which earlier delivered fresh seafood, mutton and chicken to homes, have not been able to provide any items in the past few days.

FreshToHome and Licious, two e-commerce firms providing poultry items, had listed all items “out of stock” on Thursday. The situation on the ground was no better with physical stores stating that fresh items had stopped arriving, leaving people to rely on frozen meat.

Dinesh, who works at Green Chick Chop in Defence Colony, said only frozen non-vegetarian items were being supplied to them and fresh poultry had not arrived in the last two days.

“We have not increased our rates yet, but the supply chain has surely been impacted. We’re not sure how the closure of Ghazipur slaughterhouse will impact the overall supply, but there are certainly problems in procuring mutton and chicken at the moment,” Dinesh added.

Tejpal Sakla, owner of Meaty Affair in Janakpuri, said that even though demand was high, he was unable to meet it with no fresh chicken or mutton being delivered since Monday.

Prices have risen in the market owing to the reduced supply. “If I have to pay 25% more to procure items, I will also have to raise the selling price. My stock may run dry by Friday,” said Sakla.

Many store owners said customers haven’t been coming due to the lockdown. Nazeer Fresh at Karkardooma, which supplies fresh raw meat, said they are still receiving calls from people and delivering poultry items to them. “We last received our stock on Wednesday. We will have to see whether this continues on Friday. So far, we have not increased our prices,” said Pawan Kumar, who works at the shop.

People said as Navratri is occurring simultaneously, many meat shops have shut shop on their own. Akshit Lamba, a resident of Safdarjung Enclave, said, “We are relying on delivery chains. This will affect the demand and supply.”

Vinod Kumar, owner of Bengal Meat and Fish Shop in Pashchim Vihar, said he and others have shut shop as they don’t sell meat during Navratri. “I haven’t gone to the mandi in the last few days, so I’m unaware of increase in prices after the closure of the Ghazipur slaughterhouse,” he added.

222,['27/03/2020'],Delhi: Colour-coded e-passes for moving essentials,"Image used for representational purpose only

NEW DELHI: To ensure that there is no shortage of essential commodities during the lockdown , Delhi government has decided to issue electronic passes to those engaged in manufacturer , transport and storage of the items. Those who supply and distribute five basic essential items, including milk, vegetables, groceries and medicines, are also eligible for the e-passes.

A helpline — 1031 — and an online platform — epass.jantasamvad.org/epass/init — have been created to generate colour-coded e-passes, which would be sent on the WhatsApp number of the applicant after verification.

The online and telephonic requests would be transferred to the 11 district administrations, where modules with multiple computers manned by more than 10 people have been set up. The colour codes of the passes are based on the nature of service for easy identification.

After an applicant calls for the e-pass, an SMS would be sent to his mobile number with a link to submit basic details along with the copy of a government identity card. The district officials concerned will issue the e-pass following a scrutiny of documents and eligibility. The e-passes will remain valid till April 14. Misuse will attract penal punishment.

Since its launch, the system has been overburdened, but around 8,264 e-passes have been issued in the last two days by the 11 districts. “Around 10,133 requests are pending because many people who are not engaged in essential services have also applied for the passes. Many have made multiple applications,” sources said.

More than 23,000 applications have been received for e-passes. A source said a vegetable vendor would be issued the pass on the basis of trust for use in the area mentioned. “However, if the vendor is found using it for other purposes, he will be penalised by police,” he added.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has appealed to people not to make requests for passes if they are not engaged in essential services. He clarified that 1031 is not a general helpline and urged please not to make general calls as it would lead to congestion of the line. He clarified that people do not need passes for going to their nearby ration shops, general stores or chemists.

Many people have been finding it difficult to connect to the helpline. Novy Kapadia (67), who stays in Naraina Vihar, said, “I tried the line over 10 times. Later, I also tried the online platform, but couldn’t get any response till late in the evening. My medical helper needs to travel from Wazirpur to my house everyday. He needs the e-pass.”

Sources in the government said after the helpline witnessed congestion, the total number of lines was increased to 30. It is being strengthened to meet the huge demand.

“We have requested police to allow essential service providers of the roads even if they don’t have a pass. The government is working relentlessly to provide passes to all essential service providers,” Kejriwal said.

LUCKNOW: In a bid to ensure timely payment of electricity bills during lockdown, CM Yogi Adityanth on Thursday directed Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited ( UPPCL ) to bear the charge levied by banks on online payment of electricity bills.

The CM issued the directions in a review meeting to assess the problems faced by the people during lockdown.

Until now, banks levy transaction charge from consumers on online payment of electricity bills through debit or credit cards. This charge would now be borne by UPPCL. The arrangement will be put in place for April, a state government spokesperson said. Sources said this is being done to restrict people from visiting sub-stations to pay the bills and instead make online payment during the three-week nationwide lockdown.

Consumers can also pay their electricity bills online through mobile application ‘e-nivaran’ or through UPPCL website www.upenergy.in. The spokesperson said consumers can lodge complaints pertaining to electricity bills on helpline number 1912.

UPPCL has also appealed to consumers to pay the bills for uninterrupted power supply. This, the corporation said, will help it in paying the dues to the power generating companies. Principal secretary energy Arvind Kumar said, on an average, about 25% consumers pay the electricity bills online, which comes to 17.5% of total power revenue collection.

228,['27/03/2020'],"Corona blue: Clear skies, clean air in Delhi","NEW DELHI: Reduced vehicular movement on the roads and an early morning shower led to not only a dramatic improvement in air quality, with the PM2.5 level dropping to 20 micrograms per cubic metre by Friday afternoon, but also usually clear blue skies , a sight rarely seen in the capital at this time. Delhi also logged the lowest Air Quality Index of the week at 69 (satisfactory).Both the Central Pollution Control Board and environmentalists said on Friday that the next two weeks should see further improvement in the capital’s air quality.The azure skies became a popular topic on social media, with Delhiites posting pictures of the sky and discussing when they had last seen experienced such air quality. Dwarka resident V Selvarajan, who is the founder of the NGO Green Circle, remembered such a beautiful sky in Delhi only in the 1980s and early 90s. He appeared to believe that nature was regaining its balance in this period of minimal human activities.“The rain certainly helped, but with no industries operating and no vehicles on the road, you can see the difference,” said Selvarajan. “The winds blowing are clean and fresh and I have been trying to spend as much time on my balcony as possible.”Bhavreen Kandhari, an environmental activist from Defence Colony, said the current conditions could act as the baseline for levels to be maintained by industries to reduce pollution. “Many of us have noticed the blue skies. It is no coincidence that with vehicles going off the roads and industries shutting down, the air quality has improved so much,” said Kandhari. “This is the largest experiment ever being conducted in the whole world and if we cannot use these results to improve things, then there really is no hope.”Delhi’s 24-hour AQI has been declining in recent days. On Sunday, it was 191 (moderate), dropping to 122 (moderate) by Tuesday. It reached the ‘satisfactory’ range on Wednesday and on Friday, the city recorded its lowest AQI thus far.The improvement has been significant across the National Capital Region. On Friday, Delhi-NCR’s 24-hour PM2.5 average was a mere 28.5 micrograms per cubic metre at 8pm against a safe level of 60. The 24-hour PM10 average, at the same time, logged 56.3 micrograms per cubic metre, much below the safe standard of 100 micrograms per cubic metre.In the capital, meanwhile, the PM2.5 pollution level dropped to 20.2 micrograms per cubic metre at 1 pm on Friday — the lowest it has been this week. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and policy, Centre for Science and Environment, explained that the lowering of pollution levels in the capital was due to a mix of factors, including the weather and a reduction in industrial and vehicular activities.On Friday, Delhi recorded 1.8mm of rainfall till 5.30 pm, with an evening shower adding another 2.5mm of rain. Strong gusty winds ranging from 40-50 km/hr, along with the rain was further expected to help Delhi’s air quality, officials said.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74856803,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-476610,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corona-blue-clear-skies-clean-air/articleshow/74855039.cms

NEW DELHI: With lakhs of casual workers losing their jobs due to the lockdown and having no means to feed their families, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has set up over 500 hunger relief centres in Delhi to ensure four lakh such people get free lunch and dinner from Saturday.Kejriwal said his government had opened hunger relief centres in government schools across the city with a capacity to provide food packets to 500 people at each meal time.This was in addition to several locations identified by all district magistrates in their respective areas where food was being distributed at the doorsteps of the needy.Officials said the government mapped the demand and supply with the help of district officials, RWAs and NGOs to arrive at the figure of four lakh. The district teams carried out an elaborate exercise and identified pockets where causal labourers and their families lived to start distributing food.South district on Friday provided cooked meals to almost 17,000 people at over 400 locations twice. Similarly, Southwest district provided hot lunch to 11,000 and dinner to 13,000 people at about 60 locations with the help of social organisations. The district also delivered dry ration packets and toiletries for 21 days to 70 extremely poor families.Senior officials said at least 13 organisations, including some prominent religious-socio groups and not-for-profit organisations like Iskcon, Radha Soami Satsang Beas and gurdwaras, had joined hands with the government to provide relief to the poor in the time of “humanitarian crisis”. The government has also appealed to individuals and groups willing to volunteer in contributing and distributing meals and food packets to fill up a form and get associated in the mammoth task.The government has also formed an advisory panel, led by deputy CM Manish Sisodia, to coordinate the relief efforts.With all commercial establishments, except those dealing in essential items, closed till April 14 to prevent community transmission of novel coronavirus , daily wagers have been facing the challenge to feed themselves and their families. While Delhi government initially started providing free lunch and dinner at its night shelters, it has now made massive arrangements to ensure lakhs of poor families living in the capital do not go hungry.The CM said his government was providing free ration to 72 lakh beneficiaries. He added that the government was feeding nearly 20,000 people per day at its night shelters, but the number has been rising.“I noticed some videos on social media of people who could not get meals. Considering this, Delhi government has decided to provide lunch and dinner at 325 schools across the city. Every school shall be able to feed around 500 beneficiaries. The strength of people being fed shall increase from 20,000 per day to two lakh, which will further increase to four lakh from tomorrow (Saturday),” Kejriwal said in his digital press conference, adding that MLAs had been told to ensure that no one in their constituency suffered from hunger.DM (South) BM Mishra said Radha Soami Satsang Beas had agreed to provide more than 50,000 meals twice a day to a large population in his district.

233,['27/03/2020'],"Delhi lockdown: Truck drivers stranded, supply of essential items likely to be affected","Truck operators claimed that a large number of truck drivers has already gone back to their villages

NEW DELHI: Movement of freight trucks to and from Delhi has been disrupted following the lockdown. Several trucks are still stuck at the state borders. Truck operators, meanwhile, claim that many drivers have already left for their villages. It may affect the supply of goods to Delhi in the coming days, they add.

SP Singh of Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training said that while movement is getting restored, it is nowhere near normal. “The exodus of truck drivers due to fear factor has begun. They too want to be with their families, and it has become difficult for them to get water or food.”

Singh said a large number of truck drivers has already gone back to their villages in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Odisha. “At their homes, they will at least get two square meals,” he added.

Naveen Kumar Gupta, secretary general of the All India Motor Transport Congress said that everyone is waiting for a formal circular with guidelines from the Centre. “Although trucks carrying essential goods are exempted, one has to understand that after unloading the essential goods, the truck can’t go back empty. It will get stranded, leading to scarcity of vehicles,” he added.

Both Singh and Gupta said that truck drivers are unable to get food and water and wherever they are stranded, the local administration should help them. “There is also a need to spread awareness about social distancing among drivers,” Gupta said.

“There are not many trucks at Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar as most are still stuck at borders. As dhabas have closed everywhere, we provided food to the drivers here,” said Sandeep Jain, president of the Traders Welfare Association of the transport hub.

“Though there is some relaxation in some parts of the country, it is not the case everywhere. Truck movement across the country has been disrupted. Loading and unloading of goods is also not happening at many places due to manpower shortage,” said B Channa Reddy, president of All India Truck Operators Confederation.

234,['27/03/2020'],"Oppo’s India engineers are developing image processing, 5G tech","Chinese smartphone maker Oppo’s Hyderabad R&D centre is just over a year old but it's already playing a major role in developing new technologies for India and the rest of the world. The 350-strong centre is Oppo’s largest and only one outside China.

Tasleem Arif, VP & head of R&D in Oppo India , says the centre has played a key role in its VOOC fast charging technology, in the globalization of its operating system ColorOS 7, and in its newest smartphone F15. “We have filed over 50 patents this year, 30% of which are in imaging and 20% in the network space,” he says.

This includes patents in the areas of camera and image processing, battery, networks (5G), system performance, payments, AI and gaming. “There are more patents in process,” Arif adds.

The latest version of VOOC, 3.0, which powers the Reno2 series, was developed in the centre here. Some key features of the F15, like Game Boost 3.0, Hyper Boost and Frame Boost technologies, were developed here. Hyper Boost delves deep into the handset’s performance to examine latency and control issues, as well as touch control and refresh rates to ensure games run smoothly, even in heavy loading scenarios. The optimised FPS (frames per second) is 38% higher. Average touch sensitivity rises by 16%, ensuring fast touch response even in low power conditions. Both these enable smoother game play.

Frame Boost 2.0 allocates resources to avoid the consumption of too much power and overheating of the phone, and Touch Boost 2.0 assesses touch events and accelerates response time, increasing general touch performance by 35.2%.

For the F15, which was recently launched in the Indian market, Oppo came up with localised technology innovations such as AI video beautification and a WiFi calling feature. “In the AI video beautification feature, which is applied in both the front and rear cameras, the software has been configured to capture and analyse Indian skin tones and features,” Arif says.

With the WiFi calling feature, users can make and answer calls even in low bandwidth areas, as long as they are connected to a WiFi network,” he explained.

The team has worked on local innovations like integrating the government’s DigiLocker service into ColorOS 7 and came up with a localised feature called DocVault that makes storing and retrieving documents like driving license and Aadhaar card simpler and faster.

Arif says Oppo is investing heavily on gathering consumer insights and working towards consumer centric innovations. The company has announced a $7 billion global investment in R&D over the next three years to develop core technologies in hardware, software and system, in addition to 5G, AI, augmented reality etc. “We have also allocated $143 million in 2020 for supporting developers across the globe to boost our operating ecosystem. As part of this, we plan to tap the potential of the Indian developer community this year to improve user experience, especially in the domain of 5G and AI,” Arif says.

By 2020, the Hyderabad centre expects to be 500 strong. “We have been hiring skilled resources from prestigious institutes like IIT, IIIT and NIT,” says Arif.

The sister duo neither had shelter nor the money to rent a place or buy food. And they couldn’t go back to their home in Bogdang Nubra (Ladakh) as train and flight operations are shut.

“The private hostel where we stay was shut in view of the Covid-19 threat and my sister and I were asked to vacate the facility,” Zulikha told TOI.

With no place to go, they ended up at a friend’s rented accommodation but the house owner asked them to leave the next morning. With little money in hand, the sisters stayed at different places for small durations. “Finally, another college friend welcomed us in her home and her house owner has allowed us to stay with her throughout the lockdown,” Zulikha added.

But their woes didn’t end here. They still had no means for food. Seeing no other way, Zulikha wrote a post about her financial problem and uploaded it on social media and pleaded for help.

Meanwhile, Zulikha also got in touch with All Ladakh Student Union wing in Dehradun. “As soon I learnt about Zulikha and her sister from one of our associates, I tried to help them but due to restrictions, no one could reach out to her. I also received a list of nearly 65 students who were in need of urgent help. That is when I thought of approaching Ladakh MP Jamyang Tsering Namgyal on Twitter and also tried calling him on his cell phone. After repeated attempts, I was able to speak with the MP and he promised me to help the students,” said Shujat Hussain, president of All Ladakh Student Union.

Namgyal contacted Mala Rajya Laxmi, the MP of Tehri Grahwal, who instructed the officials in Dehradun to help the students stranded in the city.

On Wednesday late evening, 25 grocery packets were provided to Zulikha and her sister. Other students from Ladakh were also given help by district authorities who provided them with food packets.

Besides getting ration from the administration, Zulikha also received support from some city residents who made online transfer of money to help her.

The appeal comes a day before the Friday prayers.

Agra and Aligarh’s ‘shahar’ Mufti have issued a ‘fatwa’ saying that due to 21 days of nationwide lockdown, Muslim community should offer ‘Zuhar ki namaz’ at home, instead of ‘Jumma namaz’ at the mosque.

Talking to TOI, Agra Mufti Mudassar Khan said, “Considering the gravity of the situation, the fatwa was issued. The purpose behind it is to maintain social distancing during the lockdown period as urged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.”

“Shariyat also allows such decisions during times of crisis,” said Khan, adding that only Imam, ‘muezzin’ (one who proclaims the call to prayer) and the mosque administrators will offer prayers at mosques five times a day.

They too will maintain social distancing and all required precautions will be taken to combat novel coronavirus that has claimed 12 lives in India so far.

Aligarh’s Mufti, Mohammad Khalid Hameed, said that this is a time for everyone to take precautions while following religious practices.

“We urge people not to come to mosques and stay at their homes to check spread of coronavirus,” he said, adding that the whole community will pray to get rid of this problem.

In Mathura, Imam Mohammad Sarjidul Qadri, appealed to the community not to visit mosques during lockdown period of 21 days. “Many people have died across the world due to Covid-19, and if people want to be safe, they should maintain social distancing and obey lockdown orders,” he said.

As reported earlier, temples across the state have already shut their doors. Even on Navratra, devotees are not visiting temples to maintain social distancing.

While in Sambhal, Jama Masjid’s Imam of Maulana Alam Noori issued a video massage on Thursday asking Muslims not to gather at mosques across the district for Friday namaz.

The patient, who was part of a ‘Tabligi Jamaat’ (religious preachers), had stayed in a mosque in Deoband for three days earlier this month. He had a contact history with foreigners before he arrived in the valley. He had reportedly returned from New Delhi recently after being part of the jamaat which was attended by people from Indonesia and Malaysia.

On Thursday afternoon, a health team rushed to Mohammadiya Mosque situated in Khankaah locality of Deoband, santitized the whole area, shut down the building and also took away with them three persons who had close contact with him.

Saharanpur senior superintendent of police Dinesh Kumar P told TOI, “The senior citizen had visited Deoband on March 9 and stayed here till March 11. He died in Kashmir on Thursday because of novel coronavirus. We cannot say with certainty if he was already infected at that moment because there is a gap of 13 days after he left Deoband by train. But we are taking no chances. Entire area has been sanitized and people are being asked to stay indoors. Three persons, who had come in contact with him, have been isolated.”

Before being admitted to the hospital in Srinagar, the religious preacher had come into contact with some local doctors, nurses and paramedics in addition to attending a couple of religious congregations in Sopore town of Kashmir’s Baramulla district. Among the many that he came in contact with, four had tested positive on Wednesday.

But that doesn’t mean they are on a holiday during the nationwide lockdown imposed to minimise novel coronavirus spread. Accepting that the break shutdown might be long, many schools in the city have started online classes.At home, students have to still wear their uniforms and sit down with a smartphone, tablet or computer to attend “school”. They have to log on to this virtual classroom at the time slotted and follow a routine that schools have started following, under the changed circumstances. The idea is not to waste valuable study time during this stay-at-home phase .While some teachers admitted they were just about getting used to speaking before a camera, most students are loving the novel experience. La Martiniere for Girls, DPS Ruby Park, South City International and The Heritage are some of the schools that already started teaching and assessing students online this week. The Newtown School is also set to start virtual classes soon.La Martiniere for Girls held its first online class on Wednesday. “We are glad the school started online classes. The Covid-19 crisis is not likely to end any time soon and we don’t want to lose out on lessons indefinitely,” said Anoushka Sen, a student of Class XI of the humanities stream. Classmate Sampriya Banik said, “I was missing school. At least, now we can look forward to being connected virtually. It felt as if we were back in classroom.”Teachers said the Plus-2 syllabus was huge and would become unmanageable unless continuous teaching was carried out. Hence, the decision to start online classes instead of to wait for the lockdown to end.At The Heritage, it’s a study package of four-and-a-half hours that students have to sit through daily, divided over several subjects. A temporary routine has been drawn up. Students have been given links, which they can use to log on to the virtual classroom at 9am. The academic co-ordinator, Soubhik Jati, is setting it all up from his residence; his work starts at 7:30am and goes on till 8 at night so that lectures can be held smoothly and assignments can be submitted.Jati said virtual classes were close to real classrooms. “The routine was prepared on March 20 itself and shared with heads of subjects who prepared the content. We are using a learning app for the platform for 75 days and students have been given free access,” he said.Most students seem glad to be “back in class”. “We had maths on Wednesday. It was great speaking to my friends and teacher after so many days,” said DPS Ruby Park Class-VI student Ayan Mitra.In the absence of smartboards, teachers used a big exercise book to write as they taught. “Apart from online teaching via a video-call app, we are uploading chapter-wise assignments of different subjects. Flip Learn and our school’s own app are also being used for online lessons,” said a teacher at DPS Ruby Park.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/home-school-starts-as-kids-log-on-to-online-classes/articleshow/74837343.cms

The embassy, which had asked the students to fend for themselves after they were stranded in the airport at Almaty, provided them with hotel accommodation and made food arrangements for them following directions from the court.“We are now comfortable and are thankful to the embassy,” Sameer, a student told TOI from Kazakhstan. Lawyer Miriam Fozia Rahman filed a petition on behalf of the Indian students stranded at Almaty airport, Kazakhstan in the Delhi high court. According to Rahman, in what was a first, a hearing was conducted through video conference by the judges, her (the petitioner) and the MEA counsel Jasmeet Singh.On Wednesday, the high court directed the embassy to ensure the welfare of the Indian students who were stranded in Kazakhstan. The court also directed that a nodal officer be appointed from the embassy to take care of the students.“The embassy was indifferent to us when we approached it for help,” medical student Sameer said. An audio recording of the rash response of the embassy staff when students called for help also went viral. There are nearly 500 students, mostly medical students, stuck in Kazakhstan unable to return to India on account of cancellation of flights. The students sent videos of themselves stranded at Almaty airport to TOI explaining the condition they were in. Their issue was highlighted in TOI on March 23. After they were evicted from the Almaty airport, the students were forced to look for accommodation with friends or people they knew but it became difficult to continue the arrangement.Following the direction of the Delhi high court, the embassy announced that it was appointing a nodal officer forIndian students in Almaty.

242,['27/03/2020'],Telangana: Some take a detour to dodge cop vigil in districts,"<p>A few trying to cross over tried taking internal roads through villages<br></p>

HYDERABAD: As the Telangana government closed all the inter-state borders to prevent movement of people from one location to another during the lockdown period, some commuters are giving jitters to the police and district administrations. In their desperate attempts to reach their villages and towns, people are choosing remote villages and entering into neighbouring states to escape police radar and checkposts on the main roads.

For instance, Garikapadu near Ramapuram in Krishna district is a Telangana-AP border village on the National Highway-65. Since there is a checkpost on the main road, some people are taking the village internal road by traversing about 3 km and joining the NH after the checkpost mainly to catch police off guard. After coming to know this, villagers have fenced their village road for outside vehicles.

Similarly, people from Karnataka are entering Telangana from remote villages in Jukkal mandal and Sopura village in Kamareddy district. On Maharashstra border, as Salura is closed for vehicular movement from other states, they are reaching from nearby villages.

Some people from Sironcha in Maharashtra entered Chennur in Mancherial district on Wednesday and locals noticed them and informed the cops. But police said they cannot keep a watch on every village, especially in the remote areas. Police are finding it difficult to keep a watch on Maoist- affected districts like Warangal, Asifabad-Kumaram Bheem and Bhadradri-Kothagudem.

The state government had closed borders of Maharashtra, Karnataka and AP on March 22, soon after news about a huge number of positive cases from Maharashtra spread like a wildfire. Following the Centre’s decision to lockdown the entire nation till April 14, movement of people, especially to neighouring AP, had increased since Wednesday.

“It is true commuters are even ready to take the longest routes to reach AP by avoiding police checkposts. Traffic at Jangareddygudem in West Godavari and Tiruvur in Krishna district has increased in the last two days,” senior officials in the government said.

With chaos prevailing at inter-state border at Garikapadu of Krishna , at Vadapalli bridge (Guntur-Nalgonda) and Putlur plaza (Mahbubnagar-Kurnool) as hundreds of students and employees stuck at the checkposts for last two days, Telangana minister G Jagadishwar Reddy said a decision was taken to allow the people of both states to cross.“This was the last chance for people to cross the borders during the lockdown period. Both Telangana and AP chief ministers had agreed on Thursday to allow people on humanitarian ground,” the minister, who visited the border checkpost at Vadapalli in the afternoon, said. However, he said all the people must undergo mandatory tests by the government and those suspected with coronavirus symptoms would be sent for quarantine immediately. The minister also announced that from Friday no person from AP would be allowed into Telangana during lockdown.Several hundreds of people, who reached the checkpost from Hyderabad on Wednesday night and Thursday morning, were stopped by officials of the AP government.

Since there were several families and women who were stranded, police officials of the respective states brought the issue to the notice of their respective governments.Jagadishwar along with Miryalaguda MLA N Bhaskar Rao spoke to the people and said it was not the intention of the governments to put people to hardships. The minister informed the situation to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao who, in turn, spoke to his AP counterpart Jaganmohan Reddy and decided to allow them into AP.“Since none of you have undergone coronavirus tests, it is mandatory to undergo the test before going to your respective villages.

On Thursday, Bengaluru city police commissioner Bhaskar Rao said if PG and hostel owners ask inmates to leave, it would be illegal. “They must provide food too,” he said. The commissioner said if this was not done they would be prosecuted. “It’s loud and clear,” he said in a tweet.

A worker from Jagtial in Telangana employed with a pharmaceutical company told TOI from Bengaluru that he was forced to sleep on the road for last two nights. “Everyone in the PG accommodation where I was staying were forced to leave by the owners,” he said.

Prashanth (22), who has been working in Bengaluru for the last one year, said he was without food because of the lockdown. “I approached the local police who were passing by for help to send me to my hometown but they did not respond,” he said.

A resident of Siddipet, Bharath said both his sisters in Bengaluru were also facing a severe problem after they were evicted from their PG accommodation. While one of them is employed with a software company, another went there to join a company but the appointment order was cancelled because of the lockdown.

Both of them were staying in an area where there are several buildings from where PG accommodation is run. “Despite the orders of the police, the owners have evicted many people. My sisters wanted to return home but are stuck there because of the lockdown. We have no relatives in Bengaluru and they have nowhere to go,” Bharath said.

He has also tried to reach public representatives in Siddipet for help but has not been able to meet them. Bharath said he has been trying to meet finance minister T Harish Rao for help.

They have also said no food has been given to them in over 19 hours.

“The hospital staff asked us to fill our drinking water bottles from the toilets. Not just this, we were not provided with any breakfast on Thursday, and got food nearly 19 hours after we were given dinner on Wednesday,” claimed a 32-year-old Covid-19 suspect who works at a multinational hotel chain in Dubai.

A diabetic, he had approached the government hospital after developing symptoms akin to the contagious disease. According to experts, long gaps in meals may worsen the health condition of any diabetic patient.

The patient also tweeted to the Prime Minister Office (PMO) and to the UP’s chief minister seeking help from them.

“I am not sure if anyone is reading this, but I am suffering due to COVID-19. Meerut Medical College (doesn't) have proper infrastructure, no food or water (since) the last 20 hours here... help (sic),” read the tweet.

TOI could not access the hospital’s quarantine ward, but patients inside gave almost the same account when contacted on phone. They shared pictures and videos which corroborated the version shared by the patient on twitter.

Another patient, a 30-year-old from Hastinapur, said, “Drinking water is a major issue here. At a time when special care should be taken about anything we eat or drink, we are not even getting filtered water. We are being told to fill water from the washroom taps.”

When contacted, Dr RC Gupta, principal of LLRM Medical College, said, “We haven’t got any such complaint so far. However, now that the matter has been brought to our notice, we will look into it.”

Urging people not to misinterpret it, he said, “The purpose of the 21-day lockdown by the Prime Minister is to contain the outbreak of the virus. But we are just avoiding taking a chance and preparing everything ahead.”Kejriwal also appealed to the people leaving Delhi to return from the border and stay back as his government was scaling up food distribution arrangements.Out of the 40 positive cases in Delhi, 30 have come from outside. “The situation is under control right now with a maximum daily increase of three-four cases. On some days, there are no new case. But the situation is deteriorating in countries like the US and the UK. If the same happens in India, are we ready for that?” the chief minister asked.The report of the team, set up by Kejriwal, was submitted on Thursday and includes a three-stage action plan. The first stage talks about the arrangements required if Delhi starts getting 100 new cases daily. The second and third stages deal with situations when the count reaches 500 and 1,000 new cases every day, respectively.The current healthcare system is enough to treat 100 new cases daily, said Kejriwal. “A detailed plan has been prepared to see how many isolation beds, ventilators, ICU beds, testing mechanism, ambulances, and medical staff including doctors and nurses,” are required to tackle all three stages, he added. The team has also mapped mechanisms on inclusion of private hospitals in case of a surge and on procuring essential resources.“We will start implementing these plans once the cases rise from 100 per day. We have a detailed plan to treat up to 1,000 new cases per day. But I hope we never reach that stage,” Kejriwal said.Through video-conferencing, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and the chief minister also reviewed the lockdown situation and the condition of essential supplies.Around 8 lakh social welfare pension beneficiaries have received Rs 5,000 — double of the usual amount — for March and will get the same for April in the first week of next month, Kejriwal said.

The closed Ooty municipal market houses over 1,300 grocery, vegetable and fruit shops.

“By splitting the vegetable shops in Uzhavar Sandhai and Ooty municipal markets, shops will be set up in open area in Shanthi Vijai ground (municipal) and Ooty main bus stand. This is to give required space to the customers to maintain social distancing,” collector J Innocent Divya told reporters in the town on Thursday.

“Shopkeepers are responsible for maintaining social distance of their customers. Otherwise, they will be asked to close their shops,” she said.

As far as villages in the district are concerned, pickup vans will supply vegetables and fruits to every village on regular intervals of time. In this connection, a meeting was held by the district administration with the wholesale vegetable vendors.

In connection with the seven samples from the district given for COVID-19 test, Divya said, “All the seven results are negative. However, two of them have symptoms and they are monitored in step-down wards.”

HYDERABAD: Living cooped up in a shed for 21 days with no access to the outside world is scarier to a dozen-odd construction labourers from Visakhapatnam than travelling 600 km between states. Even the firmly closed borders between states does not bother them.

The labourers started their long journey from a basti in Hyderabad’s Banjara Hills area to Visakhapatnam the moment PM Narendra Modi announced the national lockdown on Tuesday. They reached Kodad on the Telangana-AP border on Thursday, walking and hitching rides on a handful of trucks that they came across.

Speaking to TOI over the phone, 26-year-old Vadla Shankar says that they have no other option but to walk as much as they can as they are left with no work and very little money to survive in Hyderabad. “Home would be a much safe option?” he asks.

“We began walking on Wednesday night at 10.30 pm, with each one of us having between Rs 1,000 and Rs 2,000 in cash,” said P Mahesh, another 21-year-old from the group adding: “It is very difficult to get food, but surviving 21 days of lockout on our own seemed even more difficult. We hope to reach our village soon.”

With great difficulty, the labourers had managed to get food at a local dhaba upon reaching Nalgonda district . They claim to have covered most of the distance by walking but with many having already exhausting their money, managing a truck to cover the remaining distance has become a difficult task .

Migrant labourers earn between Rs 700 and Rs 1,000 a day in Hyderabad. There are about 300 people from Visakhapatnam in the same Banjara Hills basti, some who have their families settled in Hyderabad decided to stay back.

The Telengana government reached out to them after a social activist alerted them on plight of migrant labourers unable to find work. “We tried to convince them to stay back, assured them food but we have to understand their psyche too,” said Sajaya Kakarla, social activist who had reached out to help them.

“Though the group belongs to a tribal community, the region they live in has not been declared a scheduled tribal area. Hence, they don’t get any benefits,” observed P S Ajay Kumar, another social activist who works with tribals in Andhra Pradesh . “Four of them carry mobiles but they have run out of charge and are unable to stay in touch with their families,” Ajay Kumar said.

A group of six had managed to reach Tuni in Andhra Pradesh which is over 400 kilometres from Hyderabad by Thursday afternoon. Locals there are said to have reached out to them to given them money and food .

As the situation became tense, the SP stepped in urged people, who intended to enter AP, not to resort to violence. It was learnt that at least five persons were injured while several vehicles damaged.“It is not advisable for you to gather in such large numbers. Who knows if they are carrying the virus. Please return to Hyderabad, I will facilitate your return travel and make sure you will not face any difficulty. If someone is not having any vehicle, I will help you out by arranging a bus,’’ Ranganath told those waiting to cross over. Most had left the place till last reports came in and had started their return to Hyderabad.Earlier in the day, chief ministers of both Telugu states had spoken to each other to resolve the issue and agreed on a one-time deal for people to cross over.

In Jaisalmer’s Nachna, Mohangarh canal areas and other areas with tubewells, crops of wheat, jeera, mustard are ready to be harvested but farmers are not getting any labourers for it. And where the crops have been harvested, they are lying in the fields and not being gathered, for want of labourers.

According to the information, due to lockdown, all public transport is closed and labourers from the neighbouring places are not coming to the canal area and the labourers who were there, have gone to their villages due to which there is a shortage of labourers.

According to additional director general of police (ADG-Meerut zone) Prashant Kumar, ""Disciplining disobedient crowds is the biggest challenge in containing the spread of coronavirus.""

Although Meerut zone, comprising eight densely populated districts of west UP, has only two confirmed cases — one each in Shamli and Baghpat — so far, western UP as a whole accounts for more than 70% of the total 42 positive coronavirus cases in the state, with Noida and Agra leading the chart.

""We are using all possible means, including continuously appealing to people through public address systems, patrolling, drawing social distance circles on roadsides and near shops for people to stand a meter apart from each other, issuing challans to stray vehicles, barricading, etc, but unless people understand the real danger, these measures turn futile,"" said ADG Kumar.

Unlike curfew, the lockdown has its own loopholes, too; there is a relaxation in the morning hours for the people to procure daily needs, but it is also the time when markets get crowded defeating the very purpose of social distancing and the lockdown.

""A large number of people still don't understand the gravity of the situation. A couple of car occupants got aggressive with cops when they were not allowed to enter the city limits. When the crossed their limits, I had to pull out my service pistol to force them to maintain at least two-meter distance,"" an inspector who wished not to be identified told TOI.

However, ADG Kumar says, ""It's high time and we will have to be strict now, else all of us will regret.""

Notably, in Saharanpur, drones have been deployed for aerial surveillance and identifying areas where people are venturing out of the roads.

""Despite prohibitory orders in place, many people are not adhering to the directions of staying at home. They cite one reason or another to stay out. We have deployed drones to enforce lockdown effectively and are taking strict measures against people caught by the aerial surveillance,"" said SSP Saharanpur Dinesh P.

Muzaffarnagar SSP Abhishek Yadav disclosed, "" A total of 50 people have been booked on Thursday alone for defying the lockdown, while 10 were booked on Wednesday.""

It may be noted that a large population of the people from Sirohi and Jalore has been working in southern states including Gujrat and now, they now have been making their way back to their respective homes due to corona outbreak and suspension of works due to lockdown in thousands.

According to the member of the National Minority Commission, Sunil Singhi, these migrants have been asked to stay where they are.

“The Rajasthan Migrants Association has also been asked to help them, whosoever, contact them for help. They could also contact me for,” Singhi said.

Meanwhile, the district administrations of Jalore and Sirohi have now opened their borders for all these migrants who have been coming to Rajasthan and want to reach their homes.

“The borders were sealed till Wednesday but were opened on the orders of the state government in the evening. Since then about 1,500 persons have entered Rajasthan,” said SP (Jalore) Himmat Abhilash Tak.

MLA from Sirohi Sanyam Lodha has also tweeted to inform that the state government has also ordered to allow these migratory workers from Sirohi, Jalore and Pali, after conducting their screening on the border, which were ceased earlier.

But there is a threat also involved in this huge influx of the migratory workers, who have been coming all the way from Gujrat, Maharashtra and Karnataka mostly.

“Though, we have put up an extensive checking mechanism at the Abu Road and Mandar posts of Sirohi bordering Gujrat, but still some of these migratory workers entering Rajasthan from other routes in rural areas across 175km long border, could not be ruled out,” said Sirohi collector Bhagwati Prasad.

Two days back, 40 migratory workers from Gujarat, had been intercepted in Jodhpur at Paota circle and they had claimed that they had not been stopped anywhere. They, however, were let go only after screening and noting their details.

Prasad said that for such cases, the ward panch and panch of the villages of Sirohi have been asked to keep watch on every such person, who has returned home from other states, immediately.

Though, none of the districts have reported any positive case so far but the possibility cannot be ruled out in such a massive influx, if any positive enter the districts giving a miss to the eyes of the administration.

In some instances, they said, their employees were stopped on their way to shops from wholesale markets with goods. They said they needed clear-cut guidelines for their operation, as they were in a dilemma whether to open shops to ensure people get essential commodities, or close them as police force them to do.

In some areas in the city, such as Venkatapuram, police were seen threatening grocery shopkeepers to close by the evening. In some other areas, shops were open only for a couple of hours in the morning.

Representatives of grocery merchants’ associations, meanwhile, took up the issue with the district administration authorities.

G Irudayaraja, district president of Tamil Nadu Merchants’ Federation, said there were around 10,000 small provision and grocery shops in the city and that police were coercing many shop owners to down shutters. “The government says essential commodities would be available for people. But police are asking us to close shops,” he said.

Pointing out that they were dependent on other states for supply of goods such as dahl, masala and oil, Irudayaraja said, “Only if we get them from wholesale markets, we can sell them in retail. But cops have been beating our workers, who have been bringing stock.”

He said vegetable wholesale markets were open from 6am to 8am and that they were not able to procure stock in such a short time as the markets were crowded. “We want the state to extend the working time of wholesale markets.”

The merchants also urged the state to provide them with clear guidelines on how to function and issue them bonafide certificates so that they could travel to get goods without being harassed.

Meanwhile, collector K Rajamani said Uzhavar Santhais in R S Puram, Singanalur, Vadavalli, Sundarapuram, Sulur, Pollachi and Mettupalayam would function from Friday to ensure availability of vegetables to the residents. In addition, ad-hoc vegetable markets would be set up at Gandhipuram bus stand, Ukkadam bus stand and Mettupalayam Road bus stand, he said in the evening.

Rajamani said the vendors and buyers should maintain social distancing. Vendors should maintain a distance of 1.5m between each stall, while customers should maintain a distance of 1m from each other, he said and urged people not to crowd the facilities.

HYDERABAD: Eighteen youngsters from Kerala, who work as trainees in an agri products manufacturing company in Mumbai, are stuck in the city for the last one week due to the lockdown and subsequent suspension of transport services. As of now, the 18 persons with little money left are taking shelter in a school at Ferozguda near Balanagar.

Speaking about their ordeal, the stranded youngsters, who are aged between 19 and 25, said after the outbreak of Covid-19 in Mumbai, their employer informed them not to report for work till further orders and suggested they return to their native place.

Due to the non-availability of seats in direct flights and trains to Kerala, the youngsters decided to first come to Hyderabad en route and then board Sabari Express to reach Kerala.

The 18-member team reached Hyderabad last Saturday and they were supposed to leave Hyderabad on Sunday. However as Prime Minister Narendra Modi had already announced ‘janata curfew, all transport facilities came to a standstill.

Tey got in touch with Hyderabad-based Malayali organisations and contacted Telangana Planning Commission vice-chairman and former MP B Vinod Kumar, who inturn spoke to Cyberabad police and Ranga Reddy officials to make arrangements for their travel.

He said the state government should provide facilities for those who are from other areas.

He appealed to the people to stay back wherever they are as it is dangerous to travel at this point in time.

He said the union government had reached out to a few Telugus who were stranded in Varanasi.

He announced that each BJP worker would prepare five meal packets every day and supply to poor. He added that he had interacted with may district collectors in the Telugu states. “It is possible to check the spread of coronavirus if people cooperate and stay put at their homes during the lockdown period,” he said. With lockdown being declared across the country to stop the spread of coronavirus, several people have been stranded in different states as transport facilities have either been completely halted or reduced significantly.

Several districts in affected states have been completely shut off.

With nationwide lockdown in progress, a groom–to-be decided to go ahead with his wedding minus “band, baja and baraat”. Instead of the horse that grooms traditionally ride on, he chose to drive his motorcycle to the bride’s house. His baraat comprised his father and two friends to witness the wedding. After getting married, he returned home with his bride without any fanfare.

The wedding took place in Bijnor's Jatan mohalla under Bijnor city police station area on Thursday.

Vikas Kumar, 22, from Naseerpur village under Kotwali Dehat police station area, was in high spirits ever since his marriage was fixed 18 months ago. He expected a big fat wedding but the outbreak of coronavirus put paid to his plans.

With the entire country locked down and people asked to maintain social distance and stay indoors, a grand wedding was out of question.

Not willing to put off his wedding, Vikas invited his closest friends and headed for the bride’s house along with his father and two friends on two bikes. Donning the groom’s outfit, Vikas also wore the protective mask before heading for the bride’s house.

Later, Vikas told TOI, “I have some plans to make my wedding memorable. But I had to content with a small family function. Most of my friends missed my wedding because of coronavirus and restrictions on movement and gatherings.”

The wedding rituals were performed in the presence of close family members. The bride’s neighbours also kept away from the wedding.

270,['27/03/2020'],"Kolkata: Universities, colleges, too, turn to virtual teaching","KOLKATA: Bangabasi College professor Partha Ghosh was pleasantly surprised to find 85% attendance in his physics class on Wednesday morning. He felt the response was tremendous, given it was an online class.

With the nation shutting down to keep the novel coronavirus at bay, colleges and universities have shifted their classrooms to the virtual world to keep lessons going.

Teachers at Presidency University have started mailing assignments to students to work on them while the institutions remain shut till April 15. The university has also provided its students access to its digital library for reference work. Even the department of mass communication at Sister Nivedita University has been taking virtual classes. It is hard to hold students’ attention in person, but most seemed keen to engage during the online interaction, a professor at SNU said.

As the coronavirus pandemic shut down classes on campuses across the nation, students and faculty are sampling a taste of what could be the new normal in college life for weeks to come.

Professors and college authorities TOI spoke to said since it was not clear when classes would resume, they were trying to resort to different methods of online or remote teaching to make as much progress with the syllabus as possible. “University will be shut for at least the next four weeks but we are not sure if the situation will improve after that to allow us to hold normal in-person classes. Even as we stare at an uncertain future, we do not want to waste time as semester examinations are due in May. We are exploring several options, including emailing assignments to students and providing access to the digital library for reference work. If the shutdown continues, we may have to explore other options too,” said a senior official at Presidency University.

Most educators who work in traditional colleges and universities have very little training in online instruction but in the next few weeks, many teachers and students are likely to learn the effective ways of teaching and learning remotely. “We made a WhatsApp group of the students, where they were asked to join the virtual classroom. A meeting was scheduled over an app and the link was provided to students who logged in from their homes at the scheduled time. After a short lecture, assignments were give out. After completing them, students will submit them online. The entire cycle will be repeated every alternate day,” said Ghosh of Bangabasi College.

Colleges, which are rather particular about attendance, have decided to relax the rule. “Many students attend classes towards the end of a semester to achieve their attendance percentage so that they can sit for exams. In the current scene, we may have to allow some relaxations,” said the principal of a south Kolkata college.

On Thursday, around 20 personnel of Government Railway Police (GRP) pooled in ration from their homes and cooked a meal for street dwellers. The policemen distributed the food among two dozen homeless people who were at a pavement near Dehradun railway station.

Dinesh Kumar, GRP in charge, told TOI, “The cops cooked rice and pulses and distributed the food among those who sleep at the bus stand next to the railway station. We had identified 10-12 people but more needy people came from nearby areas when we started distributing food. From Friday onwards, we will arrange big utensils so that we can prepare meal for more such people.”

Om Kumar, a labourer who migrated from Badaun but got stuck in Dehradun due to the lockdown, was among those who were served food by the GRP officials. “This was my second meal since Wednesday. I have been sleeping on the pavement next to the railway station since the nationwide lockdown has been announced,” Kumar told TOI.

Meanwhile, Dehradun Police reached out to almost 600 labourers and slum dwellers living on the banks of Rispana river and handed over packets of ration, masks and sanitisers.

A senior official said seven inmates, including two on Thursday, were released after the recent lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Before the lockdown, 33 juveniles were released. They were involved in theft, elopement and other cases filed under the POCSO Act. Most of them were in 15 and above age group,” said A Rajendra, assistant chief probation superintendent of juvenile homes.

The state has four observation homes where undertrial children in conflict with the law are lodged. Two such homes are in Hyderabad, while the other two are in Sangareddy and Karimnagar. Rajendra said all the homes had been sanitised. “After the lockdown, two new inmates were shifted and kept in a separate dormitory away from the existing inmates as a precautionary measure. Medical officers are monitoring their health,” said Rajendra.

Fiftyfour inmates are still in these four homes, an official said. The girls’ observation home is empty, while the boys’ home in Saidabad has 25 inmates. “Adequate sanitisers, gloves and masks are provided in all the homes,” said D Divya, commissioner, women and child welfare.

The people employed with public transportation services — currently excluded from the list of emergency services — have found an unexpected opportunity to spend quality time with their families.

The public transport employees — who were accustomed to eight-hour shifts or overtimes, plying from one station to another by their assigned vehicles and would have to spend weekly holiday partially in pending official and homely engagements — are during the lockdown spending 24x7 at home with their families. “It is a happy time at home. It is for the first time in a career of 25 years that we are staying at home with the family for 24 hours without work or call from office. Otherwise, it was hardly possible for us to stay at home even at the time of Gujjar reservation agitation, when railway movement was halted,” said Rakesh Sinha, an Indian railways passenger train guard and added that he has been fasting for the Navratra and performing the daily pooja with his family.

“I don’t know how the 50 years of my life went by but now, it is pure happiness being in isolation with the family,” he further said.

The lockdown period has given him an opportunity to relive his childhood days when he would read portions of the Ramcharitra Manas during the nine days of Navratra, said B N Gupta, another senior official of India railways in Kota, adding that he has been reciting a portion of the holy book daily for two hours and been observing the Navratra fast.

The hospital is waiting for kits to arrive to take in samples.“We got the permission from ICMR to conduct the tests on Wednesday evening. We have ordered for the kits from Mylabs Science right after getting the green signal. We will start conducting tests within 24 hours of receiving the kits,” said Shyamasis Bandyopadhyay, director medical service at AGHK.Atleast five private bodies, including Peerless Hospital, Suraksha Hospital and Medica Hospital, had applied for this nod. Their results are awaited.With an increasing number of corona suspected patients and the ICMR extending the category of people whose swab samples have to be tested, pressure was mounting on ICMR-NICED and IPGMER, the only two facilities where samples from different hospitals in across the state are being tested.“There is the need to test more samples not only in West Bengal but across the country. But due to the existing infrastructure we were initially testing only the symptomatic patients. If private laboratories start conducting tests for those who can afford, it will put some load off government labs,” said a health department official.The central government a few days ago had decided to allow NABL accredited laboratories for real time PCR assay for RNA virus to conduct confirmatory test on swab samples of Covid-19 suspects. At least five private laboratories from Kolkata had applied for the registration with ICMR. So far only AGHK got the sanction.“Our chief consultant microbiologist will head the team that will run the laboratory,” said Bandyopadhyay.Only on Wednesday, the Bengal CM had rued that the central government had not given sanction to any private laboratory in the state. So far, ICMR has permitted 29 private labs across eight states in the country. For states like Maharashtra, where the Covid-19 count has crossed 100, nine private labs have been allowed to conduct tests. Smaller states like Delhi where the number of the infected has touched 35, four such private labs have been permitted.“Though the state government will start testing at three more labs attached with its hospitals, if the ICMR does not sanction more private labs to conduct the tests, it’s still going to be tough for the state,” said a senior health department official.The private labs have been allowed to use US FDA-approved kits. But the government has capped the charges for each test at Rs 4,500.Along with ICMR-NICED and IPGMER in the public sector, the laboratory at government run School of Tropical Medicine Kolkata will start taking in samples as 200 kits arrived for its facility on Thursday.

Most of the staff are working from home. The income-tax department has also stopped searches and there were no searches or surveys in the past few days.

282,['27/03/2020'],Plan for flu clinics at private hospitals to screen Covid suspects a non-starter for lack of protective gear,"Haridwar: It seems the state government’s plan to open flu clinics at private hospitals in Haridwar and other districts, for free treatment of flu patients, won’t take off. It was expected that besides treating flu patients, the clinics would screen suspected Covid cases and refer them to government hospitals, taking off part of the latter’s burden.However, doctors at private hospitals said the lack of personal protection equipment (PPE) and infra-red thermometers or thermal scanners are major reasons why the plan is a non-starter.Speaking to TOI, a member of Indian Medical Association (IMA) in Haridwar said, “Even N95 masks and sanitisers are not available to us at a reasonable price.”When asked if any flu clinics are working in Haridwar, chief medical officer Saroj Naithani said, “I have no information on it.” However, she confirmed that a letter to set up these clinics was sent to all 361 registered hospitals/clinics in a WhatsApp group of IMA, Haridwar.Regarding the argument that private hospitals were unwilling to set up flu clinics in their premises due to lack of availability of PPEs and thermal scanners, Dr Naithani said, “Doctors are expected to question patients about their travel history and symptoms. If they think there is something amiss, they can bring it to the notice of a government hospital. For this, they don’t require PPE or thermal scanners.”Meanwhile, reacting to the issue, IMA president Dinesh Singh said, “A number of physicians and paediatricians are providing consultation to patients, including those suffering from flu, in emergencies, as OPDs are closed at all hospitals/clinics due to the lockdown.He added that “none of the physicians who are looking at patients has so far come across any case of suspected Covid-19.”",dehradun,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/plan-for-flu-clinics-at-private-hospitals-to-screen-covid-suspects-a-non-starter-for-lack-of-protective-gear/articleshow/74836714.cms

284,['27/03/2020'],Kabul attack: Two victims were from Ludhiana,"Pall of gloom had descended on the families after they had heard the news

LUDHIANA: Even as the news of deadly gurdwara attack in Kabul is yet to sink in, the families of two Ludhiana-based victims are worried about how they will get the bodies to India amid lockdown in the entire world.

Shankar Singh of Chawni Mohalla and Jeevan Singh of Karabara area in Ludhiana were among 23 killed in terrorist attack at a gurudwara in Afghanistan capital on Wednesday.

The families are in touch with the district administration and are completing documents to shifting the bodies to India.

Pall of gloom had descended on the families after they had heard the news.

“The brutal act was a murder of humanity and those who did it committed great injustice to us. Even as the family of Jeevan Singh is here, my sister-in-law Keemti Kaur (wife of Shankar Singh) is in Kabul. She is managing things there. She told me that she will get the body of her husband by 4 pm today and is getting paper work done for transferring of bodies to India in a special plane,” said Sunny Chawla , a dyeing unit owner and brother-in-law of Keemti Kaur.

“I had called the deputy commissioner who assured us that after we get complete documents from there, he will give us the authority to get the bodies from Delhi and then two or three persons can travel in ambulance and get the bodies from Delhi airport,” he said.

Sikandar Singh, another relative of the deceased, said they will get the bodies cremated here only. He said his maternal uncles Sher Singh and Lota had miraculous escape in the terrorist attack and suffered only minor injuries.

Relative of Shankar Singh said he had gone to Kabul about nine years ago to run cloth business. He said he used to do service in the gurdwara daily for about one-and-a-half hours.

“My six nephews and nieces (children of Shankar) lived with their maternal grandmother Naveen Kaur in Chawni Mohalla even as Keemti would come to see them and stay for about month. My brother-in-law had come to Ludhiana about three years ago for his daughter’s marriage in Daresi and came again when she had a divorce as her in-laws didn’t treat her well. He used to tell me that he had visited his native place as he did want to face his daughter. Now, only his body will return to India now,” Sunny said. “He was the only earning member in the family.”

A relative of Jeevan Singh, whose family is inconsolable after hearing the shocking news of his death, said the victim had told them that he would return on Baisakhi and would get one of his two daughters married. Jeevan is survived by his wife, two daughters and a seven-year-old son.

The relatives said both Shankar and Jeevan were permanent residents of Afghanistan and had learned the local language as well.

The department officials said they had identified three main locations – Haridwar city, Shyampur range and Chidiyapur range, which shares border with Uttar Pradesh. Several stranded workers have approached the patrolling teams for help as they struggle to go to their home states. Most of them could be seen at railway station and bus stand, forest officials stated, adding that they also distributed face masks, hand sanitisers and fruits.

District forest officer (DFO) of Haridwar Akash Verma told TOI, “A lot of people are stranded in Haridwar. They don’t have much support. So, we have asked our patrolling team to feed these people. Not only that, we directed them to provide food for the stray dogs too. This is our own initiative and we appeal to the people to come forward and support the poor and the needy.”

“The district administration is constantly trying to move them to safer areas in the city. Haridwar has a large migrant population and all of them now need our support,” the DFO added.

Meanwhile, there were reports of overcharging and hoarding from some areas in the district with people alleging that fruits, vegetables and daily essentials like rice, wheat flour, cooking oil etc were being sold at more than normal prices in some areas.

287,['27/03/2020'],Shivraj cabinet expansion may get deferred till April 15 due to corona scare,"Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan

BHOPAL: The newly-formed cabinet expansion of the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led BJP government may get delayed till April 15 due to the Covid-19 lockdown. The government, which was formed due to a split in Congress, might face a major challenge during the cabinet formation in a bid to manage the cards of keeping BJP loyalists together and also convincing the 22 MLAs from the Jyotiraditya Scindia faction.

“Covid-19 is the biggest challenge and priority before us. Cabinet may form within the next week or ten days,” said senior BJP leader Narottam Mishra.

The entire exercise is as challenging as the coronavirus outbreak, which if done smartly could lead to smooth functioning of the government.

Sources disclosed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked all states to tackle Covid-19 as their first and foremost priority. His instructions to completely lockdown the country for a period of 21-days was also endorsed by former Union minister Scindia, who has a crucial role to play in the formation of the state cabinet.

“Requesting everyone to conform to the lockdown. Let’s break the chain of this deadly virus. This is the biggest challenge before us,” said Scindia, on a social media post on Thursday. He further tweeted, “I am aware of the problems caused to the public due to the coronavirus scare and lockdown. But, Modiji has appealed to maintain social distancing and that is why I am not able to come before you.”

Scindia loyalist MLAs have also asked the state government to ensure proper supply of essential items in their respective constituencies from where they will be contesting in the bypolls in the next six months. “The government must ensure proper supply of essential items in the constituencies so that the poor and needy get relief,” former health minister and MLA from Sanwer, Tulsi Silawat, told the media.

Interestingly, after Covid-19, the biggest attention of MLAs is towards the cabinet formation and how chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan convinces the BJP MLAs along with the 22 former legislators who joined the saffron party. Sources said, initially there was plan to adjust two leaders as deputy ministers (Tulsi Silawat and Narottam Mishra) and elevate 10 MLAs as cabinet ministers.

But, before the allotment of berths, both BJP and Scindia faction MLAs will have to decide on the distribution of assembly seats in different regions.

In the Gwalior-Chambal region, three heavyweights — Imrati Devi, Pradyuman Singh Tomar and Mahendra Singh Sisodia have kept their fingers crossed. They were ministers in the Congress government. But, new names have also emerged such as Adal Singh Kansana, who could challenge Narottam Mishra or Yashodhara Raje Scindia, who are already tipped to get a cabinet berth. BJP stalwarts Arvind Bhadoria, who trounced Congress leader Hemant Katare and played an important role in bringing the Scindia faction leaders is also seeking a berth in the cabinet. The total number can go up to 7 seats from the region.

Similarly, in Bundelkhand, BJP has five strong contenders. Among the rebels, Govind Singh Rajput is the only one minister from this region. But from BJP, Gopal Bhargava, Bhupendra Singh, former chief minister Uma Bharti’s nephew Rahul Lodhi, Harishankar Khatik and Brijendra Pratap Singh are strong claimants for cabinet berths. Except Lodhi, others had been in the cabinet in the previous Shivraj government.

In the Vindhya region, there are as many as seven leaders who can stake a claim in the cabinet. The only rebel is Bisahulal Singh, while BJP has a long list including Rajendra Shukla, Nagendra Singh, Narayan Tripathi, Girish Gautam, Sharadendu Tiwari, Kedarnath Shukla and Meena Singh. Rajendra Shukla, Nagendra Singh and Meena Singh have served as ministers before. Sharadendu’s claim is strong since he trounced Congress stalwart Ajay Singh Rahul.

In the Mahakaushal region, there are four names in the fray. Gaurishankar Bisen, Ajay Vishnoi, Sanjay Pathak and Jalam Singh Patel were ministers in previous Shivraj government. Pathak is a strong claimant since he played a major role in bringing the Congress rebels to BJP. Jalam Singh Patel is the brother of Union minister Prahlad Patel, who had also been inducted in the Shivraj ministry earlier.

In the Madhya Bharat region, BJP will have to adjust seven ministers, including Surendra Patwa, Vishwas Sarang, Rampal Singh and Kamal Patel — who had been cabinet ministers. Besides, Sitasharan Sharma is also a strong claimant for a cabinet berth. Two MLAs — Rameshwar Sharma and Vishnu Khatri are also strong contenders from Bhopal district, though Scindia confidant and former education minister in the Kamal Nath government — Prabhuram Chaudhary will definitely get a cabinet berth.

The Malwa-Nimar region, which was left unattended during the previous BJP regime due to internal differences among leaders, has as many as 10 contenders for cabinet posts.

Scindia confidant Tulsi Silawat is believed to be a frontrunner for the deputy CM’s post. MLAs Vijay Shah and Paras Jain will also stake their claims. Besides, Nina Verma, wife of former Union minister Vikram Verma , Kailash Vijayvargiya’s close confidant Ramesh Mendola, former Indore mayor Malini Gaur, Usha Thakur, Yashpal Singh Sisodia, Rajendra Pandey and Om Prakash Saklecha are some of the strong claimants.

Scindia supporters Hardeep Singh Dang and Rajvardhan Singh Dattigaon are also claimants. If all of them are considered, the new government will have more than 50 contenders for cabinet berths and selecting 30 among these is definitely going to be a hard nut to crack for chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan.

288,['27/03/2020'],Kolkata: Scant supply pushes up prices towards evening,"KOLKATA: Irregular supply to city markets has led to a fluctuation in the prices of staples and vegetables. With stocks depleting fast, prices of commodities are soaring as the day is progressing. In the morning, prices of commodities cooled a bit with police easing the movement of goods vehicles. But the supply was less than the demand, induced by panic buying of consumers.

Most of the shops selling rice remained shut on Thursday as stocks dried up. Grocery stores across the city wore an empty look.Arun Ghosh of Annapurna Bhandar in Kidderpore said, “There was no point in keeping my store open as I am yet to replenish my stock.” Another shopowner from College Street market said: “Since there is no vehicle to ferry items from the wholesale markets and neighbouring districts, there is a scarcity. Suppliers said that lorry drivers are scared of the police. We opened our shops, but essentials are not available.”

Another issue plaguing the markets was the absence of workers. Ingredients like flour, oil, sugar and rice come from Burrabazar and Posta haats that are shut because of lack of workers. “Many of them have gone back to their homes in the districts. Others are not able to come as there are no trains and buses,” said Biswanath Agarwal, general secretary of the Posta Merchants’ Association.

The supply of perishable items improved a bit on Thursday. But prices spiked in the evening with the steady depletion of stock. Besides, there was very little supply of fish and chicken in the market.

Potato, which started selling at Rs 20 a kg, rose to Rs 30-Rs 35 in the evening. Most vegetable prices soared like this. However, there was some good news as well. Onions, potatoes and green vegetables were available in huge quantities. But police did not allow anybody to set up stalls outside the markets to sell the fresh produce.

Indore reported nine positive cases in past two days and one death so far.CMHO Dr Praveen Jadia said, “Indore district has directly jumped to a stage somewhere between second and third stage. There are four stages of COVID-19 or coronavirus infection.”The health department had been screening international passengers since January 29. We have tested samples of any person found with symptoms, said Jadia. However, no person was tested positive for Stage-1. The positive cases only began appearing in district from Tuesday, said Jadia. There were many among the positive cases, who do not have any travel history and are unable to give details of contact history with any infected persons , added Jadia.Positive cases have travel history of countries affected with coronavirus infection. At this stage there is no spread of the disease locally.There is a local area of infected persons. At this stage, the infected persons usually are acquaintances, relatives or family members of person infected by travelling in an affected country.Fewer people are affected, source of virus is known and is therefore easier to perform contact tracing and contain spread via self-quarantiningIn this stage those who have not been exposed to an infected person or anyone, who has a travel history to affected countries are tested positive.In other words, people are unable to identify where they might have picked up the virus from. Unfortunately for Indore, there are a few cases similar to this stage.This stage is the worst, where it becomes an epidemic. It becomes impossible to control and contain the spread of infection.

The residents have decided to supply food items to all the families that are in need of help by creating food packets, which will include daily essentials and other food items. “We have contacted shopkeepers and asked them to pack essentials such as rice, flour, pulses, milk powder oils etc. in packets. We have also identified around 50 eminent people and activists to make lists of the families living across the town who will need help,” said Rushir Sah, a resident and owner of a restaurant.

The people who have been identified include Nainital MLA, nagar palika chairman, ward members among others. They have been asked to contact people living in their area and identify the families who need to be supplied food packets. “We have estimated that around a thousand such families live in Nainital. They have come from places such as neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal while some of the daily wagers have also come from Nepal. They have no food and are also short of cash. Therefore, it is necessary that people with means should come together and help them,” Sah said.

The initiative has also gained support from many schools as well the hotel association of Nainital. Sah added that he has already received around Rs 1.5 lakh as donation to help the families stuck in Nainital.

""We need around Rs 4 lakh to supply the first batch of packets and I have already received around Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, people are also donating money to the people tasked with identification of poor families. Therefore, we think that the target will be achieved every easily,"" he said.

The residents have decided that they will start delivering the food packets to families within a day or two and the deliveries will be done during the three-hour window already provided by the administration.

Meanwhile, the Nainital district administration has said that it is the responsibility of the employers to provide food and assistance to poor families and daily wagers who were employed by them and are stuck in the area because of the lockdown. The administration, in a meeting late on Wednesday decided that the employers will be charged if any labourer dies of hunger.

NEW DELHI: In urgent measures to ramp up medical capacity to tackle any sharp rise in Covid-19 cases, the government is considering facilitating fifth-year MBBS students and retired but practising doctors to help in managing patients, if necessary.The health ministry and the Board of Governors in Supersession of Medical Council of India (BoG-MCI) is looking at senior medical students being given provisional permit to practise and manage Covid-19 cases, sources said. The suggestions include allowing doctors in vital disciplines like anaesthesiology, pulmonology, cardiology and radiology who are waiting to appear for the final exam with a “Board Eligible” degree so that they assist in medi cal management.They could get “Board Certified” degree later after passing the exam. There are around 50,000 such specialist doctors who can play a key role in critical care if the number of hospitalisation cases increases in the coming weeks.The proposal also includes relaxing norms and giving temporary licence to those who have pursued medical education from foreign universities in Russia and China and are waiting to clear MCI’s eligibility test. Such doctors can be allowed to work in hospitals under senior doctors to tackle the current situation.Health minister Harsh Vardhan is understood to have asked Niti Aayog member V K Paul, who also heads the BoG-MCI, to review the proposal, sources in the ministry said. The proposal is crucial as it has the potential to address the shortage of doctors, mainly specialists in the country. Such doctors, along with nurses and paramedics, are absolutely essential to tackle any community spread of the disease.Though India’s strategy against Covid-19 is focused on breaking the chain of transmission, there are concerns over a rise in mortality and the need for ramped up infrastructure to tackle the menace. Around 17 states have started working at dedicated Covid -19 hospitals. Besides, the government has also earmarked beds for isolation and treatment of Covid-19 patients in both public and private hospitals.Currently, there are 119 public laboratories under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) capable of conducting 12,000 Covid-19 tests every day.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74838160,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-193323,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-mulls-roping-in-5th-year-med-students-retired-doctors-to-fight-virus/articleshow/74838162.cms

RAJKOT: A Rajkot-based company has taken up the task of manufacturing ventilators in bulk, looking at the massive demand in hospitals across the country where Covid-19 patients are being treated.

A meeting of various stakeholders was held at the Rajkot collector’s office two days ago under the leadership of Rahul Gupta, a special coordination officer appointed for coronavirus and former collector of Rajkot.

The need for hand sanitizers, personal protective equipment (PPE) kit, and ventilator has risen massively with the spread of the virus and hospitals nation-wide are reeling under the shortage of supply of these essential medical equipment. The meeting was called to explore the possibility of mass production of these medical equipment at local level.

According to sources, Jyoti CNC, a leading Rajkot-based company in CNC manufacturing machines in India, has shown willingness to manufacture ventilators. The company is one of the top manufactures of computerized numerical control (CNC) machining used to make various factory tools.

When contacted, chairman and managing director of the company, Prakramsinh Jadeja said, “We are not experts in producing ventilators but looking at the current demand in the country, we are planning to develop this equipment. We will take help of experts in the manufacture and design of the equipment. First we will start with five to 10 pieces, and if we are successful, we will go in for mass production.”

According to company officials, it is premature to talk about the cost of the equipment at this moment.

Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary, health & family welfare said, said that Jyoti CNC has agreed to manufacture 1,000 ventilators for the state government to rise up to any emergency challenge that Covid-19 may pose in the state.

This facility with two furnaces was set up in 1995 to cremate unclaimed bodies. The decision was taken to avoid a repeat of the 10-hour delay that authorities faced after stiff resistance from locals and Nimtala burning ghat staff in cremating the 57-year-old who had died of the disease.

The KMC health department indicated that the crematorium situated on the municipal solid waste dump ground complex was ideal for cremating Covid-19 victims as the neighbourhood is sparsely populated and there would be no objections. A source said the operator of the electric furnaces was on Thursday asked to ensure both the units were serviced and ready for operation. Usually, one furnace is operational and the other is on standby.

An official said the civic body’s electrical wing had agreed to hand over the crematorium to the health department for the next couple of months. “The health department will take a final call in case a Covid-19 patient has to be cremated,” he said. The civic body’s health department has also decided not to allow entry of more than three family members of a Covid-19 victim at the time of cremation, a KMC source said.

The state health department must prepare the KMC staffers at Dhapa to handle bodies. “They have to be trained on the standard precautions for hygiene, use of masks and gloves. The rules allow relatives to see the body for one last time by unzipping only the face end of the body bag. Only those religious rituals are allowed that do not require touching the body.

“No one is allowed to bath, kiss or hug the body. The cremation staff and family members should follow hand hygiene measures after the cremation. The ash does not pose any risk. Large gatherings at the crematorium should be avoided as a social distancing measure,” a health department official.

However, a city-based doctor said that the circular is confusing and violates guidelines issued by the Government of India and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).In a circular dated March 23, the MMC refers to the current situation regarding Covid-19 , the possibility of community transmison and the circulars issued by the health ministry, Government of India and ICMR to avoid crowding of OPDs and avoiding venturing out of one’s residence. It allows registered medical practitioners (RMPs) to give telephonic consultations and send prescriptions online during the ongoing emergency phase.However, it states that the RMPs should provide the treatment only for minor ailments, routine follow-ups, and for patients whose medical histories are known to the RMPs. It restrains the RMPs from prescribing injectables or prescribing clinically suspected Covid-19 cases.According to Avinash Deshpande, an Aurangabad-based doctor, the circular is unnecessary because the state government has asked all private hospitals to keep their OPDs open. “Has the MMC received the government’s nod on this circular? It is not clear how the RMP will know that the patient is clinically suspected Covid-19 case. What is the legal definition of a minor ailment? When the court of law has disallowed online consultation, by what jurisdiction or power has the MMC overruled it?” Deshpande asked.Incidentally, on March 25, the board of directors of the Medical Council of India issued guidelines on use telemedicine by RMPs. It states that the professional judgment of an RMP should be the guiding principle for all telemedicine consultations.When asked about the circular, MMC president Shivkumar Utture said clear-cut guidelines on who can be given consultation, the type of ailments covered in telephonic consultation and the process of giving prescription to the patient is in black and white. “The idea behind the circular is that patients should not be crowding the OPDs of doctors’ clinics. In a usual OPD, it is not possible to follow the 3m distance rule,” Utture said. He added that most routine patients of the doctors are elderly and it is advised that they should stay indoors.Utture said the circular has been issued with the permission of the deputy director of health services and the Directorate of Medical Education and Research Maharashtra.Kuldeepsing Raul, the former president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Aurangabad branch, said though it is not advisable to use telemedicine generally, the ongoing situation is an unprecedented scenario and that is why the exception has been made and IMA has also endorsed it.",aurangabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/doc-questions-mmcs-online-consultation-circular/articleshow/74838100.cms
306,['27/03/2020'],Trichy: Ban on liquor sale leaves alcoholics in deep distress,"Representative image

TRICHY: The ban imposed on sale of liquor during the three weeks of curfew over Covid-19 has forced alcohol dependents to look for ways to overcome their craving.

Curfew from Monday evening led to the closure of all Tasmac-run wine shops attached with bars as well as bars in restaurants across the state. As the ban has stopped alcohol availability for addicts as well as dependents, they have started experiencing withdrawal symptoms in the past three days.

“It is going to be a big issue. Three days of non-alcoholic state will lead to withdrawal symptoms such as pneumonia, violence and aggression. Our de-addiction centre has been witnessing such cases for the past few days,” said director of Athma Hospitals in Trichy and psychiatrist Dr K Ramakrishnan.

Stating that such people would turn violent and take extreme steps, Dr Ramakrishnan however said addicts can overcome this condition by keeping themselves under control for at least a week. However, the doctor was apprehensive that such people may procure liquor through illegal means or get hold of other substances like marijuana.

Quoting surveys, Dr Ramakrishnan said India had 27% of alcohol abuse or social drinkers and 5% of dependents. Those with withdrawal symptom would usually visit the general physician who will in turn refer them to the de-addiction centres. Due to Covid-19 scare, de-addiction centres are also screening patients with alcohol withdrawal symptoms before admitting them for treatment.

Consultant psychiatrist at Kauvery Hospitals in Chennai Dr Yamini Kannappan says that 5% to 10% of alcohol dependents can have a severe withdrawal called delirious tremens marked by complete shakiness and sometimes fits. “The severity of the alcohol withdrawal depends upon how long the person has been drinking and how much. The symptom will occur six hours after the last drink and will be worst at 24 hours to 72 hours,” said the doctor while insisting on the need for more de-addiction centres to tackle such cases that could present a second health crisis after Covid-19 outbreak.

Clinical psychologist D Randeep Rajkumar of Trichy says the reward system in the brain won’t work due to withdrawal of alcohol and it will only result in depression for them. “They will become irritated and angry. They cannot concentrate on anything; they will even break things,” he said.

The psychologist suggests such people consume raw vegetable like carrot, cabbage, gooseberry, bitter gourd soup etc since such things are rich in sour taste which will prevent the body from becoming dry. “If the level is maintained, they can get rid of the symptoms. Breathing exercise will help them get over tension and irritability,” said Randeep.

Dr Yamini also asked people taking alcohol to get rid of their anxiety triggered by social distancing, isolation, not meeting friends and being locked down for three weeks. “We should not take self-medication to relieve anxiety,” she said.

The order has instructed Muslims to offer prayers at home and not to gather in mosques for the Friday prayers. “Jamia Nizamia has issued a fatwa stating that despite high significance attached to Friday prayers in Islam, great importance is also given to the preservation of human life. Islam asks Muslims not to become a cause of harm to anyone. The vice-chancellor of Jamia Nizamia advised all the devout to offer namaz at home and not to gather in mosques even on Fridays,” the CEO said in the order.

The board order stated that keeping in mind the Shariah guidelines, Muslims have been advised to offer Friday prayers at home.

“As per the central and the state governments’ orders, a few people, not more than five, can gather in mosques and offer Friday prayers with a short sermon, so that mosques are not deprived of prayers,” the order stated.

The board, which controls mosques and other Muslim endowments in the state, maintained that its instructions should be strictly adhered to.

Waqf Board member and senior advocate Waheed Ahmed said in view of the current medical and health threat with respect to Covid-19 around the globe, it has become mandatory to follow the guidelines issued by WHO and other such organisations. “The same was advised by Prophet Muhammed 1450 years ago, to nullify plague. There are sayings of the prophet as recorded in Bukhari Shariff and Muslim Shariff, two great Islamic books, that instruct people to maintain quarantine. The prophet said that if you hear of a plague in a land, then do not go to it. If it happens in a land where you are, then do not travel out of it,” Ahmed told TOI.

308,['27/03/2020'],"Goa CM Pramod Sawant relents, allows stores to open with distancing norms","PANAJI: Relenting to public pressure that even saw a PIL being filed in the high court, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Thursday — day two of the national lockdown — permitted grocery stores, vegetable vendors and milk centres to open from Friday.Even as he allowed shops to stay open 24x7 if needed,Sawant warned people of the consequences and appealed to them to maintain social distancing and not roam around with their vehicles.The central government ordered lockdown will continue to be operational in toto, Sawant said.Goa police urged people not to bring their vehicles to shops as that would hinder forming of queues and social distancing norms. “Legal action will be taken for violating these directions under MV Act and relevant provisions of IPC. This would be strictly enforced and vehicles may be impounded if required,” Inspector General of Police Jaspal Singh said.He said that they “also expect public to maintain safe distance from one another while standing in queue”.“It pains me (to relax the lockdown) because I know what repercussions it can have on my people,” Sawant said, alerting the public that there are as many as 2,500 people who have come into Goa who are not cooperating with police and health authorities about home quarantining.“The government should not be held responsible if coronavirus starts spreading in Goa on a large scale as we wanted 100% lockdown to prevent people from coming in contact with each to curb the spread of the disease,” he said.Not only had the opposition lashed out at the state government for failing to put a system in place to provide essential commodities to people during the lockdown, but the pressure had mounted from citizens, too.After a citizen approached the high court over the issue, the advocate general assured the court that by Thursday evening all steps would be taken to ensure supply of essentials to the peopleThe petitioner, a high court advocate, said the state government has gone against central government guidelines by keeping grocery shops shut and had prayed that the state government comply with the central guidelines or put in place a system for essentials to reach the people.The chief minister said that his decision to open stores was because he received several complaints from the public about insufficient supply of essential commodities following the state announced total lockdown.Sawant said that though he and his government had started receiving flak on social media for strict measures put in place he was “ready to face criticism in the interest of the health of the people” and the decision to open shops was in deference to “people’s sentiments”.“Understanding peoples’ sentiments, the state government has taken a decision to open grocery shops, milk centres and vegetable vendors. Even shopkeepers can keep their stores open 24x7,” the chief minister said while appealing to people to cooperate with the police during the lockdown.Each person has to be responsible for his and his family’s health. “We cannot tell from where and whom coronavirus will be transmitted.”During the period March 22 to March 26 the state government has home quarantined nearly 1,500 persons, Sawant said. He requested those under home observation to refrain from venturing. “But it looks like they are moving around villages across Goa and interacting with people,” he said, a subtle warning to the populace to stay alert to contamination.Sawant said that persons who have been home quarantined had come to Goa from places where several positive cases have been reported.“After we contacted municipalities, local panch members and other authorities, we learnt that nearly 2,500 people who have come to Goa either from outside the state or the country have not been stamped as home quarantined. Police and medical officer have gone to their places, but they are not willing to cooperate with them and it is a serious issue,” Sawant said.Three positive cases were detected on Wednesday and more than 100 people have been quarantined at the facilities created by the government.“Being a touristic state, many people may even have travelled from Goa and there could be more positive cases. One of the patients we have found is asymptomatic, but he could be carrier of the coronavirus spreading it to others,” Sawant said, adding that this is why after understanding all of this he had called for a 100% lockdown.If we had to keep grocery story, milk and vegetable open then almost all of Goa would have taken to the streets, he said.He said that 35 closed contacts of the three positive cases have been placed at isolation centres already.“We are making all efforts to identify each and every persons who has come in contact with them and place them in isolation,” Sawant said.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74842038,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-365870,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-relents-allows-stores-to-open-with-distancing-norms/articleshow/74837990.cms

In a retweeted video of KMC road-sweeping trucks rolling along Sarat Bose Road, Bachchan wrote: “Wow! This is fantastic…hello Mumbai. Can the authorities do this for us as well”.

The vehicles in the video were pressed into service by the KMC in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. They are being used to clean and sweep roads and are also spraying disinfectants at a time when manual cleaning has turned difficult due to the lockdown.

The vehicles, called ‘sweeping-cum-washing trucks’ were first bought by the KMC from Germany a few years ago. Now, they are locally manufactured and procured by the KMC. They are fitted with a collecting bucket that collects the trash which is emptied in dump yards.

Some of these vehicles are also fitted with sprinklers that can spray both water and cleaning chemicals. Over the last two days, the KMC has used the trucks on 25-30 roads, including Harish Mukherjee Road, Sarat Bose Road, Chittaranjan Avenue, Alipore Road and JL Nehru Road.

The ministry had earlier communicated to the nationalized banks about the stoppage of 7% agriculture jewel loans and revocation of interest subvention and prompt repayment incentive to the farmers. Banks were also advised not to sanction prompt repayment incentive to farmers, if the loans were availed after October 1, 2019. This apart, the rate of interest for jewel loan was also enhanced to 9.9% from 7%.

Farmers have demanded the government to revoke the order to allow them to avail agriculture jewel loan at 7% interest with prompt repayment incentive of 3%.

Earlier, farmers were given jewel loan for an interest rate of 7%. If anyone repaid the loan promptly within the stipulated period, they will get 3% prompt repayment incentive.

Meanwhile, considering the unprecedented situation prevailing in the country on account of increasing incidence of Covid-19 infection and consequent lockdown, the Union government is considering the possibility of extending the benefit of interest subvention and prompt repayment incentive to short term agriculture crop loans due between March 20, and June 30 this year, if the loans are repaid by June 30, official sources said.

The farming community in the delta region has welcomed the Union government’s decision on revoking the earlier order with regard to the extension of the benefit of interest subvention and incentive, said N Veerasekaran, state spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Sangam.

The entire loan amount availed by the farmers irrespective of co-operative or nationalized banks should be waived off, secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association Swamimalai S Vimalnathan said.

Indore seems to be turning out to Madhya Pradesh’s Covid-19 hotspot with 13 cases detected in just two days – accounting for half of the state’s 26 cases.

Three of Indore’s new patients are from Ranipura – the locality where the 65-year-old who died on Thursday lived. Two of them are girls, aged 14 and 18 – making them the youngest Covid-19 patients in Madhya Pradesh. They have been admitted to MY Hospital.

The third, a 41-year-old man, is admitted to CHL Hospital. And the fourth patient, a 53-year-old, is from Limbodi area. “Both are men, who don’t have any travel or contact history. I am gathering details of the female patients,” said MGM Medical College PRO Dr Rahul Rokade.

The entire state is in lockdown and curfew is in force in five cities – Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur, Gwalior and Ujjain.

The Shivpuri patient had arrived from Hyderabad recently and posted a video on social media, saying “he feels he has symptoms of Covid-19”. He urged officials to get him tested. The administration took note of the video and sent a team to check.

He was put in home quarantine and swab samples taken, which came back positive on Thursday.

He was immediately shifted to a hospital isolation ward where Shivpuri district’s first Coronavirus patient is also being treated. His family members have been put on home quarantine and are being observed.

In Gwalior, officials were shocked when railway officials informed them that around 590 people have boarded a goods train at Mathura and reached Gwalior railway station.

When the train did not stop, they started shouting and the Gwalior stationmaster got the train to stop.

“Majority of these people were from Bhind and Morena districts. They were daily labourers who got stranded. We ensured proper screening and also gave them food. The administration of their districts have made arrangements to take them home,” Gwalior division commissioner M B Ojha told TOI.

“Exodus from nearby districts both inwards and outwards is seen in great numbers, we are ensuring proper testing of each and every individual,” he added.

Officials of Bhind and Morena districts sent teams to take them home. “They are being brought back. Some buses are still en route to Morena. About 200 of the 590 people were from Morena,” collector Priyanka Das told TOI. She added, “This is an issue in the district, but local people are responding and informing about any such possible suspect patients.”

In Morena district, Congress MLA from Sabalgarh, Baijnath Kushwaha, his driver, gunman, and family members have been put in home isolation, though he doesn’t have any symptoms. He was at the press conference in Bhopal on March 20, which was attended by a journalist who has turned out to be Covid-positive.

Officials said the condition of the six patients in Jabalpur is stable.

He reached Delhi on March 12 and took a Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation bus from Dhaula Kuan to Jaipur.The Ramganj resident got down from the bus at Ghat Gate in the afternoon and hired a rickshaw to his home in Ramganj.Since there has been a gap of 14 days since his arrival, the health department is finding it difficult to identify the passengers who travelled with him and screen them.

When asked, Rajaram who was accompanying the vendors at Vrindavan Nagar , Abhinav Homes and Comfort colonies said they thought since it was curfew and people are not allowed to go out of their homes, they decided to deliver vegetables to homes. The veggies are sourced from the nearby farms and are fresh, he said.

While doing so, they are also maintaining the call for social distancing and not allowing customers to crowd the vehicle and touch the vegetables. “It is an extraordinary situation, we are discouraging people from touching the veggies, instead we are picking them what they want,” he said.

Meanwhile, the lockdown was complete in Piplani, Sonagiri, Ayodhya Nagar and Ayodhya By-pass areas. Chemists and druggists were open in the morning and late evening hours and so were select grocery stores. Like in the last couple of days, there was no crowding at these stores.

The weekly vegetable market at Piplani was suspended while milk supply remained uninterrupted.

Police personnel posted at all junctions found less number of people in the city as a police team near the central bus stand heaved a sigh of relief on Thursday saying they were exhausted of advising people to stay indoors.

In some parts of the city there was unwanted movement of people on bikes and cars. Such people were arrested and released on bail besides seizing their vehicles for disobedience to lawful order, negligent act likely to spread infectious disease, disobedience to quarantine under the Indian Penal Code, Epidemic Diseases Act and Tamil Nadu Public Health Act and Motor Vehicles Act.

Commissioner of police V Varadharaju said that people into medical, vegetable and groceries, municipal water supplies, public distribution system and milk profession were exempted from prosecution. “The violations have come down today compared to yesterday. We have imposed fine ranging from Rs 100 to Rs 500 against the violators from today,” he told TOI.

The situation was similar in Trichy rural, Ariyalur , Perambalur, Karur, Pudukottai , Thanjavur , Tiruvarur and Nagappattinam districts in the central region. As of 6pm on Thursday, 439 people were arrested in 384 cases and 265 vehicles including two four wheelers were seized from Trichy rural and the seven districts. On Wednesday, the police arrested 850 people in 651 cases and seized 459 vehicles including 20 four wheelers.

A case against a quarantined man in Perambalur was also one of the cases. “A quarantined man went out and returned home. So, he was also booked,” central zone IG A Amalraj told TOI this evening.

Images of such notices are also being circulated on social media with posts like, “Dekho mere ghar ke paas corona positive case hai.”Senior lawyer Vineet Godha , has written a letter to the chief minister to take cognizance of the issue, which is adding to the woes of quarantined people. “There are over 2000 such notices. The language used in such notices should be changed as it is creating confusion,” he said. The lawyer said that his son and wife had returned from England on March 16.“Though my son had a little fever after his return, he is fully fit now. I had informed the administration about it and immediately quarantined both my wife and son. Instead of medically examining my son, I was asked by the administration to SMS my address. Ten days after his return and informing the administration, two persons approached me on March 24 and asked about their passport details. On March 25 night a notice of COVID-19 was pasted outside my home,” wrote Godha in his letter.The notice also mention that quarantine period will be from March 25 to March 15. In fact, almost all the notices pasted in Bhopal mention the same quarantine period, irrespective of people’s travel history .Godha said that there is nothing wrong in pasting notice, but it should not be misleading. “ When we contacted the administration on March 16, we wanted to tell them about the people who had visited him but it did not happen and defeated the very concern raised by the PM,” he said.Such notices can be seen in Arera colony, BHEL, Ayodhya bypass and Saket Nagar.The office of the district collector told TOI, “Yes all these are not COVID-19 cases, but we consider them as suspects.

Every vendor will be made to sit at a safe distance from one another and markings have also been done for customers to stand in queue and buy vegetables. Superintendent of police Abhinav Deshmukh has announced that security will be provided for grocery and vegetable shops that will remain open for 24x7 till April 14.

Talking about the initiative taken by the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC), civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti said, “We have set up as many as 33 vegetable stalls in the city at initial level and have ensured that all residents will have access to these shops. The local vendors have been roped in for the work. We have ensured that there is sufficient supply of vegetables to these stalls. We will increase the number of stalls in the next few days.”

Vinay Hasabnis, a resident of Rajarampuri said, “We thank the civic administration for setting up a vegetable market in our area where there was no crowd and people were following the rules of social distancing. I bought vegetables without any rush. Variety of vegetables were available in the market at reasonable rates. We had expected that the rates may rise due to sudden country-wide lockdown but that was not the case.”

Yuvraj Gaikwad, a vegetable vendor in Rankala bus stand area, said, “We are getting adequate supply of vegetables from the suppliers at the APMC. We have been shifted to a new place from the existing markets and the flow of customers continued throughout the day. So far, there is no shortage of vegetables.”

Guardian minister Satej Patil said, “We have asked the government agencies to gather information about the availability of cold storages in the district and if necessary we will acquire them. Vegetables can be stored in these cold storages and can be supplied to the customers as per requirement. This will help us in keeping the flow of vegetable supply in the market normal and put a check on price rise. We are also planning to make seating arrangements for farmers who are coming to the city to sell vegetables in Tapowan area. This will make their commute easy and people in that area will also get to buy fresh vegetables.”

Meanwhile, Deshmukh said that people are coming out of houses to buy vegetables and grocery as they fear these commodities will not be available to them due to lockdown.

“This was making the vegetable markets crowded. We have convinced the people that there will not be shortage of any essential commodity till the lockdown ends. To ensure that people get enough vegetables and grocery, we are ready to keep the markets open 24x7.”

PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has identified 67 locations across the city for delivery of vegetables during the ongoing lockdown.

A list of farmers’ groups has been drawn up to deliver vegetables at these places.

The civic body has said the new system will start functioning in two days. The civic body will upload the details of locations and farmers’ groups on its website for citizens.

Citizens are expected to register their demand for vegetables using the contact details of a farmers’ group attached to the nearest location for delivery.

Deputy commissioner Madhav Jagtap said, “The chart which will be available on the website, contains the location with the details of the ward where it is located, the name of a farmers’ group that will deliver the farm produce at that location and the contact details of the group. Any individual or housing society can register their demand with the farmers’ group.”

A proposal to introduce a system for doorstep delivery of vegetables was discussed in the last few days. The initiative is being executed by the PMC, the state agriculture department and the farmers’ groups.

A PMC official said most areas of the city are covered under the initiative. A ward-wise approach for delivery of vegetables will restrict citizens’ trips to Mahatma Phule Mandai and other places for vegetables.

The locations identified are familiar to the citizens of the area as most are places where the weekly farmer’s markets are hosted.

While deliveries are expected to take place at these locations, it will be up to the farmers’ groups and citizens to finalize how and where they will be picked up within the area. The farmers’ groups and residents can mutually decide the payments which can be processed online as per convenience or after the vegetables are delivered.

The PMC said it would not be responsible for the quality and prices of vegetables since the supply would come directly from farmers’ groups.

330,['27/03/2020'],"Cough, and your neighbours might tell on you","Coimbatore: Beware of stepping out with a cold or cough , your neighbour might just rat you out. Nearly 35% of calls that the newly-introduced 1077 helpline for Covid-19 related queries gets is from people who want to complain about their neighbours with either flu symptoms or a travel history not seeking medical help or flouting quarantine rules.

The team manning the helpline say they get at least 150 such calls a day. “The helpline is manned by three shifts, so that we are available 24x7. Each shift gets at least 50 calls from people who want to alert us about neighbours with either suspicious symptoms or travel history,” says a doctor manning the helpline. “They say their neighbor has a cold or cough, or just returned from abroad, but are not quarantining themselves. If someone has both a travel history and symptoms, they start panicking.”

A public health department official says most of such calls are from urban areas such as Peelamedu, Sowripalayam, Singanallur and Puliakulam. “Most of our callers are people who live in apartments. They get paranoid that their corridors, elevators and entryways are getting contaminated by neighbours who are not quarantining themselves. These areas have a lot of apartment clusters and the residents are well off and often travel across the country and abroad.”

The helpline handlers, however, welcome these complaint calls as while they have been able to trace international travellers, they have not been able to do so in the case of domestic travellers. “Almost 25% of these calls are genuine. Since we are now monitoring inter-state travellers with symptoms, these people are being helpful. And it is important that these people isolate or room quarantine themselves properly. We also stick the quarantine sticker and poster on their houses,” the official said.

Since the callers also provide contact numbers of suspected cases, it is easy for the helpline people to ascertain facts. If the person in question has a travel history and symptoms, the team will ensure checkup by a doctor from the nearest primary health centre. They will also arrange a 108 ambulance to take the suspect to ESI Hospital or government hospital, if required.

The helpline also gets many calls from people who want to either clarify their doubts on Covid-19 or get to know whether they should get tested if they were having some of the symptoms and what they could do to prevent getting further infected.

“We also get calls asking us how many more cases are reported in the district. Some call us to complain about lockdown related issues or conservancy workers who are out with symptoms. There are others who take up issues such as gas leak and water supply issues,” said another helpline team member.

He said they would also help with contact tracing of suspected cases and following up with people who are already under quarantine. “We will have a doctor and home guard visit the 20% who doesn’t respond to our calls.”

The helpline, which has two landlines and an android phone to make video calls to check on people who are already under quarantine, is expected to get two more landline phones this week.

PUNE: Representatives of the pharmacists’ association on Thursday agreed to release a WhatsApp number for facilitating free door-step delivery of medicines to dissuade people from moving around with old prescriptions to justify their presence on the road.

Policemen enforcing the lock-down orders pointed out that vehicle users were showing them old medical prescriptions to be on the road.

Ambulances, water tankers, garbage trucks, government, army and goods vehicles were not stopped. People showing identity cards and their purpose were allowed to go.

Katraj resident Pramod Salunkhe showed a 2008 prescription at Adarsh Chowk in Kondhwa and argued with the police for stopping him. After he was let off, Salunkhe told TOI, “The police cannot question me about where I should purchase medicines from. It is my discretion.”

Kondhwa resident Saeed Mulla, carrying a 2017 prescription, told TOI at Jyoti Chowk checkpoint, “The prescription is old but the medicine is the same. I don’t feel it necessary to visit the doctor for getting a new prescription for purchasing the same medicine.”

The police, who stopped people at checkpoints at Dandekar bridge junction and Rajaram bridge on Sinhagad Road, near Alka Talkies in Deccan Gymkhana area and other places, wanted to know why nearby medical stores were not accessed and their necessity to travel to far-off places.

Joint commissioner of Pune police Ravindra Shisve told TOI, “A person in need of medicines can send his or her prescription along with the name and address to the WhatsApp number. The order so placed will be forwarded to the area distributor who will send a delivery boy to the person’s home for handing over the medicines free of charge.”

Shisve said the idea is to reduce unwanted rush at medical shops. “Senior citizens are not familiar with online apps for medicines. There is a lockdown and we are seeking a judicious balance between enforcement and facilitation. Fuel availability is being sorted out.”

The police higher-ups also met 15 representatives of online app-based food service and other online service providers such as Zomato, Swiggy and Big Basket about passes on conditions to delivery boys. “We need some time to study their movements and develop a technology for monitoring them before the passes are issued,” Shisve said.

These service providers must not fleece customers. They should sensitise their employees on maintaining cleanliness and hygiene and they should wear masks, use sanitisers and maintain social distance from their clients.

Shisve said, “We are working to ensure that each PMC ward has a vegetable outlet to reduce the rush at Market Yard in Gultekdi, Mandai and the PMC markets.”

TRICHY: A 24-year-old man who flew in from Dubai and was admitted to the isolation ward of Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH) here tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday. Public health and preventive medicine department was in the process of identifying the co-passengers of the man, the first Covid-19 case recorded in Trichy.

The information was confirmed in a tweet from health minister Dr C Vijaya Baskar in the evening. “One new # COVID-19 positive case reported from Trichy. 24 Y Male, Dubai Return at # Trichy GH. Pt in isolation & stable,” it read.

MGMGH hospital administration said he was a native of Erode district and has been to Dubai looking for a job. A bachelor, he landed at Trichy airport in the early hours of March 22. The public health and preventive medicine department official said he had symptoms of cough and fever. Hence he was isolated at MGMGH the same day.

His swab sample was taken and sent to the viral research and diagnostic laboratory (VRDL) at government medical college hospital in Tiruvarur the next day. After testing his sample, the laboratory sought to repeat the test on March 24 and it was reconfirmed at the King institute of preventive medicine and research at Guindy in Chennai. He has been kept at the intensive care unit (ICU) of the isolation ward. Doctors said his health condition was stable.

As soon as the infection was diagnosed, public health and preventive medicine department swung into action to check the list of 85 passengers who were on board the flight with the man. “We have been checking the list of his co-passengers in order to reach out to them,” said an officer.

As on Thursday evening, five patients including him were being kept at the isolation ward. A day after shifting all the 600 patients from the six- storey superspecialty block at MGMGH, the hospital administration got fire and rescue service personnel in Trichy to conduct a mass cleaning of their campus. They sprayed disinfectants using their equipment.

335,['27/03/2020'],"Here, they are on a mission to feed people under isolation","Members of the ‘Sruthi’ Kudumbashree unit at work in Parottukonam

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Sliced onions get sauteed to a golden brown tinge. Soon, Girija A steps in and a blend of powdered spices and masala is sprinkled over the softened onion slices. A few minutes later the dish takes the form of egg roast and a stack of spongy appam is readied for packing. This was the dinner for around 200 people in care homes who have been kept under isolation in the city on Thursday.

Girija and seven other women have been serving food to people brought to care homes from airport and other places since March 14. Their Kudumbasree unit ‘Sruthi’ based in Parottukonam is taking up such an initiative for the first time.

“We have collaborated with city corporation many times, but to provide food for people who are being observed for 14 days in camps is a special experience. Initially, many persons advised me not to take up this job, but I came forward and we take all precautions. Besides, these people need our support and care, they chose to remain under isolation to keep others safe,” said Girija, who has been running her team for 15 years.

She picks a menu as varied as possible. On Thursday, they served idli and sambar for breakfast followed by fried rice and chicken for lunch. On Tuesday, they served meals with fish curry and five other dishes. It is not just cooking, they have to make around 200 packets three times a day. They have barely slept for the past two weeks as breakfast needs to be readied by 6am.

“When we were told about giving food for these people, we understood that they came from different places and different backgrounds. It was not their fault that they have to stay in care homes for 14 days. We want to give them good food, because there is nothing else we can do for them. They stay away from their families in a care home and at least we can help them by giving them tasty food,” said Thankamani, another member of the team.

All of them are the sole breadwinners of their families. “These are difficult times for many people especially during this lockdown. We are grateful that we got a job to do and that too a noble one,” said Rose Mary. On the first few days, Girija and Rose Mary used to load the food packets in their Omni car and drove to each care home. Now, corporation vehicles arrive to pick the food. They also served food for the destitute, who were housed at Putharikandom on Wednesday.

From Friday onwards, they will also introduce snacks along with tea. “Till now we gave them biscuits in the evening. Now onwards we will introduce different kinds of snacks,” said Girija. Serving food three times a day along with tea for two weeks to nearly 200 people does take a toll on these women.

“We are used to working hard, if we become lazy in our work, those people would be hungry, so we would rather skip our sleep and prepare food for them,” said Thankamani.

On Thursday, the city corporation also launched the first community kitchen at Thycaud Model LP School.

The demand-supply mismatch became all the more conspicuous in the evening when prices of all essential commodities spiked. In several places, shortage of milk and bread continued.The situation could improve on Friday with merchants in Posta assuring that they will open for business on Friday. Posta Merchants’ Association general secretary Biswanath Agarwal said all wholesale shops would function from Friday onwards to revive the supply chain.But the assurance of operations in subject to availability of workforce. Wholesalers said they cannot assort and package food items without labourers, most of whom have left for their homes in neighbouring states. Posta and Burrabazar provide essential edibles to not just entire Bengal but also the neighbouring states. Even a day’s closure can impact supply in these areas and result in price escalation.Retailers, on the other hand, said they were unable to ferry food items because mini-trucks were not available. Federation of Traders (West Bengal) general secretary Tarak Nath Trivedi said lack of small goods vehicles had impacted transportation from wholesale hubs to retail markets. “Most drivers are unwilling to operate fearing police coercion and arrest. Also, many drivers and helpers have left the city for their home because they don’t have a house here and no fixed place to eat,” said Trivedi.Though the CM warned of stern action against those who impeded movement of essential commodities, complaints continued to pour in. Food and civil supplies minister Jyotipriya Mallick said he had received a few complaints and spoken to police. “There are some issues like identity of vendors that we hope to resolve shortly. We received calls from traders in Koley market about trucks carrying essential materials from districts being stopped at Burdwan and Dankuni. We called up the district police officials and ensured that these vehicles reached Kolkata,” said DC (EB) Biswajit Ghosh.“In the absence of train services, vendors are hiring vehicles to bring vegetables to the markets, if they are forced to return, it would be very difficult to bring back the supplies again during the remaining lockdown period. Their loss will be mounting, factoring in the vehicle hiring charges,” said West Bengal Vendors’ Association president Kamal Dey The state government has put all kinds of food, e-grocers and their movement and transportation in the lockdown exempt list and has said these vendors need an authorisation from the local police or administration for unrestricted movement. Police had provided two phone numbers — 9432610446 and 9874903465 — for vendors to call up if they got stuck during their movement to and from wholesale and retail markets. Joint CP (headquarters) Subhankar Sinha Sarkar said they did not receive any calls from vendors throughout the day. Police said they were fast-tracking request for authorisation letters for those involved in medicine, groceries, vegetables, fruits or are animal products delivery.During the day, cops visited several markets. “We had sent our police teams across major markets and to grocery stores to collect reports.

Amid scarcity of these medicines, many of which might be as important for critically ill patients, as food for a normal person, experts suggest doorstep delivery of some medicines. “For instance, immunosuppressive medicine should be provided to all kidney transplant patients at the doorstep under the current circumstances. While people are not even able to buy the basic medicines, it is even more difficult to get supply of immunosuppressive medicines. For transplant patients not getting these medicines, the scenario would mean death. The government needs to provide these at the doorstep,” said Dr Bhagwan Reddy,

Meanwhile, patients are facing hardships to get basic medicines, especially when movement is restricted due to the total lockdown. “I have done rounds of all medical shops in the vicinity of my house to get medicines Eliquis and Oxramet. Like me, many heart disease patients were doing rounds of shops but were turned away and now with the lockdown, it is impossible to go to other areas to check for availability,” said a patient, Sunil Reddy .

Meanwhile drug suppliers say that although medicines are available in some parts of the city, distribution has not been possible to remote areas in the city, and even distributors are expecting a shortfall soon. “The available stock will last for 7-8 days and we are expecting a shortage after that if the distribution network between states remains cut off,” said Ramesh Chandragupta, president, Chemist and Druggist Association , Telangana.

340,['27/03/2020'],"Lack of jobs, food haunts migrant labourers in Kolkata’s wholesale hub","Labourers plead for help at Burrabazar on Thursday

KOLKATA: Labourers, who form an important cog in the delivery chain of commodities, have gone jobless and don’t even have a place to eat as cops have shut down all eateries. The situation has turned so difficult for them that they are now starting to flee the city.

From assortment to packaging to delivery of items, this workforce — people from Bengal and the neighbouring states — drives the industry. These people work as drivers of goods vehicles, helpers and labourers in the wholesale hub during the day and sleep in their vehicles or on the pavement at night.

Many of them alleged that they were not finding any food to eat as cops have instructed small eateries to keep their places shut during the lockdown. A very big part of this workforce depends on small eateries that sell food at very low prices.

According to traders, many of them have started leaving the wholesale hubs to take refuge in the suburbs. “For the last two days, I have been roaming from one locality to another in search of food with police chasing us several times. We do not have homes here where we can purchase vegetables and prepare our food. ,” said Birju Paswan, who works as a helper in a goods vehicle, in Burrabazar.

On Thursday morning, TOI found close to 100 labourers almost on the verge of tears because they had run out of money and could not even go back home in Begusarai in Bihar. “We are wage labourers working in Posta, which are shut for the past two days. We have very little money left but no food is available. Cops are chasing us when we are going out to search for food. We just want to go back home now,” Pankaj Singh, one of the labourers.

Wholesalers said it was very difficult for them to keep the supply chain smooth in the absence of labourers. “We have to assort and package commodities like potatoes, onions, garlic, ginger, flour in sacks of 40-50kgs and we are talking about thousands of sacks here. It is not possible for us to do that. But we will try to do our best with the available workforce,” said Biswanath Agarwal, secretary of the Posta Merchants’ Association.

Owner of many eateries TOI spoke to said they had strict instructions from the police to not open their establishments.

The situation was further compounded by a surge in demand amidst the lockdown.Officials of LPG providers said there was no problem in supply but in almost all distribution centres, those who deliver them to doorsteps were not reporting to work owing to fear of contracting the disease.According to customers, trouble kicked off from the first day of lockdown as delivery persons found it difficult to reach the distribution centres. Entally resident Rajkumar Bhattacharya had to hire a rickshaw paying four times the actual fare to reach his LPG distributor at Padmapukur on Wednesday. “Usually, we make an online booking and the cylinder is delivered within 48 hours. When it wasn’t delivered within that time, I called up the distributor and he asked me to collect the cylinder as he did not have manpower,” said Bhattacharya.An elderly resident of New Town said he received a text message on Wednesday that read: “Due to Covid-19 epidemic spread worldwide, the LPG supply may be delayed due to non-availability of deliverymen. Kindly take self-delivery of filled LPG cylinder from our showroom/godown.”TOI on Thursday spotted 150 customers at a gas dealers’ showroom near Tobin Road where LPG cylinders were stacked up but the customers were asked to maintain 1m distance. “I have a full cylinder at home but the other cylinder I have is near empty. I came with the other cylinder to replace it with a new cylinder to ensure I don’t run out gas in case of emergency,” said Pranab Majumdar, a resident of Gopal Lal Thakur Road.LPG distributors, too, admitted to the manpower crunch. “There are around 80 distributors in Kolkata and most of them are working on a skeletal workforce. Few of them are arranging pickup and drop for the delivery people. But that is not enough. With complete restriction on trains and buses, the delivery personnel are not reporting to work and the dealers are forced to ask the customers to come and carry the cylinder home by themselves,” said Bijan Bihari Biswas, president of Indane Distributors’ Association (West Bengal).A senior official of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) said the company was witnessing a 50% surge in demand. “ LPG demand has gone up from 2.3-2.4 lakh to 3.2 lakh per day,” said Arup Das, the deputy general manager of IOC. Das explained that those with double cylinder book for a new one when he or she starts using second cylinder for 3-4 days. In the changed scenario, most of the people are booking when even the first cylinder is still running.Bharat Gas Distributor Association state president Sukomal Sen agreed with Das. “There is a spurt in booking but there is no crisis in supply. We are facing problems of delivery boys as well,” he added.According to Das, to meet the rising demand for LPG, IOC has taken all steps to increase production by optimising operations and improving LPG yield in LPG producing units like FCC/Index.On Wednesday, a TMC-affiliated truck drivers association at the Budge Budge unit had refused to ply, leading to a temporary gap in supply. But state food minister Jyotipriya Mullick intervened and brought the situation under control and the supply resumed. “I asked told the agitating drivers that they cannot cut the supply line at any cost.

Over the past one week, the two septuagenarians from Karunya Nagar have stitched and distributed more than 200 cloth masks free of cost to healthcare workers in the area, braving joint pain and long-sightedness.

It all began around 10 days ago when the coordinators and managers of NGO SEESHA were discussing how they could provide their field volunteers with protective masks, since there was a virus scare. The NGO has around 24 volunteers, who have split into two teams to create awareness on hand washing techniques, sanitation and hygiene, garbage and health waste disposal in villages in and around Karunya Nagar.

Dr Samuel Thomas, one of the NGO’s coordinators, said, “We were discussing shortage of masks in the market and the difficulties involved in travelling all the way to Coimbatore city, which is 26km away, to just buy them. That was when Jayalakshmi, an inmate in our old age home said she could stitch the masks in their free time.”

Jayalakshmi, who has been an inmate of the home for the past six years, said she had been following the coronavirus situation on television for the past one month. “I picked up one of the plastic masks and surgical masks and tried to replicate them with three layers. Once I got the hang of it, I began stitching. I stitch for around five and half hours a day.” Jayalakshmi then trained another inmate, Rukmani, to stitch the masks.

The NGO, meanwhile, encouraged the two by buying them 200 metres of cotton cloth. “In the past one week, these two women haven’t complained of joint and back pain that they usually develop when they sit at a place for too long. Lack of adequate eye sight too hasn’t been a deterrent for them to stitch 200 three ply face masks, which we have distributed to our field volunteers, healthcare staff including doctors and nurses, forest department staff, and police, among others,” Dr Thomas said.

When TOI asked Jayalakshmi about the physical strains involved in the job, she said with a smile, “The fact that I am helping the community during this crisis takes away all my pains.”

The two are assisted by two tailoring teachers. They also get help from other inmates of the old age home who cut clothes, attach ropes to the masks, fold them and hot press them neatly to disinfect them.

“The man working in my mill was on Wednesday coming from Warje, when he was beaten up by some policemen. I will request police to issue passes for the flour mills,” he said.

The police said they were only stopping people loitering on the roads without any purpose.

A grocer on Paud Road accused the police of being harsh with his men. “The stock at the shop emptied because of panic buying on Wednesday night. My men were going to the market on Thursday, when the police beat up one of them,” he said.

A police officer at the Chandni Chowk checkpoint said some people did not understand the risk involved in moving now. He said, “We urge people to stay indoors. We take stern steps only when they do not agree to do so.”

Another officer said, “We stopped a man driving towards Deccan with his son. He said he was taking his son to a doctor. But he drove down the other side within a few minutes.”

However, some good Samaritans have emerged to take care of their needs.Some residents of south Delhi’s Chittaranjan Park offered meals to the security guards, while some in Aya Nagar bought flour and other essentials for the workless daily-wage earners in their area. Chitra Mukherjee of Abarjan Samiti in B Block, Chittaranjan Park, said, “We have to be considerate of the needs of people who continue to work risking their health.”Mukherjee’s group is also helping three garbage collectors who arrive every day despite the threat to their lives. There’s no place for them to have their meals because all shops are closed. “We have made a list of people who will give them breakfast and lunch in turn,” she said. “We have also spoken to other RWAs to start similar measures.”Sanjay Gupta, director of NGO Chetna, said members cannot move around to assist street children, so they have adopted an innovative way to keep in touch with them. “We observed that at least one of every five children had a mobile phone. We send messages or videos on TikTok and keep them abreast of the situation. Before the lockdown, we had distributed masks among them,” said Gupta.Gupta added that this effort to keep in touch was even more important for children living at the railway stations and near drains, where the living conditions were worse. Many of them don’t have families so monitoring them was vital to their welfare.Besides such groups, there are also individuals who are selflessly easing the pain of economic hardship of the impoverished. Ashok Randhawa , president of South Asian Forum for People Against Terror, said he had provided food to around 700 homeless people till Wednesday. “These are the people most vulnerable to catching the viral infection because they live in the open,” said Randhawa. “Some of them were fed by the local shops, but now with everything shut down these people weren’t getting food.”Randhawa and his son cook food in the morning and go to the Sai Baba temple on Lodhi Road and to Sarojini Nagar to feed the poor. “We wore masks and gloves and asked the people who gathered to stand at a distance from each other,” he added.Ved Pal Lohia of Aya Nagar too bought flour and other essential food stuff for the labourers in the locality who have been unable to return to their villages because there is no transport available. He said that he had also spread word in his neighbourhood about the initiative so more people could join the effort to help the daily-wage workers.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74839049,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-278134,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/when-things-are-closed-but-hearts-are-open-the-other-side-of-delhi/articleshow/74837451.cms

HYDERABAD: The legal fraternity is feeling the heat of coronavirus. Worried over the plight of junior lawyers and with courts not functioning, Telangana bar council has written letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to extend Rs 10,000 to each economically backward advocate to sustain his or her family.

“Continuous lockdown of trial courts and the high court will push 5,000 lawyers with less than ten years of experience towards a terrible situation. There are 33,500 lawyers registered with the state bar council and our study shows that 10,000 of them are poor. Of this, 5,000 are in dire straits who need immediate help from the state government during the lockdown period,” said Chalakani Venkat Yadav, member of the bar council and also the government’s welfare counsel in the high court.

He told newsmen on Thursday that since the government had already created a welfare fund, it could extend Rs 10,000 to each poor advocate.

Advocates going to attend court hearings in urgent matters should be allowed to reach courts without hassles, he said.

PUNE: Janata Vasahat resident Yankappa Kumbhar (27) has not gone out to work in the past five days.

“I am worried. I used to earn Rs600-Rs700 daily by working as a crane operator, but have not earned a single paisa in the past few days. I am not sure how I am going to survive,” he said.

“We are using our groceries sparingly. I have saved money but that is not enough to sustain us for long,” said Kumbhar, a slum dweller.

Another resident, Ganesh Kawathe (40), said he works as ‘hamal’ (porter) at Market Yard. “I used to earn Rs350 per day but haven’t gone out to work for the last five days,” said Kawathe who lives in a small hutment with a family of five.

The Dattawadi police have come to the aid of casual workers in slums and is carrying out an extensive drive to convince them about the need to stay put in their homes.

Senior inspector Devidas Gheware of Dattawadi police said “Majority of the residents in the slum pockets of Janata Vasahat, Panmala, Ambil Odha-Dandekar bridge and Parvati Darshan are casual or daily wage workers. We called a meeting of ration, grocery and pharmacy shops on Wednesday and urged them to provide necessary goods and medicines to local residents on credit. After our request, the shop owners agreed to provide goods and medicines to the locals on credit. The local residents can pay the shop owners once they resume work,” he said.

Police have requested the shop owners to keep a record of the provisions on credit in detail and not fudge the records. “We have also warned them of stern action if they black market the grains or other essential commodities,” he said.

In last four days, the Dattawadi police have conducted awareness programmes for slum dwellers and asked them to be at home. Police have also urged the slum dwellers to observe social distancing and mark spaces outside the grocery shops and medicine shops. “Many women from the slum pockets work as maids or as hospital staffers and it is necessary for them to maintain a proper hygiene. We have arranged a counselling session for them,” he said.

352,['27/03/2020'],Bhopal: Home delivery off track due to flood of orders,"Picture for representational purpose only.

BHOPAL: Lack of home delivery services due to the lockdown is forcing citizens to venture out of their homes to purchase essentials like groceries, milk, bathroom supplies and medicines.

While some local general stores and pharmacists have gone out of their way to ensure home delivery to customers, bigger online superstores, otherwise known for their home delivery services, have stopped the service even when the stores are open, forcing customers to go down to the store to buy necessary items.

The district administration has released a list of store managers for people to contact for home delivery, but most numbers are switched off.

Manoj Kumar, manager at a superstore in Katara Hills said, “We don’t have staff, so we are not providing home delivery services, but the store is open.”

When TOI tried to contact the numbers of store managers mentioned in the list, most of them were switched off, while others went unanswered, despite several attempts.

Online superstores have also stated displaying a message on their apps that they are non-operational due to restrictions imposed by local authorities and that they are working to resume their services.

District collector Tarun Pithode told TOI that the authorities are trying to get the functional numbers so that home delivery of groceries etc can start soon. He said people were still in panic mode, which is making things even more difficult.

“Superstores were flooded with orders because of which they couldn’t meet the demands. There was also the issue that some drivers were stopped by the police because of which they stopped the service. We are in touch with the online superstores to encourage them to resume services. We have also asked them to provide functional numbers so that people can contact them. Everything will be smoothed out in a day or two,” said Pithode.

Meanwhile, local stores and pharmacies have started delivering groceries, bathroom supplies and medicines to customers at their doorstep.

Vijay Shah, owner of a general store in Awadhpuri , said, “We have got passes for delivery staff so that people may not have to leave their homes at such a time. They have also been asked to maintain distance while delivering items and keep hands clean.”

Gurinder Malhotra, co-owner of a medical store, has started home delivery of medicines without any extra charges.

“In such a time of panic due to COVID-19, we have decided to deliver the medicines at the doorstep of the customers. We realise that there are senior citizens, diabetic patients and ill children who cannot do without their prescriptions, and are also afraid to leave their homes. This is a time to serve your people,” he said.

Since many prefer to go to street vegetable vendors, residents urged officials to ensure enough space in the markets to avoid crowding.

“We are ready to follow the Covid-19 protocol to maintain social distance. But in some shops, it is difficult to maintain the distance as the space available for customers to walk is very small that it would be very difficult to cross each other without rubbing shoulders”, S Chithra, a resident of Palayam Bazaar said.

Instead of entering the market area, it would be better to purchase from platform vendors as the risk would be very minimal, said K Parthiban of ESP Street. “Due to lack of infrastructure in the main city markets, consumers by and large prefer street vendors and a minimum number of consumers are seen buying vegetable in the markets”, he added.

The district administration has already closed down all Uzhavar Santhais, where a considerable number of people purchase their commodities. So all are forced to go to the vegetable markets which have no proper space to move around without touching others, said P Kathaperumal, a resident of Woraiyur .

Despite imposition of section 144 of CrPC, residents and motorists were seen hitting the roads.

People thronging markets did not follow the social distancing while buying vegetables and groceries. One of the horticulture officials in the Hasthampatty Uzavar Shandy told TOI that the public were not standing in the specified circles. “They did not heed to us when we insisted them to follow the distance,” he said.

358,['27/03/2020'],Miles to go before they sleep,"Ghaziabad: A group of migrant workers walk to their villages amid the nationwide complete lockdown, on the NH2... Read More

After the Prime Minister announced the 21-day lockdown on Tuesday evening, Raj Kumar’s employer in Gurugram told him to get back home and stay there. But home was 1,050km away in Bihar’s Chapra. With just Rs 1,000 in hand, and not sure when his next pay would come, staying on in Gurugram made no sense to him.

With all public transport off the roads because of the lockdown, Raj Kumar and his family — his wife, their three-month-old toddler and his 58-year-old mother — set out on foot early on Wednesday, joining a stream of thousands of workers heading out of the city, all on foot, in hope of finding a way to reach home. By evening, many from Haryana had reached UP, having walked more than 50km, across Delhi. Some local residents offered packets of food along the way. They were thankful for that, but kept walking, hoping someone, somewhere would offer a ride.

This exodus of a huge work force that finds employment in the gigantic commercial sector of Delhi-NCR, which includes one of India’s largest automobile hubs in Manesar, began earlier this week and turned into a steady, endless flow down the presently car-free expressways that go deep into Haryana and UP after it became clear that the lockdown wouldn’t end on March 31. The people leaving are factory workers, construction labourers and daily wagers, whose earnings have dried up because of the total shutdown of the commercial sector.

The migration out of Delhi-NCR, which has more than 60 cases of people testing positive for the novel coronavirus infection, will also be of concern for governments because of the bridge it builds between urban and rural India, which is what the lockdown aims to stop.

“How do I pay my room rent if I don’t have any money? I had no option but to head back home. I’ll return only when things get back to normal and my employer gives me a call,” Raj said on Wednesday evening. He and his family had reached Ghaziabad by then. But Chapra was still hundreds of kilometres away.

Manoj Thakur (26), who worked with a factory in Vaishali, had reached Dadri after 10 hours of walking from the empty Anand Vihar bus terminal. “I stay in a rented room near my factory in Vaishali. I started walking around 3pm and reached Dadri at 1am. I have got food, but there is no water. None of the shops are open on the highway,” he said. Manoj still had to travel 160km to reach home in Etah district.

Manorama (30), also from Etah, had her 11-year-old daughter for company. “People like me need daily wage to survive. We don’t have enough savings to stay at a rented home for a month. Those who take decisions should have thought about us before shutting down public transport overnight,” she said. Manorama expected to reach home earliest by Friday. She had no idea where she would spend the night with her daughter.

It is the suddenness of the lockdown decision and the uncertainty about wages that have rendered the workers helpless. Many workers said though their employers had given them some cash, it wasn’t enough to sustain them for 21 days.

“I was given only Rs 1,000 before being told to stay at home. How can we stay here or pay our room rent with this money, at a time when essentials are overpriced?” asked Omkar. He is among six workers from Agra sent on long leave by a prominent sweet shop in Noida.

For Mohan Singh, the hope of earning a livelihood in a city had shattered too soon. He had come to Manesar just 10 days ago. “I have no money left. My family has been without proper food for three days now,” said Mohan, who is from Badaun. With his family of 10, Mohan has now started walking towards his home, 266km away.

It was more difficult for Om Prakash Kushwaha, who was carrying his seven-month-old daughter in his arms. Om Prakash was headed for Ajmer, which might take almost a week if he doesn’t get a transport on the way.

On Thursday morning, the Delhi-Jaipur highway had many such groups of people walking home — some with luggage on their heads, others with kids ticked between their arms. Most of them had a question for the government: “Why didn’t they inform us about the lockdown in advance? We wouldn’t have to walk like this,” said Patap Gupta, who was on his way to Amethi from Faridabad — a distance of 550km.

Meanwhile, a group of activists distributed packaged food, bananas and biscuits among a few labourers on the Yamuna Expressway in Greater Noida. Noida police said the only way they could help the labourers was by allowing them to pass. Rajesh Kumar Singh, DCP (zone 3), said, “We are not stopping them, but keeping a watch on their movement. We are helpless as commercial vehicles are not supposed to be on the road.”

Late on Thursday, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced special arrangements for the migrant workers, directing police to arrange food, water and security for them. The CM has also requested Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar to take necessary measures to ensure the safety of those coming from Gurgaon and Faridabad. “Those who are going to Bihar will also be taken care of, the administration will ensure required health measures for them along with food and water,” said a UP government statement.

PUNE: Pumps would only refuel vehicles involved in providing essential services in the district for now.

The district administration iterated on Thursday that petrol and diesel would be dispensed only to vehicles providing essential services in Pune even after a flurry of notifications issued by the Union and state governments on making essential services available to all citizens.

An official from the district administration on Thursday clarified that the district authorities could enforce certain restrictions to hinder the movement of people under Section 144 imposed in the district. “The decision to restrict the petrol and diesel supply to all, except essential service providers, has been taken to restrict unnecessary movement of people to curb the spread of Covid-19,” the official said.

He added that all those involved in providing essential services, including vehicles for transport of agriculture commodities and equipment, as well as other essential services, would be refilled with petrol and diesel if they provided proof of being involved in providing such services.

The revised lockdown orders issued by the state government on Wednesday had said steps should be taken to ensure there was no disruption in the supply of essential commodities to citizens. Also, a recent order released by the ministry of petroleum and natural gas had said in view of the recent outbreak of Covid-19, state governments had imposed restrictions on various activities, including restrictions on movement of vehicles and individuals.

It stated, “In all states/UTs, following activities must be permitted without any hindrance: Operation of petrol pump/retail outlets, LPG and oil agencies, including their back-end activities.”

PUNE: The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) will increase the number of buses on road following requests by private hospitals and pathology laboratories.

The transport utility has been providing free-of-charge bus services for government employees engaged in emergency services as of now, PMPML’s joint managing director Ajay Charthankar said. PMPML runs 110 buses in the morning and evening hours currently.

“We have been getting requests from different private hospitals and pathology centres for providing their staff with buses. While a plan is being chalked out, we need between 10 to 12 commuters in a bus preferably from one area in order to make our jobs easier. If someone working in a private hospital takes our bus and shows their identity card verifying that s/he is on emergency duty, they are being allowed to board. The number of buses will be increased as per the demand of the civic body, government hospitals and private parties, if it suits us. We might be looking at adding 50 buses in the future,” said a PMPML official.

The official added that passengers travelling in the buses were being checked. “We have requested them to wear masks and carry hand sanitizers. The identity cards are being checked. The service starts at 5am and goes on till 11am, resumes at 5pm and goes on till the late evening hours as there are many people working night shifts. Discussions are on with private hospitals on ways to provide them buses,” he said.

PMP Pravasi Manch activist Sanjay Shitole hailed the move. “The PMPML is a public service and it must be used to provide transportation under these difficult circumstances. On normal days, many people don’t want to travel in the buses but they are doing a good job presently,” he said.

Bhopal: The number of serious offences reported in the state capital has come down drastically during the ongoing lockdown amid the coronavirus scare. Not a single case of loot, murder, attempt to murder, rape and other serious crimes were reported in the past four days. House break-ins and vehicle thefts have also been negligible. Senior city cops maintained that the fall in crime rate was a result of continuous monitoring and checking done by police personnel.

Earlier, around 8-10 cases of serious offences were reported at various police stations in the city on an average daily. Every day, on an average around half a dozen vehicle theft cases were also reported. On an average, two molestation and a rape case were also reported daily before the lockdown.

More than 30 cases were registered in the city against people violating the lockdown order including one against a Covid-19 suspect, who had returned from Dubai three days back and was found roaming on his scooter at Board Office Square police check point. Ten cases against lockdown violators were registered on Thursday. Although, a few assault cases were reported across the city.

ASP (crime branch) Nishchal Jharia said that enhanced police movement and curfew has led to a steep fall in the crime rate. “Even the miscreants are worried about their health and it seems and they are not venturing out”, he said.

ASP Zone-1 Rajat Saklecha said that cops have been maintaining constant vigil at every nook and corner of the city to enforce the lockdown. Security check points have been set up at all roads on the city outskirts to check movements.

SP (Police Headquarters) Dharamveer Singh Yadav said that apart from setting up check points, two police patrol vehicles at each police station level were directed to patrol in their respective areas and spread awareness on precautions to be taken to avoid the spread of coronavirus. Violators of prohibitory orders are being booked under relevant sections of the IPC and Motor Vehicles Act.

District magistrates have been asked to ensure that packed food is delivered at their doorstep.The helpline, officials said, would be open between 11am to 3pm and 6pm to 9pm and manned by DUSIB officials. It will direct people to the nearest night shelter or pass on the information to the DM for delivery of packed food if the need arises.A nine-member advisory panel under deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia has also been formed for coordination and effective implementation of measures taken by the government for providing food. Apart from two bureaucrats, the government has roped in civil society members and experts in the fields of urban planning, homeless and disaster management.Following PM Narendra Modi’s call for a day-long ‘Janata Curfew’ on Sunday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had last week announced a slew of measures, including enhancement of ration by 1.5 times to 72 lakh public distribution system beneficiaries and free lunch and dinner at night shelters for the needy.With a complete lockdown till April 14, a large number of daily wagers, causal workers and those working in shops, offices and factories may face problems to arrange for food.Apart from the 220 night shelters in Delhi, where anyone can go and eat lunch and dinner, the government has also decided to open feeding centres at least two school buildings in each municipal ward and provide meals to 500 people each.“The district magistrates have been asked to identify pockets where poor people may need food. By opening feeding centres in schools, we will be able to decongest night shelters and also maintain the norms of social distancing,” DUSIB member-expert Bipin Rai said.On Wednesday evening, about 18,500 people had food at night shelters and officials said the number was likely to increase in the coming days.

It will be difficult for volunteers to deliver materials without police permission,” he said.When contacted, DCP R Karuppasamy said that they are only allowing volunteers who are working in co-ordination with the health department. “Volunteers who are providing service with the support of health department can continue. However, we cannot allow others because various organizations and clubs will start doing this. It will defeat the purpose of the lockdown. However, when there is need we will contact such volunteers. So, we are keeping a database of people who contacted us with the demand,” he said.Though the health team, police and corporation are making arrangements to provide support to people on home quarantine, it is facing some initial hiccups.

372,['27/03/2020'],Garbage generation goes down due to lockdown,"Pune: The garbage generation in the city dropped by 400 tonnes per day following the lockdown to tame the spread of coronavirus.

The solid waste management department attributed the plunge in trash generation to the closure of food joints and commercial establishments like shopping malls following the lockdown. The shutdown of restaurants has reduced the wet garbage, while the dry garbage generation has gone down because the offices are closed.

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) figures reveal that on an average the city generates around 2,100 tonnes of garbage. It has come down to 1,600 tonnes following the lockdown. Nearly 180 tonnes of wet garbage have gone out of the collection system, while 240 tonnes of dry garbage and 80 tonnes of reject items have reduced.

Dnyaneshwar Molak, the head of the PMC’s solid waste management department, said, “A sizeable reduction in trash generation has been seen off late. Both dry and wet garbage generation has gone down. Even the garbage reject has reduced.”

After the imposition of the lockdown, many waste-pickers could not pick up garbage because of police restrictions on the movement of residents. Also, many housing societies are not cooperating with the waste-pickers, affecting the garbage collection.

“Police have not allowed waste-pickers to leave their houses and go for door-to-door collection. It has adversely impacted the collection of garbage,” said Laxmi Narayanan of Solid Waste Collection and Handling (SWaCH) Collective.

Narayanan said the PMC commissioner and the city police commissioner had appealed to policemen to allow the conservancy staffers to do their job but not all policemen acted upon it. Many policemen were still preventing the conservancy staffers from venturing out, she said.

She said apart from the non-cooperation from the policemen, other issues, including non-availability of transport services, inability to use two-wheelers and lack of communication facilities, had also caused obstacles for the SWaCH workers.

Molak said, “Now the problem is as good as resolved. We have spoken to police officers. They are now allowing these workers to travel and perform their duties.”

Pinky Sonawane, who works in Aundh, said, “A few housing societies and residents also told us not to collect waste till March 31, fearing infection. A few others told us to come only once in a few days.”

Some waste-pickers were afraid of collecting garbage from areas where people had been home quarantined, said a source.

HL: DISPOSAL OF SAFETY GEARS

All masks, gloves and other safety items used by citizens should be wrapped carefully in a newspaper and marked with a big RED DOT, before handing them over to waste-pickers

It will ensure that waste-pickers do not open/touch such items

RESIDENTS’ ROLE

Citizens should segregate wet, dry and sanitary waste

All citizens must try to compost their waste at source and reduce the growing pressure on the system

INCOME HIT

Waste-pickers are not paid employees of the Pune Municipal Corporation or SWaCH

They depend on monthly user fees from citizens and daily sale of recyclable material

Their income will take a hit because scrap markets are currently closed

PUNE: Around 1,500 sex workers living in Budhwar Peth have barely enough rations to last a fortnight as they struggle to make ends meet in the wake of the curbs imposed due to Covid-19.

The police are keeping a strict vigil to ensure social distancing in these areas. “Even though we are doing our best to help these women, it is not enough.” Tejaswi Sevekari, executive director of Saheli Sangh, a sex-workers’ collective operating in the area said.

Saheli started educating the women of the situation since February-end . They were told about covering their faces while coughing or sneezing, washing their hands with soap and save money and ration for the tough days.

“Most women have come together and are helping each other by sharing ration, LPG and other goods. We have told them to store at least 5kg grain, but the packages given by our regular donors is not enough,” Sevekari said. Given the small dwellings these women inhabit, storing grain is a big problem.

The women have also been advised to stop sending money home and to first sustain themselves. Their landlords have told them not to pay rent for a month or two.

“They must get at least two meals a day. With all other activities on hold, we have appealed to local political leaders, families and friends to pitch in wherever they can. We are worried about the older women and the critical group which comprises HIV patients,” Sevekari said.

Several of them come from outside Maharashtra. Some from Karnataka had tried to find a state transport bus to take them back home before Sunday’s janata curfew, but they returned disappointed.

“Around 40 of us live together. There are no customers and we are not earning. Saheli is helping us out but we cannot go on like this,” 30-year-old Rani said.

Local corporator Datta Sagare has been helping Saheli. His son Anand, and Veer Hanuman Mitra Mandal, along with Sachin Damge of Vande Mataram Sanghatana have distributed food grain packets to the women.

Manchar village is one of the largest villages in Ambegaon taluka with a population of around 60,000.

“There was a rush to purchase essential commodities like milk, groceries and other goods after the lockdown was suddenly announced and social distancing was quickly forgotten. So, we decided to start the free home delivery facility,” sarpanch Datta Kenjale said.

He said the gram panchayat prepared category-wise list of traders selling various items like milk, meat, vegetables and other goods and sent it to residents via social media platforms. “Now, people contact the traders as per their needs and get home delivery of goods. We have also instructed them to observe social distancing in their shops and while delivering the commodities at home,” he said.

Dinesh Khude, a grocer, said, “People call us and send a list of goods needed either through SMS or WhatsApp. We deliver the goods in three-four hours. We have found that people cancel their orders if there is a delay in delivery of goods. So, we intimate customers about the approximate time needed to deliver the goods. There has been a good response from customers for this service.”

The Renuka women’s self-help group has also benefited from the home delivery service. President, Aruna Dheke, said, “Ours is a group of 10 women farmers and is a part of the home delivery service in the village. The vegetables grown on our farms are supplied to customers after getting orders on phone. We carry additional stock with us as people residing nearby too come to purchase vegetables. We maintain social distancing while selling vegetables. On Tuesday, we sold 100kg of peas and as many kg of chillies.”

But this led to a chaotic situation, overcrowding, and loss of all social distancing, thus defeating the purpose of the lockdown and heightening the risks of the spread of Covid-19.Municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra went to the Kalupur market after reports of large crowds of consumers crammed in the narrow lanes of the market came in. He talked with the vegetable dealers and then with city police commissioner Ashish Bhatia.“We had a detailed discussion and decided to permit only wholesale purchases from Kalupur market. The police commissioner has decided on heavy bandobust to prevent individual retail customers making purchases,” Nehra said.Nehra added that only wholesalers are permitted inside the Jamalpur main market, and the retailers who used to sit outside have already been shifted to Riverfront Sunday market, where there was little chance of overcrowding.A trader at Jamalpur market said there was a rush of retail customers in the wholesale market from Thursday morning. “The individual purchasers who came were willing to buy in bulk as retailers in their areas were overcharging. He said potato, which was priced at Rs 10-14 per kg was being sold at Rs 30-35 per kg in many areas. So families are pooling requirements for collective buying in bulk.”The trader added that the state government should fix retail rates for vegetables which may be 1.5 to 2 times of wholesale rates. He said at Jamalpur main market they usually did not sell less than 5kg to anyone, but on Thursday they also sold lesser amounts at a higher price.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74838193,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-946964,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-retail-sale-at-kalupur-jamalpur/articleshow/74837089.cms
390,['27/03/2020'],Many students face challenges amid national lockdown,"Pune: Students in the city preparing for competitive exams have been facing multiple challenges in the wake of the national lockdown.

They want the district and municipal administration to facilitate transport for them to return home.

Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said, “Our top priority is to provide basic facilities and health services to all sections of the society. It will be difficult for us to make transport arrangements.”

Laxman Waghmare, an MPSC aspirant from Jalgaon district, said, “As per the previous schedule, the prelim exam was going to be on April 8. Had the government taken the decision to postpone it earlier, we would have gone to our villages,” he said.

Some students said they do not have gas to cook food. “We used to have food at the mess. We don’t have a gas cylinder either,” Parikshet Saner, a student from Nashik, said.

“Some have their own vehicles and are ready to travel to their native places. The administration should make passes for us so the police will not stop us,” Mauli Naiknavare from Pandharpur in Solapur district said.

A senior district official said, “We cannot make alternative arrangements for them. Neither can we issue a pass , otherwise many people could have similar requests.” Most of these students live in Peth areas of the city, where limited shops are open. Some said they didn’t get grocery and food items in nearby shops.

Santosh Rathod, another aspirant from Nanded district, said, “I get around Rs2,500 per month from home for my expenses and I paid the mess and room rent from that. Now, I don’t know how to survive with less than Rs500 in with me for the next three days.”

392,['27/03/2020'],Coronavirus adds to misery of Delhi riot victims,"NEW DELHI: A month after Mohammad Akhtar’s house was set ablaze in Shiv Vihar during the Delhi riots, the 52-year-old returned to his neighbourhood this week. Coming back to the charred remains of his home was the only option available to him as the tent that served as his temporary shelter was dismantled. Akhtar had been living at the Eidgah relief camp in Mustafabad which housed at least 600 riot-displaced victims.“We weren’t forced to leave. But the camp was running out of ration supply. The caterer had already packed up. There was nothing left there,” said Akhtar, who once reared buffaloes to eke out a living. He has no source of earning now, and is apprehensive about the future.Fear over Covid-19 has forced the administration to look for alternative shelters for those displaced by the riots. Delhi Waqf Board, which was managing the site, confirmed that at least five tents have been dismantled. It claimed that the residents are being shifted to rented properties in the neighbourhood. But many of these families claimed that they have nowhere to go and little to eat.“We prepared our last meal at Eidgah today. The authorities have asked us to leave. For the last two days, we were struggling to prepare food because essentials like oil and milk were hard to come by in bulk,” said Aqueel Ahmad, the caterer who was in-charge of the kitchen at Eidgah.Fear of the contagious disease has also led a few people to leave on their own.Akhtar was among the two petitioners who had moved Delhi high court on March 20 asking the government to set up a medical camp to screen people for Covid-19 by thermal scanners. The high court passed an order on March 23, asking the government to set up the camp within 48 hours. But even before the deadline for compliance ended, the Waqf board began to dismantle camps.“This is a clear violation of the court’s order. The government can be held accountable for contempt of court if it’s making people leave without screening them,” said a lawyer who had represented Akhtar at the high court.Wasim was among those who left because of coronavirus fear. “We left two days ago because people started saying it wasn’t safe to live with so many people as the disease could spread,” he said. The 30-year-old has taken up a rented house, but there's no work for him. “Some volunteers gave us money for three months rent, but we don’t know how we will eat now,” he added.Even as the displaced stare at a bleak future, all they pray for is peace. “We hope that this does not happen with anyone. Our lives changed overnight because of the riots. And then it changed again when we had to leave the camp at such a short notice. We don't have a plan for survival, but we know we have to try,” said Akhtar.“If we had money or sources of regular income, we could have fed at least 10 more people in these times of fear. But right now, we don’t even have the clarity about what we will be eating next,” he added.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74838325,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-216980,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/coronavirus-adds-to-misery-of-riot-victims/articleshow/74837486.cms
393,['27/03/2020'],Many come forward to distribute food among the needy in Jaipur,"JAIPUR: As the lockdown has affected jobs of thousands of labourers in the unorganised sector, they are finding it difficult to arrange for two square meals a day. To solve this crisis, people from all sections of the society are coming forward to donate ration and food to the people in need.Kho Nagoriyan, situated in the city’s outskirts, has major population of labourers, most of whom are out of business since the lockdown. Hence, a few economically secure residents of the area have decided to distribute food items to the needy.Jakir Haji, a resident of Kho Nagoriyan said, “We are seeing that every day people are sleeping hungry which prompted us to start distributing food. Some shopkeeper supplied paneer, tomatoes, potato, cooking oil bottle or achaar (pickle). It is a collaboration by many people. Every day, we distribute food to 300 people, but I know that is not enough so I am trying to get in touch with some NGO to get help.”While the battle against coronavirus is underway in full swing, hunger has come to haunt many due to the economic crisis that has followed. However, people are visiting various colonies and slums for serving food to the needy. Rashmi Jain, along with three others has been running ‘Feeding Hands’, an NGO that serves free food to people.Everyday they serve 400 people and have been going around the city for this. “The times are so hard that we are teary-eyed looking at the situation of the poor . There are places where people haven’t eaten for three consecutive days. Everyday, police control rooms receive calls from people where food is needed as soon as possible and they later inform us. We serve daal and four kulchas daily prepared at home by our workers. This NGO has been working with the help of people who are coming forward to contribute items like buns, potatoes, puri or other food items,” said Rashmi.Some citizen have been going door to door distributing food packets with the help of donors. Giriraj Khandelwal, one such person in Jaipur, has been receiving help from the people in distributing the food packets. “Jain Samaj, Arya Samaj and various other organizations have been calling me. I pick up my vehicle every day, collect the food material provided and distribute the food like masala puri or achaar or dry ration like – wheat, pulses, rice along with pouches of masalas (spices). This is a time of crisis, wherein everyone should come forward to help,” said Khandelwal.The government has recently announced that people will be given ration without papers, which is although appreciable, yet the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) says that a blueprint hasn’t been created for it. The PUCL has been supplying cooked food packets to 1,000 people daily. “We have been distributing food packets everywhere. Government has taken a good initiative but it should also speed up the implementation of it. A helpline is needed for rural areas where people can register their complaints or else the problem will not be solved,” said Kavita Srivastav, president, PUCL.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74844142,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-189208,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/many-come-forward-to-distribute-food-among-the-needy/articleshow/74837484.cms

The new case is the fifth positive patient in Nagpur city and eighth in Vidarbha so far. The businessman has no travel history to foreign country, neither was he in close contact with any positive patients, or travelled by flight. The person had travelled to New Delhi and returned by train recently.

Government authorities remained tight-lipped and refused to comment if this could be a case of local transmission. But the way NMC sprang into action and started survey of the entire locality of the patient shows that the administration has taken this case very seriously. Moreover, the patient has diabetes and high blood pressure, which increases his risk.

NMC zonal medical officer Dr Sunil Kamble claimed that the case came out due to NMC’s door-to-door containment drive. “Our door-to-door survey team visited the house of this person on Monday, and learnt he had high fever. Our team asked him to go to IGGMCH and get himself tested. This prompted the person to go for a check-up,” he said.

The patient runs a famous shoe shop adjacent to the residence of a former minister at Khamla. He and his manager, both from the same community, went to New Delhi by Tamil Nadu Express on March 16. They reached Delhi the next morning, and freshened at the station itself.

They went to Karol Bagh in Delhi and purchased materials for their shop. They did not stay in Delhi, and started back the same day by the Telangana Express, and reached the city on March 18.

One of the patient’s relatives, a former corporator, told TOI, “He and his manager had no health problems on March 18. The person has diabetes and high blood pressure. He and his manager went to their shop as usual till March 21,” he said.

The shop was closed for janata curfew on March 22, and the same day the patient started experiencing health problems. Since then, he did not go to the shop and the manager along with two more staffers managed the shop. He visited a nearby doctor and took treatment.

“After NMC staffers told him to visit IGGMCH, he called me in panic on March 25. I asked him to go with his entire family to Mayo Hospital and get checked so that he has no confusion or fear. He along with his mother, wife, son and daughter went to Mayo Hospital. After taking samples, he was asked to stay there while the others returned home. Today, doctors said he was positive for Covid-19,” the senior corporator said.

Immediately after the person tested positive, a team of health department with police reached his home and cordoned off the entire lane. Total 10 persons, including four family members of the patient and six family members of the manager, were also taken to IGGMCH by the NMC team for check up.

This sent ripples among residents of Khamla, which is a crowded market area of South-West Nagpur. Also, members of the businessman’s community are known to mingle a lot, with many meeting and visiting houses of each other daily.

Mayor Sandip Joshi has directed NMC officials to conduct door-to-door containment drive in the vicinity of the house of the shopkeeper and the activity has already kicked-off.

Till now, all five positive patients in Nagpur have been from south-west part of the city.

No vehicle has ever come here for spraying and we are worried about our safety.

25k random tests in next 10 days

BENGALURU: If all goes according to plan, Karnataka will soon start testing more samples. The state is in talks with a Chinese manufacturer to procure rapid testing kits.Dr CN Manjunath , director, Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, and nodal officer for Covid-19 lab testing in the newly-formed task force, said the government is in touch with a Beijing-based manufacturer for the supply of 1 lakh kits.“The idea is to test more persons. What we are currently doing is the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test. There is acute shortage of kits even at the ICMR level. What we are buying from China is the rapid testing kit called ‘SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test Strip’, which will use the blood sample. It is validated and the accuracy is almost 96-97%,” he said.Currently, the government is spending Rs 2,600 per test per person. Once the kits are available, the cost can come down to Rs 600-700.The rapid immune-based testing kit is used to detect Covid-19 coronavirus antigen. It was widely used in China to detect both immunoglobulin IgM and IgG antibodies, said Dr Manjuanth. In this technique, when the antigen and antibody combine, they leave a visible colour spot or band which confirms presence of the infection.“The rapid testing mechanism is to avoid the Covid-19 infection from spreading further. Thursday’s positive case of a Mysuru man who had no travel history and no contact with patients has raised questions on the virus behaviour. It’s showing signs of slipping into the community and has to be looked into immediately,” said a top-level official.With flights to and from China having been suspended, procuring the kits will be a major problem. “We have discussed this with the director general of civil aviation and the home ministry. The only option is to send a chartered flight to China and procure 1 lakh testing kits. We also want to buy Personal Protection Equipment and masks in large numbers,” said Dr Manjunath.The government will start 31 fever clinics in Bengaluru on Friday to screen persons with Covid-19 symptoms. It will scale up tests to 25,000 in the next 10 days, in keeping with the ICMR mandate to conduct random testing. Medical education minister K Sudhakar said: “This is being done to ensure that if people with travel history develop Covid-19 symptoms, they should come to the fever clinics. This way, we can reduce the risk of community spread.” He said only 1,500 tests have been conducted so far. “We want to follow the example of South Korea,” he added.

Fortis group is also likely to announce the creation of isolation facility on Friday, sources said.While Apollo hospital has reserved 50 beds for Covid-19 patients, Max group has reserved 20 beds each at its Saket and Patparganj centres and BLK 10 beds for isolation and treatment. All three hospital groups said they were prepared to scale up the infrastructure significantly, depending on the need, on a short notice.Apollo has also received licence for Covid-19 testing. Sangita Reddy, joint managing director of the group, said most centres have been cleared for testing.“Full-scale testing is likely to start by the end of March. We will have the provision for home collection of samples as well as drive-through testing. In-hospital testing will be discouraged, except for in-patients. Dedicated fever clinics are being set up to screen people. People who qualify under the criteria for tests will enter via the drive-through, make payment as per government recommendations and then be tested,” Reddy said.Reddy added more than 50% Covid-19 positive cases need only isolation and symptomatic management. “Isolation is not possible in many Indian homes where 6-7 people share common accommodation and toilet. Soon, we will be launching “Project Stay I” to create medical rooms in hotels/hostels with light medical supervision for quarantine and creating a barrier before people come into the hospitals,” she said.The medical rooms will be rolled out in Chennai, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Delhi, starting with approximately 50 in each city.

“We are working tirelessly to help those in need. We are also facing so many difficulties with the lockdown and risking our lives to carry out our work during these difficult times. We are just as much as eligible like health workers and doctors to get special pay and benefits which would enhance our livelihoods,” president of 108 Ambulance Employees’ Welfare Association, M Irulandi said.

The association added that more than 2,000 ambulance workers from across Tamil Nadu had called the Amma Call Centre toll free number 1100 to register complaint demanding special pay.

Meanwhile, 108 ambulance authorities said that they are holding talks with the government regarding benefits for workers. “As of now, considering the lockdown situation, we are providing an additional payment of Rs 150 per day for all workers to buy food and groceries,” said an official.

Some workers claimed that they were not getting enough masks and protective wear. “We are only using whatever we were already given. They are telling us they will get us more masks and protective gear but keep on delaying. Superiors told us masks are in short supply so we need to wait,” said one of the workers.

However, authorities denied that there was any shortage in supply. “Stock availability is not an issue and we have already ordered for additional supplies too. We are facing few logistical issues since couriers stopped functioning so there could be delays. All workers mandatorily get masks and gloves. The workers of special ambulances designated for Covid-19 are also getting proper personal protective equipment kits,” the official said.

403,['27/03/2020'],"Panic buying dips, ropes used to check overcrowding","Visakhapatnam: The common man has begun rewiring his daily routine to the rigours of the nation-wide lockdown. People seemed less nervy and tried to make regular purchases, picking up vegetables for daily use, unlike the previous two days.

Most residents in areas such as Maharanipeta and MVP did not purchase vegetables which could be stocked and instead focused on buying limited amounts of perishable vegetables.

P Govinda Rao, a vendor at the wholesale market, said: “This is probably because people have already stocked their pantries and fridges. However, by and large, the stockpiling has been limited to a few with a majority focusing on sensible purchasing.”

While social distancing was practiced across the city, wary shopkeepers came up with new ideas to keep anxious buyers out. Much like Wednesday, some shopkeepers drew boxes or circles outside the shop for buyers stand at a distance from one another. But on Thursday many shops were seen with ropes tied across their door frames to prevent buyers stepping inside the shop. Besides it also helped maintain the necessary distance.

The authorities too have done their bit to ensure that there was free flow of vegetables, indicating better coordination between revenue and law and order authorities.

L Shiva Shankar, joint collector, said that vendors and farmers were allowed to bring in vegetables.

405,['27/03/2020'],"Docs take up consultation via social media, ensure social distancing","Madurai: Doctors are finding ways to communicate with their patients using technology and social media during this period of social distancing, thereby ensuring that people are not unwontedly exposed to harm. They are monitoring patients, following up and also calming them down through video calls and chats.

Geriatrician Dr N Raja has started consulting his patients through video on WhatsApp . “I shut my clinic for consultation four days back after the Prime Minister ordered the country to go into lockdown. Soon after, I started anxious calls from my patients,” he said.

One of his patients who is undergoing treatment for rheumatoid arthritis wanted to know if it was safe to continue with his medication as he had read that it has side effects. “This is because the patient was overloaded with information on quinone, a name that has been making rounds since the (Covid-19) crisis started,” he said.

Another patients of his had read that the drugs he was taking for hypertension could make him susceptible to the deadly virus. “This is when I ask them to come on a video call and reassure them to take the drug for another month,” he said, adding that he and many other private practitioners do not want to expose patients to any unwanted infection, and hence suggested those on long term medication to continue for another month.

Gynaecologist Dr Revathy Janakiram said she was using social media to provide free consultation to keep them comfortable. “I have a staff nurse and an office assistant in my clinic in case there is an emergency delivery, otherwise I speak to them over WhatsApp, prescribe necessary medicines and follow up after six hours to know how they are doing,” she said. For now, her relief is that most of the deliveries of her patients are scheduled for the first week of April.

K M G Vivekanandham, 66, a patient, said consulting over the phone was a relief. “Being connected with your doctor at times like this is a boon as telephone consulting is the only solution here,” he said.

Dr Raja adds, “Most of my patients have ailments like diabetes and hypertension and many are equipped with devices to know their blood sugar levels and pressure. Hence, counselling them to continue with medication is not a problem. It is only people who do not have monitors that is a matter of concern.” Many private practitioners are also working round-the-clock, like the counterparts in government service, over the phone. “We cannot afford to ignore the calls, so have to answer them,” the doctors said.

409,['27/03/2020'],Lockdown poses problem for pet owners in city,"Pune: The coronavirus lockdown has posed a problem for those who have pets at home.

Many people said that they were unable to take their dogs out for walks or defecation, while others said finding food, essentials and veterinarian services was a huge problem.

The situation has remained unchanged despite the exemption granted to veterinarians and pet stores by the Union home ministry through a notification.

Purva Sankhla, a resident of Satara Road, said, “There is certainly a problem with regards to supply of dog essentials in the market. Pet stores in our area are closed. I even checked online, but e-commerce sites are only supplying essential commodities, which do not include dog food.”

Lyla Cama, an NIBM Road resident and a dog trainer, said, “Finding dog food has become a major challenge. All the pet stores in my area are closed and deliveries are not taking place. Delivery boys from a pet store in Aundh were beaten up by the police. I will have to drive all the way to Aundh on Friday to get food for my dog. I am planning to pick up over 15kg of dog food as many people from my area have been calling me for the same.”

Shilpi Hisariya Khemka, owner of a pet shop Hadapsar, said people indulged in bulk buying when the 21-day lockdown was announced. “We are selling whatever stock we have in hand, but new supplies are not coming in. My customers call me in advance, and I give them the time when they can visit to make purchases. I open the store for only 30-45 minutes daily,” she said.

Prathamesh Gaikar, another pet shop owner in Baner, said that he has been getting orders for at least 30 deliveries daily as many shops are shut. My shop has run out of stuff, but I am getting stock picked up from warehouses. Some dog food brands have depots in Pune but are facing difficulty with logistics. While stock is available for one to two months in Pune, it is not reaching shops and customers due to staff crunch and other logistical issues,” he said.

He further added that he is delivering only pet food and some essentials like medicated shampoos. “We have told people that we will not deliver toys and treats as these are not essentials. We are also urging people to buy food that will last for a month. If people start hoarding, no stock will be left in the city,” he added.

Pet shop owners stated that maximum demand for pet food is from people who feed stray dogs and animals. Cama said, “Restaurants, shops and all other establishments are shut, and strays are not getting food and water. Dog food brands have provided stock to organisations to feed strays, but people are not allowed to get out. Something needs to be done to ensure that even stray animals are fed well.”

Pet care during lockdown

- If society is big, walk dogs only on society premises. If outdoors, walk only a short distance so that dogs can pee or poop

- Make sure to clean the poop

- Clean paws of dogs with a sanitizer after walks

- Do not visit pet shops or veterinarians unless there is an emergency

- If dogs can’t be taken outdoors, find games to play with them indoors

- Play sniffing and mentally demanding games with dogs - 15 minutes of cognitive or sniffing activity is equivalent to an hour of physical activity

VIZIANAGARAM: The Vizianagaram administration has decided to allow sale of vegetables and essentials through push carts and mobile vans. The decision was taken during a meet at the collectorate here on Thursday.

The administration has also decided to relocate three rythu bazaars to Ayodhya Maidan, Rajiv Gandhi Stadium and Bonkula Dibba, which are open grounds.

Talking to TOI, district collector M Jawahar Lal said: “We are taking this option mainly because vegetables have to be sold quickly, the farmers and vendors cannot take back their stock. However, we are doing this within the confines of the lockdown rules.”

Vizianagaram Marketing additional director, Shyam Kumar, said: “In many rythu bazaars we cannot accommodate all the customers and vendors at once. Moreover, in most of the bazaars vendors share shop space, in such a scenario we need to control the customer flow and practise social distancing.”

GC Kishore Kumar , Vizianagaram district joint collector, said: “During the meet it has been decided to relocate and rehabilitate small vendors by allowing them to set up shop in colonies, where no major markets are available and allow sale of essentials and vegetables by push carts and vans in colonies. We are relocating many of the small vendors from the fort area to new colonies. As for the push carts and vendors, they will have to carry a banner and ID papers to ensure that they are properly identified.”

A shopkeeper at Anna Nagar in Madurai said that they were finding it difficult to supply goods owing to the panic buying, as people used to buy essential commodities in large quantities. Now, the corporation has enlisted shops, which could deliver goods, and also roped in volunteers to deliver goods.

Sugumar of K K Nagar said that he thought of doing something useful for the society in the crisis and approached shops to deliver goods. It is only if they have an ID and a local address. This was made mandatory because only people having ID’s given by the corporation authorities could deliver goods. Kumar, a shopkeeper, says that they may approach more volunteers if the situation demands.

A few customers are asking for bulk orders for apartments, and in that case auto rickshaws are being roped in for home delivery. The customer would have to pay the auto charge in addition to the price of the goods. All these operations are expected to begin on Friday, according to corporation sources. But, all delivery personnel will have to wear masks and gloves. Vehicles used for delivery would have to be disinfected.

Dindigul district collector M Vijayalakshmi has said that four markets would be set up at Palani Road Lorry Terminal, Mettupati ground, Nagal Nagar Bharathipuram Market and SMPM School near the Round Road for the convenience of people. These markets would start functioning from March 27. People from villages can also make use of these markets.

The district administration has also put out a list of whatsapp numbers, which will help public get their grocery delivered at their doorsteps to ensure that they did not crowd in the shops. Shops have been identified to be common for many wards of the Dindigul Corporation. For example the Kannan Departmental Store with the whatsapp number 8489943093, could be useful to the people living in ward numbers 1 to 5, 36 to 40, villages under Settiyanayakkampatti panchayat and N S Nagar.

Such arrangements have been made for all the 48 wards in the Dindigul Corporation. She has said that all the vehicles to be used for home delivery would be disinfected and the delivery personnel equipped with protective gear.

Tuticorin and Tirunelveli district administrations have also made similar arrangements. In Tirunelveli, people can order from Pothy’s Super Market, Big Bazaar and Reliance Shop, between 9am and 4pm. Rs 25 would be added as delivery charge to each delivery, Tirunelveli corporation has said.

416,['27/03/2020'],"Corona threat: No ICU, ventilator at Rampur district hospital","Rampur: At a time when covid-19 threat looming large over the country and as many as 40 people have been tested positive for the deadly virus in UP, Rampur district hospital doesn’t have even an intensive care unit (ICU) and a ventilator to tackle an emergency case.

Moreover, the posts of physicians and cardiologists have been lying vacant at the hospital since long. The hospital also needs protective kits for the doctors and nurses working at the isolation ward, where suspected and confirmed cases are quarantined.

Covid-19 virus targets lungs and causes acute respiratory distress in the patient, who immediately needs ventilator for his survival. However, no positive case has so far been reported in the district.

Speaking with TOI, Rampur district magistrate Aunjaneya Kumar Singh said, “We have sent a request to the state government in this regard. We need 3,000 protective kits. A general kit costs around Rs 1,000, while special kits for the ICU cost Rs 5,000 each.”

According to the DM, they have the required funds with them to buy kits, but under the prevailing circumstances, the demands for the kits are very high and there is a shortage in the market. “However, the district hospital will get some kits soon.”

Chief medical officer (CMO ), Rampur district hospital, Dr Subodh Sharma said, ""At present, the district has only three ventilators functioning at a private hospital in Bilaspur thesil, while we don't have an ICI and the ventilator facility available at the district hospital.”

The CMO also confirmed that the hospital did not have a physician and a cardiologist, at present. ""In case of emergency, we will hire private doctors,” said Dr Sharma.

Meanwhile, Social Service Council chairman and former OSD of the Uttar Pardesh Minority Commission Shahab Malik said, ""It’s a matter of grave concern. Rampur district has a sizeable population of more than 23 lakh (according to the 2011 census), but the district hospital doesn’t have a ventilator and the ICU. Despite the outbreak of coronavirus, the government hospital is not equipped to tackle any emergency situation. We are sending an email to Union health minister Harshvardhan, requesting him to provide ventilators and other essential medical equipment to the Rampur district hospital as early as possible.""

417,['27/03/2020'],Confusion order of day as Goa citizens hunt for essentials,"Curfew in Goa

MARGAO: Day two of the lockdown in the state was marked with pronounced confusion. While the authorities failed to make any arrangements to ensure availability of daily essentials, like milk and groceries, the few departmental stores and grocery shops that had made announcements of home delivery failed to honour their commitments as they couldn’t obtain curfew passes to make the necessary logistical arrangements.

Some adventurous vegetable vendors, who had kept their stalls open in the Gandhi market in Margao on Thursday morning did some brisk business before lathi-wielding cops descended on the market and thrashed the vendors, forcing people who had come to the market to beat a hasty retreat.

“As I had failed to stock on groceries, I found this morning that I had completely run out of rice. I rushed to the market, but found everything closed. I chanced upon an open grocery shop only to be told by the owner that he had opened it to take some groceries home and would sell none of it. On being told about my predicament, he was kind enough to oblige me,” Edgar Fernandes from Borda in Margao told TOI.

Those who opted to try out the home delivery offer by super stores and grocery shops were also left disappointed. “I tried their number several times, but nobody answered. Just when I was about to give up, somebody answered and told me that they were helpless in doing home delivery of goods as they were unable to get curfew passes for movement of vehicles,” a resident of Comba in Margao said.

At the milk booths, as people resorted to panic buying, the stock soon got over, leaving many to make do without milk for the day. Similar was the case with bread supplies at bakeries.

The entire process is set to be executed within a week. Also, at the time of issuing parole and while readmitting the convicts in jail, their medical test would be conducted.Under normal circumstances, parole period is of 45 days, but under the current special circumstances, the period has been extended to 60 days. If need arises, it could be extended further.The capacity of Burail jail 1,120 and the current number of prisoners there is also to its strength. Out of these, 420 are convicts, 583 undertrials and four children.The high-powered committee has decided that out of the 420 convicts, around 261 convicts have never availed parole and it is expected that 40-50% or 100 to 120 of them, would be given parole benefit. Similarly, 80-85% of the 146 convicts, who have already availed parole earlier and their report is positive, would also be given the benefit. However, seven 7 convicts, who have a history of jumping parole, would not get this benefit. Also, 6 foreign nationals would also not get the parole benefit, while the duration of 14 convicts, who are already out on parole, would be extended.There are 583 undertrials in Burail jail, out of whom 146 are identified as ones who could be given interim bail.

The purpose is to decongest jails so that social distancing could be implemented there. If need arises, the parole period could be extended as well.”As far as the process of release on parole is concerned, DLSA member secretary Ashok Kumar Mann said the district magistrate after getting report from the jail superintendent and the SSP would issue release orders.",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74839104,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-57580,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/350-inmates-of-burail-jail-may-get-parole/articleshow/74837017.cms
422,['27/03/2020'],Yes! I am back: First positive patient returns home after defeating Covid-19,"Nagpur: The software professional who was discharged from the isolation ward of Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) said that the last 14 days were tough, but he rediscovered himself during this period.

“Yes! I am back,” said the 45-year-old, who happens to be the first patient in Central India to test positive for Covid-19, and eventually the first who recovered.

“We need tonnes and tonnes of positivity at this point of time. Bombard it. Ours is a great nation,” he exclaimed when asked about his first reaction after homecoming. He also expects that his wife, who is recovering from Covid-19 at GMCH, will return home by Saturday.

While it was an important development for Vidarbha, authorities kept it low-key, respecting the privacy of the patient and his family. An ambulance of IGGMC drove him to his house. His mother welcomed him in a traditional manner with aarti and applied tilak on his forehead as he stepped into the house.

His 14-year-old daughter had drawn a beautiful ‘rangoli’ at the main entrance door of the house. The rangoli showed a pair of boxing gloves fighting against the invisible coronavirus. She wrote two words — Fighter and Champion in praise of her father. “I am overwhelmed, short of words,” he said after seeing the rangoli.

The patient, as he earlier told TOI, kept himself busy in reading and thinking positive. As he is a believer in god, he used to read Shrimad Bhagwad Gita regularly. He has done a lot of spiritual thinking and now plans to write a book to inspire others to fight Covid-19.

“I will share exactly what I learnt during my experience in the 14-day isolation with Corona. I realized that there is a hierarchy of power. Body or physical strength comes at the lowest level of this hierarchy,” he said. According to his thinking, body, mind, intellect, soul and finally god are the right hierarchy of power.

“For body, you need to keep your temperature in control, which is quite easy. For mind, you have to resolve that you are going to fight. For intellect, you need to trust doctors’ knowledge. For soul, you must keep telling yourself that you are beyond all these sufferings. And finally, the super power is god, for which you must believe that god is with me all the time,” he said.

As common people are also observing the 21-day home quarantine-like situation due to lockdown, this man has a message for all of them. “If I can stay calm and composed in one room of the hospital for 14 days, you all are in your own houses, with your loved ones around you. What is the problem? Just be with your family, pray for all, and take care of yourself,” he quipped.

423,['27/03/2020'],"Amid corona crisis, central railway exceeds revenue target","Nagpur: With closure of passenger train operations due to coronavirus, there has been a spurt in freight train movement and the Central Railway is working 24X7 to ensure uninterrupted supply of essential commodities, with coal loading of 190 rakes in the last four days.

Nagpur Division of Central Railway alone loaded 137 coal rakes from March 21-25, supplying 5,08,712.20 tonnes coal and generating a revenue of Rs46.45 crore. Besides, 12 container rakes were also loaded, earning Rs1.52 crore.

Freight movement has been quick, though number of rakes that have been moving are as usual between 28 and 32 per day. Even railway minister Piyush Goyal has lauded Nagpur division for speedy coal supplies to power plants despite lockdown.

Despite Central Railway releasing a refund of over Rs10.27 crore to over 1.69 lakh passengers due to cancellation of trains between March 1 and 21, the achievement of revenue target has come as a silver lining.

A delighted Somesh Kumar, DRM, Central Railway, has thanked SrDCM Krishnath Patil and SrDOM Ashutosh Shrivastava and other branch heads for dedicated efforts to boost loadings.

“A 4pm on Thursday, we crossed last financial year’s earnings of Rs3,076.73 crore with five days left for current financial year to end. Nagpur has earned Rs3,078.73 crore this financial year (2019-20). In the next 5 days we expect to earn Rs60 crore,” said railway spokesperson & ACM (Goods) SG Rao.

“We are making all out efforts to ensure availability of essential commodities through its uninterrupted freight services. During the situation of lockdown in various states, Central Railway deployed staff at various goods sheds, stations and control offices, and is working to ensure that supply of essential items for the nation does not get affected,” said chief public relations officer (CPRO) Shivaji Sutar.

Sutar said the total tonnage of all the freight during the four days (March 22-25) is approximately 5.66 lakh tonnes. In terms of wagons, it is 9,837 wagons. Coal was the bulk one which was loaded for power plants at Parli, Nashik, Paras, Koradi and Mouda in Maharashtra, and Sarani and Singaji in MP.

Sutar says petrol , oil and lubricants (POL) and LPG was carried in 17 rakes for supply to various destinations like Gaigaon, Khapri, Tadali etc. Bhusawal alone carried 13 rakes. It also operated one full rake of onions.

Out of 57 rakes of container traffic, Mumbai alone accounted for 46 rakes. All the 6 rakes of fertilizer originated from Mumbai Division dispatched to northern and southern parts of India. Freight movement is being closely monitored by officials at very senior level. “Central Railway understands its crucial role during this difficult time and requests all the stakeholders to fully support in this endeavour,” he added.

Railway trackmen get masks, sanitizers

Even as coronavirus scare continues, trackmen have geared up for zero missing fittings, immediate rail replacements at Butibori, Bharatwada and Borkhedi yard. They have been counselled on safety precautions and onus of maintaining tracks following goods traffic. Hand-wash , mask and sanitizers were issued on Thursday. These gangmen were scanned with thermal gun. Social distancing while working in gang during work and lunch time is being ensured. “Gang staff is staggered to facilitate personal safety and safety of train running,” said ACM Rao.

When TOI visited a few supermarkets and department stores, it was learnt that pulses, cereals and other essential commodities were out of stock.“The scarcity is due to two reasons: shortage of staff and restrictions on traffic movement. Although we have enough stock at our warehouse, there are neither people at the backend nor there are staff to load the stock. Hence, most of the commodities like rava, oil, pulses, cereals, biscuits and dairy products were out of stock on Thursday,” a senior store manager of MORE supermarket said adding that it has become difficult to procure vegetables and fruits from other cities due to traffic restrictions.The same is plight of e-commerce platforms. Since crowded areas are to be avoided, many opted to place orders online through various applications like Bigbasket, Amazon and Flipkart. But most of the e-commerce portals have stopped delivery.P Asha, a homemaker, said, “I need wheat flour. Although I ordered online, my order was cancelled. Moreover, when I went to check at the supermarket, they said it is out of stock and could not say when stocks would arrive. My father’s medicines that I ordered online have also not arrived yet.”However, the picture is slightly different with local e-commerce portals like Do Ghante, Farm 19, etc. D Srinivas, director of Do Ghante, said, “We are getting many orders, but due to time contraints and travel restrictions, we are unable to reach out to the people. There are many people who are old and scared to visit markets. Hence, we approached the district administration to allow home delivery of essential commodities.”Speaking to TOI, Ranga Reddy, DCP (law and order), said, “We have taken this matter to the district administration and discussed it with the police officials. People who wish to home deliver essential commodities need to make an ID card with their name, registered e-commerce portal and mention home delivery in the card. This card needs to be submitted to the police and a list will be prepared. Only then they will be allowed to home deliver.

The document stressed the “growing concern about the unprecedented extent of the Covid-19 outbreak in the world, which may constitute a threat to international peace and security.”The proposal, however, did not go far, with both China and Russia nixing the idea. Sources said it did not appear as if the P-5 were overly keen to hold a meeting on a subject that is devastating countries and the global economy, virtually without any early end in sight.Some reports said the Estonian proposal called for “transparency” which China was reportedly unwilling to address. Beijing has been facing a volley of alle gations that it hid the incidence of the highly infectious coronavirus for over a month before reporting cases of unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan in late 2019. While the UN stonewalled a discussion when the G-20 leaders sat down on Thursday for a unique virtual summit, there was no questioning for transparency or origin of the virus.Official sources said the conversation was collaborative and cooperative, which means the US and China may have put their mutual acrimony behind for the moment. In 2015, the Security Council did hold a similar meeting when the Ebola virus was a looming threat, particularly to UN missions in Africa But this time it’s different. Not only is China the source of the pandemic, the US-China rivalry is playing out in the background as well with President Donald Trump insisting on referring to the disease as ‘China virus’.

CHANDIGARH: On the second day of the national lockdown, door-to-door delivery of milk, vegetables, grocery and medicines saw an improvement in the city, but residents complained of high prices of vegetables and limited stock with grocers.

The Chandigarh administration has not planned any kind of relaxation and will stick to door-to-door delivery of essential items. About the arrangements, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore said quarantining was more important than essential items. He said he would daily make rounds of different areas of the city and the residents need to show some patience as the system would be 100% in place in a day or two.

Badnore, who flagged off CTU buses from Sector 26 mandi to different areas of the city for door-to-door delivery of vegetables, said he and his team of officers have assessed the issues that need to be resolved. “By Friday, most of the issues will be sorted out by the UT administration,” he assured.

UT adviser Manoj Parida, who also took rounds of different sectors, said, “Is it fair to expect normalcy in abnormal times? Residents must show some patience. We are constantly trying to improve efficiency of the door-to-door delivery system in the city.”

However, the residents complained of high prices of vegetables delivered door-to-door by vendors in CTU buses. Raju, a resident of Sector 44-C, said the vendor sold peas at Rs 100 per kg and tomato and cucumber at Rs 60 per kg, which were available between Rs 30 and Rs 40 per kg last week. No public announcement was made by vendors and officials. There was a huge rush of residents, which defeated the purpose of social distancing, he added.

Echoing a similar view, Pooja of Sector 45-C said there was around half-a-kilometre queue in front of the CTU bus to buy vegetables. She did not buy any as she did not want to put her and her family’s life at risk by going into the rush. People were not maintaining proper distance and some were even without masks, she added.

Milk and newspaper supply also witnessed an improvement. But the residents complained of switched off numbers of grocery stores. A grocer said he had received around 500 calls since morning and his stock was finished within three hours. As there was no stock left, he preferred to switch off his phone.

“The administration should improve the wholesale supply of grocery items as only then we will be able to sell those to customers in retail. We have limited staff to provide home delivery,” he added.

Medicine supply improves

The UT administration released numbers of chemists in various sectors for home delivery of medicines. However, the residents demanded that more chemist shops be given permission. Harjeet Singh Sandhu , State Transport Authority (STA) secretary who is the nodal officer for supplying medicines, said they were planning to open more chemist shops in the coming days.

UT creates corona fund

The UT administrator announced the creation of “Chandigarh Fights Corona Fund” and contributed Rs 1 lakh. The fund will be used to fight Covid-19 in Chandigarh. Any person who intends to contribute can deposit the money either through cheque or through online banking with the Indian Red Cross Society , UT, Chandigarh bank account. Bank details are as follows:

Name: Indian Red Cross Society , UT, Chandigarh; bank: Central Bank of India , Sector 17-B, Chandigarh; address SCO 68-69, Bank Square, Sector-17 B, Chandigarh; account number: 3578152035; IFSC code CBIN0280412; MICR code 160016002

Admn to set up SRTs

UT has decided to set up sector response teams (SRTs) consisting of officials, who will address the grievances of people in their areas. People will be able to consult them and the SRTs will coordinate between them and the administration, besides the control rooms in the municipal commissioner’s office/deputy commissioner’s office, among others, and ensure that the supply chain is maintained. The names and contact information of the nodal officers of the SRTs has been uploaded on the website of the Chandigarh administration.

Ration in mobile vans

UT adviser Manoj Parida said talks were on with Markfed and Hafed to operate mobile vans in the city to provide ration at reasonable rates. He appealed to the residents to avail facility of three mobile ATMs arranged for the city.

The driver further said that cops strictly warned him of dire consequences if he was seen driving on the road again.

“I showed them [the police] the patient’s medical documents. However, the police officer on duty asked me not to drive on this road again. Now, please make it clear, whether I should continue my emergency work or not,” he further said.

Responding to the video, additional superintendent of police (city) Amit Kumar Anand said that all emergency services are allowed to function.

“Buying time (through lockdown) will not help the epidemic die down on its own until the young population is allowed to get infected as is being done in the United Kingdom. However, it will help to experiment or develop medicine and vaccine,” he said. Every country can frame strategies to mitigate trans-border spread of the infection, as India intends to by lockdown, he added.

Dr Singh echoed World Health Organisation (WHO)’s Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus’s warning .“Last thing any country needs is to reopen schools and businesses only to be forced to close them again because of resurgence,” Ghebreyesus had said on Wednesday.

“We failed to learn from Covid-19 (experiences) beyond our borders. We should have not seen this day, and I foresee even worst of it. Still, the epidemic can be controlled, by hand hygiene, social distancing and isolation…..isolation,” said Dr Singh.

Little over eight years since AIIMS Bhopal began, the institute is faced with its greatest challenge yet. “We are trying to mitigate limitations,” Dr Singh explained. “Except for scarcity of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) we have workable stock of other accessories,” he added.

As of now, AIIMS has around 80 isolation beds, six ICU beds and four of these are with negative pressure. These are needed when the patient is critical and excreting a large quantity of virus, said Dr Singh. To control or even slow down the epidemic in India, we all must adhere to the advisory of lockdown as suggested by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Dr Singh said.

“Even the highly educated have failed to understand the need for 24-hour Janata curfew,” he said.

At NIV Alappuzha , the number of samples being handled a day has increased by four times in the past one week. Along with three other states, Kerala has the highest number of government approved laboratories — eight.In the first 10 days of March, the state tested 691 samples and in the next 14 days, the testing spiked to 3,723 samples. As cases began to turn positive, the number of people who were brought under surveillance rose from 3,313 to 1.02 lakh in just two weeks, preventing exposure of a large section of society to symptomatic persons as well as those under observation.Speedy results from multiple facilities have so far enabled three crucial steps in containment; identifying primary contacts, tracking possibilities of infection followed by isolation and monitoring.“Only if we do tests, we would know the sources of infection which could enable us to initiate steps for containment. The faster you do it, the better, especially considering that exposure of immuno-suppressed persons to infected persons could lead to an uncontrollable spread. Early testing helps us in quicker isolation steps,” a health official saidEquipped with eight testing facilities across the state, and awaiting one more, and having to deal with samples from 13 Covid-affected districts, the health department has prepared a sample distribution channel (SDC) to facilitate sample collection and arrival at testing facilities in minimum time across a larger network. When Covid cases were confirmed in Pathanamthitta after a brief silent period of the first series of outbreak, health authorities realized that speed in detecting positive cases mattered in containing the spread.Earlier, samples from all districts were pooled in at Ernakulam and then transported to Kalamassery Medical college from where it airlifted to Pune. On February 2, the testing began at NIV, Alappuzha. As case load surged, testing was initiated at Medical colleges in Kozhikode, Thiruvananthapuram and Thrissur. In the meantime, the authorities pushed proposals for Covid testing facilities at Rajiv Gandhi Center for Biotechnology, Thiruvanathapuram, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute of Medical Sciences, Thiruvanathapuram, State Public Health Laboratory, Thiruvanathapuram and Interuniversity, Kottayam.The health department has also put in place a system for self-manufacture of viral transport medium (VTM) which is crucial in the process of transportation of samples. In addition, the government is set to procure PCR machines for medical colleges in Ernakulam, Kottayam, Pariyaram, and Parippally and once the machines are installed, proposal would be sent to ICMR for starting Covid testing facility in these places as well.NIV Alappuzha has consistently handled around 150 samples a day for the past one week.

However, the world came crashing down for this professional working with an IT he was detected with the virus.He was so upset that he thought it would be the end of his life after reading reports of deaths in China and European countries. He even called on his close friend and disclosed all investments he had made. After being in the isolation ward for 12 days, he now says his perspective towards life has changed completely. In an exclusive tête-à-tête with TOI, he shared his experience from being traumatic initially to a change that he termed as “second life”.Excerpts:How it all began?I was part of the team from same IT company that went to the US. We were four of which two fell sick. When our first colleague tested positive, second one, who was sick, pushed me to check my swab samples. In fact, the second one’s test came out to be negative. I went there very casually as I was completely fit with no cold, cough or fever. But when my test came out positive, it was the biggest shock of my life since corona’s name is synonymous with death.What was your reaction?I was completely shattered and didn’t know what to do. I sat with my head down for half an hour thinking was it the end of my world? I then called up a close friend and told him to open an excel file on my laptop where I had all the files of my investments. I told him the password and advised him to pass it on to my parents in case something drastic happens. I wasn’t able to sleep properly for the first couple of days due to tension.How you are spending time in isolation?Initially, it was bit difficult, but later I adjusted my schedule and made a timetable. I keep myself busy on phone and talking to my sister along with my parents, friends and relatives. I keep watching inspirational videos on YouTube and talking to some of the monks of Ram Krishna Math, who also kept my spirits high.What has changed in the last 12 days?Truly speaking, it was roller coaster ride for me in this short span. This stay at isolation has changed my entire perspective towards life. Before coming here, I was content with my career growth like normal humans. It included high profile job in an IT company and career growth that I thought were the milestones. But, now I realized that these are not objectives of the life. I came back from the 2% of people from the world who were infected with the deadly virus which opened my eyes in a real sense. Now, I want to contribute towards betterment of the society in whatever way I can.How are the facilities and doctors at GMCH?Usually, we tend to blame the government for poor facilities, but now only its manpower is working while taking all the risks to treat patients like us. They’re in fact lifesavers and I want to express my gratitude to them, including Dr Gosavi and his team of doctors and nurses. Even the staff here deserves appreciation, as they clean and disinfect our rooms thrice. I would rather say that they’re no less than soldiers, who guard our borders. I will carry this experience throughout my life.Any bitter experience?After the list of quarantine patients was leaked, me and my family faced numerous problems as it contained my name. Me and my family received numerous calls and I had to literally tell them a lie that I was under isolation due to fear of social stigma. It was a very painful experience. It was kind of hypocrisy of the people who on one hand avoid helping out with the positive patients and families, but on other hand blindly forward such lists without thinking of implications on the persons named there.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74837062,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-100938,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/i-thought-my-life-will-end-says-4th-covid-19-patient/articleshow/74837063.cms

District guardian minister Nitin Raut, who inspected Mayo Hospital and Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), said preparations are being expedited to put in place special facilities. “We are soon going to have a special 250-bed special ward for Covid-19, and another 1,200-1,300-bedded facility at GMCH, which will have 50% reserved for intensive care units,” he said.

Raut, who expressed dismay at the fifth positive patient in the city, said the health team had done well to send one earlier patient home fit and fine. “I have already sanctioned Rs25 crore to set up infrastructure to fight Covid-19 in the district, in addition to Rs7 crore for the rural areas,” said the guardian minister.

Raut expressed satisfaction with the existing facilities of treating Covid-19 patients and suspects at government hospitals but said there is scope for improvement, which too would be a reality soon.

Raut also said people had started queuing up at grocery shops and such other outlets of essential commodities after the announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but their fears have been allayed now. “We are stressing on social distancing now, especially at shops and other places,” he said.

With slums left grossly unattended by authorities, including police, the fear of community infection spreading there seems to be high among the more aware citizens, since the unaware lot are venturing out and mingling, violating all orders.

At slums like Naik Talao, Pandhrabodi, Futala Nayi Vasti and such places, people were spotted socializing and gathering. There are also reports of liquor being available at such places at higher rates.

Mamta Sharma, a teacher from Hiwre Layout, said the streets are occupied by loitering people, cyclists and bikers despite prohibitory orders, which is causing distress to people like her who are aware about the dangerous situation. “Twice I had to call police and again NMC control room. They just come for temporary rounds,” she said, demanding permanent deployment at Wathoda Road and Quetta Colony.

Sandesh Singalkar, Congress spokesperson, too said the lack of awareness is causing problems in East Nagpur , where public seems to be taking the Covid-19 threat casually. “Public is coming out, gathering at different places, socializing and remaining out of their homes causing much fear of infection spread,” he said. Singalkar wanted the government to pronounce it’s policies in more clear terms to remove all confusion.

East Nagpur MLA Krishna Khopde said daily wagers are coming onto the streets and can be found more in slums and areas where the economically weaker community reside. “With the Central government under PM Modi having detailed sops for daily wagers, they are likely to remain inside homes now. I am constantly communicating with my supporters and party office-bearers, and accordingly sharing feedback and alerting authorities regarding issues cropping up,” said Khopde.

“People need to understand and cooperate as a pandemic like Covid-19 will not go away unless they join us in our fight,” said Khopde.

City police, on Thursday, detained 76 persons, registered three offences against violators, and slapped penalties at nakabandis against 171 persons. Around 4,732 passes were also distributed to citizens at different police stations for emergency movement.

City police chief BK Upadhyay said the police would now try to create awareness among citizens in slums. “We will make announcements through our public address systems in the slums and interior lanes,” he said.

Police are just trying to ensure that maximum people stay at home and do not come on the streets with or without vehicles.Still many people can be seen on the roads despite police presence?People are coming on the roads only to avail essential and emergency services. Almost 99.9% people are inside homes and not stepping out. Essential commodities and emergency services also have their chains, where substantial people are engaged, whom we cannot stop or else the network would be broken and availability will be affected. There are a number of employees or workers behind each service, and chains that need to be on the roads to help these networks remain functional.

It’s a negligible percentage who are on the road without any reasons.There are allegations of police high-handedness, especially caning violators on the road?I have told personnel not to use force, like canes, on citizens. We do not support use of force on citizens. Rather, we have decided to take action against violators under various legal provisions, which can land them behind bars too. Already legal action has been initiated, which will continue.What other roles are police playing in the war against Covid-19 with other government agencies?We are playing a multifaceted role along with other government agencies. Apart from enforcing section 144, our force is also engaged in social works like helping senior citizens, transporting public in case they get stranded, providing food to many and so on. We are also accompanying health and other teams as escorts for screening suspects and keeping a check on quarantined people.

I would expect that finance and treasury authorities would take sufficient steps to reasonably meet the extraordinary situation created due to spread of such infectious disease in the country,” said Justice Sunil Shukre.The directives came while hearing a plea by CH Sharma and others regarding inadequate facilities at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH).Citing Covid-19 infection threat, the director of accounts and treasury at Mumbai had issued a circular on March 24 fixing March 27 as the deadline for acceptance of all pay/treasury bills by the concerned district treasuries and sub-treasuries.Though the case was not listed, it was on the insistence of amicus curiae Anup Gilda, who presented the circular in the HC, that the plea was taken up for urgent hearing.“When it’s admitted in the circular that all offices are working with extremely depleted strength, it would be unreasonable on authority’s part to expect that they, constrained by depletion of staff members, would be able to meet the deadline. The reasonableness of the action could have been seen had the authority extended this date beyond March 31,” the judge said.While requesting the director and principal finance secretary (accounts and treasury), to reconsider the deadline, Justice Shukre added that the circular apparently seems to be arbitrary and against principle of rule of law, well enshrined in constitutional scheme.“This arbitrary aspect of the communication has a potential of adversely affecting efforts of various medical authorities and also the administrators of various departments in containing Covid-19 spread. Presently, all of them are focused on its containment. They may find it difficult to shift their focus, maybe for a temporary period, to such matters, as preparation of various bills and their submissions take time,” the judge said.Box —",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74837143,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-31692,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-19-threat-extraordinary-situation-needs-strong-steps/articleshow/74837144.cms

The weather turned pleasant late afternoon and by evening, many places started witnessing rains around 7 pm. Rainfall continued intermittently and by midnight, the city saw heavy rains.

Stating that viruses can survive longer in humid weather, infectious diseases specialist Dr Ashwini Tayde said, “Thundershowers and subsequent cloudy weather mean viral infection cases will be more in coming days. Every fever, cough and cold could not be Covid-19 for sure. But as we are observing 21-day lock down, it is our responsibility to stay at home and maintain health.”

The doctor added there was no scientific basis yet to claims that rise in temperature will control the spread of coronavirus.

According to the officials of Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), Nagpur, the region might witness more rains in coming days. The city received a total of 13.8 millimetres rain on Wednesday. “A trough was extending up to 0.9 km above mean sea level from East Central Arabian sea to South Madhya Pradesh across konkan, Madhya Maharashtra and Vidarbha. As a result of this, rains occurred over the region,” said an official.

With 31.6 mm rains, Amravati was the wettest place in the region followed by Hingna which recorded 18 mm rains.

The rains brought down the city’s maximum temperature to 37.3 degree Celsius. The minimum temperature recorded on Wednesday was 18.9 degree Celsius or nearly three degrees below normal. Akola was the hottest in the region with a maximum temperature of 39.5 degree Celsius on the same day.

As per met department forecast, thunderstorm with gusty winds and hail are expected to occur in Akola, Amravati, Buldhana, Washim and Yavatmal on March 29 and 30. Other districts are predicted to receive light to moderate showers.

The city had received 6.2mm rainfall on the night of March 17.

AHMEDABAD: The 21-day lockdown imposed by the state government has left habitual smokers in a frenzy, and many have ended up rationing the number of cigarettes they smoke, one puff at a time. With the 21-day lockdown causing paan shops across the state to shut down completely, smokers are struggling hard to find their smokes.

""I had stocked up on a few packets of cigarettes when the state government announced closure of paan shops in four major cities, but that was considering shops will reopen after March 31. However, I don't think I have enough stock to last me two more weeks through the lockdown period. I've cut down to three cigarettes a day from over 10,"" said Sharad Sharma, an Ahmedabad-based businessman.

Paan shop owners said that most people have stocked up well in advance. ""Shutdown of paan shops is certainly a revenue loss, but all businesses are facing losses due to the lockdown and we have to bear it. Many of our regular customers purchases their stocks before shutdown,"" said Paresh Chauhan, who owns a city-based paan shop.

""I somehow anticipated a longer closure and therefore, had stocked up cigarettes for a month. I am still using them judiciously but not sure how it will fare if the lockdown gets extended further. Let's see how it goes,"" said Abhishek Amin, a Surat-based businessman.

The increased demand for cigarettes has also led to packets being sold in the black market at 35%-50% higher rates. ""I'm a habitual smoker and thus it is tough for me to live without them. I called the owner of a roadside stall near home, from where I regularly purchase smokes and while he agreed to supply me, I ended up paying 50% higher price,"" said Ashish Narayanan, a professional.

A number of smokers have taken the lockdown as an opportunity to quit smoking altogether. ""I have been trying to quit smoking for a long time now and I feel there's no better chance than the lockdown. It's tough because I smoked quite a few cigarettes a day but I have stopped completely since Sunday. It has gone well with me,"" said Nirali Shah, a Vejalpur resident.

(Names of smokers have been changed to protect identity)

Another pest control firm owner, Ravi Pujara said, “The residents in the city are really scared after one person died of COVID-19. We are getting 10 inquiries per day and our staff is always on their toes. We are using sanitisation chemical having 68% alcohol, which is enough to kill any kind of virus.”

Raju Patel, president of Saipujya Apartment in City Light said, “We have disinfected the entire building and this will be performed after 10 days.”

""All our sweepers are on leave due to the lockdown. So, we thought of sanitising the entire building and protecting our 200 families,” said Kirti Shah, president of Anmol apartment in Parle Point.

SURAT: Migrants in large numbers have been leaving the city ever since the nationwide lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to contain the spread of COVID-19 on Tuesday night.

Thousands of migrants can be seen at Kamrej crossroads and at a few other points on highway alongside Diamond City and parts of south Gujarat waiting for some transport to leave for their hometowns.

Curbs on private vehicles and public transport during the lockdown compelled many people to begin the journey to their native places on foot. A number of migrant workers had also left the city on their bicycles, motorcycles and autorickshaws. Some of the workers also travelled home in goods vehicles.

However, the state government on Thursday announced bus facility for labourers going on foot to their hometowns in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and districts of Dahod and Panchmahal. The announcement has led to increase in the number of migrant labourers wanting to return to their homes.

""It is true that a number of people are leaving the city, and this needs to be stopped. Police will have to take strict action against people coming out on to the roads,"" Surat district collector Dhaval Patel told TOI.

On Wednesday, several labourers were sent either to their native places or to a nearer place by police in rural areas of Surat district. This was because many workers and their families had walked up to the highway from the city in the hope of getting transport. These workers were also provided food by local non-government organizations.

""Labour department has data of labourers working in different industries. It should have informed the government about such a possibility. I think the state government completely failed in understanding the situation,"" said Vipul Pandya, president of Bandhkam Majdoor Sangathan, Ahmedabad.

""The issue of people leaving the city in large numbers has become a serious problem. Police are trying to stop them but people are still managing to escape. We will work on some strategy to stop the movement of people from the city,"" police commissioner R B Brahmbhatt said.

455,['27/03/2020'],2 injured in clashes over land dispute,"Rajkot: Two persons were injured in a clash between two groups over ownership of land in Dungarpur village of Rajkot taluka on Wednesday evening.

Police said the clash erupted after one group claimed ownership over a government wasteland and started leveling the surface. The other group also staked its claim to the land and asked them to vacate. “Soon an altercation broke out among the two groups that resulted in the clash in which members of both the groups attacked each other with swords, axes, iron pipes and bats. While in one group, one Anil Rathod (28) was injured, in the other, one Raiya Gamara (33) was injured,” said G N Vaghela, sub-inspector with Aji Dam police station.

In his complaint, Anil said that while his uncle Chandu Rathod was running the bulldozer on the land, four persons from the Gamara family stopped them and asking the members of the Rathod family to vacate the land and go away. In the cross complaint, Raiya said that his family wanted to take the possession of the land for tethering cattle. As the Rathod family was bulldozing the land, they objected to it, resulting in the clash.

“Both the warring groups wanted to usurp the land to build cattle sheds,” added Vaghela.

Meanwhile, A man was injured after he was attacked with iron pipes by three assailants at Trishul Chowk on Gayatrinagar main road in Rajkot on Wednesday night.

Police said the accused, identified as Jaideep Devada, Prabhat Devada and Raju Devada, attacked Chirag Devada.

NEW DELHI: Households with 'Ujjwala' LPG connection will get free refills till June, a move, which together with the provision of free foodgrains through ration shops, will put food on the 'thaali' ( plate ) in 8.3 crore poor households and help them tide over the lockdown.

Describing the package as ""an example of responsive governance in challenging times,"" oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said it will ""mitigate the economic impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the rural and urban poor, farmers, health workers , migrant workers, senior citizens and other vulnerable sections of society"".

Besides keeping the kitchen fire burning, the free cylinders will address the problem of low consumption by beneficiaries - mostly due to slow pace of behavioural and social change that hampers sustained usage of LPG for cooking. The Comptroller and Auditor General's report in December 2019 pegged the annual average refill consumption at 3.66 among beneficiaries who had completed a year till March 2018.

It said analysis for 3.18 crore PMUY beneficiaries as on December 31, 2018 showed that refill consumption declined to 3.21 refills a year.

GMC has sealed the Mangaladas Nagar area where the patient resides and declared it as Red Zone. Additional police teams have been deployed in the area to monitor the movement of locals.GMC commissioner C Anuradha along with senior officials visited the area on Thursday and set up a control room in the ward secretariate. “We have deployed 700 sanitation and 150 malaria department workers in the area and launched special drive to keep each and every door clean. We have sprayed sodium hypochlorite and bleaching powder,” said Anuradha. She said they used 10 water tankers and two fire-fighting machines to disinfect the area.She explained that they have identified 38 colonies within 3km area of the residence of the patient that have been sub-divided into 1,650 clusters. About 58,843 houses and 4,846 shops have been located in the area. She said residents of all these colonies have been asked not to venture out. Meanwhile, 10 main roads and 181 internal roads have been closed down to prevent entry and exit from the colonies.Meanwhile, the health department has identified 29 people who were in close contact with the patient and have put them in home isolation. While 16 people were found to have travelled with the patient from New Delhi to Guntur, another 13 people were found to be in close contact with the patient after his return from New Delhi.The 65-year old patient said to have visited Delhi to attend a religious session and stayed in a place of worship along with several other unidentified devotees for three days.

458,['27/03/2020'],BS-IV vehicles rot in showrooms across Andhra as March 31 deadline draws near,"Vijayawada: Automobile dealers in Andhra Pradesh are unable to sell around 1,000 Bharat Stage IV (BS-IV) model vehicles because of the nationwide lockdown which was imposed to battle the spread of Covid-19. They are also unable to complete the registration process and deliver over 5,000 vehicles that have already been sold. The deadline for registration of BS-IV vehicles is March 31.

The lockdown in major cities—Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Tirupati, Kurnool, Nellore, Kadapa, Guntur and few other towns in the state—is preventing dealers from reaching automobile showrooms and completing the paperwork to file for registration and issuance of vehicle number. In many areas of the state, regional transport offices (RTOs) are operating with skeletal staff due to the lockdown.

Speaking to TOI, additional transport commissioner P Srinivas said that over 5,000 vehicles already sold and waiting to be registered in the state. “Though we have introduced online registration of new vehicles in the state, the owners of the new vehicles are unable to do so on their own due to some technical issues. Nearly 1,000 BS-IV vehicles have remained unsold in the state,” he added.

The Supreme Court ordered that the deadline for registration of Bharat Stage IV (BS-IV) vehicles is March 31, 2020 and from April 1, 2020, only BS-VI category vehicles will be allowed for registration. Some automobile dealers have announced good discounts to clear their BS-IV inventory.

“I had planned to purchase BS-IV model Bajaj Pulsar bike at a discounted price on Ugadi day (March 23). But the lockdown due to Covid-19 washed away my plans and I failed to purchase the bike due to lockdown. Since, the lockdown will continue till April 14, I have to cough up more money to buy the BS-VI model,” said G Gopikrishna, a resident of Vijayawada.

Sources said that the transport department, one of the major contributors to the revenue resources to the Andhra Pradesh State exchequer, fell short of its revenue generation target for the fiscal year 2019-2020 due to the slowdown of the automobile industry and recent lockdown.

In the 2018-19 fiscal year, the revenue collection for the transport department was 3,204 crore. The department earned a revenue of 3,003 crore in the current (2019-2020) fiscal till February. The department expected to good revenue in March 2020, but the lockdown has hit their hopes.

The Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association of India (FADA) has approached the SC for an extension for the sale and registration of the BS-IV vehicles saying that the lockdown has failed to clear the BS-IV inventory. The case is likely to come up for hearing on Friday.

The Supreme Court ordered that the deadline for registration of Bharat Stage IV (BS-IV) vehicles is March 31, 2020 and from April 1, 2020, only BS-VI category vehicles will be allowed for registration

If a person has no travel history in the last one month and has not been in direct contact with any suspected case of Covid-19 but still develops fever, cough and cold and fatigue, it is likely that the patient is suffering from a viral fever or the flu but chances of Covid-19 acquired through secondary sources cannot be ruled out, said doctors.In such cases, the person should self-isolate, not come in contact with family and dial 108, stating his location and health condition, advised district medical and health officer (DMHO) in-charge Dr K Vijayalakshmi.“Once 108 service is called, our Rapid Action Team consisting of a medical officer will visit the house and bring the case to King George Hospital (KGH) or Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH/Government Chest Hospital) and admit the patient. After testing, if the person is found to be Covid-19 negative and only suffering from usual viral fever, paracetamol tablets and required medicines will be prescribed and the patient will be sent home,” Dr Vijayalakshmi added.The DMHO in-charge further said, “If it is found that the person is suffering from dengue, flu or other ailments, the patient has a choice to get admitted either in the government hospitals like KGH or go to a private hospital.

MUMBAI: Two 65-year-old women in Mumbai, both without any apparent travel history, have succumbed to Covid-19, taking the state’s death toll to five. On Thursday, eight patients tested positive from the state, three from Sangli and one each from Mumbai, Sindhudurg, Nagpur, Kolhapur and Pune. Maharashtra now has 130 cases but was overtaken by Kerala (137) on Thursday as the state with the most cases.One of the two women who died was a Govandi resident, the other was from central Mumbai. The death of the Govandi woman has triggered a frantic contact tracing mission as she had visited at least three hospitals before succumbing. Her positive test reports arrived after her family had carried out her final rites. As per WHO, a stringent protocol has to be followed to cremate an infected person which involves carrying the person’s remains in a leakproof body bag and minimal contact with others.The second woman who died was reportedly a food (dabba) vendor who catered to clients working in nearby corporate offices. Soon after she was admitted to Kasturba on March 23, civic officials began a contact tracing exercise and reached out to a dozen people. The woman was a known case of diabetes and hypertension and had complained of breathlessness at the time of admission to Kasturba. While civic officials confirmed her death, they didn’t comment on how she could have got the infection. “Leave alone international, she has not done domestic travel,” said a civic official. Seven people from her family are believed to be under home quarantine.The Govandi woman’s reports came positive while she was admitted at NMMC hospital in Vashi on Wednesday. NMMC medical health officer Dr Balasaheb Sonawane said, “The woman was suffering breathlessness and her kin took her to Tandon hospital in Chembur late on Tuesday. At 1.30am on Wednesday, doctors at Tandon referred her to Kasturba as she was symptomatic. But instead her kin took her to Dr DY Patil hospital. There too, doctors referred her to the civic hospital in Vashi. But by the time she reached here, she was critical and succumbed on Wednesday evening. But we had sent her swab sample to Kasturba and the report came positive on Thursday morning. But her kin had already taken away her body on Wednesday for cremation.” NMMC has served DY Patil hospital a show-cause notice for referring a patient without protocol.Sonawane said, “The Tandon hospital administration should have informed BMC’s health department about the patient being symptomatic instead of directly sending her to Kasturba. We have the mobile number of the woman’s family member, probably her daughter, but calls are not being received. We need to trace her family members to quarantine them. During lockdown, she might have been brought in an ambulance from Tandon hospital to Nerul. So even the ambulance driver will have to be quarantined. We are coordinating with BMC officials to trace the family.”In Mumbai, two doctors have tested positive in the last few days. While it’s unclear how one of the doctors contracted it, the other had come in contact with an individual who had returned from Italy. Two more patients were discharged from Mumbai on Thursday. In all, ten in the city have been discharged.Of the other cases, the patient from Sindudhurg was in contact with a person who tested positive and they had travelled together in a train. The person from Nagpur has a travel history to Delhi, and it is not yet clear if he has a travel history abroad. The three in Sangli who tested positive are part of 12 members of a family that have tested positive.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74838232,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-26572,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/two-65-year-old-women-without-any-travel-history-die-in-mumbai/articleshow/74838231.cms

The trio is undergoing treatment in a private hospital and is said to be stable.Unlike most other coronavirus positive patients in Mumbai, the doctor didn’t have a travel history. BMC officials didn’t officially confirm the case, but told TOI that apart from practising in his own clinic, he also consulted in two hospitals nearby. The civic body has started a contact tracing exercise.One of the hospitals where he is likely to have consulted after developing mild symptoms has collected the names of 60 patients and handed it to the BMC. Incidentally, in the same hospital, the doctor had treated an influenza H1N1patient who tested negative for Covid-19.The hospital in the western suburbs said the doctor had taken leave around two days after developing cough and fever. “On his last day here, he had checked around 20 patients in the OPD and another 20-odd in the wards. The resident medical officer and a nurse who had worked with him on that day have been put under home quarantine,” said a senior management official of the hospital, adding that BMC has sanitised the room where he consulted and the building premises.His 43-year-old wife and 20-year-old daughter also tested positive. His son’s report was negative. “His brother lives nearby and was tested but his report is negative.

470,['27/03/2020'],Covid scare now becomes children’s nightmares,"MUMBAI: A few days after school closed, the nightmares began. Eight year-old Jahnavi (name changed) would arrive at her parents’ bedroom at 3am, saying she was scared. “This went on for three days. Then she finally said she had been getting a stomach ache in the evenings and was scared she had contracted the coronavirus ,” said her mother, who works in an advertising agency.Last week, 12-year-old Advay (name changed) had a panic attack. “He suddenly said he couldn’t breathe. After he calmed down, he told us he was scared that we (his parents) would be killed by the coronavirus,” said his mother, who teaches in an international school.With the pandemic shutting down schools and offices and news about its spread and impact being discussed non-stop in homes, the anxiety is leaving its mark on children. As parents discuss the death toll, panic about how to keep the disease at bay and whether their groceries are running out, children cannot escape its impact.Long before schools closed down, Covid-19 was already on everyone’s radar. “I was scared to go to school. If someone sneezed on me, I thought I was going to get it,” said nine-year old Jahaan (name changed). He refused to go down to the building garden, much before the lockdown was declared.The biggest change after the lockdown is social isolation: no school, hanging out with friends or playing downstairs. “Suddenly the whole normality has changed. Children don’t go to school and their parents, who may have been working, are at home all the time,” said Dr Alka Subramanyam , associate professor of psychiatry at BYL Nair Hospital.Children are bound to be affected by the anxiety displayed by parents, psychiatrists say. “I have been inundated by calls from friends and clients who either think they have it or are not doing enough to prevent it. Not sleeping, having paranoid thoughts and so on,” said Kersi Chavda , consultant psychiatrist and former president of the Bombay Psychiatric Society It’s best to tell children simple facts, said Chavda. “We can tell them these germs have come to our city from other countries and we have stay home for some time to be safe. End on a positive note, saying it will certainly get better,” added Chavda.“It’s important to limit corona-time so the child is not exposed to this all day,” said Subramanyam. “Among the big triggers for children are visual images. Even during 9/11, children who watched images on television were more prone to stress,” she added.“A routine is vital to normalise things during an abnormal period. Also, we should not focus so much on schoolwork during this time. Instead, parents should reassure children and spend quality time with them. The emphasis should be on getting through this together as a family,” advised Subramanyam.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-scare-now-becomes-childrens-nightmares/articleshow/74838254.cms

The Covid-19 outbreak — which started in Wuhan in China in December 2019 — is still an “imported” disease in Maharashtra, with 66% of the patients having an international travel history.Most of them had travelled from the UAE and the US, followed by Saudi Arabia , and the UK. Another 29% of patients came in contact with affected travelers. The contact and travel history of seven people couldn’t be conclusively established, said the report of the analysis. Among travellers, a big chunk of cases have come from the UAE.In fact, the state’s index patients were from agroup of 40 people who had travelled to Dubai and Abu Dhabi on a six-day trip. At least 15 of the group members have tested positive so far. This is the first such analysis done by the state and it shows that 16 patients are over 60 years, including three who are over 70. The positive patients also include 10 who are under 20 years (two of them under 10).The state registered 130 positive cases and five deaths as of Thursday. Senior state officials said the analysis held no surpri ses and reflects the trend across the world. “People in the 30-50 age group are the ones who travel abroad for work, and are predictably the largest group in Maharashtra’s Covid-19 patient pool so far. So mobility is clearly the big factor here,’’ said Dr TP Lahane, who heads the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). Dr Shashank Joshi, dean of the Indian College of Physicians, said the 31-50 age group have emerged as the “superspreaders” across the world. “They get infected and spread it within the community.It is the senior citizen group we need to focus on as they suffer high mortality,” he said. Studies emerging from China, Italy and the US — some of the countries worst affected by the pandemic — have shown that the majority of the patients are men. In Maharashtra, too, only 31% of the patients are women. “The week-wise graph of the number of cases shows that India has entered the crucial phase. Into the eighth week of the epidemic, we have 600 cases but the experience in other countries shows that this is where the exponential rise occurs,” said a senior state health official.Mumbai, expectedly, has emerged as the district with the highest number of cases. “That was bound to happen. The city is a hub of travellers.

KALYAN: A 25-year-old Dombivli resident testing positive for coronavirus has sent the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) into a tizzy as he had mingled with at least 1,000 guests at his brother’s wedding on March 19. His report came in on Wednesday.

The youth, who works in a multinational company, had gone on a trip to Turkey with 21 of his friends. He returned home on March 15, and four days later attended his brother's wedding in Dombivli.

The civic health department has started tracking all local residents and relatives who attended the wedding as well as the 21 friends who had accompanied him on the Turkey trip to be tested for the coronavirus. Till Thursday evening, they examined at least 5,300 people for symptoms.

The patient is undergoing treatment at Kasturba Hospital. Three members of his family are also undergoing tests there, said sources.

According to sources, around 1,000 guests attended the March 19 function despite the state government's notification which had banned the gathering of over 50 people in one place, including weddings, to curb the spread of the virus.

A civic health official said that after the wedding, the youth started exhibiting symptoms of Covid-19—cough and fever—and he went to a nearby hospital, where doctors examined him and immediately sent him to Kasturba Hospital.

His report, which came in on Wednesday, showed that he had tested positive for coronavirus. Kasturba officials shared the information with the KDMC, which sprung into action and sanitized the entire locality and started conducting medical checkup of all residents.

Till date, six people have tested positive for coronavirus in the Kalyan-Dombivli city. While two of them were discharged after recovery, four are still undergoing treatment. Of the six patients, three had contracted the infection after coming in contact with those with international travel history, said sources.

476,['27/03/2020'],Centre revises lockdown guidelines to allow vet hospitals to remain open: States issue passes to feed strays,"NEW DELHI: Realising the threat posed by hungry stray animals, especially dogs, in residential areas due to lack of food during the lockdown period, mny states, including Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu , Karnataka and Goa, have stepped in to issue passes to individuals to feed such animals.

Besides, the home ministry has also revised its lockdown guidelines to allow veterinary hospitals and pharmacies to remain operational during the period. The move will help take effective action to prevent animals from suffering without medical aid.

The addition to the guidelines came after the the issue was flagged by Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) and many animal rights groups and individual including BJP MP and former Union minister Maneka Gandhi.

Maneka even issued an appeal, saying street dogs, cows and birds can neither get nor transmit coronavirus. “However in the event of a lockdown, if they are not fed, many will die creating another kind of serious problem,” she said while asking all animal welfare workers to feed the animals during this period.

Animal rights groups believe that hungry stray animals, including street dogs, may turn aggressive and pose danger if they are left without food.

Welcoming the move, Gauri Maulekhi , trustee of People for Animals (PFA), said, “We are grateful that the central government has taken timely steps.”

She said, “Aggravating the Covid-19 troubles, avian influenza is plaguing several states and large-scale culling of poultry birds is being done. The PPR (Peste des petits ruminants - also known as goat plague) among goats is spreading in Bihar, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand , and herds are getting wiped out. Animal and veterinary hospitals being shut down at such a time will add to the problem of dying, diseased and injured animals and rotting carcasses.”

Several states have started issuing passes to animal feeders. All individuals who get such passes may now go out and feed animals and birds during the lockdown period.

AWBI too wrote to chief secretaries of states and UTs, saying feeding street animals is a valuable service which is consistently being provided by compassionate individuals.

In his letter, AWBI’s chairman O P Chaudhary flagged that the absence of the practice of feeding street animals may cause a large number of animals and birds to suffer and die, and carcasses may spread different diseases which will be difficult to control.

477,['27/03/2020'],Virus alters logistics of final farewell,"MUMBAI: Never in his 18-year career had Dion Pinto conducted a funeral with no immediate family members of the deceased present. But the undertaker had to do it on Tuesday for a 99-year-old woman whose children are all based abroad and couldn’t come down for the funeral as flights have been cancelled. Two of her relatives were the only mourners present.

Covid-19 has not only upended airport departures, but also final departures. The logistics of grief, too, is virally changing shape as the dead are quietly making their way from the hospital or home to cremation grounds in ambulances bereft of mourners.

Over the past week, Nitesh Mehta, who runs ‘Sarvapooja’, has fulfilled an unprecedented request from at least 15 families. “They asked me to arrange for the body to be fetched directly from the hospital as they were wary of risking infection by getting the body home or holding a ceremony,” says Mehta, who had to hire private ambulance drivers at the last minute to do the job as not many are ready to work amid the scare.

The lockdown has also affected the export of remains. “With flights shut, our daily bookings have come down from eight to about five,” says Pinto, adding that funerals have shrunk from sixhour-long affairs to quick ceremonies that take less than an hour.

Funerals are mutating in the face of the virus . Nitin Paranjape , a pandit, said he has stopped taking bookings for carrying out last rites completely as it’s “too risky”. Another pandit, Shailesh Dongre, said he wears a mask and does not touch the family of the deceased during the ceremony.

Muslim funeral processions have had to do away with namaaz read in the outer portion of the masjid before the body is taken to the cemetery. Masjids have been locked down so the namaaz has to be read at home. “A government notification allows not more than 20 people at the cemetery,” said Shabbar Kabli , administration officer at Mahim Muslim Kabrastan.

The hands that carry coffins and stretchers for a living, too, are scarce. “Fifty per cent of my staff has gone back to their hometowns and the rest are not keen on staying back either,” said Pinto. “The staff is trained on how to handle bodies, but not a virus,” Pinto added.

Antim Sanskar Seva, a not-for-profit service, stopped operations after March 22. “Our men are scared and have not reported to work since Monday,” says Ramnik Parekh, founder of the service. “Typically, there are about 60 to 100 family members at cremations but now that number has reduced to 10,” he says.

The seeding of Aadhaar numbers with bank accounts, also part of the Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile trinity, has created a delivery bridge that sends money into verified accounts of the poor with minimum leakage. There are also more than 25.5 crore beneficiaries linked through Aadhaar to the Centre’s Ujjwala LPG scheme.

There are 987 banks linked to the Aadhaar payment bridge with the number of transactions crossing 622 crore, establishing the durability of the system. The transactions have totalled more than Rs 276,000 crore. The MGNREGA transactions have crossed 77 crore, and the previous system of verifications and stages has been reduced, delivering as much as Rs 82,000 crore.

The DBT transactions relating to LPG-Pahal scheme have nearly touched 500 crore and the value is more than Rs 105,000 crore. DBT transactions relating to more than a dozen central schemes have touched 100 crore and the amount is almost Rs 120 crore.

The national social assistance programme has delivered more than Rs 7,500 crore and the amount under PM Kisan is almost Rs 5,500 crore.

The expansion of Aadhaarbased services has been rapid, gaining pace once the Supreme Court upheld its use in several sectors. The number of Aadhaars linked to bank accounts has crossed 68 crore.

MUMBAI: A 40-year-old woman allegedly committed suicide by jumping from her third floor residence in the Fort area on Thursday morning.

The deceased was a spinster, who lived with her 90-year-old mother. She used to work for a financial and banking services firm which has its office in Parel.

The police said that they had received a call in the morning about an injured woman lying in the locality and dispatched a police team to the spot. An officer said that the woman was taken to hospital where she was declared dead. A case of accidental death has been filed at MRA Marg police, station.

Deputy commissioner of police Sangramsinh Nishandaar said that according to the preliminary information they have received, the woman had left her home around 4am and returned around 5am.

“After that, she did not step out of the house. The incident took place within an hour after she returned-—between 5am and 6am,” said Nishandaar.

A couple of days before her death, she had similarly stepped out of home early in the morning and subsequently returned home, the police said.

The police said that the woman had had a petty domestic tiff with a neighbour a couple of days ago. She had left some food plates outside her room and had not picked them up for a couple of days, said an oficer. “This caused some problem to the neighbour and he had asked her to remove the plates,” said the police officer.

He said the deceased had also faced a crisis with a personal relationship. “We are also verifying this information,” he said.

The cause of death in the post-mortem report states there was evidence of contusion under the scalp with multiple injuries.

However, the final opinion has been kept pending. Also, there were fractures on the hand, head, skull and ribs, the provisional report has noted.

NOIDA: It seems like a rerun of Case No. 10 in Delhi — five of the 14 Covid-19 cases in Noida seem to go back to one source, a British citizen who was in India between March 15 and 19.

In Delhi, a woman who had returned from Saudi Arabia may have infected at least eight more, including her doctor, setting off a chain reaction.

In Noida, the first in this chain of infections was a 47-year-old woman who lives in a Sector 137 housing society. Neither did she have any travel history nor had she come in contact with anyone who had travelled. When health officials investigated her case, they found out her husband’s office had a visitor from the UK. He had been in contact with the visitor. The couple tested positive for Covid-19 on March 24 and their 21-year-old daughter tested positive on Thursday.

While this was playing out, another employee of the same company started showing symptoms. Both he and his wife, residents of Sector 150, tested positive. None of the five who tested positive had any recent travel history. A health official said employees of the company had said the visitor from the UK “seemed symptomatic” when he was here.

“The company staff told us he had fever and cough when he was in India. We had sent an email about his testing in London, but were told he is healthy and has not been tested,” chief medical officer Anurag Bhargava said.

To stop the chain of transmission, the hotel where he had stayed and the societies where the couples who tested positive live have been sealed and sanitised. “No one from our staff has reported any symptom,” the hotel manager said.

The district administration, meanwhile, is trying to map the contact points. “We are checking for suspected cases and carrying out sanitisation,” said district magistrate BN Singh. About 750 people are being monitored — 19 who came in direct contact with the five patients, and 150 employees and their families — and told to keep an eye out for symptoms.

KOLKATA: A 48-year-old man was shot at and injured following a drunken brawl on Lake View Road in south Kolkata on Thursday afternoon. Pintu Das, a resident of Sarat Banerjee Road, is admitted to SSKM Hospital with a bullet wound on his right leg and is said to be out of danger.

Police have arrested the two accused — identified as Tinku Das, 40, and Joy Das, 30, both neighbours of the victim and having criminal antecedents — and registered an attempt to murder case against them.

They have launched a hunt for the person who arranged liquor for the accused during lockdown.

According to local residents, a gunshot around 12.30pm prompted them to call police. Joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma said the three men were boozing near Lake Camp 2 when Tinku and Joy picked up a fight with Pintu. “Tinku fired at Pintu from his single-shot gun. The victim was taken to MR Bangur Hospital and then referred to SSKM,” Sharma said, adding that the firearm had been seized.

484,['27/03/2020'],Feeling depressed? Citizens can call this helpline soon,"Rajkot: Amid the lockdown, people are now reporting of having psychological problems after they are being forced to stay cooped up inside their homes and flats. This has also led to many starting to have anxiety stress and panic attacks resulting in frequent fights with spouses or family members.

Looking at the increasing stress levels, the Rajkot district administration has launched a helpline on Thursday to counsel people who are disturbed or feeling stressed out mentally. While the main aim is to counsel people complaining of anxiety while in home quarantine, the helpline will also offer its services to general people too.

Talking to TOI, the nodal officer for this project, Janaksinh Gohil said, “People are social animals and when they are now being isolated, they are panicking which is making them hyper or stressed out. Some kept under home quarantine also fear of being tested positive of Coronavirus. This helpline will try to allay their fears through counseling.”

The helpline has five numbers which have been set up in the collector’s office – three with outgoing and two with incoming facilities. The experts will call up such people on home quarantine and counsel them while anybody from the general public can also call up if they require any psychological assistance.

A team of 60 people including 15 psychiatrists, professors and lecturers of psychology department of Saurashtra University and government authorized counselors of social welfare department will remain present to attend the helpline calls on shift-wise duty.

Dr Devjyoti Sharma, a Kutch-based psychiatrist said: “There is a possibility of increasing tension among couples as they have to stay together for longer period of time now. But they need to remember each other’s positive points in such trying times. People are also stressed owing to the uncertainty, loss in business due to the lockdown besides the future economic situation.”

485,['27/03/2020'],"Coronavirus Cases Kolkata: 66-year-old is 10th Covid-19 case in Kolkata, has no travel history","KOLKATA: A 66-year-old man has tested positive for Covid-19 taking the total count of infected in the state to 10. According to the patient’s family, he has no travel history — either abroad or outside Bengal — and did not come in contact with any Covid-19 patient, setting alarm bells ringing in medical circles.The former Coal India employee, who lives in Nayabad, is undergoing treatment in the ICU of a private hospital off EM Bypass and his condition is critical. He was put on ventilation support on Thursday evening. Doctors have also put him on anti-retroviral drugs used in the treatment for HIV. This is the first time that this drug is being used on a Covid-19 patient in the state.“The patient’s condition is stable but critical. His oxygen saturation is low and he is on ventilation support. We are trying hard to salvage him,” said Dr Sudipta Mitra, of Peerless Hospital, where the patient is admitted.The patient was brought to the hospital on March 23 with complaint of fever and respiratory distress and admitted in the isolation ward. His swab samples were first sent to IPGMER and then to ICMR-NICED for confirmatory test. Both results turned out to be positive.Family members said the senior citizen had attended a family wedding in Midnapore’s Egra on March 13. “There were none among the guest who had travelled to the affected parts of the world or anyone who had returned from another state,” the patient’s son claimed.The patient’s wife, son, daughter-in-law and four year-old grand-daughter has been taken to the New Town quara-ntine Centre and their swab samples are being tested. The East Midnapore district administration is in touch with his relatives in Egra, who have also been put under home isolation. “All of them are stable and did not display any symptoms. They have been advised strict home isolation. A police picket along with a medical team has been stationed there. We are also reaching out to all guests at the wedding and advising them home isolation. Periodic reports are being sent to the state control room,” a senior officer said. The patient reached Egra on March 12 to attend the wedding of his nephew. More than 300 guests attended the wedding the next day. He started feeling feverish from March 14. When the fever did not subside even after medication, his blood samples were tested in Egra itself.“The reports came positive for typhoid. In addition to the fever, my father started suffering from sore throat, cough and breathing distress. That is why we brought him to the Kolkata hospital straight from Egra,” said the son, an engineer by profession. He said they travelled in their personal car and drove straight to the hospital where the patient is admitted.“Thank God we brought him straight to this hospital where doctors started treating him in the isolation ward from day one. Had we admitted him in a local hospital in Midnapore, the ramification in terms the transmission of infection would have been greater,” said the son. “I have signed the consent form allowing doctors to use anti-etroviral drugs. I am optimist of a positive outcome,” he added.Doctors at Sawai Man Singh Hospital in Jaipur were the first to start using a combination of Lopanavir and Ritonavir on some Covid-19 patients, including an Italian. On Thursday, a government hospital in Kochi, too, declared a British national free of the virus after the patient was put on the anti-HIV drug.“In HIV positive patients, this combination drug inhibits the growth of virus along with bringing down its virulence. Though a wider trial on its efficacy on Covid-19 patients should have been ideal, the situation is not ideal for such trial due to the current scenario,” said a clinical pharmacologist.The hospital medical team involved in the treatment of the patient have also been put on hydroxyl-chloroquine that has recommended by ICMR as a preventive medication for high-risk contacts of a positive patient.“Our medical team dealing with the patient have been given full personal protective equipment right from day one,” said Mitra.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74838389,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-122203,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/66-yr-old-is-10th-covid-case-in-city-has-no-travel-history/articleshow/74837951.cms
486,['27/03/2020'],CM Mamata Banerjee writes to 18 CMs to help stranded West Bengal labourers,"KOLKATA: Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has written to as many as 18 of her counterparts urging them to provide food, shelter and medicine to labourers from the state stranded there due to the countrywide lockdown.

“Bengal has many workers — semi-skilled and unskilled — working in different parts of the country. Many of them could not return home and are stuck in different places following the COVID-19 lockdown in the country. I take the opportunity to request you to kindly ask your administration to provide them basic food, shelter and medical support in this hour of crisis,” Banerjee said in the letter on Thursday.

The CM made the request because it is not possible for the Bengal administration to reach out to these places during the lockdown. “We are getting SOS calls from them. They are generally in groups of 50-100 and can be easily identified by the local administration. My chief secretary will pass on the details of such people to your chief secretary to hasten the process. We in Bengal are taking care of people stuck in the state,” Banerjee wrote.

The situation is similar with Bangladeshi people stuck in Bengal and Indians in Bangladesh. On Wednesday, a family from Bangladesh had to ferry the body of a cancer patient who died at Thakurpukur Cancer Hospital to Dhaka via the Benapole border. Home ministry sources said over 2,300 Bangladeshi nationals left India and 400 Indians came back home from Bangladesh in the past three days.

The international and inter-state problems persisting, many labourers are stranded in different parts of Bengal. The Purulia administration arranged for a government bus to rescue a group of Murshidabad labourers on their way back home at Jangipur, who were stranded at Balarampur’s Tantia without food and shelter.

Ground reports from districts bear out the gravity of the Covid-19 threat. According to deputy chief medical officer of health Nadia II Asit Kumar Dewan, there are 27 fever cases in the district, bordering Bangladesh.

The Nadia administration has already sent 835 people to six quarantine centres set up in the district and has advised home isolation for 15,717 people. Chapra block medical officer of health Am-artya Pal said: “We have 1,158 cases in our block. They are under home surveillance.”

As many as 20,409 are in home isolation in Midnapore. Of them, 172 came from abroad while the remaining returned from other states. A total of 10,147 people in Purulia have been advised home isolation while 5,639 people are under surveillance in different blocks of Hooghly.

Health workers in districts are reaching out to panchayats to keep an eye on people in home isolation. “Many of these people are coming out of their homes, meeting friends and relatives, without even knowing whether they are (virus) carriers or not. We are requesting panchayats to arrange for their accommodation in vacant school buildings, Aila houses instead of keeping them at their homes,” a health worker said.

DO NOT EVICT ANY ONE AND CAUSE PANIC: KTR TELLS HOSTELS AND PGS

Even as almost all of Hyderabad went scurrying indoors after PM Narendra Modi announced the 21-day nationwide lockdown , thousands of anxious students and young professionals spilled out on to the streets of Hyderabad, bag and baggage. Evicted from their hostels and paying guest accommodations almost overnight, they were suddenly left with nowhere to go. No public transport and sealed state borders meant that they were left stranded and homeless in Hyderabad.That’s when news got out that Telangana Police was issuing ‘No Objection Certificates’ that would enable those stranded to get back home. By Wednesday afternoon, hordes of hapless youngsters started thronging police stations across the city demanding NOCs. After hours of waiting in queues — social distancing be damned — many of them managed to snag their copies.Their woes were far from over though. Armed with their NOCs, many hopped onto two wheelers or other private vehicles, and sped home. But their hope of reaching their towns/ villages were short lived as they were met with barricades at the AP border. Not only did the local authorities refuse to recognise this NOC, they also refused to allow the returning youth in, stating it’s a violation of the lockdown. Hours later, as the crowds at the borders increased, it was decided that those who came in will be quarantined for two weeks.Meanwhile, back here in Hyderabad, late on Wednesday, the Telangana Police directed all hostel and PG managements not to evict their occupants. “Since the lockdown is under implementation, no permission/ no objection certificate shall be granted in this regard for any movement of people across the state till further orders in the overall interest of public health and public safety,” Telangana Director General of Police (DGP) M Mahendar Reddy said in a directive, adding that strict action will be taken against hostels and PGs that violate this order.As this news spread, there was yet another mass migration from AP borders back to Hyderabad. Now, we have thousands of students and professionals who’ve been needlessly exposed to COVID-19 risk. Who’s to blame?Amidst the constant flip-flop between AP and Telangana governments, the biggest casualties were students and professionals who were stranded in between. Helpless, panic-stricken and far away from home, they say the uncertainty about their food and accommodation are their biggest concerns.“As my hostel was shut, I collected an NOC from Banjara Hills police station and headed to Guntur on my two wheeler. At 11.30 pm, I reached the border near Jaggayyapeta. When I flashed my NOC to the Andhra police, they asked me to wait as the border was sealed. Within a couple of hours, around 200 vehicles gathered at the border and traffic was piled up for almost 4 kilometres. Looking at the huge crowds that had gathered, I feared for my safety as there was potential for the virus to spread. I decided to drive back to my hostel,” shares Chaitanya Kumar, a student from Gandhi Nagar. “Luckily for me, my hostel allowed me to stay. However, they made it clear that they will not provide any food. I will need to fend for myself. With most of the eateries closed, it’s not easy but I’m grateful to at least have a roof over my head,” Chaitanya adds.Madhusudhan Kankatala, an IT employee from Gachibowli, had an equally stressful experience. “Ever since the lockdown was imposed, my parents were extremely worried about me and asked me to return home to Kurnool so that we can stay together during this lockdown period. I obtained an NOC from Kukatpally Police Station and headed home. To my utmost horror, despite having an NOC, I was not allowed inside by the AP Police . I waited for hours at the border before deciding to return to my hostel,” he says, adding, “Why were the NOCs issued in the first place if we were never going to be allowed to go home? The Telangana Police should’ve communicated with their AP counterparts before issuing these NOCs. They have only made matters worse for us in this extremely difficult period.”Many professionals who’ve come from other states to work in the city, are in an equally helpless situation. “I have been asked to vacate my PG accommodation in Gachibowli. With the country under lockdown and all modes of transport shut, I can’t even return home to Kerala. My parents are worried; I have nowhere to go. Thankfully, after the DGP’s directive, the owner has let us stay here for now, but there is no assurance regarding our meals. We are not sure when the meals might stop or when the owner might ask us to vacate. Times are really tough for those of us who are away from homes,” says Kavya B, an employee at a city-based IT firm.K Kotesh, another IT employee in Madhapur , says he was forced to vacate his PG, since the owner couldn’t afford to bear the expenses of running the place any longer. “The owner told me he cannot pay for groceries to provide meals or bear the cost of the electricity bill either, and told me to vacate immediately. Because I hail from Khammam, I somehow managed to return to my hometown, but there are many who are living thousands of miles away from home. What will they do? People must show some compassion during times like these,” he says.A similar sense of anguish echoes across college campuses in the city, with hundreds of students from other states left feeling helplessness. Imsanglanimchen, a student from Nagaland who is studying Ocean & Atmospheric Science at University of Hyderabad (UoH), says, “We started panicking when the admin asked us to vacate our hostels.

Luckily, we’ve been allowed to stay for now. We are getting basic food from the hostel mess but we don’t know how long this will last. The uncertainty is causing panic among the students.”Hostel owners, meanwhile, share that the only reason they are asking occupants to vacate the premises, is because they don’t have the economic means to run the hostels any more. T Subba Rao, who runs a hostel in Madhapur, says, “We pay a rent of Rs 2.20 lakh to accommodate 40 to 50 people in our hostels. However, only seven occupants now remain and it’s difficult for us to pay such a steep rent. Additionally, we need to pay power bill, water bill and Internet bill as well as salaries to the cook and other staff members. With such less occupants in the hostels, we don’t know how sustainable this will be. The police are asking us not to close hostels, but how can we run the hostel without funds? The government must support us.”Bharat Kumar, another hostel owner in Madhapur, echoes similar views. “With 90 per cent of our occupants vacating the hostels and going to their respective homes, it’s become difficult for us to pay the hostel rent as well as wages to our staff. We are hoping the government will help us maintain these hostels. Last night, many students who were on their way to AP, returned to our hostels. Since they would have mingled with so many people, now it’s it’s our responsibility to keep them under quarantine here. But without funds, it will be really hard.

NEW DELHI: No cities have been locked down, no transport closed and international entry is still open. Well, that’s South Korea which has not only managed to flatten the curve of rising coronavirus cases in the country but has done a remarkable job of fully curing 41% of its 9,137 infected citizens, keeping the death count at just 131 as on Wednesday.South Korea has discharged 3,730 of its 9,137 confirmed Covid-19 patients who have fully recovered, Dr Lee Wang-jun, CEO of Myongji Hospital and chairman of Korean Hospital Association , said on Wednesday at a specially organised webinar by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR). The video conference was organised by the UNDRR and the WHO for 900 disaster management and health specialists from 105 countries to learn from the Korean experience.Dr Lee explained the Korean strategy as containing four key policies. “The first policy is one of complete openness and transparency in sharing updated information on new infections through the Korean Centre for Disease Control , simultaneously with all stakeholders, including the media, on where, when and how the infections were discovered and investigated,” a UNDRR report said.The lessons learnt from the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in 2015 were handy, as a result there was no confusion among the public about the drills to be followed during a pandemic to avoid spreading the virus. “No cities have been locked down, no transport closed and international entry is still open,” Dr Lee said.The second policy was containment and mitigation — tracking all suspect cases and tracing all confirmed ones.Mitigation involved lowering the peak of the outbreak through a social distancing campaign introduced just after the big outbreak in Daegu at the end of February, Dr Lee said. Daegu, with a population of 2.5 million, reported 735 infections in a single day as against Seoul ’s 75 with a population of 25 million. Korea has managed to restrict the community spread of Covid-19 to Daegu with 85% of all cases. Though it decided to close all schools and imposed voluntary restrictions on large gatherings, no cities were put under lockdown.“The fourth policy promoted massive screening and fasttracking of suspect cases, underpinned by accelerated production of diagnostic kits with a weekly diagnostic capability of 430,000,” Dr Lee said.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74839116,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-121873,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/how-south-korea-won-the-battle-sans-lockdown/articleshow/74838315.cms
