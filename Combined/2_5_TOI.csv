0,['5/02/2020'],matthe udbhava: Pramod to play Udbhava’s Anant Nag for today’s milieu,"In 1990, director Kodlu Ramakrishna ’s film, Udbhava, which had Anant Nag in the lead, was a trendsetter of sorts. So, when the filmmaker announced a sequel to it, 30 years later, it raised a lot of eyebrows. The film, Matthe Udbhava is set for release this week, and according to its leading man Pramod , it is a follow up to the events of the original film. “After Geetha Bangle Store and Premier Padmini, I was looking for a film that would allow me to showcase what I am capable of as an actor. There were several offers, but I was a bit wary about taking on anything, as I had done a film that got stalled midway. I wanted to work on good films that would see the light of day. When Kodlu Ramakrishna sir approached me for a role in Matthe Udbhava, I was not sure whether to do it, considering that he comes from a different school of filmmaking. A friend suggested that I meet Kodlu sir and decide whether to do it or not. Once he narrated the script, I realised that this is exactly what I was looking for — a role that would let me showcase the actor in me,” says Pramod.Like Anant in Udbhava, Pramod’s character in Matthe Udbhava has a way with words and looks at using anyone he meets to his advantage. “He is a total opportunist. In fact, one of the action sequences in the film is for him to impress the heroine. At that point, there is no romance between them, and he sees her purely as a means to an end,” he says, adding, “The hero is not bad; he’s just street smart. I get to play Udbhava’s Anant for today’s milieu,” says the actor.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73934990,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-178631/73934990.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/pramod-to-play-udbhavas-anant-nag-for-todays-milieu/articleshow/73934990.cms

11,['5/02/2020'],Cabinet nod likely to all-weather port at Vadhavan in Maharashtra,"This story is from February 5, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet is likely to give its in-principle approval for an all-weather port at Vadhavan , 140 km north of Mumbai, which will be one of the top 10 container ports in the world.

Sources said the shipping ministry wants to start the work to develop this port during the next financial year, 2020-21. The container port with 20-metre draft will have capacity to berth world’s longest container ships. As per the plan, after developing the port, the shipping ministry will allocate berths to private operators under the public-private-partnership (PPP) mode.

The individual terminals can be given to private players through competitive bidding where they will be investing in berths, equipment and other utilities, sources said. The upcoming port has the potential to attract large ocean carriers given the deep water depth at the site and the close proximity to major industrial locations in the western region.

The Centre’s move to give in-principle approval to the project gains importance considering that the Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) in May last year had started ""internal discussions"" on building the new port at Vadhavan in Palghar district on the public-private-partnership (PPP) model and had cited delays in getting central government approval for the project.

13,['5/02/2020'],Deliver on promise of justice: Nakodar police firing victims' families to CM,"This story is from February 5, 2020

JALANDHAR: Families of four youths killed in the 1986 Nakodar police firing claimed on Tuesday that Punjab CM Amarinder Singh and Jalandhar MP Santokh Singh had promised them justice during the 2019 parliamentary polls, but did little to ensure it in the past year.

The families, flanked by human rights activists and members of Sikh groups, made the statement on the 34th anniversary of the incident in which policemen had fired at people protesting against the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib in a gurdwara of Nakodar. Addressing a press conference here, firing victim Ravinder Singh's father Baldev Singh, flanked by sisters of the other three victims, said former CM Parkash Singh Badal protected officers responsible for the firing and now CM Amarinder Singh's government was denying them justice. ""There are striking similarities between Bargari sacrilege-Behbal Kalan police firing case and the Nakodar case. In 1986 too, students were peacefully protesting after burning of Birs of Guru Granth Sahib in a gurdwara. In both cases, justice is being denied,"" he said.

Baldev said the Congress would meet the same political fate like that of Badals' if it did not deliver justice in the case.

Baldev said after former MLA H S Phoolka and Kharar legislator Kanwar Sandhu raised the issue in the Punjab assembly last year, sleuths of state intelligence department approached him to talk about compensation. ""I told them to arrange a meeting with the CM, so that I could tell him how the four young Sikhs were gunned down. One them was killed in police custody. Police had even refused to give their bodies for cremation,"" he said.

He said they could procure one part of the Justice Gurnam Singh Commission's report, which was formed by the then Surjit Singh Barnala government to probe the incident, but the second part of the report had gone missing.

He said the second part contained affidavits and statements of witnesses which incriminated police officers. ""It is not available in Punjab assembly records. We have been chasing other files related to the case too, but crucial records have gone missing. Punjab government should order a time-bound probe to prosecute officers and find out how the second part of the probe could go missing,"" he said.

Advocate Satnam Singh Bains, who has been working on Punjab Documentation and Advocacy Project, said when reports of even the British period were available in records or archives, it was difficult to understand how reports and records of 1986 could go missing. ""Even General Dyer faced court martial. But, in this case, Punjab Police officers were allowed to go scot-free, even as they killed four youths in firing without any provocation. The British government gave compensation to the victims of Jallianwala Bagh,"" he said. ""In this case also, state government should announce a compensation and order a time-bound probe,"" he added.

Paramjit Kaur Khalra and other activists of Khalra Mission Organisation, Punjab Human Rights Organisation general secretary Gurbachan Singh, and Alliance of Sikh Organisations leader Sukhdev Singh were also present at the conference.

Our last collaboration (Aashiqui 2, 2013) had resonated well with the audience, and we didn’t want to do something similar in our second outing together. I am glad that Mohit sees me differently, and offered me Malang, which has action in it. I have grown up watching action movies. That’s my first love! I enjoy watching action stars like Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jackie Chan and Jean-Claude Van Damme. In fact, I was a karate kid, with good jumping and attacking skills. I think action is in my blood.Acting is something that I stumbled into. I was a VJ, who casually auditioned for London Dreams (2009), and surprisingly bagged the role. From then, one thing just led to another. Since I never planned to become an actor in the first place, there was no thought about genres at all. I wasn’t even sure what to pick up and what not to, I just kept taking up whatever came my way. It is only after Aashiqui 2 that I realized acting is what I want to do. The films that worked for me have been from the romance and drama genres, and so, I was offered similar films. No one ever thought that I could do action films, and personality-wise, I don’t come across as someone who could like action, so I guess I wasn’t approached for such roles. I have been waiting for an opportunity to perform action, and when Mohit offered me Malang, I jumped with joy. I needed to build my physique to look convincing on screen while beating up 30 people. I worked on it and this is the end product.Yes, absolutely. Mohit gave me my first lead role and the character struck a chord with the audience. With Malang, he is showcasing another side of me. I think Mohit brings out these sides of me, which even I am unaware of. He is a very special person in my life.I don’t really care about fashion. I like to look good, but I end up wearing the same things. Of course, I am not saying that I will dress up like this forever, I do leave room for improvement. As far as being an introvert is concerned, I resisted social media for the longest time. I finally took the plunge after my team members told me how important it is to be active online. However, after being active initially, my interest has fizzled now. I don’t feel obligated to be active on social media, I do it when I feel like it. I am not in it for the number of followers. I am active on social media during film promotions, as it is part of my job. Being in the public eye all the time tires me. Therefore, there are times where I disappear, rejuvenate and do things I like to do, away from the public glare. I don’t know if I will ever want to give away that part of my life.I am still trying to understand the repercussions of not being as active on social media. I would want to strike a balance. It is not that I am socially awkward, or that I have a problem talking in front of people, it’s just that I don't find myself being gregarious all the time. However, I don’t want to enter a space where my career is getting affected by it. I don’t want to be ‘out of sight, out of mind’.Working with Anil sir has been like attending a master class. His energy and passion for acting are infectious. He loves working, learning and being the best version of himself. If he is working with a young team, he makes it a point to learn something from them. On the first day of the shoot, he asked me what I was eating. I was on a strict diet for this film, and when I told him that, he took the number of my caterer. The next day, he came on the set and told me, ‘Hey, I am on your diet. I am feeling much healthier’. I was surprised to see his enthusiasm. I just hope to be as dedicated as he is. Though he is a senior, he wanted to hear, rather than being heard on the set. He wanted Mohit to direct him, he wanted to be told things.Now, that’s been an amazing experience. Working in a movie that has (Mahesh) Bhatt saab coming back to direction after a gap of 20 years. is surreal. The film also stars his daughters Pooja (Bhatt) and Alia (Bhatt), and even Sanjay Dutt, who is like his brother. The set feels like a sacred place. I also feel that I am a much better person and a much better actor after working with him. I joined the film after a few days after it went on floors, and Bhatt saab knew that I was jumping on a moving train as an actor. When you join in a little late, the others are already in the thick of things. However, he guided me and got me in sync with the rest of them in no time.Let it remain a mystery whether I am single or not (laughs!). As far as Diva is concerned, I don’t know how our meeting over dinner was taken out of context. Both of us, at different occasions, have rubbished these rumours. Following reports about my impending wedding, my mom asked me, ‘Is there something I should know?’ and I told her, ‘No!’. Diva and I have been friends for a while, but there’s nothing more to it.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73933794,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-37920/73933794.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/aditya-roy-kapur-i-dont-come-across-as-someone-who-could-do-action-but-it-is-my-first-love/articleshow/73933794.cms

BHOPAL: Coronavirus scare has affected the tourism industry in Madhya Pradesh . After the outbreak of the viral disease, large number of bookings of Chinese nationals were cancelled suddenly in Khajuraho leading to almost 15% decline in the tourist footfall.India on Sunday also temporarily suspended e-visa facility for Chinese travellers and foreigners residing in China in view of the coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 400 people, infected over 20 ,000 others and spread to 25 countries.This year the number of foreign tourists also declined and the tourism industry attributed the drop in the footfall to the ongoing unrest over pro and anti CAA ( Citizenship amendment act) agitations across the country. Archaeological survey of India (ASI) sources in Khajuraho said, “ this year there is a general decline in both foreign and domestic tourists.”This year there was a “ very good” flow of Chinese tourists to Khajuraho. They were following Delhi, -Jaipur- Agra- Orchha -Khajuraho -Benaras circuit, said Mahendra Sharma , owner of a hotel in Khajuraho and office bearers of the hotel owners association at the international tourist centre.“ This was a new trend for Khajuraho and Orchha that a large number of Chinese nationals were arriving when the number of international tourists went down”, he said adding, “ in every 100 international tourists, the number of Chinese would be 10 to 20. Recently there was a group of 300 also.”Balbeer Goutam, president of the Guide association of Khajuraho said, “ I deal with French tourists and there numbers declined unprecedently this year. Chinese tourists compensated the shortfall to some extent and I would use my skills in English to explain the temples and their history to them.”“But”, he paused and added, “ as the luck would have it, they too stopped coming because of the corona outbreak.” Only those who had already reached India before the trouble started visited Khajuraho and appreciated its beauty, he said.One of the world heritage sites, Khajuraho temples are looked after by the ASI which include their conservation and entry of tourists.",bhopal,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73945470,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-250667,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/coronavirus-scare-hits-tourism-industry-in-madhya-pradesh/articleshow/73945336.cms

GREATER NOIDA: Chinese nationals employed by automobile companies – even those stationed in India for weeks – will give the Auto Expo a miss amid rising apprehension in India over the coronavirus outbreak. The decision was taken, at virtually the last minute, as automakers feared that the presence of Chinese nationals may discourage visitors from coming to their pavilions. Also, concerns expressed by government officials during interactions may have prompted the companies and event organisers to take the unprecedented step.The decision means that hundreds of Chinese nationals who were slated to visit the event (which opens for media tomorrow and for the public from Friday) will now sit in their hotel rooms in Delhi, Gurgaon and even Greater Noida (which hosts the expo), but not enter the Expo venue.More than 20% space, or over 8,000 sq m of the total 40,000 sq m at the Expo, has been reserved by Chinese companies. These include top companies such as SAIC (China’s biggest seller and owner of MG Motors), FAW (entering through the Haima brand), Great Wall Motors (largest Chinese SUV maker), and BYD (maker of electric buses and batteries). Apart from them, many smaller Chinese companies have also partnered Indian makers and thus would have been present at the Expo.“As a proactive measure, Great Wall Motors has decided to excuse Chinese officials from visiting the Expo. We believe in taking utmost caution when it comes to local concerns and ensuring safety of those visiting our pavilion,” Hardeep Singh Brar , director (sales & marketing) of the company, told TOI. The company has decided to cancel the fam-visit of a large contingent of Chinese journalists that it was getting to India, while also postponing the visit of its global president Wang Fengying.Siam, the organiser of the event, also confirmed that Chinese nationals will not be visiting. “All Chinese companies participating at the Expo have confirmed that their exhibit area would be manned by their Indian employees and representatives. None of these stalls would be manned by anybody who has come to India recently from China,” Siam president Rajan Wadhera said. “As all arrivals from China have now stopped, there will be no visitors and delegations from China at the Motor Show.”Siam itself is taking steps to apprise Expo visitors of the safety measures they need to take, and how to notice any symptoms of the coronavirus. It is also installing hand sanitizers at various places at the expo.MG Motors’ parent SAIC has also decided against getting any of the Chinese officials stationed at its India factory at Halol in Gujarat. Also, staff returning from China has been kept in single rooms and instructed not to share premises with others.Ankur Bhatia, Indian partner of China’s FAW and owner of Bird Electric, said that Indian officials are now being deployed to man the booths. “Many of the Chinese staff are actually trying to even fly back home as they fear that travel advisories against the country may keep them stranded here for long.”The absence of Chinese officials will mean that meetings fixed by Indian parts suppliers, and other partners, will not take place now. “It will have to be undertaken at some other time. We had no other option but to postpone,” Bhatia added.A parallel component fair, that accompanies the vehicles expo, will also not have visitors from China. “Around 30 companies from the Chinese group have confirmed that their stand at components expo (at Pragati Maidan in New Delhi) would be managed by their Indian counterparts in their absence. As travel of Chinese nationals to India has now been stopped, there will be no representatives from China at the show,” components body ACMA said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73949827,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-170871,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/amid-coronavirus-fear-chinese-executives-to-give-auto-expo-a-miss/articleshow/73945487.cms

NEW DELHI: The Centre has told the Supreme Court that women may not be suitable for command posts in the Army as male troops are not yet prepared to accept women officers. It also cited greater family demands and the danger of them being taken prisoner of war to oppose the plea of a few women officers for command posting after getting permanent commission.“The composition of rank & file being male, and predominantly drawn from rural background, with prevailing societal norms, the troops are not yet mentally schooled to accept women officers in command,” it said.It also said male and female officers cannot be treated on a par in the matter of postings because of their different physical standards and exposures, and reservations over exposing women officers to combat situations.Senior advocate R Balasubramanian and lawyer Neela Gokhale told a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and Ajay Rastogi that induction of women to such posts would change the dynamics of the armed forces. They contended physiological limitation is further accentuated by the “challenges of confinement, motherhood and childcare”.Opposing the Centre’s plea, Meenakshi Lekhi and Aishwarya Bhatti, representing the women officers, told the court that many of them displayed exceptional bravery in adverse situations. They informed the court it was Minty Agarwal who, as flight controller, had guided Wing Commander Abhinandan when he shot down a Pakistani F-16 for which she was awarded the Yudh Seva Medal . Earlier Mitali Madhumita was awarded the Sena Medal for her bravery when terrorists attacked the Indian embassy in Kabul.But the Centre said armed forces require sacrifices and commitment beyond the call of duty by the entire family of service personnel involving separation and frequent transfers, affecting the education of children and career prospects of the spouse. “...it is a greater challenge for women officers to meet these hazards of service owing to prolonged absence during pregnancy, motherhood and domestic obligations towards their children and families, especially when both husband and wife happen to be service officers,” it said.Balasubramanian told the court that the Centre is agreeable to permanent commission to women officers who have served up to 14 years in the Army but not above that. He said those above 14 years of service would be permitted to serve till 20 years without PC and those past 20-year service would be released with pensionary benefits.He said all aspects were considered by the Centre while formulating a policy, like national security and operational effectiveness, and it was difficult to allow women officers in command posts. He said it would be a situation of extreme physical, mental and psychological stress for the organisation and the government if a woman officer is taken PoW, and it is best avoided by keeping them away from direct combat.“Future wars are likely to be short, intense and lethal, besides being prosecuted at very short notice. The boundaries between conventional and counter insurgency/terrorist operations have blurred in the present hybrid nature of warfare. The non-linear battlefield has rendered the erstwhile rear areas as much vulnerable as the battlefront. Therefore induction of women officers into Indian Army , hitherto a male bastion, needs to be viewed in the perspective of changed battlefield environment,” he said.“The officers are expected to lead their men from the front and need to be in prime physical condition to undertake combat tasks. Inherent physiological differences between men and women preclude equal physical performance resulting in lower physical standards and hence the physical capacity of women officers remains a challenge for command of units,” the government said.But the bench also hinted that complete bar against women officers for holding command posts was not right and the Army should allow them as per organisational requirement and suitability.The court said there was resistance when women were being inducted in police force but they are doing extremely well. “A change of mindset is required with changing times. You need to give them opportunity and they will serve to the best of their capabilities,” the bench said.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73945686,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-673041,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/male-troops-wont-accept-women-commanders-government-to-sc/articleshow/73945673.cms

23,['5/02/2020'],Quess Corp: Quess who’s India’s largest private employer?,"BENGALURU: Next time you see an Amazon delivery executive in your locality or walk into a Samsung store for after-sales service, you will probably be dealing with an employee of Quess Corp — a company you most probably haven’t heard of.Going by its latest quarterly filing, the Bengaluru-based company, which provides staffing solutions for some of the biggest brands in the country, now has the largest roster of employees and associates — 3.85 lakh — in the private sector in India.Growing at 38% every year since 2016, Quess has shot past Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which remains the largest overall employer with 4.46 lakh on the rolls, but of whom about 90,000 are overseas, pegging its India workforce at about 3.6 lakh, according to people briefed on the matter. TCS does not provide a geographic split of its employee base and a company spokesperson declined to comment for the story.The development underlines a growing shift in the economy as companies like Quess have benefited from the demand for outsourced workers in areas ranging from e-commerce delivery to facilities management for commercial buildings.There is, of course, a significant difference in the skill levels of staff at TCS, which mostly employs engineers, and Quess, which depends largely on ‘grey-collar’ workers.Quess’s employees function as outsourced service providers for its over 2,000 clients, including Samsung, Amazon, Reliance , Vodafone India and Bajaj Finance , according to a report from ICRA. The company has about 5,000 workers overseas in markets like Singapore.“There are many countries which have a population smaller than the number of employees we have. The scale of our impact on the Indian job market is not well-known, especially the role we play in formalizing the job economy,” said Quess Corp's Group CEO Suraj Moraje, a former McKinsey & Co partner who joined the company in November.The development comes at a time when traditional sectors such as automobiles, telecom, FMCG and even IT services have seen layoffs for reasons like slowing growth and consolidation. At the same time, new economy companies continue to grow, fuelled by a record year of capital inflows.Investors tracking the space say the shift is happening not only because of the scarcity of jobs, but also because wages have increased substantially in the segment. “This area is exploding and these grey-collar jobs now have salaries which compare with entry-level compensation in IT/ITes companies,” says Anand Lunia, founding partner at venture capital firm India Quotient, adding that wages for delivery boys have risen faster than inflation over the last decade.Lunia was an early investor in Rebel Foods, which owns brands like Faasos and Behrouz Biryani, where salaries of delivery personnel are about Rs 20,000 – compared to Rs 6,000-7,000 in 2010, which inflation-adjusted, would have been about Rs 10,000-12,000 now.“Their aspiration is a steady job, which is a big reason why companies outsource these jobs since attrition is high and there is also not always a steady demand for these roles,” he said.According to Moraje, the average salaries at Quess range between Rs 12,000-Rs 40,000 for 70% of its workforce, about 75% of whom are in the age group of 21-35. While he declined to give an attrition number, the firm interviews over 1 million people a year. “We need to make sure that employees and associates have a career path so that our recruiting costs and retention rate improve,” he says. The company says it provides benefits such as provident fund and insurance to its entire workforce, and for many of them, this is their first formal employment.Quess, which was started by serial entrepreneur Ajit Isaac over a decade ago, has grown at a fast clip through a slew of acquisitions and the backing of Fairfax, owned by Canadian billionaire Prem Watsa . The company was listed in 2016. Local rival TeamLease, also based in Bengaluru, had about 2.28 lakh employees and trainees as of December 2019. Other major players in the space include global giants like Adecco and Randstand.“Companies are focusing on their core activities, while outsourcing activities that can be done by a specialised company; Quess Corp fits in there. Companies are wary of employing full-time when they can find gigs to fill in the jobs,” said Mahesh Vyas, MD & CEO at CMIE (Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy). He added that whether benefits are provided or not will be critical to measure if such employment are sustainable. “If a larger part of the labour force is getting into engagement that does not give social security, in a generation’s time, we could have a problem.”",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73951591,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-120950,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/quess-whos-indias-largest-private-employer/articleshow/73945892.cms

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said an attempt was being made to mislead people about the Union Budget as now critics had also come around to acknowledge that the Budget was the best which could have possibly been crafted in the challenging global economic situation.

“An attempt was made to mislead people about the provisions of the Budget but now even those who had criticised are praising it as the the best possible in the prevailing global economic scenario,” sources quoted Modi as telling members of the BJP parliamentary party.

The PM’s comments came on a day when the Sensex jumped more than 800 points and were seen as meant to motivate BJP MPs to defend the Budget against opposition attacks.

During his address to party MPs, Modi hailed the just-concluded Bodo accord and the agreement to settle members of the Bru-Reang tribe in Tripura, terming them “historic” successes of his government.

These would usher in an era of peace in the north-east which has suffered decades of bloodshed and violence, he said, adding that his government had also curbed Naxalism and boosted development in areas hit by extremist Left violence.

Modi said the northeast states used to see frequent blockades and ‘bandhs’ that would bring life to a standstill for days but things had changed for the better.

External affairs minister S Jaishankar and health minister Harsh Vardhan gave a presentation on the novel coronavirus, and how their ministries were dealing with the situation.

Father, brother say no AAP link

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police claimed on Tuesday that the 29-year-old man, Kapil Baisla (alias Gurjar), who had fired in the air at the Shaheen Bagh protest site while shouting pro-Hindu slogans on Saturday evening is an Aam Aadmi Party worker. This was confirmed by DCP (crime branch) Rajesh Deo.Baisla, who had been nabbed from the spot by the police, allegedly claimed during interrogation that he and his father, Gaje Singh , were members of AAP and had enrolled with the party in early 2019. The police claimed the crime branch had got deleted data from Baisla’s phone retrieved through forensic experts and found a series of photographs validating his alleged claims.The police denied allegations that it had leaked the photographs. Sources claimed that the photographs had been sent to Kapil Baisla by a third person, who had clicked them at the event. These images were also shared on a WhatsApp group, which has dozens of members.The photographs show AAP’s Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh putting the party cap on Baisla and the latter meeting AAP netas. It also had some pictures of Baisla posing with guns. The photographs are from 2019 and were saved on back-up. “Before reaching the spot, Baisla had logged off from WhatsApp and uninstalled it but he was asked to log back and the photographs were found saved in WhatsApp image folder,” said a source. Delhi Police’s SIT has now launched an investigation to establish if there was any kind of conspiracy. The Crime Branch has taken Baisla on a two-day remand and will interrogate him to find out if anyone had asked him to carry out the shooting. His father and brother are also expected to join the investigation. The police went to Baisla’s house but found the father missing. They had arrested his friend, Sarthak, on Tuesday for assisting him.DCP (Crime) Rajesh Deo said Baisla had said he had joined AAP along with a dozen other people, including his father, in early 2019. Cops said they had found several tweets by AAP workers on May 4, 2019 announcing Baisla’s father Gaje Singh, then the district president of BSP, and Baisla joining the party in presence of senior AAP members.However, Baisla’s father Singh and his brother, Sachin, who have gone missing, put out a video message from an undisclosed location, saying that they had nothing to do with AAP. “Every year during elections, a number of parties approach us and they make us wear their party cap or symbol as a mark of respect. We have nothing to do with AAP, this is being done to malign us. No one from our family has been with AAP,” said Sachin. Gaje said AAP netas had approached him during an election campaign and put their cap on him. “They had asked me to join, but I have nothing to do with the party. Even BJP had approached me but I refused them too,” he said.Meanwhile, police have established the sequence of events before the shooting. Baisla and Sarthak took the DND to reach Maharani Bagh from east Delhi’s Dallupura. They travelled on Baisla’s KTM bike. After reaching Shaheen Bagh, Baisla gave his phone to Sarthak and asked him to hand it over to his family.The cops have also identified the man who had supplied the pistol to Baisla seven years ago and a manhunt has been launched to nab him. Baisla’s interrogation reports cite him saying: “I had hidden the pistol in my trouser while travelling, but since it had become uncomfortable, I stopped and entered a bathroom at Holy Family Hospital and hid it under my jacket,” he said. Cops have booked Baisla and Sarthak for attempt to murder and under sections of the Arms Act.In Video: Shaheen Bagh shooter seen with AAP leaders in pictures recovered by Delhi Police",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73946324,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-913441,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shaheen-bagh-shooter-an-aap-worker-police/articleshow/73946333.cms

Representative image

NEW DELHI: The home ministry on Tuesday said the term ‘love jihad’ — popularly used to describe cases of allegedly forced inter-faith marriages — was not defined under existing laws and no such case had been reported by any central agencies.

In reply to a question by LS MP Behanan Benny asking if the government was aware of Kerala HC ’s observation that there was no case of ‘love jihad’ in the state, junior home minister G Kishan Reddy referred to Article 25 of the Constitution, which provides for freedom to profess, practice and propagate religion subject to public order, morality and health.

“Various courts have upheld this view, including Kerala HC. The term ‘love jihad’ is not defined under extant laws. No such case of ‘love jihad’ has been reported by any of the central agencies. However, two cases from Kerala involving inter-faith marriages have been investigated by the National Investigation Agency ,” he said.

The NIA had probed the case relating to inter-faith marriage of Kerala girl Hadiya, a Hindu who converted to Islam, to Shafin Jahan. It also probed a similar case of another Hindu girl from Kerala, Athira, who had alleged that she was being lured into embracing Islam.

NEW DELHI: Can the Nirbhaya death row convicts be hanged separately, since at least two of them have exhausted their mercy plea? Delhi high court may answer this question on Wednesday as it gives verdict on the Centre’s plea challenging the stay by a trial court on execution of the four convicts, since one of them had filed a mercy plea before the President.

After an urgent hearing on Saturday followed by marathon proceedings on Sunday, Justice Suresh Kumar Kait had reserved orders on the Centre’s plea arguing that pendency of the mercy plea of one convict in a case of multiple death row inmates can’t be used as a ground to stay hanging of those who have exhausted all available legal options or are yet to exercise it.

A day after the trial court postponed indefinitely the execution of the four men, the Centre and Delhi Police had challenged it, accusing the condemned prisoners of “testing the patience of the nation”.

Before the HC website reflected that judgment will be pronounced on Wednesday, Nirbhaya’s parents on Tuesday mentioned the issue before Justice Kait and pleaded for an expeditious decision.

The trial court on January 7, had issued black warrants for the execution of all the four convicts in Tihar Jail at 7am on January 22. But they could not be hanged due to pendency of mercy petition of one of them. Later on January 17, the trial court fixed February 1 for the hanging at 6am, but the court was forced to stay the execution again as the counsel for three convicts — Pawan Gupta , Vinay Sharma and Akshay Thakur — urged it to adjourn the matter “sine die” saying their legal remedies were yet to be exhausted.

While the mercy plea of Mukesh Singh and Sharma were rejected by the President, Gupta has not yet filed it even as Thakur’s mercy plea filed on February 1 is pending.

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta had contended it is a deliberate and calculated design of the convicts to “frustrate mandate of law” by getting their execution delayed and they were not entitled to any more time. But advocate AP Singh — appearing for Gupta, Thakur and Sharma — had opposed the petition questioning the “hurry to execute the death sentence in this case only... Justice hurried is justice buried.”

The counsel for the convicts also protested against the fresh plea wondering how it can be entertained when the Centre was never a party in the case proceedings before the trial court. Senior advocate Rebecca John, appearing on behalf of Singh, had said that the “Centre has sought the setting aside of the order of the Patiala House court” when “an earlier HC order has clearly said that any order of the trial court should be challenged in apex court only.”

Of the nearly 5.8 crore assessees who filed returns for the last fiscal, 55.4 lakh had claimed HRA, which is roughly 9.5% of the base. Within this, around 43 lakh had annual HRA of under Rs 1 lakh. Around 42,000 assessees had said their annual HRA was over Rs 4 lakh, or more than Rs 33,500 a month.Under the new regime proposed in the Budget, allowances such as HRA and LTA will be added to the income and taxed. Currently, these allowances are not counted while calculating the taxable income. Individuals are also allowed claim a deduction for home loans if living in the property.The government has maintained the new tax regime, which offers lower rates due to reworked slabs, but without exemptions , will benefit a large section of taxpayers. It has said taxpayers should work out calculations and decide if they want to move to the new system or stick to the existing one.On Sunday, the government had also said around 9% of taxpayers or 48 lakh availed of the Rs 2 lakh deduction for investments in provident fund, life or medical insurance. There were just around 3.8 lakh persons who had claimed exemptions of over Rs 4 lakh.Tax department officers said the government expected as many as 80% of tax assesses to shift to the new regime, after doing the calculations, as it made life simpler apart from lower rates. Officials said even those who may need to pay a marginally higher amount may be attracted by the lack of hassles in the flat rate.Government expects to take a hit of around Rs 40,000 crore based on this assumption. Officials have argued that a large number of taxpayers are not in a position to take advantage of all exemptions at the low levels of income. It was only the upper middle class and the rich who claimed the exemptions and that this segment will have the option to stick to the current regime.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73950333,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-483415,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/80-may-switch-tax-regimes-government/articleshow/73946716.cms

MUMBAI: The sensex rallied 917 points on Tuesday on the back of an easing of global crude prices and encouraging manufacturing data. Brokers said that the rally was also fuelled by global measures to control the coronavirus outbreak and short-covering after the 987-point fall post-Budget on Saturday.Tuesday’s surge in the BSE’s benchmark index was its sharpest gain since the thousand points-plus rally on September 23, 2019, after the government reduced the rate of corporate tax to 25%.After international crude oil prices moderated to $54.86 per barrel, the rupee firmed up 11 paise per US dollar. Oil prices eased as energy demand is expected to slip on the back of setbacks to trade in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. The sensex closed at 40,789, up 2.3% or 917 points, recovering its post-Budget losses. The NSE Nifty too firmed up to 11,979, rising 271 points.Data released by the government on Monday evening showed that manufacturing sector activity, as measured by the purchasing manager’s index (PMI) climbed to a near-eight-year high in January.Titan Industries, which declared its results on Tuesday, was the biggest gainer, rallying nearly 8%. Other top gainers were ITC, HDFC, Bajaj Finance and Tata Steel.“Markets are in a phase of pre- & post-adjustments to the Budget. 12,100 (for the Nifty) remains a key resistance zone on the upside, which looks difficult to be crossed on a sustainable basis at least in the first attempt,” said Manav Chopra, head of research-equity, Indiabulls Ventures Ltd.According to Umesh Mehta, head of research at Samco Securities , Saturday’s post-Budget crash was a knee-jerk reaction but as investors realised that the Budget would aid in the long-term growth of the economy, the market picked up. “With the Budget overhang gone, investors are breathing a sigh of relief and are back to making fresh calls. Additionally, January auto sales numbers were comparatively decent and with no other negative news, the Indian bourses saw a sudden rally today,” he said.Another positive for the equity markets was the rally in the government bond markets, which saw yields on government securities dip after the government announced that it would stick to its last year’s numbers despite a higher fiscal deficit this year.After the Budget, market attention is now shifting to the Reserve Bank of India ’s monetary policy meeting on Thursday. “The meeting will throw a light on the inflation trajectory as well as provide an economic outlook going forward. Further, the decline in oil prices and rupee appreciation is working in favour of the Indian markets. However, concerns regarding coronavirus still persist and we may witness volatility in the short-term,” said Ajit Mishra, VP-research, Religare Broking.Dealers believe that there would have been short-covering because despite the sharp rally, foreign investors made limited purchases.

31,['5/02/2020'],"Day 2: Protesters throw garbage on roads in Patna, dump carcasses","This story is from February 5, 2020

PATNA: The sanitation scenario in the state capital worsened as the Group-D employees of Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) continued with their strike on the second consecutive day on Tuesday.

Around 4,500 daily wage sanitation workers are on strike against the urban development and housing department (UDHD) decision to end the services of daily wage workers and outsource the sanitation work to some other company after March. Earlier, the department had decided to outsource the services from February 1 itself.

The workers staged protest at PMC headquarters in Maurya Lok Complex. They threw garbage on the busy thoroughfares, including Ashok Rajpath and Fraser Road, while people living in residential areas had to bear with the stink as the door-to-door waste collection remained suspended.

The protesters and members of Patna Nagar Nigam Staff Union (PNNSU) barged into the PMC office and dumped carcasses of dogs and pigs outside the chamber of mayor Sita Sahu and PMC commissioner Amit Kumar Pandey. They also removed the garbage bins and dumpsters from roadside at several locations in the city.

Hemant Kumar, a sanitation worker, said, “We are throwing waste on the road to draw the state government’s attention towards our demands.”

Residents of many areas had to cross the roads and streets littered with garbage and slush, overflowing dustbins and choking drains.

Priya Rathore of Kadamkuan said, “All the roadside bins have been removed. People have started throwing garbage on roadside. Where else we will throw the household garbage.”

Arshita Singh, a student of Shri Arvind Mahila College, complained that the residents were throwing garbage at college gate. “Pigs, cows and stray dog are roaming freely on roads. I have never witnessed such situation in the last four years. It is a government failure to keep the city clean and green,” she said

“Although garbage is collected from homes at old Patliputra Colony through private sanitation workers, it is just dumped outside the park. What is the point of allocating so much money in their budget when PMC can’t hire workers through outsourcing,” Rajat Kumar of Doctor’s Colony in Kankarbagh asked.

Suchita Choudhary, a resident of Boring Canal Road, said the municipal body should allocate a temporary space to dump garbage or else make temporary arrangement as dustbins in households were overflowing.

32,['5/02/2020'],Mayor meets minister in support of PMC workers,"This story is from February 5, 2020

PATNA: Amid sanitation workers’ strike for the second consecutive day on Tuesday, mayor Sita Sahu met urban development and housing department (UDHD) minister Suresh Sharma and demanded that Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) should be authorized to make Group-D appointments in the civic body under Section 38(B) of Bihar Municipal Act, 2007.

The mayor raised the concerns of agitating sanitation workers while submitting a charter of five demands to the minister and UDHD secretary Anand Kishor. “We have submitted our demand to minister and secretary and urged them to revoke the department’s order to do away with the daily wage sanitation workers. We are not opposing the decision of the Lokayukta, but the sanitation workers should continue to work with the PMC,” she told this newspaper.

The Lokayukta had found several discrepancies in the functioning of daily wage sanitation workers in several municipal bodies in the state and decided to end their services from February 1. Later, the department extended that deadline to March 31.

“We have demanded regularization of the workers working in the PMC for a decade and regularization of payscale of daily wage workers,” Sahu said.

The minister, however, said, “It is not our decision to end the services of sanitation workers and avail the services through outsourcing. The services of daily wage group D employees have been stopped in many municipal bodies in the state.”

He further said: “In the interest of the sanitation workers, the department has extended the deadline till March 31. The workers should return to work. We will consider their demand.”

UDHD secretary said a meeting would be convened to consider the issues raised by Patna mayor.

Meanwhile, Patna Nagar Nigam Staff Union (PNNSU) president Chandra Prakash said the UDHD has to revoke its decision.

“We are not against the decision of outsourcing companies but the daily wagers working for more than a decade should get their rights. The PMC board had taken the decision to regularize the workers who have been working for 10 years,” he said and added: “The strike will continue until our demands are met. The recruitment process of workers should be completed by February 19. All the workers should be regularized and get their rightful place.”

Sunita Devi, a sanitation worker said, “What will I do after March 31? I have been working here for the last six years and helping my husband in family income.”

Another worker, Anil Kumar, said it is a do-or-die situation for them. “I support a family of five. Whatever I earn is spent on my kid’s education and home rent. Where will we go,” he asked.

Minister offers olive branch to protesters: UDHD minister Suresh Sharma held a meeting with the officials concerned on Tuesday and said the daily wage Group D employees will be given priority in selection of sanitation staff by the company to be outsourced after March. “Besides, they will also get the benefits of Bhavishya Nidhi Yojana and Karamchari Rajya Bima Yojana,” he said.

Patna Nagar Nigam Staff Union president Chandra Prakash, however, rejected the offer and said: “We will fight for our rights till last breath. The department can’t force us to leave our rightful place.”

PATNA: Commuters and residents got respite from the parking of trucks on Digha-Danapur canal road following the Patna DM’s order on Monday.

Earlier, the residents and commuters faced tough time in passing through Digha-Danapur canal road due to long queues of trucks parked on its both sides throughout the day. Thousands of commuters use this road connecting Danapur with J P Setu. DM Kumar Ravi issued on Monday ordered that no truck will be parked on the canal road after 5am. Besides, he also ordered that heavy vehicles on JP Setu will be allowed only between 10pm and 5am.

A senior traffic police officer said: “At times, truck drivers get stuck in the city and fail to cross J P Setu before the fixed time. As a result, they park their vehicles in Phulwarisharif, Khagaul and Digha-Danapur areas, which led to frequent snarls, especially on the Digha-Danapur canal road.”

He added: “Police officers have been deployed in the areas to keep a check on truck drivers. Besides, regular monitoring is being done on all such roads in order to ensure hassle-free vehicular movement.”

Commuters travelling on the Digha-Danapur canal road heaved a sigh of relief. “Trucks used to be parked since morning leading to traffic jam on the canal road. However, on Tuesday, we had a respite from that as there was no truck parked there,” said Amit Sinha, a resident of Saguna Mor.

The DM has also asked the officials concerned to prevent overloaded trucks from moving on JP Setu and towing away vehicles breaking down on the bridge or either side of it.

Instructions were also issued to reduce traffic congestion on the New Bypass Road from NH-30 to Anisabad. The DM has asked ADM (law and order) to make proposal of foot overbridges (FoBs) on the stretch.

Divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said traffic congestion on the New Bypass Road will be reduced soon as the 95km-long state highway-78 is ready for vehicular movement. The highway from Bihta in Patna district to Sarmera in Nalanda will provide direct connectivity to trucks and other vehicles going to Bhojpur.

PATNA: JD(U)’s Munger MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lallan Singh on Tuesday defended the party’s support to Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in the Lok Sabha and raised a demand for fresh caste census in the country.

Speaking in the debate on the motion of thanks on the President’s address in Lok Sabha, Lallan also said people are linking CAA with National Register of Citizens (NRC), which is “not even in the womb”. “When NRC will come in the womb, all of us will see what exactly it is and do the needful,” he said.

On anti-CAA protests across the country, Lallan said, “Nobody knows about the reality of the misconception being spread about CAA. When a debate was held on the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill (CAB) in the Parliament, all of us supported it. Nobody said back then about which section of the CAB to be opposed…Maybe I would have supported the Bill out of lack of knowledge. We are having a debate today as well and I would be grateful if anyone could tell me about which section of CAA is being opposed by them.”

Speaking on the issue of caste census, Lallan said, “Reservation introduced by Mandal commission took the caste census of 1931 as the base. However, no caste census was done after 1931. There is a need to conduct fresh caste census so that actual status of different castes can be ascertained.”

He also raised the issue of special category status for Bihar, which has been a long pending demand of the JD(U). “Bihar legislative assembly had passed a resolution that the state be accorded special category status and special package be given to it. The Centre should look into it,” Lallan said.

35,['5/02/2020'],Police arrest gang of four highway robbers,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Nashik: The Nashik rural police on Monday arrested four people in connection with a pick-up van robbery that took place on January 18 near Tehere village on the section between Malegaon and Dhule.

The suspects have been identified as Gorakh Gangurde, Sunil Dagale, Rohit Gangurde, and Niranjan Mangale. According to police, they were arrested from Dindori and Ozar Township areas, and have confessed to have committed the crime.

“In the wee hours of January 18, the suspects had stopped the driver of the pick-up vehicle, threatened him with a country-made firearm and had decamped with the vehicle, driver’s cellphone and cash — all amounting to Rs 5.60 lakh,” a police officer said.

Working on the instructions of SP Arti Singh, the Local Crime Branch (LCB) personnel checked the modus operandi of the crime and arrested the suspects.

“After robbing the pick-up vehicle, the criminals disassembled it four days later at Khedgaon. They had decided to sell off the spare parts and distribute the money among them,” the officer said.

“We got information that the trolley of the pick-up was sold to a person in Niphad taluka. We detained him for questioning and he gave us the name of the man who helped the criminals in disposing away other spare parts,” he added.

The police said that they have recovered spare parts of the vehicle concerned, the van used for committing the crime, two another pick-up vehicles on which the spare parts were fixed — all worth Rs 13.62 lakh.

“We are investigating if the suspects had committed similar crimes in the past. A large number of people travel by the Mumbai Agra highway and other highways passing through the rural district on a daily basis. Given the possibility of such people getting robbed during the night hours, personnel of all police stations conduct patrolling on the highways and other important roads in their respective jurisdictions,” he added.

36,['5/02/2020'],‘Failed’ candidates add to talent pool too,"This story is from February 5, 2020

By Sujaya Banerjee

At one organisation I worked, we regularly hired fresh chartered accountants to join as management trainees in the audit department. We would hire them in large numbers and be left with a handful at the end of every 12-18 months. Most of the trainees left for better assignments/roles, as they found audit work repetitive and non-stimulating, especially on the back of three years of audit work they had already completed as a part of their CA articleship.

A new president for the audit team joined soon thereafter and described this as insanity — doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting a new outcome each time. His frustration forced us to go back to the drawing board to explore new solutions to build talent pipelines for the audit function.

The exercise proved to be an eye-opener as we began exploring all the alternate talent pools available to us across entry levels from inside and outside the organisation. Externally, we had commerce graduates and those with master’s in commerce as available pools, and we could also perhaps consider more CAs for the next-level roles. We listed the following:

* Engineers already familiar with the plants’ operations could be included through the internal job posting process

* QA/QC or procurement executives who may want a career in audit

* CAs already in the system who would want to explore joining mid-level positions

* BCom and MCom graduates who generally have no placement support in college

We brainstormed till we suddenly hit upon an interesting talent pool we had not considered before — CA ‘inter-fail’! This group is large in India, given the stringent pass marks in the CA exams, and has no real career opportunities in except accounting-related jobs. We clarified with our talent-acquisition teams that we would treat them as graduates with 3-plus years of work experience and immediately set about finding this group. We hired 20 in the first year and soon hit a treasure trove. This pool was mature, diligent with great humility to learn and deliver results. We had a great experience and 100% retention in Year 1. We had now tasted blood.

We hired another 30 in the next year and this became a great success story of new talent contribution and retention. This experience urged us to question the stigma of ‘Failed’ on many who attempt competitive exams and don’t pass tests for coveted programmes like IIT-JEE, CAT and UPSC.

What happens to the large numbers who fail these exams every year? Even worse, what about the ones who attempt these exams several times and are not successful. If we remove the stigma and our bias of failure, it is imminently possible to find people with aspiration, with otherwise great academic records, good critical thinking, analytical thinking capability, general knowledge and good communication skills. What’s more, many are humbled by the experience of having failed and are open to new learning opportunities and alternate careers. In fact, early wins in their new careers can quickly lift confidence levels that have taken a beating with repeated failure experiences.

Every year, 12 lakh of the 14 lakh candidates who attempt IIT-JEE do not clear the JEE Main. The cut-off for JEE Main is often 100 — How normal does that sound? CAT has about 2 lakh exam takers, out of which 5,000 pass to make it to some IIMs and 5,000 make it to other leading MBA schools. There are other entrance programmes for various streams that also have stringent cut-offs, with large numbers not making it to the programmes they intended to join. Despite this, the latest India Skills Report indicates only 46.21% of graduates and post-graduates are employable from these talent pools. In fact, it also indicates that at least 40% of the employable management students remain invisible to recruiters because they lie beyond the top 1,000 campuses. Also, interestingly, the report indicates that at least 60% of management graduates do not make it to deserving jobs as they lack the appropriate levels of English needed. There are various reasons attributed to poor employability, ranging from K12 education, selection procedure to graduate colleges, curriculum, quality of teaching, student interest and the lack of corporate involvement.

Unfortunately, most of these reasons have a huge part to play in this challenge that has no quick and easy solutions. Most graduates/post-graduates are left to their own devices to improve if there is sufficient awareness around the gaps to enhance their employability quotient.

Robust entry-level programmes offered by employers can help, but many organisations do not invest in these development efforts and leave new talent to their own devices to learn on the job.

At entry levels, employers broadly look for a mix of aptitude, language, personality and domain skills in selecting the right candidate. The detailed fine-tuning normally happens based on the job role they may be hiring for. College learning outcomes rated as most important are oral communication, critical thinking, ethical judgment, working effectively in teams, written communication and the real-world application of skills and knowledge.

Interestingly, these attributes can be developed better through a liberal arts programme rather than the technical, science, math courses that we have come to value to the exclusion of other streams.

A diverse workforce is a catalyst for growth

Conscious and unconscious biases, trapped in old thinking and past practices, may well be in your way if you find yourself with a too narrow a talent pool. It is time to throw out the uncreative, plug-and-play hiring, and open your organisation to well-considered, inclusive and innovative hiring approaches that can reap richer dividends:

* Foster a culture that embraces diversity in a powerful way to attract great employees. Up to 67% of job searchers want to work for companies that have a diverse workforce. Especially the ‘woke millennial’ generation values this to consider you a contemporary employer

* Organisations need to deliberately reach out to diverse pools that can bring socio-cognitive diversity (people with different education, exposures, experiences, religious beliefs). Gender, generational diversities, persons with disabilities — many of which will need to be deliberately sought until we strengthen these talent pools in society

* Consider diverse interview panelists as well to represent the diversity you want to see in the workplace

Conscious and unconscious biases are more significantly in our way than we would like to admit. Community, socio-economic class, appearance, education, past failures and our likes/dislikes and experiences with this can very significantly come in the way of giving people opportunities. Constant awareness training and communication around the theme of biases and leaders’ role-modelling inclusion is a powerful way of combating this.

Here’s how you can stop expeditious hiring by not repeating past patterns and old thinking — look for hidden talent to expand the pool:

* Deliberately explore education streams and disciplines you have not hired before. Focus on the attributes you need most for the job and identify talent pools who could deliver to these attributes or could be trained easily, if you had no past policy/practice/resource constraints to access them. Explore, experiment, include!

* Veterans/retirees are a good pool to explore even as we are heading to become the youngest talent pool in the world. Experienced retirees are often knowledgeable, disciplined, committed people, and now — with increased life expectancy and longevity — can become great mentors to talent and a great pool to pick from

* Seasoned gig workers in addition to talent-on-demand — this labour pool can save employers cost and can deliver high-quality services with greater flexibility

* Apprenticeship programmes can offer a good source of entry-level talent that can be groomed and prepared through backward integration to create a robust talent pipeline through offering on-the-job-training exposures

* Customers, not current, but if you know of their talent and they know & like your organisation and there are no conflicts of interest, then why not?

* If you exclude 50% of your talent pool, no wonder you find yourself in a war for talent. While most organisations are making commendable efforts to attract entry-level female talent, including lateral hiring, there is a challenge of both availability and inclusion, which are symbiotically linked to each other. More deliberate actions in this space can increase the talent pool and enable a significantly talented and educated diverse group become economically relevant

Enhancing inclusion in the workplace and making this a pre-condition to leadership positions, both internally and while hiring, can help increase retention and enable organisations accrue the many benefits of a diverse workforce — increased productivity, teamwork, creativity and innovation. Here are some good questions to ask to get started:

* What are our organisation’s definitions of ability, competence, performance?

* How can we deliberately create an inclusive culture?

* How can we keep our brand promise of being an equal opportunities employer?

* How can we redefine our hiring policies and practices to remove biases trapped in past habits?

* Can we consider revisiting the education criteria we have defined for our jobs, so we can explore new talent pools not considered? (Failures from competitive exams; candidates who don’t speak good English (English can be learned!); persons with disability)

* Can we ask diverse employees for suggestions on improving initiatives for attracting more diverse talent?

* Can we consider late-career progressions and figure out how to include talented women through flexible schedules on the gig economy?

Talent acquisition is a powerful mechanism for not only changing the culture of your organisation by including new groups and providing new opportunities, but also shaping the society. Talent is abundantly present, if only we moved out of the quagmire of past habits and deficit narrow thinking, to find fresh treasure troves of real talent.

Swati Deshpande | TNN

Mumbai: In a relief for Sussanne Khan, ex-wife of actor Hritik Roshan, the Bombay high court on Tuesday upheld an arbitral award in her favour over a claim of over Rs 2.5 crore. A bench of Chief Justice Pradeep Nandrajog and Justice Bharati Dangre dismissed a plea by Mudhit Gupta and Emgee Properties of Goa.

The bench said, “On a deeper scrutiny of the award, we are satisfied about the exercise of juridical power by the arbitrator and the refusal to interfere in the same by the learned single judge on a footing that it is not permissible to reassess or re-appreciate evidence or examine the sufficiency of evidence.”

Gupta, represented by counsel Simil Purohit and Lexim Associates, had challenged the legal validity of a 2018 arbitral award that upheld the claim of Khan, who is the sole proprietor of Sussanne Khan House of Design. The HC observed, “Akin to a banyan tree which is characterised by aerial roots which hang from its leaves, the submissions of Purohit float all over in the air desperately, in an attempt to cling on and envelope the case of his opponent and begin its life as an epiphyte.”

The HC also observed that Khan’s counsel Sharan Jagtiani and Parinam Law argued that the arbitrator “hit the bullseye” and rightly granted her the claim as “one flowing from the contract”. The contract was of 2013 and pertained to her “professional designing services” being hired for a villa project in Goa.

“There being no error apparent on the face of award and no grounds for interference being in existence”, the HC refused to “inter-meddle”. Thus, putting a quietus to the dispute at its end. The order can be challenged and taken to the apex court.

BIHARSHARIF: A woman was strangled in Nalanda on Monday night for opposing her husband’s alleged illicit relation with the wife of his elder brother.

According to police sources, the accused was identified as Munna Kumar of Powari village under Harnaut police station area. Bum Shankar Singh , the father of the deceased Neha alias Nilu Kumari, said in his police complaint that he had got his daughter married to Munna in 2015. “Munna always ignored and tortured my daughter, calling her ugly. Later, it was found that he was in relationship with the wife of his elder brother. When my daughter opposed it, she was beaten up and strangled on Monday night,” Singh, who is from Langarpur under Barh police station area in Patna district, alleged in his police complaint.

He said some villagers informed him about the incident over phone late Monday night. When he reached Powari with Harnaut police, he found the body of his daughter lying in one of the rooms with no one in the house. He alleged that she was also tortured for dowry. Two other family members of Munna have been made accused.

Harnaut police station house officer Chandra Shekhar Singh said the body was handed over to her father after postmortem at Biharsharif Sadar hospital. He said action will be taken after getting postmortem and investigation reports expected in a couple of days.

PATNA: Over 500 aspirants for different posts in state police went on a rampage near Gandhi Maidan in the city on Tuesday demanding CBI inquiry into alleged leak of question papers of Bihar police sub-inspector recruitment examination.

At least two constables were injured when protesters pelted police with stones at JP roundabout. Police resorted to lathicharge and arrested four of the protesters. The incident took place around 12 noon when candidates marched towards JP roundabout from Bhikhna Pahadi while alleging question papers leak.

The results of preliminary examination conducted by Bihar Police Subordinate Selection Commission (BPSSC) was declared on January 28. Exams were conducted in two shifts across 495 centres on December 22. At least 5.85 lakh candidates had appeared in examination for altogether 2446 posts of police sub-inspector, sergeant and assistant jail superintendent.

Gandhi Maidan police station SHO Sunil Kumar said all efforts were made to pacify candidates but they blocked traffic near Magadh Mahila College and pelted stones on the policemen deployed near JP roundabout.

“They started forcibly closing shops in the area and marched forward after which water cannon was used to disperse them. The protesters started pelting stones on police personnel and two constables were injured. Police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse them. Four persons were arrested,” he said.

The agitating students alleged that questions and their answer keys were leaked on social media even before the commencement of examination. “We demand CBI inquiry into question paper leak,” they chanted.

When contacted, BPSSC’s OSD-cum-spokesperson Ashok Kumar Prasad told TOI that no incriminating material had surfaced before the commission to support candidates’ allegations of paper leak. “One Dilip Kumar, along with other candidates, had met us with a piece of paper claiming that it was a part of the leaked question. However, that was not true. They were convinced and returned. We are looking into the involvement of touts or coaching institutes in instigating the candidates,” he said, adding none of the district magistrates across state informed the commission about any paper leak.

He said 50,072 candidates cleared the preliminary examination. “The commission provided data of disqualified students and reasons behind their failure to qualify for the main exam. We had lodged 10 FIRs across the state where OMR sheet or questions were uploaded to social media sites,” he said and added that mostly failed candidates were involved in the protests.

Prasad said the commission is to conduct main examination either in the last week of April or first week of May after which physical efficiency test would be conducted for recruitment against the vacant posts.

PATNA: JD(U) is likely to announce its national office-bearers soon after the Delhi assembly poll results on February 11.

Sources in JD(U) said party president and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar , during his recent stay in the national capital, discussed the issue with senior party leaders. “Though the reconstitution of national team is already due following the re-election of Nitish as the party’s national president in October last year, the matter got a fresh momentum after unceremonious expulsion of Prashant Kishor and Pavan K Varma from the party,” a senior leader told TOI on Tuesday.

Kishor and Varma were expelled from JD(U) for “anti-party activities” on January 29 this year after months of their bitter differences with Nitish over Citizenship (Amendment) Act and certain related issues.

Their expulsion led to further shrinking in the strength of the party’s national office-bearers. Poll strategist Kishor was appointed JD(U)’s national vice-president by Nitish himself on October 16, 2018. Now that Kishor is out from the party, there is no vice-president in JD(U). Varma was the JD(U) national general secretary.

In November 2016, when Nitish had announced his first national team, there were nine national general secretaries, six national secretaries and one treasurer.

“In the last three years, three of the nine general secretaries left the party after Nitish decided to realign with the BJP in 2017. One more general secretary, Harivansh, quit the post after he was elected deputy chairperson of the Rajya Sabha in August 2018. In the meantime, Sanjay Jha and Afaque Ahmad Khan were made new general secretaries. Thus, there were seven general secretaries in the party till Varma was expelled, bringing down the number to six,” pointed out a party leader.

PATNA: Two persons, who had returned from China last week, have been kept in isolation at their homes in Bettiah and Bhagalpur as a precautionary step against the deadly coronavirus (CoV).State surveillance officer Dr Ragani Mishra said, “As of now, no symptoms of CoV have been detected in any of them. But as a precautionary measure we have kept them under observation for 14 days.”Earlier, two people were kept under observation in Sitamarhi and Saran. “We tested both coronavirus suspects, one from Sitamarhi and the other from Saran. Their test reports ruled out CoV,” Mishra said.Amid fears of spread of a CoV spread, at least 4,295 people in the border areas and 1,467 passengers at Gaya airport have been subjected to thermal screening till February 2. However, no positive cases of coronavirus have been reported in state so far.The state health department has alerted hospital superintendents, civil surgeons, and officials at state airports and border areas to keep a check on people travelling from China and Nepal.“We have started working in various parts of the state, especially in the districts situated near the Nepal border. Camps are being set up in the border areas for keeping an eye on people with even minimal symptoms,” Mishra said.She added: “More than 3,381 health workers have been appointed to spread awareness about the deadly disease in every district.

Representative image

PATNA/BEGUSARAI: Two workers of a private road construction company were shot late on Monday evening adding to the soaring number of murder cases in Begusarai . This politically volatile district saw 97 murders till November last year, according to the state crime record bureau.

The latest incident, which took place at Bharaul village under Bachhwara police station, came barely 48 hours after two youths were killed under Balia police station in the district.

The murders of the two construction workers came to light on Tuesday morning when local residents spotted the two bodies lying in a pool of blood. Reports said the two workers---Md. Qaiser Alam (25) and Rajnish Kumar (26)—were shot dead while they were asleep at the company’s base camp office at Bharaul.

The police have not rule out the extortion angle as the reason behind the killing of the two workers of Sona Infra Private Ltd, which was awarded the contract for the construction of a 2.5 km road under the Mukhya Mantri Sadak Yojna. Sources said a local gangster had demanded extortion money from the caretaker, Rajnish Kumar, last week.

“The matter was reported to the local police but they did not pay any heed. The extortionists had given a deadline for the payment of extortion money,” said an engineer with the company supervising the construction work, which was stalled after the extortion demand and subsequent threats to the workers.

Begusarai SP Awakash Kumar admitted that the Bachhwara police were informed about the firing by anti-socials at the base camp office a few days ago. “The police had asked the officials to inform before resuming construction work, which they did not do. This gave the criminals a chance to attack at the base camp,” the SP said.

Kumar, however, parried questions on police’s failure to deploy forces at the camp office as a precautionary measure. Teghra SDPO Ashish Anand, who visited the spot on Tuesday morning, said the camp office of the company is located at an isolated place, which made the task difficult for the police.

The bodies of Md. Qiser Alam, a resident of Vaishali district, and Rajnish Kumar, a native of Muzaffarpur district, were handed over to their families after the post mortem examination at the Sadar hospital.

The spate of murders has raised a question mark over the law and order situation in the district. Last year, the state government had created a new post of DIG and posted an IPS officer Rajesh Kumar to bring the situation under control. “Despite the posting of a DIG-rank officer, the spate of murders continues. There is no fear of law,” said a local businessman Navin Kumar.

Even Union minister and BJP MP from Begusarai, Giriraj Singh, had no qualms about admitting that the residents were living under fear due to the deteriorating law and order situation in the district. “The situation is not up to the mark in Begusarai,” the MP’s representative Amrendra Kumar Amar said.

CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar had also assailed the Begusarai police for their failure to check crime in the district.

44,['5/02/2020'],Bihar: Actor alleges ‘cheating’ by boyfriend from Munger,"This story is from February 5, 2020

PATNA: A 35-year-old actor from Mumbai has alleged physical and monetary exploitation by her boyfriend over four years on the pretext of marriage. The youth, Rahul Kumar, came in contact with the TV serial actor through Facebook about five years ago.

The actor, who claimed to have worked in the TV serials like Nimki Mukhiya, Gathbandhan and Crime Alert, got the ‘treachery’ of Rahul printed and pasted on the boundary walls and electric poles of Tarapur, a sub-divisional town in Munger district . Rahul, employed in a private firm, is now posted in Katihar.

The actor on Sunday contacted Tarapur SDPO Ramesh Kumar and submitted a petition seeking justice for her. In her petition, she alleged that Rahul exploited her both physically and economically for over four years on the pretext of marriage. The actor, who originally hails from Sultanpur in Uttar Pradesh , told the police that she got suspicious when Rahul asked her to transfer her ancestral property in his name and also made an agreement of marriage in Katihar civil court to win over her confidence.

“He (Rahul) started avoiding me when I turned down his proposal. I told her that it was not possible before marriage. I got suspicious when he didn’t pick up my phone calls,” the actor told the SDPO, who later assigned the Tarapur SHO to look into the matter.

When contacted, Tarapur SHO Amrendra Kumar said, “The woman met me yesterday. But I couldn’t spare much time for her as I had some other important assignments.” The SHO, however, said the accused’s family doesn’t live in Tarapur and has shifted to Katihar where he is posted.

The SDPO said police have limited role to play in such case. “But what is important is the woman’s claim of handing over Rs5 lakh to Rahul in the name of marriage. But that is not sufficient to initiate action against the accused. Moreover, the incident didn’t take place under our jurisdiction. That may be a technical problem,” the SDPO told this newspaper over phone on Monday.

Rahul’s father Anant Singh, whose name also figured in the pamphlets pasted on the walls and electric poles of the town, said the woman was trying to exploit his young son. “It’s true that my son and the woman know each other. They became friends through social media a few years ago,” he added.

Singh said the woman started exerting pressure on Rahul after she came to know about his marriage being finalized somewhere else. “She didn’t disclose to Rahul that she is already married and a mother of two. How could a married woman be allowed to solemnize her second marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act? For that, she has to divorce her husband first,” Rahul’s father said.

Even as the probe is underway in Munger, the actor has left for Katihar. “I will not let him go scot free. He (Rahul) is learnt to have ruined the career of at least four other girls on the pretext of marriage. One of them fell victim when he was doing his MBA,” the actor claimed.

PATNA: Raj Bhavan has sought the opinion of the universities in Bihar on the draft statute relating to the inter-university transfer of non-teaching staff and also the modalities of appointment of new staff in colleges and universities.

In a letter sent to the vice-chancellors of all the universities, the law officer of Raj Bhavan has clarified that if no suggestion is received within 10 days of the receipt of the letter, it would be assumed that the university is in agreement with the draft statute.

Earlier, the governor-cum-chancellor had constituted a three-member committee comprising the VCs of Patna University, Nalanda Open University and Maulana Mazharul Haque Arabic and Persian University to draft the statute concerning the service conditions of non-teaching staff of colleges and universities. The committee prepared the statute and submitted it to Raj Bhavan last month. Now the same has been forwarded to the universities for their consideration and suggestions, if any.

Soon after the receipt of the Raj Bhavan letter PU, vice-chancellor Rash Bihari Prasad Singh constituted a committee consisting of PU registrar, deputy registrar, students’ welfare dean and librarian to study the draft statute minutely and give its opinion on the various provisions made therein.

Meanwhile, the Patna University Teachers’ Association and the Patna University Employees’ Association have opposed the proposed changes in the service conditions of PU employees, especially pertaining to their inter-university transfer. They pointed out that right since its inception, PU is governed by a separate Act, while all other universities in the state are being governed by a common Act. They threatened of agitation if the PU Act was amended.

BHAGALPPUR/PATNA: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday attached movable and immovable property valued at Rs 8.38 crore of notorious gangster Jai Prakash Mandal and his close relatives under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PLMA), 2002.

ED sources said the central agency initiated the probe into the ill-gotten property of Mandal on the recommendation of EOU, which was created to carry out investigation into the wealth of people amassed through unlawful means. Mandal is a resident of Naya Tola under the Industrial police station area in Bhagalpur district.

Altogether 12 FIRs related to loot, extortion, dacoity and gambling were lodged against Mandal, which prompted the ED to initiate investigation into illegal wealth in his name and also of his close relatives. Chargesheets were also filed in seven cases for contravention of various sections of IPC and Gambling Act.

The attached property included 45% part of Sri Ram Valley (includes flats, commercial area, parking area) at Mauza Fatehpur, Bhagalpur, worth Rs 4.07 crore, Shree Shopee Mart at Bhagalpur worth Rs 2.25 crore, land and structural part of JP Ratna Filling Station (HP Petrol Pump) in Bhagalpur worth Rs 7 lakh, two residential houses in the name of his wife Ratna Devi in Bhagalpur worth Rs 48 lakh, 37 landed property of Mandal, his wife and son Pravin Mandal worth Rs 1.25 crore.

The list of the property confiscated by the ED also included six vehicles valued at Rs 20.56 lakh and bank deposits worth Rs 1.96 crore. The ED claimed that the accused amassed movable and immovable property to the tune of Rs 8.38 crore in the name of his wife and son, mostly through cash transactions.

A senior official of the central financial probe agency said, “The accused have also diverted the land acquired out of proceeds of crime into various projects like marketing complexes in the name of Shoppe Mart, development of high-rise buildings with a developer, petrol pumps and residential buildings.”

ADG, EOU, Jitendra Singh Gangwar said the state police have launched a major crackdown against the criminals who have accumulated property through unlawful means. “The crackdown will continue in future,” he said and urged the people to inform the EOU about such anti-socials without any fear from them.

The ADG made it clear that the identity of the people sharing information about such anti-socials would be kept secret.

PATNA: Vehicular traffic came to a standstill for several hours on Ashok Rajpath on Tuesday as students of Patna University (PU) and two of its constituent colleges – Patna College and B N College – staged protests over police’s failure to arrest the people who had attacked a Saraswati idol immersion procession and injured several students near Patna College on January 31.

The protesters blocked the road, burned tyres, forcibly shut down shops and shouted slogans like ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ andr ‘Jai Shri Ram’. The protests continued for around four hours.

The protesting students were also demanding payment of compensation to those injured in January 31 violence, their free treatment and raid on Lalbagh locality.

Mukesh Hinduja, a first-year student of PG Hindi department of Patna College, said inmates of Saidpur hostel and Minto hostel were carrying out the Saraswati idol immersion procession from PU campus to Rani Ghat on the night of January 31 when the trouble started.

“The procession was carried out with permissions from PU administration and district administration. ASP, DSP, SHO of Pirbahore police station and RAF jawans were keeping an eye on the procession. As soon as we reached near Lalbagh, the lights went out and the locals started throwing bombs and firing in air,” Hinduja said.

In the clash, one Avinash Kumar, a first-year economics student of B N College, sustained burn injuries. Satish Kumar, another first-year political science student of the same college, had also sustained bullet injury.

In retaliation, the students pelted stones targeting residential colonies at Lalbagh, in which several people, including police constables, were injured.

Ravi Kumar, a second-year political science student of B N College, said police had lodged complaint against 47 students of PU, Patna College and BN College for no reason. “We want justice for the students who got injured in the clash and arrest of the culprits who were behind the incident,” he said.

SHO of Pirbahore police station Rizwan Khan assured the students that the police would arrest those involved in the clash soon. “We are in the process of identifying the troublemakers,” the SHO said.

Chennai: Want to buy a 1920s Austin? Or a 1940s Impala of the sort that you have long admired in black and white Bollywood hits?

You could now get your choice of vintage car and bike models from online platforms which are diversifying into this niche — but growing — category as a way of offering more choice for collectors and enthusiasts, opening up a sector which was hitherto a closed community.

Online pre-owned vehicle platforms including OLX, Mahindra First Choice Wheels and Droom among others are offering vintage cars and motorcycles (dating from the 1920s-1970s) as well as collectible cars and bikes for retro and vintage enthusiasts.

Although a small market, it is a growing one helped by online platforms stocking and selling parts for these rare vehicles.

OLX said its vintage car listings have doubled in 2019 compared to 2017.

Vintage bikes too, have emerged to be a popular category with 4,000+ bikes being listed in 2019. Overall, ad listings of vintage bikes attracted over 1 million views while vintage cars witnessed over 800k views per month in 2019.

OLX data also showed that the same cities were showing interest in both vintage cars and bikes — Chennai, Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Thiruvananthapuram, Coimbatore and Kochi.

For vintage bikes, there is a high demand from Hyderabad while Ooty and Jaipur are also attractive markets for vintage cars.

Mahindra First Choice Wheels has been seeing growing interest in older cult marques. “People come asking for older Harley Davidson, Jawa bikes and vintage Porsche and Mercedes models even though the actual sales are still quite small.”

Online marketplace Droom has also been offering vintage cars and bikes as an option.

“We offer this category but the pool is very small. There are only under 5,000 units of vintage vehicles in India (between 1920-1970 vintage). The rest are all collectibles,” said Sandeep Aggarwal, founder, and CEO, Droom.

According to OLX VP-auto Sunny Kataria, the interest in vintage models on online platforms is mostly as an investible category.

“Vintage automobiles are a prized possession not only among collectors but are seen as a lucrative alternative asset class by HNIs who see this as an appreciating asset. Traditionally, collecting vintage cars was a niche hobby but the rise of online marketplaces has breathed a new lease of life for these marvels from the past,” he added.

According to automotive writer and vintage car enthusiast Ranojoy Mukerji online purchase of vintage vehicles will face road blocks like incomplete papers.

“These are cars which often don’t have ownership documents or documents regarding providence,” he said.

“So you buy a vintage vehicle based on trust and people often buy from friends and trusted dealers. Everything in this market is underground although sometimes the ticket sizes are quite big.”

Last year a couple of cars were sold at a price of Rs 2.5-Rs 3 crore, he added.

49,['5/02/2020'],Corona virus lockdown may create hiccups for Motown,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Chennai: The lockdown in Wuhan province of China due spread of Coronavirus could disrupt the production schedule of Indian vehicle makers — both petrol/ diesel as well as electric.

Currently stock levels are tight due to the BS4 to BS6 changeover and the Chinese new year. Added to that, say parts sourcing officials in OEMs including Mahindra, Maruti and Toyota, if the lockdown continues beyond the February 9 deadline, production of vehicles may get affected.

Wuhan is a hub for electric and electronic parts and even though Indian car or bike makers may not be directly sourcing from them, tier-1, tier-2 or tier-3 component suppliers do have strong Chinese supply links. China is a huge part of the global sourcing network and the current blockade will begin to pinch once the existing stock in shipments, factories or dealerships start running out. The electric vehicle industry will be worse affected because it is more import — and China — dependent particularly for lithium ion cells.

“Right now Wuhan is completely shut down. Other provinces like Wuxi, Shenzhen and Guangzhou are supposed to open from February 9. So companies that have suppliers in any of these places are stuck. Wuhan is not likely to open up before February 16. And when it opens, there will be such a crush that getting materials out of China will be a problem with the ports clogged,” said Hemant Sikka, president-CPO, Powerol & spares business, M&M. Mahindra, is covered till February 15. “The trouble is if you need 4,000 parts for a vehicle and only 2 of these are unavailable, your assembly line gets stuck,” said Sikka. “Most of the imports from these provinces are electronic parts like chips or the PCB. “We have enough stock for one more week but the trouble is the window is only for two weeks after which we have to switch to BS6,” said Sikka. “So a lockdown like this creates more problems.” Of course most companies are in wait and watch mode right now.

“Our tier-I and tier-II suppliers are not yet effected, however we are continuously monitoring the operations of tier-III and tier-IV suppliers to grasp any possible slowdown that may come forth,” said Naveen Soni, senior VP, sales & service, Toyota Kirloskar Motor.

Electric vehicles makers will be worst hit.“Considering the fact that the Indian EV market is not evolved enough to sustain an end to end manufacturing of all components, manufacturers are compelled to import certain parts from China and other markets. Corona virus has spread beyond China and has also affected Taiwan, Korea and other southeast Asian countries resulting in disruption of export at major ports,” said Naveen Munjal, MD, Hero Electric.

“Due to the Chinese new year, heavy shipments were supposed to begin from January 31, now it will come in March,” said Sohinder Gill, director-general, Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles. Beyond that, the biggest road block will be lithium ion cells which are all imported, said Gill.

Mumabi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has operationalised the government’s decision to hike deposit insurance cover to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 1 lakh with effect from February 4. “With a view to providing a greater measure of protection to depositors in banks the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the RBI, has raised the limit of insurance cover for depositors in insured banks from the present level of Rs1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh per depositor with effect from February 4, 2020 with the approval of Government,” RBI said in a statement. Speaking to TOI, Rajkiran Rai , MD & CEO, Union Bank of India, said banks have not yet been notified of the increase in premium. “But we do expect the cost of insurance to go up,” he said.

Finance ministry officials have indicated after the Budget that the rates will be uniform and the rates would not be risk-based. “The banks cannot pass on the hike in premiums to its customers, according to the norms. The premium won’t go up substantially in any case and may be hiked to 12-13 paise (per deposit of Rs 100 a year),” finance secretary Rajiv Kumar said in a media interaction. According to Rai, so far all the claims on deposit insurance have been from co-operative banks.

PATNA: Police on Tuesday arrested slain TPS College associate professor Shivnarayan Ram’s youngest brother Virendra Ram (45), his friend Shailendra Kishore (48) and four others for their alleged involvement in the murder under Kankarbagh police station on January 29.

Police said Virendra, who is unmarried, was having illicit relation with Shivnarayan’s wife for over ten years and decided to get rid of him. Shivnarayan (52) was shot dead near Postal Park when he was going to the college on foot from his residence in East Indira Nagar.

According to police, Virendra is in merchant navy while Shailendra owns a medical shop named Dhanmati Ambika Agency on Govind Mitra Road. The four other arrested were identified as Vikash Kumar, Dheeraj Kumar, Amarjeet Kumar and Prem Sagar. They are aged between 25 and 30 years.

Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said the pistol used in the crime had been seized. “Six cellphones, a two-wheeler used in the crime and one live cartridge were also seized from them,” he said.

The SSP said the family members quarrelled frequently as Virendra was having illicit relation with Shivnarayan’s wife. “The deceased used to live in another room separate from his wife inside family residence,” he said. Police came to know about the family tension during investigation.

Sharma said it was Kishore who had paid Rs2 lakh to Prem on January 30 for completing the task a day before. “Vikash had shot the professor in his head from behind,” he said, adding criminals had attempted to kill Shivnarayan even on January 22, but failed. “Virendra had returned from sea in November last year,” he said.

Out of the four criminals, only Prem and Amarjeet had earlier been to jail for consuming liquor.

PATNA: In yet another case of Pakadua vivah , a youth was forced to marry a girl at gunpoint after being kidnapped from village Chanda under Athmalgola police station in rural Patna on December 7 last year.

The matter was reported to police on January 2 after which an FIR was lodged with Athmalgola police station on Monday on the written complaint of the victim.

SHO Uttam Kumar said the victim is 21-year-old Bittu Paswan. Quoting the FIR, the SHO said his fellow villager Vivek Yadav had asked Bittu to accompany him to Nalanda on December 7 last year. “Both went to Nehusa under Harnaut police station where Bittu observed that marriage preparation was going on in the house where he was taken by Vivek. After spending few hours, Bittu got suspicious and tried to flee from the spot. However, he was captured,” the SHO said.

He said Bittu was forcibly married to a girl at gunpoint and was sent back to Chanda. He said after two days of marriage, Bittu received threat calls to keep mum and live with the girl. “Out of fear, he fled to Delhi. He retuned recently after which we contacted him and got an FIR lodged,” the SHO said.

He said Bittu told police that he had visited the girl’s house twice earlier. “Vivek had taken him there on both the occasions. The matter is being investigated. Vivek along with Indal Paswan and Rudal Paswan from girl’s family had been made named accused in the FIR,” he said.

Bittu’s father Devendra Paswan told this newspaper on phone that he is a sharecropper in the village. “The girl lived with us for three days after which her family members took her back. We had been threatened by few people who knew the girl’s family,” he added.

BIHARSHARIF: The Sheikhpura police on Tuesday lodged an FIR against 235 people, including 35 women, for rioting, blocking roads, trying to set a shrine on fire and misbehaving with policemen on February 2.

A large number of irate supporters and sympathisers of Ariyari block president of JD(U) Amit Vashisht alias Nand Kishore Kushwaha, who was killed on February 1, had blocked road for several hours near Patel Chowk in Sheikhpura the next day.

They also partially damaged a shrine near Dallu Chowk and misbehaved with policemen. Kushwaha was killed in a clash between two groups during Saraswati idol immersion procession at Sanayya village under the Ariyari police station area in the district.

SHO of Sheikhpura sadar police station Chandan Kumar said 200 men and 35 women were booked for rioting. He said the protesters had blocked road near Patel Chowk and set a shop on fire near sadar hospital, besides burning logs of wood near Dallu Chowk.

54,['5/02/2020'],Buyer of minority stake in pvt co has to deposit 50% of cost,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Promoters with a 75% stake can now make an offer to buy out minority shareholders from an unlisted public or private firm, according to a February 3 notification by the ministry of corporate affairs ( MCA ) on amendments to the Companies Act . Prior to this notification, only promoters with a 90% stake could buy out the remaining 10%.

“Majority shareholders through special resolution always had an ability to cause reduction of capital and achieve squeeze-out of minority shareholders,” said Economic Laws Practice partner Darshan Upadhyay. “The new provisions provide an avenue under compromise and amalgamation arrangements to approach company law tribunal for such takeovers. The minority shareholders, subject to the prescribed threshold and conditions, will have the right to object,” Upadhyay added.

Promoters choose to squeeze out minority shareholders to exercise greater control over the firm and to take advantage of easier compliance norms. The February 3 notification also stipulated that promoters must determine the offer price after taking into account the fair value of the company and that 50% of the total acquisition cost must be deposited in a separate bank account.

“MCA has now introduced these rules to provide for the takeover offer...The application made for such a takeover with company law tribunal must give details of the valuation of shares done by a registered valuer, considering such parameters of valuation as provided in the rules,” said J Sagar Associates’ partner Lalit Kumar .

Squeezing out minority shareholders in Indian companies has always been difficult. Some local arms of multinationals in which the foreign parent holds more than 90% still haven’t been able to push out minority shareholders despite these companies getting delisted from stock exchanges years ago.

It may be a challenge to implement the new rule in certain companies like Tata Sons , which reportedly was valued at $49 billion, said industry observers. If Tatas intend to buy out minority shareholder Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) Group from Tata Sons, then existing shareholders__public charitable Tata Trusts and Tata companies__will have to deposit half of the total payout for the acquisition with a bank. But, public charitable trusts are restricted by law from investing in equity shares of a company.

“The new provisions may have some unintended consequences that need to be protected. For example, in a downside situation majority shareholders (promoters) should not be allowed to force the investors to exit at a price lower than their investment value. The shareholders’ agreement would have to be negotiated to provide some entranced provisions to block such actions,” said Upadhyay.

Chennai: TVS Motor Company recorded just over 32% drop in net profits at Rs 121.1 crore for the third quarter ended December 2019 on the back of lower sales. The board has declared an interim dividend of 210% or Rs 2.1 per share.

However, this includes a provision of Rs 76.04 crore towards National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) which the company had reversed in the previous quarter based on a favourable ruling by CESTAT.

However, following the Supreme Court directive that NCCD is leviable, the company, has reinstated the provision of Rs 76.04 crore as an “exceptional item”.

Profit After Tax for Q3FY20 before factoring in the exceptional item is Rs 184.2 crore, up just over 3%.

TVS Motor's Q3 two-wheeler sales including exports was at 7.73 lakh units down from 9.5 lakh units last Q3. Motorcycle sales were flat at 3.25 lakh units as against 3.78 lakh units last year. Scooter sales were down to 2.8 lakh units as against 3.54 lakh units last Q3. Total three-wheeler sales, however, grew by 22% to 48,391 units from 39,629 units in the quarter ended December 2018.

DARBHANGA: CPI functionary and former JNU Students’ Union president Kanhaiya Kumar on Tuesday said the nationwide protests against CAA, NRC and NPR were an inclusive fight for protecting the democracy and Constitution of India.

“The NDA government is trying to polarise people on the basis of religion in pursuance of ‘divide and rule’ formula of Britishers. Deluge of promises by the central government was followed by drought of actions. This is neither a fight by any political party nor by people of a religion. This is for strengthening the secular fabric of the nation,” Kanhaiya said while addressing a public meeting at Raj Ground here as part of his ‘Save Constitution, Save Citizenship Satyagraha’ yatra.

The former JNUSU president had started his yatra from Bapudham Ashram in West Champaran on January 30. “People are protesting the divisive laws enacted by the Centre at most places we have visited under this yatra. We can call it a household protest against the sectarian law,” he said.

Attacking the Narendra Modi government at the Centre on the issue of unemployment, Kanhaiya said, “Unemployment rate has hit a 45-year-high in the country and controversial laws like CAA have been brought to divert the attention of common people.”

He added, “Before taking over as PM, Modi used to say in 2014 general election rallies that he would not allow anyone to sell the country, but national assets like LIC and Air India are today on the verge of being sold. Migration of people from Mithilanchal is highest in the country due to poverty in the region.”

Kanhaiya concluded his speech by inviting people to attend the rally scheduled to be held at Gandhi Maidan in Patna February 29 to mark the culmination of his yatra.

UDUPI: Udupi district voter’s list observer Munish Moudgil on Tuesday directed the Udupi district administration to delete names of voters that feature in two places, from the place where the voter is not an ordinary resident.

It is possible for the Election Commission to ascertain such cases using a software, which cross references the photographs of voters in voters’ lists.

This list is then given to booth level officers for physical verification, Moudgil said. During verification, names of voters will be removed from the place where they are not residing anymore, Moudgil, commissioner, survey, settlement and land records and ex-officio director Bhoomi and UPOR, said. “The district administration should take into consideration objections of political parties and work towards preparing a voters list that is free from errors and duplication, to ensure successful conduct of polls,” he said.

While undertaking the task of revision of voters list, directions given by the Election Commission on ensuring population to voters’ ratio for every assembly or parliamentary constituency should be followed. It there are variations, officials should undertake field visits to reverify the same, he said.

JAIPUR: The out-of-bounds China market is having a ripple effect on businesses in Rajasthan with jewellers in Jaipur estimating that postponement of Hong Kong jewellery show could shave off the industry business worth Rs 150-200 crore. Besides, marble, granite and tourism industries are also feeling the heat.Ajay Kala, secretary of Jaipur Chamber of Commerce & Industry, who is a regular at the Hong Kong International Jewellery Show, said, “Yes, the show has been postponed to May. More than 150 jewellers from Rajasthan participate in the show which has over the years become an important showcasing platform for us. But now, there is lot of uncertainty for the next 10 days at least. All the businesses will suffer significantly in case the situations worsens in China.”Jewellers in Jaipur say they used to generate business worth Rs 150-200 crore at the show which is now at stake.Besides gems and jewellery, importers and manufacturers of furniture, stationery items, toys and other raw material are also in a bind, not knowing the next step to take.“Chinese products are 15-20% cheaper which a major reason why many companies have stopped making them here. Now, it is difficult to import and the industry is keeping its fingers crossed. If the coronavirus problem persists, the companies may have to start making those products again,” said Digvijay Dhabriya, chairman of PHDCCI-Rajasthan. The stone industry is facing a similar dilemma. Arrivals of buyers, who would earlier come and mark the stone blocks for import to China, have stopped following visa freeze. Interestingly, much of the machinery used by the stone industry is from China.“Now, there is no scope to replace parts of the machines if need arises. The impact will be significant if the virus problem continues to prevail. A significant part of the exports go to China and it will certainly impact the industry,” said Ashok Dhoot, vice-chairman, Centre for Development of Stones, a subsidiary of RIICO.

CLEARED SKHER

Nashik: The flyover on the Mumbai-Agra highway on the stretch between Dwarka to Meenatai Thackeray Stadium would be closed for traffic within a month by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) for connecting it with a new 2.3-km flyover that is under construction.

NHAI officials said the work of the new flyover from K K Wagh College to Jatra Hotel is going on at a fast pace. The work of putting slabs on the beams is underway from both the sides. Once the work of putting slabs at the K K Wagh College end is done, NHAI is planning to start linking the existing flyover with the new one.

A senior official of NHAI said, “In about a month’s time, the work of putting slabs on the flyover beams would be over. Once we get the police permission, the stretch of the Dwarka flyover from Dwarka to Meenatai Stadium would be closed for traffic, to link this stretch with the new flyover. The work of joining the two flyover would take another two months.”

However, the stretch of the flyover from Dwarka to Indiranagar will remain open for vehicular traffic. Those coming from Mumbai side can descend at Dwarka junction from the down ramp and those who want to take the flyover towards Mumbai can use the other ramp to take the flyover.

The official added that currently they have completed 60% work of the new flyover and by December-end, the entire flyover would be ready and thrown open for vehicular traffic. The work of the new flyover began in November 2018. Officials said they needed three more months to complete the work.

Police commissioner Vishwas Nangare Patil said, “The ban on heavy vehicles from entering the city from 8am to 10pm, which was put into effect from Monday, would put drivers of heavy vehicles into the habit of not entering the city. The aim is to ensure that heavy vehicles like goods trucks, private passenger buses do not use the Dwarka junction. This rule will also help when the flyover is closed for traffic.”

Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari had laid the foundation stone of the new flyover in November 2016 in view of the large number of road accidents taking place on this stretch of the highway. The actual work began in November 2018.

Box: Transport association unhappy

Official-bearers of Nashik Transport Association presented a memorandum to the city police to reconsider its decision of banning heavy goods vehicles in the city from 8am to 10pm daily.

President of the association Rajendra Phad said the alternative routes suggested by the police were narrow and have a rush of small vehicles. They also argued that arranging workers for taking delivery of goods after 10 pm would also be difficult for the traders.

DEHRADUN: A recent brand audit of plastic waste in the city has revealed that wrappers of milk, biscuits, namkeen etc are contributing to maximum plastic waste in Dehradun.

The survey, ‘The Great Dehra Plastic Waste Brand Audit 2020’, conducted by city-based Social Development for Communities (SDC) Foundation, found that several popular brands of milk and food products were contributing the most significant amount of plastic waste. The organisation has demanded that these companies should take responsibility of collection and disposal of the single-use plastic in which their products are packaged as per the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016 which mandate that companies are responsible for the waste that they generate under the ‘Extended Producer Responsibility’ specified in the rules.

Anoop Nautiyal, founder, SDC Foundation, told TOI that the plastic waste collected during the brand audit was categorised into three categories — branded waste, non-branded waste and non-woven plastic bags. Among the branded waste were 72 packets of namkeen, 66 packets of biscuits, 61 packets of chips, 50 packets of instant noodles,and around 80 milk pouches . According to Nautiyal, all this plastic waste was found in a 10 bigha area near Ashirward Enclave at Vasant Vihar, dumped in dustbins as well as on the ground. Around 27 kg of non-branded plastic waste was also collected by the auditors as well as 4.7 kg of non-woven plastic bags.

Rishabh Shrivastava of SDC Foundation told TOI that “it is clear that branded manufacturers have emerged as major plastic polluters.” “The audit highlights the blatant violation of plastic waste management rules by the companies and it is important that they implement the legal doctrine of ‘Extended Producer Responsibility’ in order to create plastic- free cities and towns.”

Reacting to the audit, Anand Vardhan, secretary, forest and environment, said that “being a green state, Uttarakhand has already initiated a conversation with all the companies who sell their products in plastic packets seeking their explanation on how they are planning to dispose the plastic waste.”

“We have written letters to companies who sell their products in plastic packets to find out what they are doing about plastic waste management. We are still awaiting their replies,” he added.

Meanwhile, SDC Foundation in association with the Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP) on Tuesday established the seventh plastic bank in the city at DAV Inter College, Prem Nagar. The plastic bank aims to facilitate source segregation, collection and recycling of single-use plastic waste getting generated in households and local communities. The plastic waste collected will be converted into diesel at IIP.

Aurangabad: Maharashtra Solar Manufacturers Association (MSMA) has demanded that there should be no grid support charges on power generated from the solar roof tops for the captive use.

The association, which has around 450 members, has also stated that banked solar power units may be charged at nominal rates up to Re one per unit.

“If the grid support charges are levied on the total units generated by solar roof top, then no one will install solar roof top as the cost of solar roof top unit will be higher than the cost of electricity supplied by the MSEDCL,” the MSMA has said in a memorandum submitted to the competent authorities.

The association has also highlighted that no state electricity regulatory commission has approved such grid support charges for net metering systems anywhere in India. “So it will be very wrong precedence by electricity regulatory commission to approve such charges as it is against the spirit of natural justice,” MSMA president Pradeep Kulkarni said.

The solar manufacturers have also brought to the notice some of the ground realities that allegedly rule out any scope for the grid support charges.

“The consumer uses his or her own premises for installation of the solar roof top system. The consumer invests in roof top project either by cash or by taking loan from some banks or institutions. Moreover, customer enters into an annual maintenance contract with the company who has installed the roof top project by making sizable payment,” the MSMA said.

Solar unit manufacturers have been alleging that the provision of the grid support charges were not part of the draft regulation released by Maharashtra Energy Regulatory Commission (MERC). “These specific charges were introduced in final regulations is more surprising. We have no option but to raise our voice against it in a democratic manner,” Kulkarni said.

When contacted, regional MSEDCL authorities said it would be inappropriate to comment on the policy decision taken by the energy regulator itself. An official mail sent to MERC remained unanswered till Tuesday evening.

65,['5/02/2020'],Pay sanitation worker as much as class-IV staffer: Rajasthan HC to govt,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Representative image

JAIPUR: A division bench of Rajasthan High Court asked the state government to pay salary equivalent to class-IV sanitation worker to a woman employee getting a meagre salary of Rs 240 per month. The court has further asked the government to pay the arrears within two months since the day of filing the petition by the woman.

The bench comprising Justice Sabina and Justice NS Dhadha gave these orders while rejecting the appeal filed by the state government against the order of single bench in favour of Geeta Devi.

Geeta Devi filed a petition in the high court in 2013 stating that she was appointed as a sanitation worker in Government Sanskrit College in 1986. She continued to get a salary of Rs 100 per month till 2010, when her salary was increased to Rs 240 per month by the college authorities. “It is a pity that this woman was getting a negligible salary and has not been regularized by the college authorities despite her continuous service. In 2018, a single bench had given order in our favour and asked the state to provide her salary equivalent to that of a sanitation worker in a government department, still the state government went against the order in an appeal to deny dues to the woman. Now, the division bench has given order in our favour and said that the order of the single bench is fair and calls for no interference,” said Anoop Dhand, counsel for the petitioner.

In the proceedings, state government had maintained that the woman works for only half-an-hour, thus she was not regularized. “To this, we said that for sweeping the dust and garbage, does anybody need a full day. That’s how sanitation workers work and can’t be expected to pick up a broom continuously for eight hours,” he added.

A single bench of high court comprising Justice Ashok Kumar Gaur, in his judgment on July 4, 2018 had said, for the job of a sanitation worker, an employee can’t be denied regularization with a plea saying he or she works for half-an-hour. The court then had also said that non-availability of sanctioned post should not come in the way of the petitioner getting minimum pay of a class-IV employee.

66,['5/02/2020'],Mixed response to demand for rickshaw ban on Jalna Road,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Aurangabad: MLA Pradip Jaiswal seeking a ban on the movement of auto-rickshaws, especially the ones operating on seat-sharing basis on the busy Jalna Road , has evoked mixed reactions. While a section of citizens has supported the move in the wake of growing traffic congestion on the road, many have opposed the move owing to connectivity issues.

In a letter submitted to state transport minister Anil Parab, Jaiswal has requested the ban on auto-rickshaws on a particular stretch of Jalna Road — between Mahaveer Chowk and Chikalthana. He accused auto-rickshaws of causing traffic indiscipline, leading to congestion on road. The MLA said that these vehicles can be held responsible for some of the fatal accidents held in the past.

Notably, diesel-run auto-rickshaws have been already banned in the city limits, citing pollution reasons. Aurangabad police had imposed enabling provisions of the Bombay Police Act to ban entry of diesel auto-rickshaws into municipal limits.

Diksha Lohe, a resident of Jawahar colony, said that it makes no sense to ban the movement of auto-rickshaws on Jalna Road as it would cause huge inconvenience to public. “The city still does not have an effective connectivity through public transportation buses and banning these vehicles in such circumstances would be illogical. Citizens must get a better alternative before arriving at any such extreme decision,” she said.

Pankaj Pathak, a resident of the Seven Hill area said, traffic police have to play a crucial role in regulating traffic at Jalna Road. “It is the duty of traffic cops to regulate vehicular traffic on roads. The authorities cannot introduce blanket ban on the movement of any vehicles for any non-compliance. Auto-rickshaws cater to commuting needs of citizens in the best possible way and must not go off-roads on Jalna Road,” he said.

On the other hand, residents using two-wheeler or four-wheelers for commuting within city limits have welcomed the proposal of banning auto-rickshaws on Jalna Road.

JAIPUR: Two days after a 10-year-old girl was raped at a wedding hall, Jaipur police said they would urge marriage lawn owners to install CCTV cameras at various points.

Police also said prior to organising a wedding ceremony, lawn owners will have to provide them with a list of guests, including names of food caterers, people engaged in decoration, band and lighting.

The girl, who had accompanied her parents to a marriage engagement ceremony, was raped by a 36-year-old man late on Sunday night.

Police, however, managed to arrest the accused, who was a caterer for serving snacks at the function, within 24 hours. The accused, identified as Raju from Bhind in Madhya Pradesh, raped the girl in one of the toilets at the marriage garden, and left her in an unconscious state with severe injuries to her private parts.

The accused was one of those serving food. Police said the accused, in an attempt to overpower her, might have grabbed her by the neck as there were marks on her neck and head.

“CCTV camera footage is a handy tool these days in solving various crimes. In the past, we had witnessed cases of theft from wedding venues. Thus, we are going to make it compulsory for every marriage lawns to have working CCTV cameras. We are also aiming at time-to-time check of these CCTVs through local police station level,” said police commissioner Anand Srivastav.

He added that police would also take the help of JMC and the fire department to ensure marriage lawns comply with various others norms like proper lighting, parking and guards.

“We are also planning to ask the marriage lawn owners to provide us list of people engaged in wedding management right from food caterer, decorator, people engaging in bringing DJ at the wedding, videographer and photographer and others prior to organising a marriage at a lawn. It is necessary for us to have the proper credentials of these people. In the rape case too these things proved handy to make a prompt arrest,” he added.

Police would soon issue an official order in this regard by using its magisterial powers under Section 144 of CrPC.

69,['5/02/2020'],Fight BJP’s ‘Dushashans’ by boycotting NPR: Mamata Banerjee,"This story is from February 5, 2020

West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee (File photo)

BONGAON/RANAGHAT: Drawing on the Mahabharata, Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday likened BJP to a party of “Dushashans” against whom the people of her state should fight back using every means possible, including refusal to provide family data to census officers updating the NPR.

“Don’t tell them (census personnel) everything. Don’t provide documents like land or house papers and ration cards even if they ask for them. Don’t entertain them even if they come with West Bengal government identity cards. Some religious fanatics may reach your home with false identity cards,” Mamata told a large gathering of people from the border districts at Bongaon Stadium in North 24-Parganas.

She called NPR “the first step towards NRC” and part of a larger BJP ploy to bulldoze its way through any pocket of resistance. “They are now talking bullets to silence voices of dissent,” she said.

Mamata’s remark about “Dushashans” appeared to be a retort to Bengal BJP chief and MP Dilip Ghosh ’s “Shikhandi” barb at Trinamool Congress in the Lok Sabha while speaking on protests against the tweaked citizenship law in Kolkata and other parts of the country. “Unfortunately, these Shikhandis are in power there (Bengal). The police did nothing (against anti-CAA protesters). I opposed it. Now I am being defamed. I am a patriot,” PTI quoted Ghosh as saying.

While Dushashan disrobing Draupadi is seen as the most vile act in the Mahabharata, comparisons with Shikhandi are meant to invoke cowardice because the transgender warrior was used as a human shield to kill Bhishma at Kurukshetra.

Don’t tell them everything. Don’t give documents like land or house papers and ration cards even if they ask. Don’t entertain them even if they come with Bengal govt ID cards.

70,['5/02/2020'],Pedestrian signals missing on Jalna Road &amp; other areas,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Aurangabad: The local civic body, among other authorities, has failed to set up pedestrian signals on the Jalna Road and other busy areas of the city despite a long-pending demand for the same.

The historic city of Aurangabad witnesses huge movement of tourists and these visitors also face difficulties due to the absence of pedestrian signals.

Pedestrians have to face problems while negotiating heavy vehicular traffic in the city, especially on the busy Jalna Road, Jalgaon Road and Beed bypass road along with popular areas such as Gulmandi, Nirala Bazaar and Connaught place to name a few.

Sharad Advant, of the advocacy group Marathwada Janta Vikas Parishad, said it is sad that Aurangabad does not have a single pedestrian signal despite a surge in vehicular population to above 11 lakh.

“The absence of pedestrian signals exposes hundreds of pedestrians to the potential risk of traffic accidents every day. While a pedestrian is considered the king of the road in road safety parlance, needs of this category have been neglected in Aurangabad,” he said.

Pedestrian signals are instruments installed at busy roads and intersections to notify pedestrians when it is safe to cross the road. Several modern pedestrian signals have countdown timers built into their circuit so that they can display the seconds remaining before the signal changes. While bigger cities such as Mumbai and Pune have had pedestrian signals for long, residents of Aurangabad continue to wait for the desired facility.

Citizens living along the Jalna Road said the lack of speed-breakers coupled with the absence of pedestrian signals has made the road very prone to accidents.

“Children and senior citizens fail to properly gauge the movement of vehicles on the Jalna Road. We told our elderly and very young family members to not step out unless they are accompanied by someone,” said Nakshatra Mule, a resident of Manjeet Nagar.

When contacted, a senior RTO official said the proposal for setting up the pedestrian signals would be put before the next meeting of the district road safety committee. “The district road safety committee has representation from different stakeholders, including the civic body, and it would be an ideal platform to discuss the demand,” they said.

72,['5/02/2020'],Dragonflies to draw people to wetlands,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Scarlet Rock Glider

AURANGABAD: Pankaj Korapde , a researcher from Beed, has a unique way of attracting people to wetlands . He uses dragonflies to entice children and people of all age groups in various districts, including Aurangabad , Jalna and Parbhani, to establish a connection between people and wetlands.

Koparde, assistant professor, MIT World Peace University, Pune, feels that due to the lack of connection, wetlands are fast polluting or vanishing. He said that species conservation is intimately linked to habitat conservation. “For dragonflies, freshwater and forests are essential, which we, as a species, too need for survival. By taking dragonflies as a model insect, we want to sensitise people about the condition of wetlands and what they can do to conserve them. The Marathwada Dragonfly Mapping Project is a citizen science project wherein anyone, irrespective of their profession or academic background, can contribute towards research and conservation of freshwater resources of the Marathwada” Korpade said.

So far, 150 people from Marathwada have joined the project and have shared information about dragonflies spotted in the region.

According to Shravan Paralikar, research assistant of Marathwada Dragonfly Mapping Project, youngsters today are serious about their environment and what kind of planet they want to live-in. “The citizen science project provides an interface to people of Marathwada to learn about their dragonflies and think about the best ways to conserve their freshwater resources,” Paralikar said.

When asked about the reason why dragonfly was selected for the project, Korpade said that dragonflies evolved around 300 million years ago so they are evolutionary marvel and due to their colour and unique appearance people get attracted to it. “If you just tell people that water is important and one should not pollute its sources, they won’t get the message. So, we are using an insect to attract people which is called flagship species concept,” he said.

Korpade is carrying out the research under Prakriti Research Fellowship run by Carpe India Pvt Ltd and Grind Master Machines Pvt Ltd. Workshops have been held at schools and colleges in Aurangabad and Jalna. More such workshops and programmes are scheduled in Aurangabad and Parbhani districts.

Indore: Ongoing protest against CAA, NRC, NPA at Jama Masjid turn innovative and artistic on Tuesday after some painters used walls as canvas to showcase various incidents including the firing at agitators near Jamia Milia Islamia University in New Delhi. The protesters have displayed posters of freedom fighters of different religions to spread the message of communal harmony.

“With the help of paintings, artists have remembered martyrdom of Mahatma Gandhi, who want people of this country to live with harmony but we can see incidents such as open firing at agitators in Jamia area,” Zaib Pathan, management committee member of Samvidhan Bachao Andolan, told TOI. Meanwhile, Congress corporator from Ward 58 Julekha Anwar Qadari has written to district collector urging him to stop ongoing survey of food and civil supply department of BPL ration card holders.

“Currently, people of my ward are protesting against CAA, NRC and NPA and during this, field workers of food and civil supply department are carrying out the survey that is creating confusion and fear among locals. This is leading to an untoward situation for field workers and therefore, the survey should be stopped,” the letter read.

According to food and civil supply officials, the survey is about to complete in rural areas of district but in city, it could not be started in some parts, especially dominated by minority community, due to resentment among people.

“The food and civil supply department’s survey is meant to examine eligibility of ration card holders and it shouldn’t be linked with any other scheme or propaganda,” district collector Lokesh Kumar Jatav said.

According to senior administrative officials, creating any hurdles in the survey can be considered as obstruction to government work and it leads to appropriate actions in such matter.

Dehradun: Protesting anganwadi workers on Tuesday agreed to resume work and postpone their protest till March 10 after Doon mayor Sunil Uniyal Gama visited Dharna Sthal at Parade ground and met the protesters. On behalf of the chief minister, he assured the women that a committee will be formed by March 10 to look into their demands and in all likelihood, their honorarium will be increased from the next financial year, starting April.

The mayor also assured the workers that all of them will get paid for the days that they sat on protest and that none of them will be terminated from work. Some protesting anganwadi workers had received termination notice earlier.

“The state government totally recognises the efforts and sincerity that anganwadi workers put in at their work. We will try to meet all their demands with the onset of the new financial year,” said the mayor.

“The anganwadi workers have decided to resume their work, hoping that they will not be harassed by officials upon joining office for going on strike. We all had been fighting for our basic human rights. The mayor showed us a ray of hope, so we have decided to call off the strike for now, till March 10,” said Rekha Negi, president, Anganwadi Workers Union of Uttarakhand.

Anganwadi workers have been on the warpath against the administration for almost two months now, demanding Rs 600 per day wages and the status of a regular state government employee.

The district programme officers in some districts had sent termination letters to anganwadi workers through WhatsApp, triggering fresh resentment among the protesters. In Bageshwar, more than a dozen women were sacked through WhatsApp. Around a dozen protesting women lost their jobs in Dehradun as well.

Her parents searched for her at relatives’ homes and other places but could not find the girl. Next day, Dewan’s wife who knew the girl’s family went to meet them to inform that he had not come home since two days and she suspected that her husband had taken the girl away. The girl’s mother then approached police.

After she was brought back to Vadodara, Dewan was arrested and the girl’s medical check-up revealed that she had been raped. Later, during the trial the additional public prosecutor submitted medical and forensic evidence which were upheld by the court of additional sessions judge K M Sojitra.

File photo used for representational purpose

PUNE: The Pune railway station is on high alert after 10 used bullets of an AK-47 assault rifle were found in a sleeper coach of the Azad Hind Express on Tuesday morning.

The cartridges were discovered on one of the coaches after the train was moved into the railway yard.

“The train had reached Pune around 9.30am and was taken to the yard for washing and cleaning. The staffers found the ammunition in the waste bin of a washroom of the S2 coach,” RPF’s divisional security commissioner Arun Tripathi told TOI.

“The matter has been forward to the Government Railway Police, but we are also investigating the matter,” Tripathi said.

Of the 10 bullets recovered, seven were spent rounds, while three were cartdidge shells. “These are not live cartridges, but it is a serious matter, regardless. We have sought the passenger chart of this coach and are in contact with our counterparts in other cities to check if an FIR was lodged in this regard,” Tripathi added.

The train connects Howrah Junction in Kolkata to Pune. “The RPF contingent at the station is on alert and checks are being conducted,” a source said, without divulging any details on the steps being taken.

“We have prepared a panchanama and submitted the cartridges as unclaimed property. No FIR has been lodged, but we have made an entry of the cartridges found in the general register maintained at the police station. We have launched an investigation to establish the identity of the passenger travelling with the cartridges,” inspector Surendrasinh Goud from the Pune railway police station said.

82,['5/02/2020'],Mangaluru: Sood focuses on online outreach,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Praveen Sood

MANGALURU: Twitterati can now reach out to DG&IGP Praveen Sood online. The state’s top cop who as Bengaluru city police chief was active on the microblogging site, has taken to Twitter within 72 hours of taking over the baton from his predecessor Neelamani N Raju. The state police down the line will make its presence felt on Facebook, as Sood feels that Twitter and Facebook complement each other.

Sood told TOI, “I am finding my feet as the head of the police force of the state, and recognise it is vitally important for the state police to make its presence felt online, just like some other police units in cities, especially the Bengaluru city police.” The Twitter handle that Sood opened @DgpKarnataka is apart from his personal handle @Copsview, and will be used to report achievements of what personnel in khaki do across the state. It will also give information on policy issues, he said.

Admitting that while there are ready models available for the state police Twitter rollout, Sood said he will need some time to put together a team that can operate this police handle in a professional manner. “Since my role as the head of the police is quite different from what it was when I was the top cop of the Bengaluru city police, the Twitter content will have to be modified to suit the responsibilities that this role bestows on me and my earlier experience will stand me in good stead,” he said.

Noting that when he took over as DG and IGP and searched for an account for this designation, he could not find one. The account has since been created, Sood said adding, “It is still not active, but you can understand the intent. It may take a week or so before the handle becomes active,” he said. The handle will be used to inform netizens of steps that the state police intends to take to meet his objective of citizen-centric policing, he said.

“The handle will also focus on cyber security and women’s security as it is the best possible medium to create awareness on issues that affect the common man and netizens alike,” he said.

Sood admitted he will have to start from scratch on Facebook, as the state police does not have a Facebook page, and a strategy must be developed to harness this social media platform. “There should be a full-fledged and operational page some six months down the line,” Sood asserted.

PATNA: Four armed criminals looted jewellery worth around Rs90 lakh from a showroom at Jairam Bazaar under Khagaul police station in Patna district around 3pm on Tuesday.

The criminals thrashed jewellery showroom owner Sujeet Kumar when he had tried to resist. They also took away the DVR of CCTV cameras installed inside and outside. The criminals had covered their faces with mufflers and clothes.

Sources said the showroom is around 250 metres away from Khagaul police station. Sources said all the police personnel were busy at nearby Kothwan where MLC Ritlal Yadav’s daughter is to get married in the night.

The shopowner told the media that criminals were speaking in a dialect different from the one used in Patna area. “They had earlier come around 11am and asked to purchase jewellery for marriage. I told them to come later. The estimated cost of looted jewellery is around Rs90 lakh,” he said.

SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma reached the spot. SHO Mukesh Kumar Mukesh said the criminals had come on foot and sprayed some anaesthetic agent on Sujeet, who remained unconscious for over 2 hours.

PUNE: The Lohegaon airport has recorded a 23% dip in international passengers and a 6% drop in domestic flyers in 2019.An airport official attributed the decline to the problems that beset the aviation industry last year. “Quite a few flights were discontinued. The struggle for daytime slot remains a constant worry and a major roadblock in getting new flights,” the official said, adding that they were hoping for some improvement in numbers in the summer schedule, which starts from the end of March.“Last year the aviation sector faced — and continues to face — a major crisis. Jet Airways had shut, affecting flight movements at many airports. It also affected the international growth of the airport, as Jet operated two flights, to Singapore and Abu Dhabi . Those slots are still empty. Before this, Lufthansa grounded a flight to Frankfurt, as they don’t have aircraft for the route,” the official added.Pune MP Girish Bapat, who heads the airport’s advisory committee, recently said he was told by airlines that starting new flights was not profitable, even as Indian Air Force remains reluctant to give daytime slots. He said he would meet airlines in the this regard after the budget session of the Parliament.Pune airport witnesses 175 flights movements, down from the 200 recorded earlier. “The next fiscal is crucial for the airport. The new terminal building, which is expected to be a game-changer, will be ready by mid-2020,” another airport official said.Aviation analyst and expert Dhairyashil Vandekar, said factors other than the sector’s larger problems needed to be looked at. “The other reasons include the general slowdown in economic activity, and high fares charged by airlines to new airports like Shirdi, Nashik, Kolhapur, Belagavi and Dharwad. Another important reason is the inability of the Lohegaon airport officials to improve the passenger experience,” he said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73954123,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-309272,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lohegaon-airport-reels-from-declining-passenger-traffic/articleshow/73944380.cms

Sena’s Dushyant Chaturvedi celebrating after the results

Yavatmal: The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) has dealt yet another blow to the BJP on Tuesday as its candidate Dushyant Chaturvedi, hailing from Nagpur, won the legislative council seat from Yavatmal local self-government bodies constituency. He defeated Sumit Bajoria of the BJP by a margin of 113 votes in the by-election.

The seat was held by the NCP till 2016 and the same was allotted to Shiv Sena as per the seat-sharing agreement between the saffron alliance partners. The bypoll was necessitated as Sena’s Tanaji Sawant had resigned after he was elected to the legislative assembly from Bhum Paranda constituency in Osmanabad district.

The voting took place at seven polling stations on January 31.

In all, there were 489 voters from local self-government bodies such as zilla parishad, municipal corporation, municipal councils and panchayat samitis. Dushyant polled 298 votes, while his nearest rival Sumit got 185. Six votes were found invalid. Counting of votes took place at the local Bachat Bhavan.

District collector and chief returning officer Ajay Gulhane declared the result immediately after the counting and later handed over the certificate to the winning candidate.

District guardian minister and Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Rathod, senior Congress leader and former minister Shivajirao Moghe were among the leaders who reached the collector’s office to congratulate the victorious MVA candidate.

Speaking to TOI after his victory, Dushyant said the result was on expected lines. He promised to do whatever possible for him to solve the problems of the farmers during the his 28-month tenure as MLC. He also expressed gratitude towards the voters and MVA leaders.

The MLC bypoll had become a prestige issue for local biggies like Sanjay Rathod of Shiv Sena and BJP MLA Madan Yerawar. Rathod finally had the last laugh as he outwitted Yerawar and retained the seat for the party.

The mayor held a review meeting with the officials of health department and all ten zones on Tuesday. “I received suggestions from many people regarding the lack of public toilets during my interaction with people at ‘Walk and Talk With Mayor’, ‘Breakfast With Mayor’ and also through suggestion boxes campaign etc. I have decided to spend my entire mayor fund of Rs6 crore per annum on construction of public toilets. The plan for 48 public toilets has been finalized under current fiscal’s mayor fund. The tendering process and bhoomipuja will be performed before March 15. The construction will be completed within four months,” he said.

Name and numbers of Swachhata Doots have also been displayed at the toilets,” he said.

Currently, the NMC operates public toilets with 562 seats — 360 for men and 202 for women — at 68 locations across the city. There are 352 urinals in these public toilets while bathing facility is available at 112 public toilets.

91,['5/02/2020'],Objections raised on ward reservation process,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Aurangabad: A day after draws were held to fix reservation of wards, the election department of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has received objections on the process. Several questioned the process followed for the reservation, while, on the other hand, civic authorities said that they followed the procedure laid down by the election commission.

In a public event organised at Dr. Babasaheb Marathwada Ambedkar University (Bamu) auditorium on Monday, civic officials announced the wards for which reservation was directly fixed by the Election Commission of India (ECI).

Draws were held to assign reservation for the remaining wards. Subsequently, out of the 115 wards, 22 were reserved for SC, 2 for ST, 31 for backward class of citizens (BCC) or other backward class (OBC) and remaining 60 seats for the open category. A total of 58 seats bagged women reservation, of which 11 were reserved for SC-women, 1 for ST-women, 16 for BCC-women and 30 for women (general) candidates.

The process, however, did not go well with many of the aspiring candidates. Several people, including existing corporators, had to miss their opportunity of contesting from the ward in which they have been working because of the SC, ST and BCC reservations assigned to those wards.

According to civic activist Rahul Ingle, the reservation of Cidco N-3, N-4-Parijat Nagar (number 76) is questionable. “The ward had OBC reservation in 2005 and in 2015, it was reserved for women (open). But, the ward had never seen an SC candidate in the last three elections. Therefore, it should have been marked as an SC ward this time,” Ingle said.

Rupchand Waghmare, an independent corporator from Ekta Nagar, had his ward assigned for an ST candidate. He said that ST population in his ward was not high for it to be assigned as an ST ward.

When asked, head of election department and deputy commissioner Kamlakar Phad said that several people had reached out to him with their concerns on the reservation process. “They do not understand the rotation system of the election commission based on which the reservations were directly assigned to the wards. The wards reservation was decided based on previous three elections of the municipal corporation. I have not received any applications so far. They have a seven-day window to objections. When received, these objections will be sent to to the ECI for consideration,” Phad said.

The AMC election is likely to be held in the first week of April.

92,['5/02/2020'],Demolition order triggers STP money-back demand,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Pimpri Chinchwad: The National Green Tribunal’s demolition order of the Chikhali sewage treatment plant has left the PCMC in a tight spot, with opposition parties and activists demanding the recovery of the expenditure from the civic officials involved in its planning and construction.

The NGT order of January 30, 2020, stated that the sewage treatment plant (STP) was constructed within the prohibitive zone (the blue floodline) and lacked necessary permissions. The order directed the PCMC to immediately demolish the STP and take steps to construct it elsewhere in accordance with the law. “The entire exercise (demolition) shall be carried out within one month,” the NGT order stated.

When contacted, municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar said, “We received the copy of the NGT order on January 30. We will seek legal opinion before taking any decision.”

Residents of River Residency and other nearby housing societies had opposed the STP project when it was launched early last year. They then moved the NGT in April 2019. However, the PCMC began the STP construction along Indrayani river in Chikhali in July last year.

A resident said, “Had the PCMC not gone ahead with the project despite our strong protest, public funds would not have been wasted? The funds should now be recovered from the civic officials who implemented the project.”

As per a senior civic official, the STP aimed at reducing the pollution in Indrayani river. “The project cost was Rs 15 crore, of which Rs 1.5 crore has already been spent. If the under-construction STP is to be demolished, we will have to acquire land for it elsewhere and this could take a long time,” he said.

Datta Sane, NCP corporator from Chikhali, came down heavily on the civic administration for wasting public funds on the project. He demanded that the money be recovered from the civic officials who proposed the project, approved it and gave its work order.

Parag Gandhi, who represented the petitioners in the case, said, “Our main contention was that the PCMC had not obtained permissions from the MPCB and the state irrigation department for STP construction. We also showed photographic evidence of the inundated STP site during the monsoon. No construction is permitted in blue floodline area.”

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board (UEPPCB) has decided to monitor air quality across all 13 districts under its ‘State Air Quality Monitoring Programme.’ The body has also planned to monitor the air quality of Dehradun, Rishikesh and Kashipur round the clock. Till now, air quality was monitored manually barely twice a week and 104 times annually at five locations of these three cities. The 24x7 monitoring of air quality will be done at a cost of Rs 5 crore, officials said.

The move assumes significance as forest fires deteriorate state’s air quality every year and the state fails to provide air quality data on time from the hill districts where devastation from forest fires is the maximum. Also, the number of industries is growing at a significant pace which is further contributing to air contamination. At present, air quality of only six cities – Dehradun, Rishikesh, Haridwar , Kashipur, Haldwani and Rudrapur — is monitored under National Air Quality Monitoring Programme. The air quality of these cities has gone below acceptable standards. PM 2.5 levels in these cities are more than 40 and PM 10 levels are over 60. They have been tagged “non-attainment cities” in view of air pollution.

The state pollution control board has also decided to monitor air and water quality of the industrial sites in the states. “As more and more industries are coming up, we are taking steps to ensure that they adhere to pollution control norms. The inspection of air and water quality will be done on a regular basis in industrial sites,” SP Subudhi, member secretary of UEPPCB, told TOI.

Checking water pollution in rivers (other than Ganga and Yamuna) is yet another priority, as per the state government. “Water quality is currently monitored at 56 points under State Water Quality Monitoring Programme. But soon, we will add 44 additional points to this list,” said Harak Singh Rawat , state forest minister.

Also, UEPPCB will make attempt to involve youths in solid waste management. “We have serious scarcity of data to actually set up some baseline to execute works. Thus, we will involve meritorious students of national-level institutes in collecting data. We will fund their research works,” added Subudhi.

95,['5/02/2020'],Don’t extol Maoists: CM to opposition,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Twaha Fasal and Allan Shuhaib

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Reaffirming that the government was not responsible for National Investigation Agency (NIA) taking over the Pantheerankavu UAPA case , in which two young CPM workers were taken into custody for alleged Maoist links, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan accused the opposition of trying to ‘extol’ Maoists for political gains.

It may be their past practice that prompted the opposition to accuse the government when police slapped UAPA provisions against people taken into custody for unlawful activities, he said on Tuesday.

“It’s not in consultation with the political dispensation that police decide what particular provisions and acts should be invoked against people taken into custody. There is no truth in the allegation that the government wilfully handed over Pantheerankavu UAPA case to NIA,” he said.

Vijayan said as per the provisions in the NIA Act — passed by the Centre when P Chidambaram was the home minister — the agency can take over cases on its own. “State consent is not required to take over such cases. NIA took over the case even before the case came under the scrutiny of a committee, headed by retired HC judge, that ascertains whether police decision to evoke UAPA provisions against the accused were correct or not,” he said.

The chief minister was replying to an adjournment motion notice by IUML leader M K Muneer to discuss the fresh crisis that Allan Shuhaib and Twaha Fasal face following Kannur University’s decision to oust them for want of mandatory attendance. Muneer said the opposition was not interested in a discussion on who promulgated UAPA or who set up NIA.

“The chief minister should specify what evidence made Kerala police arrest the youngsters. The role of NIA came only after the state police slapped UAPA on them. It’s said that some literature was seized from them, this includes a copy of CPM’s party constitution. Police claim the boys were under surveillance for the past five years and Allan had written pro-Maoist slogans when he was a class IX student. This is absurd,” he said.

Muneer asked the government to evoke 7B provision in NIA act, that gives a chance to bring the investigation back to the state police.

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala echoed the demand only to be ruled out the chief minister who said the case could be handed back to the state police only if the Centre agreed to do so. “Do you mean that I should go to Amit Shah with a request letter? There seems to an insatiable quest to justify Maoists in a bid to hit the CPM,” he said.

Opposition exited the house after the speaker denied permission for the motion.

96,['5/02/2020'],I-T tribunal quashes decisions favouring city cos,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Nagpur: The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) has reversed decisions given in favour of seven companies by the Commissioner of Income Tax (CIT) appeals office at Nagpur, in cases involving allegedly suspicious entries of share capital and share premium.

The rulings include one passed in favour of M/s Gupta Coal (India) Corporation Limited (GCICL), headed by city businessman Padmesh Gupta. The companies under the Gupta Group had featured in the list of major Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) of the country.

The case was argued by Dr Milind Bhusari on behalf of the department, relying on a Supreme Court decision of March 2019 in a similar matter.

Following searches and other actions, the income tax department had reported a number of questionable accounting entries over receipt of share capital and premium from various companies in the firms. As the amount was added into the taxable income, the companies filed an appeal before the CIT (appeals) office. An order was issued in their favour, said a source privy to the matter.

In March 2019, however, the Supreme Court in Income Tax vs NRA Iron an Steels Private Limited ruled in the department’s favour, which was an independent matter. The apex court directed that even if the entires may look perfectly legal, attempts have to be made to pierce the veil if the transactions defy the general business logic. This led to the department here taking up the cases at ITAT.

Some of the cases are as old as 2014, the source said. The ITAT order says that CIT (appeals) had issued orders in the assessees’ favour way back in 2014, but much has changed since then with regards to judgments of various higher forums on such matters. In the light of the Supreme Court decision in NRA Iron and Steels case, the earlier orders of the CIT (appeals) have been set aside.

Income tax sources says routing unaccounted funds back into a business through share capital entries is a common practice often busted by the taxmen. Share capital is subscribed at a heavy premium by the companies. This means a share worth Rs10 is purchased at Rs100, shelling out premium of Rs90.

In many cases, the share capital is subscribed by a maze of shell companies. Often, the very logic of offering heavy premium for any business appears to be questionable leading to income tax action. The very intention will be now probed even if the deals may look perfectly legal on the face of it, said a source.

PUNE: The Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) will start a one-year foundation course in Urdu from the academic year 2020-21.

Any student who has completed at least Class X can apply. The aim is to impart skills in Urdu reading, writing, listening and speaking.

“The course is being funded by the university. Pune being a cultural city, there are many working professionals who may want to learn the language.Those who love poetry, ghazal or history have a high affinity for Urdu,” said Sadanand Bhosale , head of the Hindi department.

Saleem Shaikh, an advocate and social activist who proposed to the SPPU vice-chancellor to start the course, said, “The University of Pune had an Urdu department which shut down about 40 years ago. Nowadays, even non-Muslims want to learn the language to enhance their knowledge of shayari, ghazal etc. The course will benefit many as the university will teach Urdu right from the alphabets.”

Bhosale said there will be two regular contractual teachers and as many visiting professors from other colleges. “The syllabus has already been framed. Learning Urdu will help in translational studies. Currently, we only have Hindi, Marathi and English translational skills, but this will enhance our scope. Whether to increase the level of the course till postgraduation will be taken up by the officials later,” he said.

The first batch of the foundation course will consist of 30 students. It will initially function from the Hindi department.

The modalities of the admission will be uploaded on the university website in due course.

After receiving the proposal, SPPU VC Nitin Karmalkar set up a committee under Sadanand Bhosale to work out the feasibility of the course. The committee consists of subject experts Azmat Dalal, Abdul Bari, Uzma Tasneem, apart from Anjali Kurane, professor of anthropology at SPPU.

Aurangabad: In a programme held at the Government Cancer Hospital (GCH) on the occasion of World Cancer Day on Tuesday, survivors shared their stories to raise awareness about early signs, diagnosis and treatment of the disease.

The hospital, being developed as State Cancer Institute, treats patients from across Maharashtra as well as other states.

Geeta Uday Pol, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016, shared her personal experience. She said that she had a habit of conducting annual health check-up. “Right before my birthday on August 9, 2016, I was diagnosed with a lump in my breast in the mammography. I only shared the revelation with my husband, an Army colonel, who offered his wholehearted support. He told me that the way I supported him when he fought Kargil War, he will also support me when I fight cancer,” she said.

Pol later completed her treatment and now visits different hospitals in the city and counsels cancer patients on prevention and management.

Pune: Maharashtra State Commission for Women (MSCW) chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar, who had moved the Supreme Court against the Bombay high court’s observation that she had not demitted office despite the change in government, tendered her resignation from the post to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday.

Rahatkar’s resignation followed the Supreme Court’s order on Tuesday dismissing her special leave petition (SLP) against the high court’s order on January 22. “We are not inclined to interfere with the impugned (under challenge) order. The SLP is, accordingly, dismissed,” the SC bench of Justice R Banumathi and Justice A S Bopanna said on Tuesday.

On January 22, the HC bench of Justice S C Dharmadhikari and Justice R I Chagla, while hearing a PIL filed in 2013 by Pune-based activist Vihar Durve, observed, “We expect the learned AGP (additional government pleader) to apprise all concerned of the position in law that the chairperson cannot continue and hold the office when the present political dispensation is keen to appoint a chairperson of its choice. We expect that before the next date we will be informed about the appointment of the new chairperson.”

The high court’s observation came after AGP N M Mehra told the bench that the state would initiate the process of appointing the chairperson to the MSCW. Mehra told the bench that the present chairperson was Vijaya Rahatkar and she had not demitted office. Mehra submitted that though Rahatkar was aware that the office was held by her at the pleasure of the government and that she was appointed under the erstwhile political dispensation, she was yet to demit office or resign from the post.

Rahatkar took an exception to the HC’s observations in her SLP before the Supreme Court, claiming that her appointment was not political in nature and was subject to provisions under the Maharashtra State Commission for Woman Act, 1993. She said in the SLP, filed through lawyer Nishant Katneshwarkar, that her post was statutory and had nothing to do with the change in the state government. The HC was compelling the state government to remove her from the post of the chairperson of the commission and make a new appointment, the SLP stated.

In her resignation letter, Rahatkar said she was re-appointed the commission’s chairperson on February 18, 2019, for a period of three years. “However, I myself have decided to resign from the post,’’ she said.

Rahatkar said she had earlier served the first term from 2016-2019, when she was able to take up several issues relating to women and that that she received cooperation from all the departments.

Pune: Family members, friends, colleagues and other close contacts of the China-returned travellers should also report themselves to health officials in case of developing flu-like symptoms, medical experts said in the wake of the novel coronavirus threat.

They said it would help in containing the spread of the contagion. “Coronavirus is airborne and can spread through droplets. Close contacts, who are exposed to the travellers returning from China, are being tracked by health officials. But it is also their responsibility to self-report if they develop any illness,” Sudhir Patsute, head of the civic-run Naidu hospital, said.

“The novel strain of the coronavirus has governments and health experts worldwide on their toes. However, one of the oldest and most effective methods of containing a contagious virus has always been contact tracing. This is the most simple and efficacious way to contain the virus. But in addition to health officials, it calls participation from the society,” Patsute said.

In contact tracing method, health officials find out who the suspected persons (in this case travellers returning from China) have been in contact with. Thereafter, they are quarantined and tested. “Officials draw information about the people who have come in contact by interviewing the travellers. They then try to understand about people who have been exposed to the traveller in the preceding days and weeks as there are chances that the virus may have infected these people too,” state surveillance officer Pradip Awate said.

Eye surgeon Sanjay Patil, president of the city chapter of Indian Medical Association said, “In Punjab's Faridkot, a traveller who returned from Canada via China refused to get himself admitted at the government-designated isolation ward. Health authorities had to seek help from the police to get him isolated. Community’s cooperation is crucial in containing the virus spread.”

105,['5/02/2020'],Army looks at desi vendors for improved ammunition,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Pune: The Army is looking at Indian vendors for development of prototypes of ammunition, which can penetrate a 530mm thick armour of enemy tanks from a 2km range to enhance the lethal effect of its battle tanks.

The Director General of Mechanised Force recently invited an expression of interest from Indian vendors for the development of a prototype of Armour Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot (APFSDS) ammunition. The newly developed ammunition will be fired from the T-72 and T-90 battle tanks.

As of now, the army’s primary tank ammunition is the 125mm APFSDS. “The advent of superior protection technologies has improved armoured fighting vehicles, including those of our likely adversaries. They can defeat the penetration capability of current anti-tank ammunition,” the notice inviting the EoIs stated.

Depth of penetration is a major consideration for countering and defeating enhanced protection level for AFVs. A senior army officer said, “The present in-service ammunition has a DoP of 460mm. Therefore, there is a requirement to indigenously develop an improved APFSDS ammunition to enhance the lethality of our battle tanks.”

The armour is made from composite materials. Unless the ammunition has the capability and hits at a particular angle from specific range, it will not break the armour.

The Defence Acquisition Council headed by defence minister Rajnath Singh had approved this project in September 2019, another senior officer said. “The mechanised forces want to procure over 80,000 rounds of this ammunition,” he added.

Currently, the Ordnance Factory Board supplies this ammunition to the army. “The board has already developed a prototype of ammunition. At the same time, the High Energy Materials Research Laboratory and Armament Research and Development Establishment laboratories of Defence Research and Development Organisation are working on the prototype,” the officer said.

A senior DRDO scientist said, “The development of this ammunition is underway.”

108,['5/02/2020'],Engineering student loses Rs 24 lakh to franchise trap,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Pune: A 23-year-old engineering student, eager to start a branded retail outlet of a smartphone company, fell for the lies peddled by two cybercrooks and lost nearly Rs24 lakh in the process.

The Wanowrie police have booked the fraudsters — a man and a woman — for duping Abhijit Sanjay Satav between October and December last year.

Satav, the son of a businessman from Handewadi, is a final-year electronics and telecommunication engineering student. Police said Satav saw an ad while he was browsing the internet.

“Satav, who is computer savvy, was tempted by the (fake) advertisement of the mobile phone company. He clicked on the ad and entered his details,” inspector Salim Chaus said.

From then on, the suspects — posing as representatives of the smartphone company — began to send him e-mails and text messages, offering to let him open a franchise outlet.

“The complainant, without verifying the suspects’ credentials, believed their claims and agreed to their demands. He transferred varying sums under the pretext of different charges to the suspects’ bank accounts,” Chaus said.

“I became friendly with the suspects after I contacted them via an online ad,” Satav told TOI, and refused to go into any more detail.

In all, he transferred Rs23.67 lakh. He realized he had been duped when the suspects stopped contacting him. He eventually approached the cybercrime police.

After a preliminary probe, an FIR was registered with the Wanowrie police. “We are in the process of collecting details of the bank accounts and calls made by the suspects to the complainant,” Chaus said.

109,['5/02/2020'],Sewage plant at Elamkulam gets government nod,"The existing 60-year-old sewage treatment plant at Elamkulam

KOCHI: State government has accorded administrative sanction to set up a new sewage treatment plant at Elamkulam at a cost of Rs 16.52 crore under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut) scheme. The order in this regard was issued on January 25 after the decision of the state-level high-powered steering committee.According to the earlier plan, the project would cost Rs 13.70 crore. However, as per revised estimate, the project cost would be Rs 16.52 crore. The committee gave administrative sanction for the work on the condition that Kochi corporation should meet the excess amount from State Annual Action Plan (SAAP) savings.The new plant with 5MLD capacity is coming up on nearly 20 cents on the plot, where the current plant, which is six decades old, manages to treat 3 to 3.2MLD sewage from five divisions with much hiccups.“A joint venture of two agencies — Mary Matha and Tomar — will set up the plant in one year. We will soon sign an agreement with them. The DPR of the project is ready. Only the structural plan of the plant is to be done by the agency. The new plant will be commissioned next year. We will dismantle the old plant, which started functioning in early 1960s, once the new plant becomes operational,” said an Amrut official.Amrut mission officials attribute the escalated cost for the new plant to three bizarre reasons. The first one is that there are very few contractors or firms in the field of municipal sewerage treatment in the state and hence the bidders are fewer. Though it is a small project, all mechanical components and machinery for each unit are required. Third reason is high water table in the proposed area and special precautions have to be taken during the excavation for foundation.The new plant will rely on moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) method to treat sewage waste. The conventional method takes more time to settle the sludge for treatment while MBBR method demands only short retention time to settle the sludge.“The benefit of the MBBR method is that it requires only a small area to set up the sludge settling tank. Primary step involves screening, where non-biodegradable waste and oil is separated from the sewerage. Secondary is aeration, biological treatment and settling, and tertiary stage is filtering and chlorination of the overflowing water from the secondary stage depending on the reuse purpose. Since the retention time is less, we only need a small tank compared to the tanks in conventional method,” said the official.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73949373,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-173815,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sewage-plant-at-elamkulam-gets-govt-nod/articleshow/73944432.cms
110,['5/02/2020'],Maharashtra to deploy drones to identify illegal sand mining hotspots,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Representative image

PUNE: The state government will use drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with advanced cameras to identify the illegal sand mining hotspots, following the Centre’s directives.

A state government official said using the drones would help keep a track on the sand mafia as well as calculate the sand used for infrastructure projects. “We had tried the drones on a pilot-basis for some districts and would replicate it now in other parts,” a senior state government official, working in the sand mining department, said.

It was only recently that the state, with its huge number of infrastructure projects, had put an order to use artificial sand to address the sand requirement in the state. “Such directives had been issued earlier as well. But, the present one has called for detailed guidelines to form teams that would involve both police and traffic police, which would be good to curtail any illegal activities,” the official said.

The state government said illegal sand mining was much lesser in Maharashtra as compared to the other states. But, cases of illegal sand dredging, especially along creeks, were on the rise.

In a first, states were also directed to quantify future demands for sand over the next five years, based on a market survey to compare demand and supply (factoring in illegal sand extraction). This needed to be done under the mining plan for each district.

The ministry of environment, forests and climate change stated the guidelines were based on various court orders. The Supreme Court in July 2019 pulled up the Centre for not being able to curtail illegal sand mining across Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.

A state official said along with physical surveys, the advent of advanced technology in the form of drones needed to be used by states to have a topographic overview and provide information accuracy to curb illegal sand mining.

In May 2019, the United Nations Environment Programme had declared India and China as the top two countries where illegal sand mining had become a major environment problem.

Extraction of sand from rivers, coastal marine areas, lakes, reservoirs, agricultural field, among others, lead to pollution, flooding, lowering of water aquifers, beach erosion, destruction of important ecological habitats and frequent droughts, an official said.

111,['5/02/2020'],Nashik MPCB to step up drive against single use plastic,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Nashik: The Nashik division of Maharashtra Pollution Control Board ( MPCB ) has decided to step up its drive against single use plastic following instructions from state environment minister Aditya Thackeray.

A Nashik MPCB official said they would write to Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) and other local bodies in the district to help in stepping up the drive.

Thackeray held a video conference with all divisions of the agency on Tuesday and has directed all divisions to do more to ensure the ban on single use of plastic is fully implemented.

“Single use plastic has been banned by the state government since June 2018, but the ban is not being implemented effectively. The environment minister expressed concern over lack of effective implementation of the plastic ban,” an official from the MPCB said.

“The minister has directed the MPCB divisional offices for effective implementation of the plastic ban and has instructed to chalk out an action plan at divisional level for its proper implementation,” he added.

The official said that it has also been decided to take up a drive on any week day to collect banned single use plastic.

“We will involve all civic bodies in Nashik division for effective implementation of the ban on plastic,” he said,

Nashik division of the MPCB includes four districts – Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon and Nandurbar. Last year in October, the NMC had conducted a drive to collect banned plastic in the city and it had received very good response. The civic body had collected 9,000 kg of banned plastics in the city in one day.

The civic body had also set up collection centres at 31 locations across six divisions of the municipal corporation — six each in Panchavati, Nashik Road and Cidco, five each in Nashik East and Satpur and three collection centres in Nashik West division.

Plastic bottles with capacity of holding less than 200 ml water, plastic water pouches, plastic bags, single use disposable items made up of thermocol or plastics like dish, spoon, cups, plates, glasses, fork, bowl, container, straw, were collected by the NMC.

Nagpur: Empty metro trains, deserted roads, closed marketplaces, and no rush at tourist destinations — this scenario is rare in China, especially during January and February when the country celebrates its New Year. However, things are different this year. The novel coronavirus (nCoV) has wreaked havoc in Wuhan, a Chinese province, claiming over 425 lives till February 4.

In view of the virus outbreak there, several countries including India have evacuated their citizens from China.

Many youths from Vidarbha studying in different universities there have also returned home. Some of them shared their experiences with TOI on Tuesday.

“People were enjoying New Year holidays in China when the coronavirus happened sometime after mid-December. We had planned to stay there till February 24. As the nCoV fear spread, on the insistence of our family members we decided to return. This was before the evacuation by government of India,” said Tanmay Bansod, who has been studying in China for the last four years.

Tanmay returned to Nagpur on January 31 with some Indian friends. They were thoroughly screened at Delhi airport and then allowed to go to their respective cities.

“Our university is in Hangzhou, which is far away from the virus epicentre. But, travel restrictions have been imposed there also. Those who want to go out of the university premises need to apply with valid reason. If the authorities are convinced, you get permission to go out for 2 hours. On return, one must undergo thermal screening,” he said.

The Chinese government has made provisions of thermal screening at several public places. Residents can go out for shopping or other purposes only once in two days. Masks and full-sleeved clothes have been made compulsory while going out. Moreover, you must come back home within 2 hours, he added.

“Though the restrictions have been of advisory nature, people are following them religiously. Their belief in local authorities is noteworthy. People help each other, make way for elderly and children, and strictly follow every alert issued,” Tanmay recalled.

“Restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on social media are often criticized, but the same have turned out to be a blessing in disguise as the curbs have restricted spread of fake news/rumours during the nCoV crisis,” said a China returned girl student, who was not willing to be named.

“I wonder how many wrong messages, fake news, rumours etc would have spread in India in such a situation. As all messages/posts on social media are screened in China, only right information reaches the users,” she said.

All these students are now worried as they are uncertain when they will be allowed to go back and resume their education. “Our sessions may get delayed, examinations may get cancelled and our stay in China might get prolonged. It’s good that we have reached home and feeling safe,” said one of the students.

Vadodara: Budgets, which warrant highest care at the preparation level, are expected to be error-free accurate documents. However, that wasn’t the case with the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) budget document for the year 2020-21. An error in the document implies 12 times rise in professional tax collected by the civic body.

The civic body’s draft budget presented by the administrative wing as well as the one cleared by the standing committee, included professional tax. But instead of an annual collection, this tax was shown as ‘collected monthly’. The error went unnoticed and was also included in the budget cleared by the standing committee on Monday.

It came to light only after the budget cleared by the standing committee was printed and circulated among the media. “It was clearly a printing mistake as the VMC does not decide on the tax. It is decided by the government and VMC only collects it and includes it in the budget,” said an official.

Officials pointed out that the total collection of professional tax in the budget was expected to be Rs 48.5 crore. “This is the amount we expected to collect,” said an official.

The fact that the faux pas was only as printing mistake also becomes evident from the fact that in the last budget for 2019-20, VMC had expected to collect Rs 45 crore. tnn

KOCHI: The Supreme Court-appointed committee to supervise the distribution of compensation has rejected the claims by Maradu apartment owners with multiple flats who sought Rs 25 lakh for each demolished dwelling.

Meanwhile, the committee noted that if the SC issues a directive that the owners are entitled to get interim compensation of Rs 25 lakh for each flat, the committee will revisit this order and direct the release of the eligible amount to all the owners.

Nine owners, who owned multiple flats in the buildings demolished at Maradu on January 11 and 12, approached the committee seeking interim compensation of Rs 25 lakh for each flat they owned. The committee has also approached the SC seeking clarification on this.

“The interim compensation is intended for rehabilitation. We (committee) think the said payment should be confined to Rs 25 lakh irrespective of the number of flats owned by a person. If the contention of the claimants is accepted, for the persons who own five flats, Rs 1.25 crore will have to be released for rehabilitation. We think, the same was not intended by the SC,” noted the committee.

The term of the three-member committee will expire on March 10. Meanwhile, the deadline set by the committee for owners to submit the documents sought in the proforma 3 expired on Tuesday. The owners had been asked to submit the proforma 3, along with the documents, for determining the balance amount, besides the compensation.

Representative Image

KOCHI: The Mumbai unit of directorate of revenue intelligence ( DRI ) has arrested a Kochi resident for his alleged involvement in aiding and abetting an inter-state smuggling syndicate that was illegally importing gold in the guise of brass scraps via ports in Gujarat. The accused VE Siraj , a resident of Elamakkara , runs a cosmetic shop in Ernakulam Broadway.

DRI sources said the accused went into hiding after the agency busted the smuggling gang, including kingpin Nisar Aliyar of Perumbavoor , whom Siraj was aiding a year ago. DRI officials said the smuggling gang operated through various ports in Gujarat and smuggled gold worth more than Rs, 1,000 crore from the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ).

DRI nabbed him on Thursday from his residence after receiving a tip that he had reached Kochi. He is now being interrogated in Mumbai. DRI officials suspect that he had invested huge amounts in the illegal gold business.

“Mumbai unit arrested Aliyar, the kingpin in the case, last year. After this incident, Nisar left India and stayed in gulf countries. Recently, he returned to Kochi and DRI received a tip on his whereabouts. Officials were tracking him for a while and arrested him at his residence. After receiving the transit warrant from a court in Kochi, they took him to Mumbai. The officials are tracking his involvement in the scam,” said a source.

DRI said that Siraj was not directly involved in gold smuggling activities in Kerala, but he was connected to one Asif and Fazil from Perumbavoor, who were the main operatives of Aliyar. Though Aliyar was arrested, Asif and Fazil escaped with 90kg of gold before DRI could nab them. Siraj reportedly aided them and DRI is confirming how he might have helped them.

Investigation has revealed that the gang smuggled 4,522kg of gold worth Rs 1,473 crore from the UAE. They would melt the gold and transform them into rods and discs and later colour it to look like brass.

Puducherry: A man with symptoms of flu and fever from Ariyankuppam on the outskirts of the town was admitted to an isolation ward in Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research ( Jipmer ) on Monday.

The man, aged more than 40, visited Singapore recently and had interacted with a delegation from Hong Kong during the business trip. He reached Puducherry two days ago with symptoms of flu and fever. With the coronavirus scare looming large, he preferred to approach Jipmer for treatment.

He was admitted in an isolation ward and doctors collected the swab samples of the man which would be sent to National Institute of Virology, Pune, on Tuesday to test for coronavirus infection.

“We will send his swab samples to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune today (Tuesday). We must follow standard operating procedures to collect swab samples from the patients and send them through designated people in designated vehicles. The samples will be sent by air to Pune. The test may take six to eight hours. NIV generally sends the results by email or conveys it over phone. We may get the results of the test by tomorrow (Wednesday),” said a Jipmer official.

The doctors treating the man said he was stable. “He’s not sick and not critically ill. The man will be soon transferred to a facility established by the district health authority. The government has taken a policy decision to treat patients testing positive for coronavirus at a state government facility and Jipmer will treat only critically ill patients,” said the official.

Presently, Jipmer has an isolation ward with facilities to treat five patients. “We will enhance the facility to treat more patients as and when the need arises,” said the official. NIV, Pune, is one of the institutes accredited in the country to test for coronavirus infection. Jipmer has not obtained accreditation to perform tests for coronavirus.

Three people from the Union territory – one each from Puducherry, Karaikal and Mahe, who returned after visiting China recently — are under home quarantine.

PUNE: By March-end, recruitment for as many as 800 teachíng posts for higher secondary classes in unaided private schools affiliated to the state government would be completed, education commissioner Vishal Solanki said.

The recruitment would be conducted through the Pavitra portal. The recruitment has been ongoing since the last 18 months, but the portal has technical glitches and court proceedings.

“The recruitment process has been going on in phases. There were some technical issues in the portal and some legal issues that were creating hurdles in the recruitment system. We are trying to find out some way to overcome these hurdles and conduct this recruitment,” Solanki said.

The recruitment is being done for teachers’ posts in schools affiliated to the local self-government and unaided private schools affiliated to the government based purely on merit.

“This exercise of candidates filling up preferences was over last month. The selected candidates’ list will soon be announced,” Solanki said.

Another 1,200 more vacancies reserved for ex-servicemen will also be conducted by March. A recruitment drive through interviews in private government recognised schools for 3,000 posts would also be conducted by the education department.

Solanki said there is a huge list of applicants and almost 10 candidates would be interviewed for one vacant seat so the competition to bag the post will be tough.

120,['5/02/2020'],Civic body alters bus project to curb financial losses,"This story is from February 5, 2020

CLEARED SKHER

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to roll out lesser number of buses under its bus service project to reduce the losses after district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal voiced his concerns about it.

NMC officials said that instead of introducing 150 electric buses, the civic body would roll out 50 such buses, for which the Centre would provide subsidy. Initially NMC had decided to run 400 buses — 150 electric, 200 CNG and 50 diesel .

This change of plan is apparently to reduce the losses that the cash trapped civic body could entail by rolling out the project as planned earlier. NMC officials said that the civic body would have suffered losses of over Rs 55 crore annually by operating 400 buses. However, by rolling out 300 buses, the civic body’s annual losses would be reduced by at least Rs 20 crore.

The district guardian minister had recently cautioned NMC to roll out the project in a judicious manner so that there is not huge financial liability on it.

The bus service is to be operated on GCC (Gross Cutting Contract) for a period of 10 years. This includes purchase of new buses, maintenance of buses, employing drivers, purchasing fuel, etc. NMC will pay charges to private agencies on kilometer basis.

The union ministry of heavy industries & public enterprises has approved a grant of Rs 55 lakh each to 50 of total 150 electric buses. This amount is to be given to the agency for procuring the 50 electric buses. Hence, the per kilometre rates for these 50 electric buses will be Rs 60 per km and Rs 80 per km for remaining 100 electric buses.

“Our losses will reduce by Rs 20 crore if we reduce 100 electric buses and operate only 50. We have also urged the government to give grant to all 150 buses instead of 50 buses. But until we get government the approval, we have decided to roll out 50 electric buses only,” said NMC sources.

NMC’s standing committee chairman Uddhav Nimse said the bus service with start from April 1. The CNG buses will be available by March-end. Moreover, Maharashtra Natural Gas Ltd (MNGL) has also assured to provide CNG for the buses through tankers and its six CNG stations, said Nimse.

The municipal corporation also has plans to run the Integrated Transport Management System (ITMS) through a private IT firm in an attempt to make the bus service more effective.

This system will help NMC track locations of the buses through GPS system and also the revenue collected as ticket machines will be connected online. NMC is already in the process of finalising the IT firms for the project.

Addressing a press conference, DCC president and MLC K Harish Kumar said the BJP should immediately expel Hegde from the party.

“Let the BJP expel Anantkumar Hegde from the party and remove him from his office as MP. This is not the first time that Hegde has made derogatory statements and is showing arrogant behaviour. In the previous instances, Hegde has assaulted a doctor, stoked a controversy by making statements of changing the Constitution and called rationalists dogs. He also made a provocative statement to, “Cut the hands of those who touch Hindu women”. It is a tragedy that such a person has been given entry into the Parliament as an MP,” Kumar lamented.

There are hundreds of historical monuments and statues of Mahatma Gandhi across the nation. Further, we can see roads in the name of Gandhi all over India, Kumar said, and dared the BJP to condemn Gandhi openly by removing all his memorials, if the party does not want to take action against Anant Kumar Hegde. “All people together should boycott Hegde, who made derogatory remarks against Mahatma Gandhi,” Kumar said.

He also urged the police to book a suo motu case against Hegde. “Criticising a government in a democracy is a right of every citizen, but the BJP considers it an anti-national act. If so, isn’t this, Hegde’s statements against Mahatma Gandhi, anti-national?” he questioned.

What is Kateel’s stand on Yettinahole?

BJP MP Nalin Kumar Kateel was in the forefront fighting against the Yettinahole project. At present, he is the state president of BJP, which is in power at the Centre and state. Hence, let Kateel explain his stand on Yettinahole project now. Since Kateel is president of the ruling party, he has the power to give directions to chief minister B S Yediyurappa. Let him direct the CM to stop the project now, Kumar said.

Kochi: Police need to be sensitized on the rights of citizens , including lawyers, who get involved in criminal cases, the high court said while quashing a case registered against a lawyer for trying to speak to an accused who was his client.

Justice P B Suresh Kumar considered a petition (Crl. M.C. No. 4749/2019) filed by advocate Prasanth K of Wayanad through advocate S Rajeev. He had challenged the case registered against him by Vadakara police based on the statement of a woman civil police officer escorting a woman accused in an NDPS case.

Offences alleged against the lawyer under IPC included wrongful restraint (Section 341), assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharging duty (Section 353), and assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty (Section 354). It was alleged that the lawyer tried to speak to the accused four times and finally shouted at the woman officer and pushed her.

Along with quashing the case, the court said, “Before parting with this judgment, I think it is my duty to observe that it is high time that the police need to be sensitized about the rights of citizens, including prisoners, and need to be trained to deal with the complainants, accused, witnesses, lawyers etc. in the peculiar social fabric of our country.”

Further, the court said it cannot agree with the conduct of the lawyer and the woman officer. “This court does not approve at all the conduct of the accused involved in this matter in chasing the prisoner. There are other more appropriate means in place for the purpose of conversing with the accused who seeks legal aid in a case. At the same time, I am unable to endorse the conduct of the police officer involved in this matter in refusing to permit the accused to converse with his client, the prisoner, for one or other reason and the conduct of the police officer who registered the case against the accused and later filed the final report in a case of this nature,” the judgment stated.

If the officer had behaved properly, leaving her ego behind, this incident could have been avoided, the high court said.

Vellore: Action will be taken against parents of minor children spotted driving vehicles without driving licence , warned Tenkasi S Jawahar, principal secretary and transport commissioner, while participating in the regional level road safety meeting for officials of the composite Vellore district (Ranipet, Vellore and Tirupattur) and Tiruvannamalai district on Tuesday.

During analysis, compared to other factors, it was found that road accidents on arterial roads in towns and cities were because of minor school students riding two-wheelers without licence and flouting safety regulations, Jawahar said. Apart from taking action against the minors , appropriate punishment and fines would be imposed on their parents too, he said.

Addressing the media, Jawahar said, “According to reports from road transport and highways department, government of India, in 2016, Tamil Nadu topped the number of road accidents with more than 17,000 fatal accidents. Following joint preventive and enforcement measures adopted by police, state highways, traffic, school education and transport departments, fatal accidents decreased to 10,000 in 2019. In the composite Vellore district, there were 870 fatal road accidents in 2016, but it decreased to 375 in 2019. Our vision is to create an environment with zero fatal accidents by 2030.”

“During the meeting, we discussed ideas with SPs and DSPs of all four districts and other department officials on how to enforce the helmet rule for both riders and pillions who are the most vulnerable road users,” he said. Out of the 3 crore registered vehicle users in Tamil Nadu, 2.45 crore were found to be two-wheeler users, he said.

When asked about the key strategies to reduce fatal accidents, Jawahar said the main reasons for road accidents is unskilled drivers and bad roads. While bad roads could be repaired after holding discussion with the authorities concerned, we plan to give intensified training and awareness to unskilled drivers, he said.

Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is yet to pay the share capital and its share of the corpus fund for the VMC Sports Promotion Foundation (VSPF). VMC has not been issued shares of the foundation that is a joint venture (JV) between the civic body and the Sports Authority of Gujarat (SAG).

VSPF was floated in 2015 as a JV for operations and maintenance of the Sama indoor sports complex as well as the Manjalpur outdoor sports complex. Sports complexes are amongst the prestigious projects taken up by the Vadodara civic body.

The VMC was to pay Rs 5 lakh towards shares of VSPF and another Rs 10 crore towards the corpus fund for the foundation. VSPF has been sending reminders regarding the amount to the VMC. The interest from the corpus fund is used for the upkeep of the two sports complexes. Sources said that SAG has paid its share of the corpus fund. Sources said that the auditors of VSPF have also pointed this out to the VSPF from time to time.

Sources said that the issue has been raised in board meetings of the VSPF too. VMC commissioners or other officials attending the meetings have also been apprised of the situation in the meetings itself. The issue was also raised in the board meeting last month.

VMC officials have promised to take up the issue with the elected wing and get a nod for disbursing the amount to VSPF. But the civic body’s fund crunch and the fact that the elected wing is not very happy with VSPF working style may be hurdles in the process.

Puducherry: A differently-abled student from Puducherry has bagged the national child award (Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar) for 2020 for his exceptional achievements in academic and extra-curricular activities.

R Venkatasubramanian, a Class XI student of Kendriya Vidyalaya at Jipmer campus, received the award from President Ram Nath Kovind in a function at New Delhi.

Born with deformed left arm, Venkatasubramanian overcame his disability by channelising his energy into a wide range of fields, including abacus, karate, scouts and yoga.

He bagged the national gold medals in abacus for two consecutive years — 2014 and 2015 — and clinched a national silver medal in 2016.

“I solved the maximum number of problems (addition, subtraction, division and multiplication including numbers with two decimals) in the given three minutes in the two nationals bagging gold medals (2014 and 2015). I finished second in 2016 nationals,” said Venkatasubramanian.

His father C Ramamoorthy alias Vaithianathan is a driver in a private firm while his mother R Jayapradha is a homemaker.

A regular participant in the national integration youth camps, Venkatasubramanian overcame 75% disability to finish third in the state-level karate tournament in 2012-13. He has also received a certificate for Rajapuraskar as a scout in Bharat Scout and Guides held at Kendriya Vidyalaya, Ernakulam.

Taking a break from all his extra-curricular activities, Venkatasubramanian has now set two goals in his life – one to win a medal in Paralympics (international multi-sport event for the differently-abled) for the country in badminton and the other to join civil services and serve the country. Ramamoorthy and Jayapradha are confident that their only son will realise his dreams. Jose Mathew, Kendriya Vidyalaya (Jipmer) principal, said the strength of his student is to set realistic goals. “He is among several differently-abled people who prove that disability is a state of mind,” said Jose Mathew.

“I joined an academy to hone my badminton skills to successfully compete at the international level,” Venkatasubramanian said. He along with his mother called on lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi and sought her blessings on Monday after receiving the award from the President.

Vadodara: The Kevadia police in Narmada district on Tuesday arrested employee of a travel agency for overcharging tourists for entry tickets to Statue of Unity (SoU). The accused had tampered with the tickets and charged more money from the Delhi-based tourists.

The police said that it is yet to arrest owner of the Ahmedabad-based Rao Travel Agency. “We have nabbed the computer operator Jay Hakani who used to issue tickets to the tourists. We are looking for owner of the agency as he too is the prime accused,” said A D Rathwa, police sub-inspector, Kevadiya.

The police said that it is investigating the case further to find out if the accused had overcharged other tourists too for SoU tickets. The racket surfaced on Sunday when Ehsaan Saiyad, who works as ticket coordinator at SoU, noticed anomalies in the entry fees rate on the tickets that the tourists produced.

Saiyad got 10 express tickets having Rs 1,260 written on them towards entry charges, whereas the actual entry fee is Rs 1,030 per person. The matter was reported to SoU officials who then filed a complaint with the police. The tourists told the police that they had booked the tickets from a Delhi-based travel agency that in turn had got the tickets from Rao Travel Agency.

The accused duped the tourists of Rs 2,300. This is second such incident within a year. In May 2019, a travel agency was busted for overcharging on SoU entry tickets. SoU officials have urged the visitors to directly book the tickets online without involving any agent.

Edappadi K Palaniswami on Tuesday inaugurated an FoB on GST Road linking Alandur metro station

CHENNAI: After a foot overbridge (FoB) was opened on Tuesday giving commuters quick entry to Alandur metro station, Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) will add more cabs to its existing fleet to provide commuters with easy access to all metro stations. The FoB built at a cost of Rs 9.7crore on the busy GST Road, nearly five years after the station started operations, was inaugurated by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami.

A CMRL official said by April they will have about 256 share cabs. The 32 stations of phase-1 will get eight cabs each providing commuters a feeder service for first and last mile connectivity. The cabs will be linked to an existing app where commuters can select one of the pick-up locations given for each station and either pay online or through smart card. “The fleet will be ready in three months. The app-based service will replace other share taxis and share autos,” the official said.

At present, the share cab service is being operated at 16 stations with 32 cars. But commuters complain that the service is erratic and not enough cabs are available, particularly during peak hours.

The FoB has several facilities for an easy and safe access for commuters including four escalators, two elevators, LED lights, CCTV cameras and ramps. The facility links the city’s largest elevated transit hub at Alandur with the air-conditioned bus stop at Asarkhana and the upcoming inter-modal urban square under Kathipara grade separator.

S Bhuvaneshwari from Tambaram was one of the first metro commuters to use the facility soon after it was inaugurated through video conferencing. “It usually takes me 30 minutes to reach the station from Asarkhana bus stop which is on the opposite side of GST Road because I walk all the way upto Kathipara flyover and cross the road. Today, it took me just three minutes,” said Bhuvaneshwari, who takes metro at Alandur to go to her office at CMBT daily.

AGRA: The proctor of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) on Tuesday stepped down from his post and the varsity said it was mulling rescheduling the exams missed by protesting students in an apparent bid to break to deadlock between the administration and the protesters.

The varsity’s move to placate the frayed nerves met with mixed responses. A large group of protesting students was not impressed and said they will not settle with anything less than the scalps of the vice-chancellor (VC) and registrars who they hold responsible for the entry of security personnel into the campus.

AMU proctor Afifullah Khan did not specify reason for his resignation. He stepped down days after students launched an agitation demanding his resignation along with that of VC Tariq Mansoor and registrar Abdul Hamid after the December 15 violence in the campus which left several of them injured.

Prof Khan’s resignation was accepted by the vice chancellor, who appointed Professor Mohammad Wasim Ali of the law department as the new proctor.

After the violence on the night of December 15, thousands of students of various faculties have been on an agitation demanding resignation of top university officials, including the proctor, for the alleged police excesses in the campus. They also gave a miss to exams.

AMU’s coordination committee member Faizul Hassan, who is also the former students’ union president, said that though this move is “welcome”, but the students will not call off their stir till their other demands, including resignation of the VC and the registrar, are fulfilled.

Meanwhile, varsity spokesperson Rahat Abrar said, “The university is back to normal to some extent, and efforts are on to address other pending issues including quashing of the FIRs lodged against students of the varsity.”

He said, barring a few departments, classes were held in the university on Tuesday and the “examinations will be rescheduled soon”.

According to university officials, the proctor’s resignation has helped “build confidence among students and the administration is hopeful that the situation will normalise by next week”.

KOCHI: Despite clarification issued in Lok Sabha on non-existence of Love Jihad in Kerala on Tuesday, the Syro-Malabar Church has said that the circumstances under which they made the statement exists.

Answering a question by Benny Behanan MP, Union minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy had stated that “no such case of ‘Love Jihad’ has been reported by any of the central agencies”. He also said that “the term Love Jihad is not defined under the extant laws”.

In a statement, the Syro-Malabar Church said the public affairs commission discussed the report presented before the Lok Sabha. “The Synod has, at no point in time, made any statement or observation that will in any way threaten the longstanding friendship and understanding existing between the Christian and the Muslim communities. The Synod only demanded that the authorities concerned should probe the issue as this matter might adversely affect the families and the society at large. The circumstances under which the Synod made this statement still exists,” the statement said. The Church expressed its concern in the matter after carefully examining various reports furnished by the different dioceses across the state, it said.

The commission also observed that the stand of the Church has been misinterpreted by vested interests which could lead to serious consequences. Objecting to such moves, it alleged that it is being used in news channels and other media continually with the ulterior motive of endangering the communal harmony in Kerala. The statement requested members of the church as well as the civil society to be cautious and alert towards such intents.

“It is the earnest desire of the Syro-Malabar Church to maintain and preserve the communal harmony and brotherhood that prevails in our state,” the commission said, reminding the faithful to maintain extreme caution in this regard.

Kochi: On Tuesday, various hospitals celebrated World Cancer Day by launching a screening programme or creating awareness about the disease. According to WHO, one in 10 Indians will develop cancer during their lifetime and one in 15 will die of the disease.

The district-level awareness programme started with Valanthakad PHC ’s programme at Maradu Sreedevi auditorium. They discussed preventive steps like ensuring daily exercise and ending unhealthy habits. There was also a one-act play named ‘Arbudam’, to convey a message: fight against the disease.

Lisie hospital conducted an awareness class on various types of cancer and their symptoms. It ended with a street play to create awareness among people. Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS) inaugurated a specialized clinic for all breast-related ailments. “The unit offers the best healthcare package for multi-disciplinary consultation for female patients,” said Dr Beena KV, senior medical administrator at AIMS. Every year, AIMS treats over 500 cases of breast cancer.

On the other hand, DDRC SRL Diagnostic Services launched an innovative blood test named Agkura personal score to aid early detection of breast cancer in women. They have tied up with USA-based biotechnology company, OncoTAb, Inc, to provide these tests.

Meanwhile, Aster Medcity in association with NSS unit of department of polymer science and rubber technology at Cusat organized an awareness programme, for early detection of cancer. “In 20 years, major progress was made in cancer treatment. One-third cancer deaths can be avoided by detecting and treatment ,” said Dr Jem Kalathil, lead senior consultant (surgical oncology ) at Aster Medcity.

On the other hand, VPS Lakeshore hospital organized a cancer awareness session with people, in which they got to interact with specialists including Dr VP Gangadharan.

The participants will also be offered a free consultation with one of the oncologists at the hospital at later date .

‘Green jackfruit flour prevented leukopenia ’

Meanwhile, a study of 50 solid tumor patients over six chemo cycles in a private hospital showed that inclusion of green jackfruit flour as a dietary intervention prevented chemotherapy-induced leukopenia in patients undergoing chemotherapy.

Many patients having leukopenia needed expensive antibiotics and anti-fungal treatments. “The solid tumor patients were given 30g or three tablespoons of green jackfruit flour/day along with their regular food didn’t develop leukopenia in six cycles of chemotherapy. Since there was no leukopenia, there was no additional costs, dose reduction or rescheduling, which ultimately improved cure rates and 5-year survivals,” said Dr Thomas Varughese, oncologist and surgeon, Renai Medicity hospital.

Vadodara: Robbers speeding away in a truck and chased by two police cars with beacon lights with blaring siren. This may seem like a scene from a crime thriller, but this was the scene on the national highway-48 between Jambuva and Kapurai chowkdi on Tuesday early morning.

Two PCR vans chased around a dozen robbers for nearly 10 km after catching them red-handed siphoning off betel nuts and dry fruits from a parked container truck.

According to Rupsinh Baria, in-charge of one of the PCR vans, he suspected something fishy on seeing a few men shifting bags from the container truck to another in the parking bay near Jambuva bridge. Seeing the PCR vans approaching from a distance, the robbers quickly got into their trucks. Baria, an assistant sub-inspector, asked his driver Dhanpalsinh Manusinh to stop the van right behind the truck.

However, the truck driver reversed the vehicle, crashed it into the PCR van and sped towards Ahmedabad. The police vehicle’s bonnet and headlights were damaged, yet the two cops chased them and informed police control room. On the way, some men from the truck pelted stones at the PCR van due to which the windshield got damaged.

Another PCR van joined the chase from Tarsali on getting the wireless message. The other PCR van’s driver Chetansinh Vikramsinh tried to overtake the truck on Kapurai bridge. But the truck driver shoved the car away by brushing his heavy vehicle on the driver’s side. The other police vehicle was also damaged badly due to the impact.

Cops followed the truck even as it turned towards Dabhoi at Kapurai chowkdi. But with broken headlights, the cops could not follow the truck much. After a distance, the two vehicles turned back towards Makarpura police station where they registered an offence of attempt to murder, assaulting to deter public servant from performing his duty and Damage to Public Property Act.

“We have got the truck’s registration number, but it turns out that it was fake. We are checking the footages of CCTV camera to find out more details about the truck,” said inspector R A Patel of Makarpura police station.

KOCHI: A day after issuing notices to all hospitals in the city, the police team, which is investigating the incident in which the body of a preterm baby was found in a bucket in Perandoor Canal at Elamakkara , has brought health clinics under its jurisdiction under the scanner.

The decision was in the wake of reports that several clinics in the city are illegally helping to carry out abortion and the police suspect that the baby’s body could have been dumped after abortion in one of those clinics.

Though the police have sent a notice to all hospitals on Sunday invoking Section 91 of CrPC (summons to produce document or other thing) seeking details like whether any premature baby was delivered or aborted in any of the hospitals in the recent dates, not many hospitals have submitted the details till Monday night. “We are checking the clinics in the city too,” said an officer.

Meanwhile, top police sources said they have identified the parents of the baby and the hospital where it was delivered. They said that more details cannot be divulged now.

“The investigation is proceeding and we are yet to confirm why the body was abandoned in such a manner,” said a top police officer.

139,['5/02/2020'],7 states to emulate antimicrobial resistance strategic action plan,"This story is from February 5, 2020

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Kerala Antimicrobial Resistance Strategic Action Plan (KARSAP) to combat the growing cases of antimicrobial immunity arising primarily from irrational use of medicines and excessive antibiotics used in livestock and poultry will be emulated by the seven states in the country.

Andhra Pradesh, Telengana , Karnataka , Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu , Goa and Puducherry have evinced interest in implementing the action plan to reduce the antibiotic use, said health minister K K Shailaja adding that the action plan has already attracted national attention. She was speaking at a workshop organised to provide training for the health officials from these seven states.

By 2021, the state is intended to become antibiotic literate. Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a serious public health threat. Major drivers of AMR include inappropriate use of antimicrobials in healthcare as well as in animal husbandry, especially those used for non-therapeutic purpose like growth promotion and in agriculture and fisheries. AMR cannot be completely eradicated however, collaborative and comprehensive action needs to be taken to reduce the prevalence and spread of antimicrobial resistance, said the minister.

To minimise the development of AMR and to maintain the effectiveness of existing antimicrobials, an integrated overarching “one health” approach is essential in addressing this complex and challenging issue. The KARSAP has been developed involving multiple sectors and it addresses a wide range of activities required to tackle AMR problem effectively, she said.

says

created Shaheen Bagh because it could not counter the good work done by the

government in the past five years. In a wide-ranging interview with

Subhendu Mukherjee

and

Alok KN Mishra,

a day before campaigning comes to an end, he offered to open a window for cooperating with the corporations by giving them funds for specific projects, recalled how the Anna movement was all about hardcore patriotism, expressed concern about the violence wracking university campuses, and reiterated his commitment to work for the people of Delhi.

In any election, there is a lot of rhetoric from all sides. But this time personal attacks and communal overtones reached unprecedented levels. You were called a terrorist more than once, even by a Union minister. Where do you think is it coming from?

Do you wish Shaheen Bagh had not happened?

Independent of this, Shaheen Bagh has emerged as a symbol of the anti-CAA movement. What would you like to say about it?

Except for fielding Manish Sisodia and Bhagwant Mann, you carried the burden of the entire campaigning for your party while BJP unleashed a phalanx of senior leaders in the past 15 days. Will this have any effect on the election outcome?

AAP’s manifesto has promised deshbhakti curriculum. What was the need for it?

Political observers feel you are taking a soft nationalist stand.

kattar rashtrabhakt

Is that the reason why you did not go to Shaheen Bagh, Jamia and JNU?

Do you empathize with the students because there is turmoil in all campuses.

So, whom do you blame for this?

How is Arvind Kejriwal of February 2015 and that of February 2020 different? What has five years of being chief minister taught you and how has it changed you?

dhurandhar

You spoke about patience. Do you think that the initial one or two years were spent in combat. It could have been utilised in a better way.

You spoke about sanitation. What is the reason behind Delhi being a dirty city? What do you plan to do about it?

How will you tackle this?

Municipal polls are far away. You have promised to focus on sanitation in a major way. But the performance of the municipal corporations, which say that they are starved of funds, does affect the quality of life in Delhi. What is the way out?

Is there a way to address the grievance of corporation on funds?

You have questioned BJP about the lack of a chief minister face. Amit Shah has said that every citizen of Delhi is BJP’s CM candidate.

Pollution is Delhi’s biggest problem and it affects the poor the most. You did odd-even and the pollution level has come down but it is still a major issue.

BJP leaders are promising smog towers for Delhi.

Congress appears to be absent from the election campaign in Delhi. There are rumours that Congress has worked out a tactical alliance with Aam Aadmi Party.

You talked about giving transport a push in the next five years but buses did not come to Delhi in as many numbers as expected.

The modes of para transit like autos, e-rickshaws and grameen sevas are known for breaking traffic laws. Efforts to regulate them trigger an outcry on grounds like they belong to economically backward section.

The issue of hanging of Nirbhaya convicts has turned political when it is actually a legal issue. How did this happen?

But Nirbhaya’s parents are blaming your government.

You have been urging people to vote for AAP irrespective of the parties they belong to. Are you disassociating elections from ideology? And what has been your feedback?

Does that mean scaling down of your national ambitions?

The Anna movement which led to AAP’s birth and your party forming the government had a larger message and a larger resonance, much beyond Delhi. What will happen to that if you confine yourself to local issues?

Does that mean you want to adopt a non-confrontational approach with the Centre?

How has your relationship with the lieutenant governor evolved?

How will the guarantee card that you launched a few days back work and what if midway progress is very slow and things do not turn out the way they should be. Will the response to criticism also be innovative?

Those who have left you — like Kapil Mishra and Kumar Vishwas — are bitter and indulge in personal attacks on you. They were close to you. How do you react to it?

Law and order is not under you but we have seen since Sheila Dikshit’s time that its implementation always has implications for the Delhi government. What is your assessment of Delhi Police?

What do you have to say about the man who fired at Shaheen Bagh and has turned out to be an AAP worker, according to the police?

Are the pictures fake?

Do you think EC has done enough to check hate speech in the elections?

How have been your meetings with the PM and home minister?

Your manifesto talks about developing the river front. Isn’t that what the Centre will be doing?

During Sheila Dikshit’s tenure, infrastructure got a big push. Do you think your government has done enough for infrastructure?

It is happening because BJP does not have anything to counter the work that has been done in Delhi. It has tried everything but failed to punch holes in our work. It came out with photographs of some of our schools but these turned out to be fake. It came up with some videos of mohalla clinics but these too turned out to be fake. It came up with the water issue but that too didn’t wash with people. They were left with nothing. They gathered all parties — JD(U), RJD and LJP and formed an alliance — but that did not work. Now they have fielded 200 MPs, 70 union ministers, 11 CMs without any results. They have no option left and are trying to polarize on the lines of Hindu-Muslim.It is BJP that’s deriving benefit from Shaheen Bagh. It is contesting the election on the issue of Shaheen Bagh only, nothing else. The road should be opened. Everyone wants that road to be opened. It is obstructing school buses and ambulances and causing a half-an-hour commute to stretch over three hours. Amit Shah is home minister and the most powerful man in this country. Nobody is going to believe that he cannot get a road opened. It can be opened within 10 minutes if he wishes. He does not want to get the road opened because he wants to keep the Shaheen Bagh issue alive. It is very sad that for one election, he has for one-and-a-half months put people to trouble. Shaheen Bagh has been created only and only by BJP for elections.Shaheen Bagh is an issue only because of the blocked road. Otherwise, it’s not a Delhi specific issue but a national one.We are a small Delhi-centric party and have a shortage of faces. Incidentally, this time all are contesting the election and are busy in their respective assembly constituencies. Manish, Sanjay Singh and Gopal Rai, besides me, have done many public meetings. We do not have many leaders of national stature. Our biggest strength is our people and our work. BJP does not have a counter to our work. They cannot explain what they did in the MCD in the past 15 years. People of Delhi gave me the responsibility for schools and we made the schools better. They gave them responsibility for sanitation and they turned Delhi into a garbage dump (kuda ghar). I want to ask BJP what they have done for a clean Delhi. If Shaheen Bagh ceases to exist as an issue today, they won’t know what to say in their election speeches.Gandhiji had said a student who comes out of school or college should have three qualities — he should be a good human being, be capable of earning for his family and should be a hardcore nationalist. We started the happiness curriculum for making them good human beings, entrepreneurship for pet bharne ke liye (earning a meal) and deshbhakti for making them hardcore nationalists.We are not soft nationalists, we are hardcore nationalists. We have come out of the Anna movement. Under the Anna movement, we put the Indian flag in the hands of every child and it became a matter of pride. We are(hardcore patriots).I do not have any role in that, I have my limitations. I am Delhi CM. I am responsible for education, health, power and water. In case the corporation faces a problem tomorrow, I would not poke my nose in that. It is a law and order problem related to CAA and NRC and I do not have any role in that. Amit Shah will have to tackle it.Violence and politics taking over colleges is not a good thing. We all send our children to study and make a career. Such violence causes a sense of insecurity among people about their children. All over the country, people are feeling insecure about where they should send their children and it is not about three or four universities.I blame the central government. We should keep party politics away from university campuses.I think we are more experienced and have got a little more patience now. When we were out of government, we used to wonder like any other common man why hospitals, roads, schools and water supply are in bad condition and do not improve. We used to feel it has been 70 years, and it must be very complex — that’s why they are unable to do it. All parties have tried but nothing happened.But the earth-shaking changes witnessed in Delhi (in the past five years) prove it can be done. They were all(bigwigs) but the intent was missing. Everyone was looking for personal benefits, and if a person is occupied with personal benefits all time, he will not think about the country and progress. We are not here for making money. We are honest and want to work. Barring the administrative problems due to the power tussle with the lieutenant governor and the Centre, things have moved very fast. Education, health, electricity and water sectors have witnessed big changes. It has ignited hope and now we have a vision for the next five years.The administrative structure had made us restless. After a Delhi high court order, all files were being routed to the LG. The HC almost said that the CM is only an adviser to the LG. How can that be in a democracy? All files were sent to the LG and he did not clear them due to political reasons. It caused restlessness because we had a huge mandate and we were unable to do anything. Ultimately, it is our accountability...people will question us. Subsequently, the SC judgment changed the scenario. It gave us more power.BJP in the municipal corporations does not have any intent to clean Delhi. It is not rocket science. The world has many well-known sanitation firms. If you float a global tender, many companies will come up and clean Delhi.We will do it and make the corporations do it. We will contest the civic elections and hope to win. It’s not rocket science. The most difficult part was education. Building construction, toilet cleaning and water supply were relatively easier. Motivating teachers and doctors was difficult. Now government doctors and teachers are being appreciated. This will also be done.There are many ways of doing things. We had a list of work to do with MCD before the civic elections — vacuum cleaning and painting of roads to make them look tidier. For Yamuna cleaning, we are in an advanced stage of addressing the issue of four major drains flowing into that river by cleaning them with STPs. A lot of work will be done before the corporation elections and a lot after that.We will give the corporations funds earmarked for specific projects — like we are giving you these funds for solid waste management only. Otherwise, they end up diverting funds.That is a political position. People have the right to know who the chief minister face will be, whom they are voting for. People elect a CM but BJP does not believe in democracy. If you make an illiterate person CM later, it will be like cheating people of Delhi. BJP should disclose their CM face. I want to debate with him.The silver lining is that pollution has come down, not gone up. In other cities, pollution is going up but we have brought it down by 25%. In 2015, the average AQI was 155 while it was 115 last year. The real problem manifests between October and February due to stubble burning and temperature inversion. Due to frequent power cuts, around 6 lakh generators were operational in 2015 in Delhi. The 24-hour power supply has led to the generators being switched off. Eastern and western peripheral expressways, increase of green cover with 1100 acres of additional land being used for afforestation and other factors have reduced pollution.In next five years we will take several steps, including tackling of dust pollution and greening of open areas. Transport will get a push which we hope will reduce the number of two-wheelers. As of now, no one knows the real sources of pollution because we do not have equipment to measure. Pollution changes every minute and varies from month to month. So, we have tied up with Washington University. From April 1, a lab for real-time source apportionment of pollution will be functional and on-the-spot decisions about tackling particular reasons for pollution can be taken.Smog towers are overrated. We had sent some people to China to study smog towers, but these have not been successful. If they are successful, we will install them.We do not have any understanding with any party. I believe Congress will get confined to 2% to 3% of vote share in this election. Various surveys are showing that they have been reduced to a vote share of 2% to 3%. People do not see any hope in Congress.The reason was that in 2017 we had executed the work order for new buses but someone went to HC and got a stay on purchase. It took us three years to get the stay vacated. It was vacated only six-seven months ago. It caused a delay. But buses have now started coming, and in four to five months I think we will have 4000 more.Delhi is facing an overall issue of traffic indiscipline and it involves all vehicles. It is related to enforcement. Enforcement agencies are not under us. If the enforcement agencies become a little stricter, the situation will improve. Hike in traffic fines has led to some improvement.Delhi government does not have any role in it. We do not have the police or judicial system under us. Our role is confined to forwarding the files received from MHA to prison and the ones received from prison to MHA.Nirbhaya’s parents are simple folk and are being misled.I am saying that for the first time a party has improved schools and hospitals. If you vote for other parties, they will go back to their earlier condition. So, in national interest and in the interest of your own children, vote for AAP.There is no such national ambition. People of Delhi voted for me for Delhi. They will vote for me for Delhi for the next five years. I will be in Delhi for the next five years. The party will decide whether it wants to contest elections at other places.Improving schools is a national issue, not confined to Delhi. All over the country, schools are in a bad condition. Roads and hospitals should be better. Twenty first century India will not be built by Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens. It will be built by better schools, colleges and hospitals and progress in our space programme. In the past five years, the capital has given the country a model of development. This model can build 21st century India.I was never confrontational. Whenever we were seen being confrontational, confrontation was imposed on us. Like LG was sitting over the CCTV camera file which was cleared after our dharna. We needed to get confrontational only to get work for people of Delhi done. After the Supreme Court judgment, we do not need to get confrontational anymore.He is an excellent person. I have high respect for him. We have very good relations. I think the Supreme Court judgement helped.I have given a five-year guarantee. I will be answerable if work is not done in five years.It feels bad but it is part of politics.Delhi Police is good. It can become the most efficient police force of the country provided those controlling it are good. They can control crime if they are given clear instructions and there is no interference.Delhi Police is being used as a political tool. As I told you, BJP has nothing to counter our work with. When nothing worked, they hurled abuses like terrorist, thug and anti-national at me. DelhiPolice is their last resort. Suddenly, before elections they have come up with some photos claiming that he is an AAP member. His family members have denied any links with AAP. The country is watching how Amit Shah is coming up with conspiracies at the last moment. The person must be punished, and if he turns out to be an AAP worker, give him double the punishment.I do not know. We do not know that person.I think they could have done much more. They could have stopped whatever is going on. They did take some steps but after the bans were lifted, they began all over again…lost any fear.After Narendra Modi became PM, I went to call on him. I told him he was the PM of the country and I the CM of the capital city. So, it is extremely important that both governments and both of us have extremely cordial relations. He appreciated that. The home minister has, however, not given me an appointment.It involves multiple agencies. I had advised them to create a special purpose vehicle for it like Delhi Metro. The first task is to clean the Yamuna and after that the river front will be developed. We will give the land we hold for the purpose.All infrastructure development under Sheila Dikshit took place during the Commonwealth Games. An amount of Rs 70,000 crore was pumped into the capital. In 15 years, 65 flyovers were constructed. Our government constructed 27 in five years. All such work fails to get any attention when people talk about our work in the areas of health, education, water and power which have been highlighted more.In Video: We are staunch nationalists: Arvind Kejriwal's exclusive to TOI",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73971138,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-79453,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi/we-are-not-soft-nationalists-we-are-hardcore-nationalists-kejriwal/articleshow/73973515.cms

CHENNAI: Motorists proceeding from Venkatanarayana Road to Anna Salai will once again have to take a circuitous route from Wednesday as the Chennai Traffic Police are bringing back the changes they made during metro rail construction. The move came after complaints poured into the traffic control room about congestion at Nandanam junction. The changes will be on a trial basis for a week.

Between 2012 and 2019, several changes were made on all approach roads to Nandanam junction due to metro rail construction. Vehicles from Venkatanarayana Road in T Nagar had to turn to South Boag Road and Pondy Bazaar before joining Anna Salai or take Burkit Road and Mooparappan Street before joining Anna Salai.

In July 2019, police reverted to the old arrangement, allowing four-way traffic at the junction, that existed before 2012. Almost after seven years, motorists could use the stretch again from all sides. Though Cmrl started metro rail services in May 2018, it handed over the stretch to traffic police to open it for regular traffic a couple of months later. In July 2019, vehicular movement on both sides was allowed from Cenotaph Road and Nandanam signal.

After the old changes were brought in, motorists began complaining of traffic snarls at the Nandanam junction and requested police to bring back the old arrangement. As police too were struggling to regulate traffic particularly during peak hours with the re-stored old traffic pattern, they decided to bring back the changes they made during the construc-tion of Nandanam metro station and tunnels.

AGRA: Four days after a murder convict was shot dead by police during an encounter to rescue 25 children, a man who tried to mediate during the 9-hour long stand-off claimed on Tuesday that the abductor wanted punishment for two policemen who “tortured him” in custody in a theft case and asked “sexual favour” from his wife in lieu of his release.When contacted, senior district police officials rejected the charges, but assured a probe into the allegation and into the role of the two policemen.The accused, Subhash Batham , was shot dead early on Friday while his wife died hours later on the way to hospital after being brutally attacked by locals in Farrukhabad ’s Kathariya village. Batham organised a birthday party for his daughter and then held 25 children who were his “guests” hostage on Thursday.On Tuesday, when TOI contacted Anupam Dubey alias Balloo , who was shot at and injured by Batham while trying to negotiate peace, said, “During my one-hour interaction with Batham, he accused two police constables of Farrukhabad of torturing him in custody. He also alleged that the policemen also asked sexual favours from his wife in lieu of his release in a theft case.”A contractual driver of UP roadways, Dubey was approached by Bhojpur MLA Nagendra Singh to talk to Batham during the stand-off.“Everyone present there heard Batham, but no one did anything. The entire drama was set up to attract administration’s attention in order to punish those two policemen,” said Dubey.When asked why he was shot by Batham, Anupam said, “I don’t think he wanted to shoot me.”Additional superintendent of police, Farrukhabad, Tribhuwan Singh said, “Batham planned this entire hostage situation for many months to extort money. He demanded Rs 1 crore for each child taken hostage. He constructed basement in his house several months ago and also gathered heavy explosive material to target policemen.”“We will look into the harassment allegation and question the policemen whose names have come up,” he added.In Video: Farrukhabad abduction drama: Kidnapper accused 2 cops of seeking sexual favours from his wife, says mediator",agra,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73952076,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-119288,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/farrukhabad-hostage-crisis-mediator-claims-abductor-was-harassed-by-2-cops-wanted-them-punished/articleshow/73943341.cms

Subhendu Mukherjee

and

Alok KN Mishra,

a day before campaigning comes to an end, he offered to open a window for cooperating with the corporations by giving them funds for specific projects, recalled how the Anna movement was all about hardcore patriotism, expressed concern about the violence wracking university campuses, and reiterated his commitment to work for the people of Delhi.

In any election, there is a lot of rhetoric from all sides. But this time personal attacks and communal overtones reached unprecedented levels. You were called a terrorist more than once, even by a Union minister. Where do you think is it coming from?

Do you wish Shaheen Bagh had not happened?

Independent of this, Shaheen Bagh has emerged as a symbol of the anti-CAA movement. What would you like to say about it?

Except for fielding Manish Sisodia and Bhagwant Mann, you carried the burden of the entire campaigning for your party while BJP unleashed a phalanx of senior leaders in the past 15 days. Will this have any effect on the election outcome?

AAP’s manifesto has promised deshbhakti curriculum. What was the need for it?

Political observers feel you are taking a soft nationalist stand.

Is that the reason why you did not go to Shaheen Bagh, Jamia and JNU?

Do you empathize with the students because there is turmoil in all campuses.

So, whom do you blame for this?

How is Arvind Kejriwal of February 2015 and that of February 2020 different? What has five years of being chief minister taught you and how has it changed you?

You spoke about patience. Do you think that the initial one or two years were spent in combat. It could have been utilised in a better way.

You spoke about sanitation. What is the reason behind Delhi being a dirty city? What do you plan to do about it?

How will you tackle this?

Municipal polls are far away. You have promised to focus on sanitation in a major way. But the performance of the municipal corporations, which say that they are starved of funds, does affect the quality of life in Delhi. What is the way out?

Is there a way to address the grievance of corporation on funds?

You have questioned BJP about the lack of a chief minister face. Amit Shah has said that every citizen of Delhi is BJP’s CM candidate.

Pollution is Delhi’s biggest problem and it affects the poor the most. You did odd-even and the pollution level has come down but it is still a major issue.

BJP leaders are promising smog towers for Delhi.

Congress appears to be absent from the election campaign in Delhi. There are rumours that Congress has worked out a tactical alliance with Aam Aadmi Party.

You talked about giving transport a push in the next five years but buses did not come to Delhi in as many numbers as expected.

The modes of para transit like autos, e-rickshaws and grameen sevas are known for breaking traffic laws. Efforts to regulate them trigger an outcry on grounds like they belong to economically backward section.

The issue of hanging of Nirbhaya convicts has turned political when it is actually a legal issue. How did this happen?

But Nirbhaya’s parents are blaming your government.

You have been urging people to vote for AAP irrespective of the parties they belong to. Are you disassociating elections from ideology? And what has been your feedback?

Does that mean scaling down of your national ambitions?

The Anna movement which led to AAP’s birth and your party forming the government had a larger message and a larger resonance, much beyond Delhi. What will happen to that if you confine yourself to local issues?

Does that mean you want to adopt a non-confrontational approach with the Centre?

How has your relationship with the lieutenant governor evolved?

How will the guarantee card that you launched a few days back work and what if midway progress is very slow and things do not turn out the way they should be. Will the response to criticism also be innovative?

Those who have left you — like Kapil Mishra and Kumar Vishwas — are bitter and indulge in personal attacks on you. They were close to you. How do you react to it?

Law and order is not under you but we have seen since Sheila Dikshit’s time that its implementation always has implications for the Delhi government. What is your assessment of Delhi Police?

What do you have to say about the man who fired at Shaheen Bagh and has turned out to be an AAP worker, according to the police?

Are the pictures fake?

Do you think EC has done enough to check hate speech in the elections?

How have been your meetings with the PM and home minister?

Your manifesto talks about developing the river front. Isn’t that what the Centre will be doing?

During Sheila Dikshit’s tenure, infrastructure got a big push. Do you think your government has done enough for infrastructure?

It is happening because BJP does not have anything to counter the work that has been done in Delhi. It has tried everything but failed to punch holes in our work. It came out with photographs of some of our schools but these turned out to be fake. It came up with some videos of mohalla clinics but these too turned out to be fake. It came up with the water issue but that too didn’t wash with people. They were left with nothing. They gathered all parties — JD(U), RJD and LJP and formed an alliance — but that did not work. Now they have fielded 200 MPs, 70 union ministers, 11 CMs without any results. They have no option left and are trying to polarize on the lines of Hindu-Muslim.It is BJP that’s deriving benefit from Shaheen Bagh. It is contesting the election on the issue of Shaheen Bagh only, nothing else. The road should be opened. Everyone wants that road to be opened. It is obstructing school buses and ambulances and causing a half-an-hour commute to stretch over three hours. Amit Shah is home minister and the most powerful man in this country. Nobody is going to believe that he cannot get a road opened. It can be opened within 10 minutes if he wishes. He does not want to get the road opened because he wants to keep the Shaheen Bagh issue alive. It is very sad that for one election, he has for one-and-a-half months put people to trouble. Shaheen Bagh has been created only and only by BJP for elections.Shaheen Bagh is an issue only because of the blocked road. Otherwise, it’s not a Delhi specific issue but a national one.We are a small Delhi-centric party and have a shortage of faces. Incidentally, this time all are contesting the election and are busy in their respective assembly constituencies. Manish, Sanjay Singh and Gopal Rai, besides me, have done many public meetings. We do not have many leaders of national stature. Our biggest strength is our people and our work. BJP does not have a counter to our work. They cannot explain what they did in the MCD in the past 15 years. People of Delhi gave me the responsibility for schools and we made the schools better. They gave them responsibility for sanitation and they turned Delhi into a garbage dump (kuda ghar). I want to ask BJP what they have done for a clean Delhi. If Shaheen Bagh ceases to exist as an issue today, they won’t know what to say in their election speeches.Gandhiji had said a student who comes out of school or college should have three qualities — he should be a good human being, be capable of earning for his family and should be a hardcore nationalist. We started the happiness curriculum for making them good human beings, entrepreneurship for pet bharne ke liye (earning a meal) and deshbhakti for making them hardcore nationalists.We are not soft nationalists, we are hardcore nationalists. We have come out of the Anna movement. Under the Anna movement, we put the Indian flag in the hands of every child and it became a matter of pride. We are(hardcore patriots).I do not have any role in that, I have my limitations. I am Delhi CM. I am responsible for education, health, power and water. In case the corporation faces a problem tomorrow, I would not poke my nose in that. It is a law and order problem related to CAA and NRC and I do not have any role in that. Amit Shah will have to tackle it.Violence and politics taking over colleges is not a good thing. We all send our children to study and make a career. Such violence causes a sense of insecurity among people about their children. All over the country, people are feeling insecure about where they should send their children and it is not about three or four universities.I blame the central government. We should keep party politics away from university campuses.I think we are more experienced and have got a little more patience now. When we were out of government, we used to wonder like any other common man why hospitals, roads, schools and water supply are in bad condition and do not improve. We used to feel it has been 70 years, and it must be very complex — that’s why they are unable to do it. All parties have tried but nothing happened.But the earth-shaking changes witnessed in Delhi (in the past five years) prove it can be done. They were all(bigwigs) but the intent was missing. Everyone was looking for personal benefits, and if a person is occupied with personal benefits all time, he will not think about the country and progress. We are not here for making money. We are honest and want to work. Barring the administrative problems due to the power tussle with the lieutenant governor and the Centre, things have moved very fast. Education, health, electricity and water sectors have witnessed big changes. It has ignited hope and now we have a vision for the next five years.The administrative structure had made us restless. After a Delhi high court order, all files were being routed to the LG. The HC almost said that the CM is only an adviser to the LG. How can that be in a democracy? All files were sent to the LG and he did not clear them due to political reasons. It caused restlessness because we had a huge mandate and we were unable to do anything. Ultimately, it is our accountability...people will question us. Subsequently, the SC judgment changed the scenario. It gave us more power.BJP in the municipal corporations does not have any intent to clean Delhi. It is not rocket science. The world has many well-known sanitation firms. If you float a global tender, many companies will come up and clean Delhi.We will do it and make the corporations do it. We will contest the civic elections and hope to win. It’s not rocket science. The most difficult part was education. Building construction, toilet cleaning and water supply were relatively easier. Motivating teachers and doctors was difficult. Now government doctors and teachers are being appreciated. This will also be done.There are many ways of doing things. We had a list of work to do with MCD before the civic elections — vacuum cleaning and painting of roads to make them look tidier. For Yamuna cleaning, we are in an advanced stage of addressing the issue of four major drains flowing into that river by cleaning them with STPs. A lot of work will be done before the corporation elections and a lot after that.We will give the corporations funds earmarked for specific projects — like we are giving you these funds for solid waste management only. Otherwise, they end up diverting funds.That is a political position. People have the right to know who the chief minister face will be, whom they are voting for. People elect a CM but BJP does not believe in democracy. If you make an illiterate person CM later, it will be like cheating people of Delhi. BJP should disclose their CM face. I want to debate with him.The silver lining is that pollution has come down, not gone up. In other cities, pollution is going up but we have brought it down by 25%. In 2015, the average AQI was 155 while it was 115 last year. The real problem manifests between October and February due to stubble burning and temperature inversion. Due to frequent power cuts, around 6 lakh generators were operational in 2015 in Delhi. The 24-hour power supply has led to the generators being switched off. Eastern and western peripheral expressways, increase of green cover with 1100 acres of additional land being used for afforestation and other factors have reduced pollution.In next five years we will take several steps, including tackling of dust pollution and greening of open areas. Transport will get a push which we hope will reduce the number of two-wheelers. As of now, no one knows the real sources of pollution because we do not have equipment to measure. Pollution changes every minute and varies from month to month. So, we have tied up with Washington University. From April 1, a lab for real-time source apportionment of pollution will be functional and on-the-spot decisions about tackling particular reasons for pollution can be taken.Smog towers are overrated. We had sent some people to China to study smog towers, but these have not been successful. If they are successful, we will install them.We do not have any understanding with any party. I believe Congress will get confined to 2% to 3% of vote share in this election. Various surveys are showing that they have been reduced to a vote share of 2% to 3%. People do not see any hope in Congress.The reason was that in 2017 we had executed the work order for new buses but someone went to HC and got a stay on purchase. It took us three years to get the stay vacated. It was vacated only six-seven months ago. It caused a delay. But buses have now started coming, and in four to five months I think we will have 4000 more.Delhi is facing an overall issue of traffic indiscipline and it involves all vehicles. It is related to enforcement. Enforcement agencies are not under us. If the enforcement agencies become a little stricter, the situation will improve. Hike in traffic fines has led to some improvement.Delhi government does not have any role in it. We do not have the police or judicial system under us. Our role is confined to forwarding the files received from MHA to prison and the ones received from prison to MHA.Nirbhaya’s parents are simple folk and are being misled.I am saying that for the first time a party has improved schools and hospitals. If you vote for other parties, they will go back to their earlier condition. So, in national interest and in the interest of your own children, vote for AAP.There is no such national ambition. People of Delhi voted for me for Delhi. They will vote for me for Delhi for the next five years. I will be in Delhi for the next five years. The party will decide whether it wants to contest elections at other places.Improving schools is a national issue, not confined to Delhi. All over the country, schools are in a bad condition. Roads and hospitals should be better. Twenty first century India will not be built by Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens. It will be built by better schools, colleges and hospitals and progress in our space programme. In the past five years, the capital has given the country a model of development. This model can build 21st century India.I was never confrontational. Whenever we were seen being confrontational, confrontation was imposed on us. Like LG was sitting over the CCTV camera file which was cleared after our dharna. We needed to get confrontational only to get work for people of Delhi done. After the Supreme Court judgment, we do not need to get confrontational anymore.He is an excellent person. I have high respect for him. We have very good relations. I think the Supreme Court judgement helped.I have given a five-year guarantee. I will be answerable if work is not done in five years.It feels bad but it is part of politics.Delhi Police is good. It can become the most efficient police force of the country provided those controlling it are good. They can control crime if they are given clear instructions and there is no interference.Delhi Police is being used as a political tool. As I told you, BJP has nothing to counter our work with. When nothing worked, they hurled abuses like terrorist, thug and anti-national at me. DelhiPolice is their last resort. Suddenly, before elections they have come up with some photos claiming that he is an AAP member. His family members have denied any links with AAP. The country is watching how Amit Shah is coming up with conspiracies at the last moment. The person must be punished, and if he turns out to be an AAP worker, give him double the punishment.I do not know. We do not know that person.I think they could have done much more. They could have stopped whatever is going on. They did take some steps but after the bans were lifted, they began all over again…lost any fear.After Narendra Modi became PM, I went to call on him. I told him he was the PM of the country and I the CM of the capital city. So, it is extremely important that both governments and both of us have extremely cordial relations. He appreciated that. The home minister has, however, not given me an appointment.It involves multiple agencies. I had advised them to create a special purpose vehicle for it like Delhi Metro. The first task is to clean the Yamuna and after that the river front will be developed. We will give the land we hold for the purpose.All infrastructure development under Sheila Dikshit took place during the Commonwealth Games. An amount of Rs 70,000 crore was pumped into the capital. In 15 years, 65 flyovers were constructed. Our government constructed 27 in five years. All such work fails to get any attention when people talk about our work in the areas of health, education, water and power which have been highlighted more.In Video: We are staunch nationalists: Arvind Kejriwal's exclusive to TOI",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73971138,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-79453,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/we-are-not-soft-nationalists-we-are-hardcore-nationalists-kejriwal/articleshow/73971141.cms
144,['5/02/2020'],Medaram Jatara: One crore devotees are expected for the biennial jatara at Medara,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Devotees from several states will gather for the four-day festival.

MEDARAM: Some one crore devotees are expected for the biennial jatara at Medara, which will commence on Wednesday. The four-day Sammakka-Saralamma jatara , also dubbed as Telangana’s Kumbh Mela , is Asia’s biggest tribal fair.

Millions of devotees from Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Telangana have set up temporary tents in two kilometre radius of the tiny village of Medaram.

On Tuesday, tribal priests performed rituals for Pagididdaraju, the husband of Sammakka deity, at Punugondla village in Gangaram mandal of Mahabubad district . Priests trooped in from areas about 40km on foot.

On Wednesday evening, Kaka Saraiah, the hereditary priest will perform rituals for Saralamma at Kannepally village. Devotees offer jaggery to the deity during the ritual. The ritual is accompanied by traditional Koya dance.

Authorities have set up a 2km-long bathing ghat with a battery of taps. Some 8,900 temporary toilets have also been set up to ensure there is no open defecation during the festival. A temporary bus terminus has also been set up at Medaram, and the RTC is operating 4,200 buses from Telangana state. One of the highlights of the jatara will be plastic free celebrations.

The TSTDC has launched chopper service from Hyderabad to Medaram at cost of Rs 30 thousand for each passengers. For local pilgrims, a helicopter ride for sightseeing will be provided for Rs 3,000.

Meanwhile, governor Tamilsai Soundararajan and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao are expected to visit the congregation on February 7. The Sammakka-Saralamma Tadwai mandal comes into Mulugu district, where authorities have announced a three-day holiday.

The South Central Railway will be operating 20 special trains during the festival. Most trains will run between Sirpur-Kagaznagar to Warangal and Secundrabad to Warangal.

Representative image

CHENNAI: The CB-CID on Tuesday arrested police constable K Sithandi, one of the key accused in the 2017 Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) Group II-A examination scam, and four others who with his help secured top ranks and are now working in various government departments.

Police had already frozen the bank accounts of Sithandi, a 2008-batch head constable attached to Armed Reserve wing in Pudupet, and his wife. He had worked with a former chairman of TNPSC.

Police said Sithandi, believed to be involved in manipulating answer sheets in the 2017 Group II-A exam and 2019 Group IV exam, was arrested by a special CB-CID team from a relative’s farm in Sivaganga. Sithandi, who had got himself admitted to a hospital for treatment before going underground, will be interrogated in Chennai on Wednesday.

Sithandi and Chennai resident S Jayakumar, another of those involved in both scams, were found to have been hand in glove with a few agents and some government officials and helped several candidates crack the TNPSC exams and bag government jobs. They collected lakhs of rupees as commission.

Using his contacts, Sithandi helped four of his family members including his wife S Shanmugapriya and brother K Velmurugan clear the Group II-A and Group IV examinations. Police have arrested Velmurugan, an assistant in the Sivaganga District Registrar’s office in Karaikudi, while Shanmugapriya is absconding.

On Monday, the CB-CID also arrested MJ Deepak of Chennai, an employee of the finance department at the state secretariat, N Vinod Kumar, a commercial tax department employee in Vellore , Arun Balaji, a commercial tax department employee in Arcot , and S Devi, who works in the commercial tax department in Nagercoil . The first two paid Rs 8 lakh and Rs 9 lakh to jayakumar, while the other two paid Rs 13 lakh, a press release from the CB-CID said. The CB-CID had announced a reward for any person sharing information leading to the arrest of Jayakumar and circulated his photographs to the authorities at airports, major railway stations and other vital installations.

The TNPSC had banned 99 candidates for life after it was found that they, with help from agents and some government officials, manipulated the answer sheets in the September 1, 2019 Group IV exam using special pens with evaporating ink to shade the answers during exam. After the exam, middlemen and some TNPSC staff reshaded the answer scripts of 52 candidates and reinserted them in the answer sheet bundle on a moving vehicles. Of the 52 candidates, all of who appeared for the exam at the Rameswaram and Keelakarai centres in Ramanathapuram district , 39 ranked within the top 100.

Later, after several candidates alleged that similar malpractices were committed in the 2017 Group II-A exam, an investigation found that 42 candidates, who appeared for the exam at the Rameswaram centre that year, scored high marks by fraudulent means.

147,['5/02/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Preventive actions to ensure safety of women,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Participants at a KravMaga self-defence workshop

CHENNAI: When news of the Hyderabad-based veterinary doctor’s rape and murder broke last year, a deeply disturbed S Sreeram took to social media to write about how the safety of women had to be addressed at various levels. The post served to bring together a group of like-minded people who felt it is necessary to take preventive action to ensure safety of women . The result is PENN, an initiative that will be launched on February 8 to curb crime against women.

“It will work at various levels. At an individual level, it will educate girls and women on preventive aspects, such as online safety, use of technology and self-defence,” says Sreeram, founder and chief instructor of KravMaga TN Chapter, who has been training women in self-defence since 2009.

At the community level, members of PENN will visit localities, apartment complexes, corporates, and commercial establishments to implement safety practices. “At the governance level, we will be working with various departments like transport, electricity, tourism, education and social welfare to ensure safety in public spaces,” says Sreeram.

Work will be done at the law enforcement level to reduce field level apathy, corruption and increase sensitivity to victims. “Our emphasis is to work on a proactive, 360-degree approach to the problem, including addressing the issue at the legal level to enable a speedy, time bound mechanism to deter perpetrator and thus prevent sexual crimes,” says V S Sridhar, corporate executive and managing trustee of PENN, who reached out to Sreeram after reading his post. “After the Nirbhaya incident, I got in touch with him to conduct self-defence classes for the female employees of the corporate I work for. And later, I felt that we need to take a proactive approach and focus on preventing crime rather than reacting and protesting after something happens.”

Other core members of PENN include V Anand, a technocrat who works on various causes for youth development; Sriram Sharma, director, and music composer; and Swarnalatha Mahesh, senior advocate with a focus on woman and child safety.

PENN’s initiatives will focus on prevention of crime. “It lays stress on situational awareness, understanding criminal psychology, de-escalation, online best practices and using technology for safety,” says Sreeram. “In my experience this knowledge is easily absorbed by women rather than physically demanding self-defence skills, which are the last resort.”

PENN will be launched by selected women achievers from various fields and also a senior police officer in charge of prevention of crimes against women and children. The launch will also feature the dance ballet ‘Velu Nachiyar’.

“It is the vehicle to bring in more girls to participate. It dramatises the martial valour of the first queen who fought the British and kept them at bay for 20 years in the 18th century,” says Sreeram. “PENN plans to train girls in Israeli KravMaga self-defence as part of the ballet, making it a Trojan horse to teach personal safety.”

He will also groom trainers who can extrapolate the knowledge to all vulnerable sections, especially the urban and rural poor. “I will also work to get the state police involved as I am their close-combat trainer since 2013,” says Sreeram.

Sridhar says they will start by conducting self-defence class in colleges and also for women who are more ‘vulnerable’, working late night shifts. “Sensitising men is also an integral part of the campaign. They will be trained how they can help women in distress instead of being a mute spectator,” he says.

149,['5/02/2020'],Delay in starting approval process by AICTE likely to affect engineering admissions,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Representative image

CHENNAI: More than a two-month delay in starting approval process by All India Council for Technical Education ( AICTE ) for 2020-21 may affect the engineering admissions in the next academic year.

Usually, AICTE would start inviting applications in the first week of December for extension of approval, variation of intake, starting new courses and new technical institutions. But, so far the council did not release the approval process handbook due to a litigation. “Affiliation and approval is a long process that would take four to five months. Due to delay in starting the process, it may go beyond month of May and that it would affect the admission process,” principals of engineering colleges said.

“The technical council would give 45 days to 60 days to apply for approval process. Then it will take another two to three months to scrutinize the applications and give its approval. It would also make visits to new technical institutions and surprise visits to some of existing institutions,” said B Chidambararajan, principal of Valliammai Engineering College said.

“Though Anna University would send inspection teams to colleges before the approval process, they would issue extension of affiliation only after receiving approval letter from AICTE,” he said. After getting approval and affiliation, the colleges need submit the orders to directorate of technical education (DOTE) for starting admission process. So, all the process should be over before May to start engineering counselling in June.

S R R Senthil Kumar, principal of Sona College of Technology in Salem said without approval process handbook the colleges cannot apply for approval or affiliation for a new course.

“The technical council has permitted the universities to offer courses in eight emerging areas including AI, machine learning and data science, internet of things (IoT), cybersecurity. Many institutions wanted to start new BTech in artifiicial intelligence and data science. But, without knowing nomenclature of the course, the colleges will find it difficult to set up lab and hire faculty members,” he said.

When contacted, AICTE officials said the approval process handbook for would be released this week. “The Supreme Court has delivered the judgement. The council is now vetting the regulations,” officials said adding engineering admissions will not be delayed.

152,['5/02/2020'],KSIE likely to bag tenders for plastic shredders’ supply,"This story is from February 5, 2020

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala State Industrial Enterprises Limited ( KSIE ) is set to bag the tender for supply of plastic shredders , baling machines and dust removers to local bodies in the state after qualifying in the technical trial run of machines.

Clean Kerala company (CKC), which is learnt to have completed negotiation with KSIE, is likely to sign an agreement with KSIE this month. CKC was forced to go for new tenders for the supply of plastic shredders after LSG minister A C Moideen directed that supply contract which was earlier bagged by Ram Biologicals cannot be extended.

RTI documents show that Ram Biologicals was paid a total of Rs.11.15 crore between 2017-18 and 2019-20 for the supply of plastic shredding units in the state after the company got its supply contract extended three times. The 29th board meeting of CKC held in September 2019 decided that new tenders may be invited instead of extending Ram Biologicals’ contract. It was also decided that a trial run of machines may be conducted and assessed by a technical committee. Only the financial bids of those firms which complete the trial run successfully may be considered, the board decided.

In October 2019, Ram Biologicals, when asked to do a live demonstration of machinery, sent a communication to Clean Kerala Company saying that the supplier of its machinery is another company and that it shall be considered as demo of Ram Biologicals. The technical committee which assessed various parameters like production rate, vibration levels and noise noted in the report that the shredders supplied by KSIE met most specifications satisfactorily and that the company which supplied machinery for Ram Biologicals did not meet salient requirements.

In 2017, the contract for supply of plastic shredding units was given to Ram Biologicals for a period of six months. However the board gave extensions to the same firm thrice regardless of the higher price it had quoted in the beginning. RTI documents reveal that in the 21st board meeting held on September 9,2017, the principal secretary LSGD opined that the feedback on the performance of the machinery received from local bodies so far was good and he recommended continuing the contract for a further period of six months till the tender validity.

The 25th board meeting held in September 2018 again extended the contract and this time they reasoned that calling for fresh tenders would lead to price enhancement. The contract was renewed even while CKC kept receiving complaints from various local bodies regarding the functionality of machinery.

153,['5/02/2020'],SVNIT employees face salary issue again,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Surat: There could not be worst start to the new year than this. Salaries of teachers and non-teaching staff of Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT) have been delayed and there is little possibility of they getting the payment before lapse of a week. About 200 teachers, 150 administrative staff, 250 daily wage staff and 300 research scholars are desperately waiting for payment for the past five days.

Institute officials said they did not receive grant for salaries from ministry of human resource development (MHRD). The grant is likely to come by February 10. Interestingly, the institute officials had announced in September that SVNIT’s annual grant has been increased to Rs125 crore from Rs80 crore. There are funds with the institute but they are reserved for specific purpose.

A group of employees in a representation to SVNIT director S R Gandhi on Tuesday demanded that their salaries be paid immediately. The staff were assured that their salaries will be paid at the earliest.

“There were problems in the past, but this time the grant is delayed due to some other issues. We are hopeful of receiving the grant soon,” Gandhi said.

After its annual grant was put on hold for two consecutive years from 2016 by the MHRD, the institute faced severe financial crisis and had to delay payment of salaries for a couple months in 2019. The institute, which has been struggling with financial issues since 2015, is showing signs of stability after replacement of a few top officials now. The institute could not submit audited accounts to MHRD for 2016-17 and 2017-18 because of financial irregularities and absence of bank reconciliation document. In the past, accounts without clearance by The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India were submitted and MHRD had even released grant. But with change in the rules, the grant of SVNIT has been put on hold this time.

BMC

MUMBAI: With the outgo towards salaries of its one lakh-odd employees rising to half of its income, the BMC has placed curbs on hiring. It has also decided to boost its investment income by redeploying surplus funds parked in banks into government bonds and debentures.

Implementation of the seventh pay commission has increased the BMC’s wage burden by Rs 1,300 crore.

It has set a target to bring down its establishment cost by up to 44% in 2020-21.

As part of its cost-cutting measures, the corporation will fill vacancies by taking on apprentices for terms ranging from six months to three years. They will be hired for various departments such as gardens, litigation and accounts. The positions will include those of clerks, engineers and architects. The corporation will discontinue their services upon completion of their term and the apprentices will not have any claims on their job.

“The BMC will not replace retiring employees. Instead, we will hire apprentices who will work with the BMC temporarily. The municipal work experience will help them get jobs subsequently,” said Praveen Pardeshi, municipal commissioner. He further said up to 20% of the corporation’s staff requirements can be fulfiled by apprentices. Pointing out that hiring apprentices is a global practice, Pardeshi said Germany, with a population of seven to eight crore, has 20 lakh apprentices while India does not even have 10 lakh.

The decision to freeze recruitment will save Rs 250 crore. Under the amended Maharashtra Apprentices Act, apprentices are entitled to a monthly stipend of Rs 9,000. They are not entitled to benefits such as provident fund, which keeps employee costs down. Pardeshi said the BMC will revisit its decision to freeze hiring after the economy revives and its revenues improve.

To increase revenues, the BMC has revised its capitalized value policy with respect to pending redevelopment projects of civic land, lease renewal policy, regularizing unauthorized constructions, and granting of vacant land tenancies. These measures are expected to increase the BMC’s annual revenue by Rs 500 crore. The BMC's property tax collection till January 31 stood at Rs 2,878 crore—Rs 630 crore lower than last year. This was partly due to its earlier decision to scrap property tax for homes with a carpet area under 500 square feet.

155,['5/02/2020'],"Mango traders predict low crop yield, high prices this season","This story is from February 5, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Mango traders in Visakhapatnam and Tuni wholesale markets have predicted a fall in mango yield this season.

The fall in yield has been attributed to untimely rains in late December and late January, which affected the mango crop during the flowering season. Sources in the horticulture department said the yield this year could be below average.

Assistant director of the horticulture department K Sailaja said, “The rainfall could affect flowering and yield this year.”

The latest spell of rain coincided with Rathasaptami towards the end of January. Farmers in the region, who expected a bumper yield this year due to a strong monsoon, now fear a fall in prices. Heavy rains in 2019 had revived mango orchards in Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram districts, where the fruit is widely cultivated.

“To begin with, there was late flowering this season, partly because of a delayed monsoon, but now these rains have ensured massive flower fall in the orchard area. This will translate into a low yield as the flowering season has come to a close,” said P Latcha Reddy, a wholesale trader in both Tuni and Visakhapatnam markets.

Anji Reddy, another trader from the Gajuwaka market in Visakhapatnam, added, “Last year, the wholesale rates for the A-Grade variety of Banganapalli and Suvarnarekha, the two most popular varieties hovered between 170 and 220 a dozen. Now the rates are likely to shoot up, with crop lease holders likely to demand more from traders.”

As a majority of the lease holders of orchards are not wholesale traders, the price of the fruit is marked up by the time it reaches the consumer. In 2019, retail rates hovered around the 500 mark per dozen in Visakhapatnam city. This year, consumers are likely to pay more.

While mango orchards in Srikakulam district were destroyed by cyclones last season, the crop in Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram districts withered due to a poor monsoon in 2018.

Farmers said the number of mango orchards in Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram districts have come down owing to a dry spell between 2017 and 2019. A fall in temperature also affects flowering of the crop.

PUNE: Traffic signals located at four junctions between Bombay Engineering Group and Centre (Bombay Sappers) and Vishrantwadi will be functional within the next 15 days. Regular commuters have pointed out that traffic signals at the Mental Hospital junction and others along the stretch haven’t been working for over a year.Installed under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) a few years ago, the signals at four junctions along the stretch hadn’t been in working condition due to lack of maintenance. The Pune traffic police, which requested re-starting of the signals, went into a tizzy as the Pune Municipal Corporation denied having any signal poles along the stretch.R Vaishali, a resident of Tingrenagar, said, “The crossing here are dangerous for traffic, especially at night when there are vehicles travelling at high speed along the main road and the service roads. As the signal at Yerwada Jail Road junction has not been working for a while, vehicles turn left and right blindly. I have seen a couple of small accidents happening here.”Officers from the traffic department stated that due to the increasing traffic along Alandi Road, they wanted to start the signals along the stretch. “We wrote to PMC officials requesting them to start the existing signals. The PMC officials wrote back stating that they cannot do so as the civic body does not have any signal poles along the stretch. They said that they will have to first install signal poles at the junctions,” an officer explained.The officer further added that the traffic signals had been functioning until a few years ago. Confusion then prevailed among the traffic department and civic authorities over the matter. A traffic police officer said, “These signal posts are solar powered and do not need electricity supply. This is probably the reason that these signals may not be on PMC records. Also, it is suspected that the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) installed and operated the signals for the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) and later discontinued its use.”Swapnil Pawar, a regular commuter along the stretch, said, “Most traffic signals along this stretch have been non-functional for over a year. The Mental Hospital junction that connects Alandi Road to Commerce Zone and Airport Link Road has been witnessing growing traffic and incessant congestion. Making the signal functional is of utmost importance.”However, PMC clarified that the signals had been installed as a part of JNNURM. “Traffic signals were installed at four junctions but they stopped functioning due to a lack of maintenance. Over the last two months, former Yerwada traffic police inspector Ramesh Sathe got some signals functioning. We have now identified the signals and a tender has been floated to revive the signals. The wiring controllers need to be changed. Work is expected to start in a few days and the signals will be functional around the middle of the month,” said Srinivas Kandul, head of PMCs electrical department.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73952221,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-269974,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/signals-on-alandi-road-to-be-functional-in-less-than-15-days/articleshow/73944512.cms
158,['5/02/2020'],Close shave for 35 as MSRTC bus catches fire; cops clear traffic jam in 35 minutes,"This story is from February 5, 2020

The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation bus catches fire near Chandni Chowk on Monday evening.

PUNE: A semi-luxury Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation bus, plying from Thane to Swargate, caught fire at Bavdhan near Chandni Chowk on Monday evening.

The bus was completely gutted, but none of the 35 passengers on board was injured in the incident, Yamini Joshi, divisional controller, Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), Pune division, said.

The incident, which occurred at 5.15pm during the peak evening hours, triggered a massive traffic jam on the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass. It took 35 minutes for the police to clear traffic from the area.

The smoke from the burning bus could be seen around 5-6km away, an official of the city fire brigade said.

“Some passengers spotted the smoke billowing from the rear side of the vehicle and raised an alarm. The driver showed presence of mind and asked the passengers to alight from the bus quickly,” Kothrud fire station officer Gajanan Patrudkar said.

Residents of the area called the fire brigade. Two fire tenders from Kothrud and Bavdhan fire stations rushed to the spot.

“We reached the spot and extinguished the flames within 15 minutes,” Patrudkar said. “The fire was so intense that the fibre seats, the base, and even the metal body of the bus were completely damaged,” he said.

The bus driver suspected that the fire might have been caused due to short-circuit in cables. “However, as the fire started from the tyre, we think it could have been caused owing to excessive braking or due to faulty brakes. The brake pads might have got overheated because of excessive braking, resulting in the fire,” the officer said.

“The bus, a semi-luxury Hirkani, was on way to Swargate from Thane. There were 35 passengers on board. The driver spotted the fire, which started from the rear side of the bus, and the passengers were evacuated immediately. Though investigations will have to be conducted, the fact that the fire started from the rear end of the vehicle suggests that it didn’t occur due to any electrical problem. It is likely the brake drum of the vehicle got heated due to excessive braking, triggering the fire,” Joshi, divisional controller, MSRTC, Pune division, said.

The Hinjewadi police said the bus caught fire during the peak evening hours, triggering a huge traffic jam. “We did not allow movement of vehicles as the fire brigade officials were busy dousing the fire. Once the flames were doused, vehicles were allowed to ply on two lanes, while another lane on the opposite side was thrown open. It took around 35 minutes to clear the traffic from the spot,” the officer said.

AGRA: Over 40 days after he was booked as prime accused for anti-CAA violence by Firozabad police and sent to jail, 52-year-old Ahmad Nabi , the second stage oral cancer patient, was granted bail by Allahabad high court on January 29. The copy of the order was made available on Tuesday afternoon.

Nabi’s defence counsel Preetam Yadav said, “Ahmad Nabi committed no offence; entire prosecution story is fake. He was neither part of protest march nor was he in any way involved in the march being carried out against CAA-NRC.”

According to the FIR, “Cancer patient Ahmad Nabi and 19-year-old Faraz Khan, nephew of woodshop owner whose shop was vandalised and set on fire by unruly group of men in front of heavy police force, were prime accused of leading violent anti-CAA protesters on December 20.”

Notably, it took local administration 15 days, two reminders from Firozabad district court and multiple reports in the media to admit Ahmad Nabi in S N Medical College, who had suffered multiple fractures in alleged action by police. After surgery, Nabi is still in S N Medical College, Agra under observation.

Speaking with TOI, Nabi’s family expressed happiness on the bail. “Now, we can take him for radiotherapy, which has been pending for more than a month,” said Vakil Nabi , younger brother of Ahmad. Ahmad Nabi owns crockery store in Hajipura area of Rasoolpur police jurisdiction, where violence was reported on December 20 afternoon.

Jaipur: Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi on Tuesday claimed that BJP MLA Biharilal’s suggestion to contribute assembly allowances and TA/DA of MLAs for days when the House remains adjourned to locust-hit farmers was nothing but theatrics. BJP state president Satish Poonia supported the suggestion of his party MLA from Nokha in Bikaner district. Biharilal suggested that the MLAs should contribute the amount to help locust affected farmers instead of using it for their personal benefits. Poonia said, “We do not want allowances when the House is not in session.”

The special session of the Rajasthan assembly was convened for two days on January 24 and 25 and adjourned till February 10 after passing a resolution against the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Since the assembly was only adjourned, the MLAs were eligible for allowances and perks during this period.

In a letter to the chief minister Ashok Gehlot, speaker C P Joshi and opposition leader Gulab Chand Kataria, Biharilal demanded that allowances of the MLAs for days the House remained adjourned should be used to help locust-hit farmers.The MLA said the government was paying only Rs 27,000 to farmers who had two hectares, which is not only insuffcient.

Joshi said the business of the House was finalised unanimously by the Business Advisory Committee(BAC) meeting in which opposition leader Gulab Chand Kataria, his deputy Rajendra Rathore, senior MLA Kalicharan Saraf and Kiran Maheshwari were present. He said, “It is nothing but a drama of the BJP to be in the limelight.”

162,['5/02/2020'],Government to eco-restore 6 flood-hit districts,"This story is from February 5, 2020

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government is set to undertake a massive eco-restoration exercise to rejuvenate large swathes of land severely affected by flood, landslide and soil erosion in six districts.

The project will cover around 22,134 hectares worst affected by flooding, soil erosion and siltation in Idukki , Wayanad , Malappuram, Thrissur , Alappuzha and Kozhikode.

The project will be implemented at an estimated cost of Rs 57.03 crore. Further, around 707 hectares of landslide/landslip/land subsidence-affected areas would be revived through eco-friendly sustainable practices at an estimated cost of Rs 3.91 crore. Department of soil survey and soil conservation along with local self- government department will undertake the project within 2-3 years.

The government has accorded administrative sanction for implementing the project titled ‘eco-restoration of flood/landslide-affected areas in the state through soil and water conservation measures’.

As per the project document, the torrential rains and floods during August 2018 had damaged agricultural lands resulting in loss worth crores of rupees. The state was hit by around 1,000 landslides in Pathanamthitta, Idukki, Kottayam , Thrissur, Kozhikode, Wayanad and Kannur districts damaging large tracts of agricultural fields rendering cultivation impossible. The fertile top soil has been completely washed away from the upper reaches along with the flood water. Most of the rivers were flooded and overflowing with massive silt deposition.

The drainage course which was mostly blocked due to faulty land-use practices resulted in large-scale drainage meandering. The loss of fertile top soil has hit the agriculture sector badly with crop loss and fall in agricultural production, the document notes.

The main objective of the project is to prevent loss of fertile top soil, promoting scientific moisture conservation for facilitating safe disposal of excess water in a systematic manner. Thrust will be given to a watershed model of development of the affected areas. The drainage channels would be cleared to ensure free flow of water. Agro forestry, agrostology, planting of indigenous plant species would be taken up on a massive scale to promote revegetation and also to ensure proper soil binding.

The project document mentions establishment of green cover to reduce the carbon footprint and help in climate change mitigation. The sides of drainage courses would be reinforced with vegetative measures and geo-textiles for preventing drainage meandering. Revival of waterbodies/ponds would be taken up to improve water- holding capacity, preventing instances of flash floods and providing water for irrigation and domestic use.

The services of rural employment guarantee scheme workers would be utilised while executing low cost soil-based activities. The project would be implemented under the guidance of district soil conservation officer/assistant director of soil conservation of the district concerned.

PUNE: The property registration in the vicinity of the seven villages earmarked for acquiring land for the proposed Purandar international airport nosedived by a little over 50% last year compared to 2018 with investors and developers opting for a cautious “wait and watch policy”.A total of 87 documents were registered in the seven villages — Pargaon, Ekhatpur, Munjwadi, Kumbharvalan, Udachiwadi, Vanpuri and Khanavadi — in 2018 and the stamp duty collection was Rs48.65 lakh. In 2019, the number of registrations plunged to just 38 and the stamp duty collection was Rs23.34 lakh.Confirming the trend, sub-registrar of Saswad Rahul Khatpe said, “There has been a 56% dip in registration in 2019 as against 2018 in these seven villages.”Huge projects announced three years ago after Purandar was selected as the site for the new airport have hardly found any takers. The residents interested in the projects then are now waiting for the final take from the new government . A developer said the investors interested in projects about two years ago had recently told him to alert them only after there was some movement on the new airport project front.While the earlier BJP-led state government was pushing forth the project, there was tremendous opposition from the villagers. The new government, according to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar , would take it forward through a “dialogue” with the villagers. He also talked about the connectivity to the facility by extending the Metro lines and the ring road. But the final gazette has not been issued by the government for the past three years.Against this backdrop, the investors are treading the cautious path. “We do not want a Chakan again in Purandar,” said a leading builder, keen to invest near the area but waiting for the final order from the new government.Same was the sentiment of another realtor, who had to withdraw after planning a project in Chakan. “We shall not make the same mistake twice,” he said.When the Purandar airport project was announced, many investors from the city and Mumbai had announced big projects in the area. In 2017, some investors owning land near the proposed airport site had started constructing farmhouses. “But there is hardly any activity now,” said a resident of one of the seven villages.Senior revenue department officials claimed that there was a status quo on measurement of land for the project as the final order was to be issued by the government. “There is no ban on land deals yet. That will fall in place only after the final notification,” said an official.Officials of the Maharashtra Airport Development Company Limited (MADC) remained tight-lipped on the project. A few of them just said budgetary provisions were yet to be made for it.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73959783,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-227336,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/50-dip-in-property-registrations-near-proposed-airport-site/articleshow/73944528.cms
164,['5/02/2020'],Ajit Pawar: Govt to decide on Purandar project site soon,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Pune: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said a decision on the future of the proposed greenfield international airport at Purandar would be taken soon.

Pawar told TOI over the phone, “As far as shifting the site of the proposed airport is concerned, I shall take a decision after reviewing the projects and talking to all the stakeholders. The meeting will happen soon, and I shall take a conscious decision.”

The deputy chief minister’s statement comes against the backdrop of Purandar’s Congress MLA Sanjay Jagtap demanding change in the site of the project, announced by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis in October 2016.

The Pune guardian minister said, “The new airport project site had to be shifted from Chakan and Rajgurunagar to Purandar because of the landowners’ protests there. There have been protests against the project at Purandar, too.”

The deputy chief minister said, “A new airport for Pune is important because flyers face a lot of problems at the existing facility due to flight restrictions and runway closures since it is an Indian Air Force (IAF) base.”

After the recent meeting with the officials of the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA), Pawar had said no decision had been taken to change the site of the project.

Purandar’s Congress MLA Jagtap had then said, “We are a part of the government. The meeting on the Purandar project should happen soon. We have prepared some proposals regarding changing the site in Purandar. We are sure that the state government will accept our request. We are not against the proposed airport in Purandar but just want the present site to be changed as it is affecting seven villages.”

Aviation experts said a new airport for Pune was very essential and the state government needed to expedite the project. While all the approvals are in place, the notification on the actual land acquisition has been pending for almost a year. Officials of the Maharashtra Airport Development Company Limited (MADC) remained tight-lipped on the project. A few of them just said that budgetary provisions were yet to be made for the project.

Osmania University

SECUNDERABAD: The Osmania University (OU) officials lodged a police complaint against Tarnaka corporator Alakunta Saraswathi and her husband on Tuesday for attempting to encroach upon the university land recently.

According to officials, on the pretext of road widening near Manikeshwarnagar, some private individuals attempted to encroach upon university land. The university stalled all such excavation work through its internal security staff. Despite this, the corporator and her husband tried to go ahead with the work, forcing university officials to lodge a complaint.

“The corporator and her husband were trying to clear a vacant land to allegedly take up illegal construction work. We have booked them under section 448 for trespassing, 427 for damage of property and 506 for criminal intimidation of the IPC,” said Rajashekhar Reddy, OU inspector.

University authorities warned that stringent action would be initiated against any person indulging in unauthorized construction/encroachment of university lands and it would not hesitate to proceed legally.

The administration maintained that erecting new structures was “illegal” and would not be tolerated. “Any such structures being constructed would be razed and police cases will be filed against individuals,” stated a press release issued by the university.

167,['5/02/2020'],Quiet burial for capital area hyperloop project?,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Vijayawada: Another project floated by the erstwhile TDP regime — the hyperloop transport system between Vijayawada and Amaravati — appears to have been quietly buried by the YSRC government. “The hyperloop project has not been discussed, not even once, by the government. It is no more a priority. It looks unlikely that the project will be revived,” a senior transport department official told TOI.

The TDP government had signed a high-profile memorandum of understanding with Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT), an American transportation solutions company, in September 2017. As per the MoU, HTT was supposed to build the hyperloop system between Vijayawada and Amaravati in public-private partnership (PPP) mode. The project promised to cut travel time between the two towns to just 5 minutes (from 1 hour), using pressurised capsules that float on a frictionless magnetic cushion within tubes.

“HTT will analyse the surrounding cityscapes to create the best route between the two cities while identifying all pertinent stakeholders in the region. After conducting a six-month feasibility study, HTT will build the first hyperloop in India,” a press release issued by HTT had said at the time. It’s now unclear whether HTT had even started or completed the promised six-month feasibility study for the project’s roll-out.

While HTT is among a clutch of companies offering the technology around the world, the system has not been commissioned anywhere in the world yet.

Representative image

AJMER: Posting a message on social media about an unnamed woman IAS officer stationed in Ajmer has landed Congress leader and advocate Rajesh Tondon in a soup. Three women IAS officers from Ajmer have lodged three separate FIRs against Tondon along with a screenshot of the post. While two FIRs have been lodged in Civil Lines police station, one was filed in Kotwali police station. The FIRs stated that there are 51 women IAS officers posted in Rajasthan out of which five are in Ajmer.

The FIRs have been registered under IPC Sections 292, 293, 354, 501 209, Section 7 of Corruption Act and Section 67 of IT Act. Tandon, a former public prosecutor, had posted about an alleged obscene video clip involving a woman IAS officer of Ajmer on various social media groups and warned people to be cautious.

The post, which started doing rounds on social media, made people wonder which IAS officer Tondon was talking about. The IAS officers from Ajmer have stated that such posts were putting undue pressure on honest women officials. “All three FIRs will be investigated separately,” SP Kunwar Rashtradeep said.

The Rajasthan IAS Association and the Rajasthan Administrative Service Association have strongly condemned Tondon’s act and termed it deplorable and cowardly.

“Lady IAS officers have always been front runners and have significantly contributed to the service. The association also demands unequivocally that strictest action must be taken against this act of cowardice and malignity and any such act in future,” the IAS association said. Tandon, on the other hand, claimed that he had not shared any video clip and being an advocate he was only asking people to remain cautious. Earlier, Draupdi Devi, corporator and national president of the Koli community, Congress corporator Lalit Verma and several social groups staged protests against such posts on social media and demanded an investigation and action against such people.

Aerial view of the congested central bus stand in Trichy

TRICHY: The location for the integrated bus terminus will be finalised only after the urban civic body election, the district administration and Trichy Corporation informed on Tuesday.

Collector S Sivarasu in the presence of corporation commissioner S Sivasubramanian said that the decision on the bus terminus cannot be taken in haste. “We need to take the opinion of the civic body’s council. Once the urban local body council is elected, we will conduct stakeholders meeting to hear public opinion to take a call on the location for the bus terminus,” the collector said.

While several locations were proposed since 1994, nothing had materialised. Panchapur, which was identified by the DMK government between 2006-2011, was almost ready for construction for the integrated bus terminus but the proposal was shelved after the government changed in the 2011 assembly election.

Corporation sources said that they have identified a few places which are on the city’s outskirts. However, the recent development is being viewed by residents as a ploy to shift the responsibility in establishing the integrated bus terminus.

It was revived by the AIADMK government in 2017 as the government proposed Kottapattu near Trichy airport as the site for the integrated bus terminus. However, it was also shelved since the location was close to the international airport and not feasible owing to frequent VVIP movement.

Residents have expressed disappointment as uncertainty persists in the conduct of urban local body election across the state. “Even when there was a group of elected councillors, there was no efforts to identify the appropriate location for the terminus. Waiting for the council is an indirect plan to snub the demand,” said Subash Chandran , a resident of Woraiyur .

Jaipur: A roadmap to control locusts would be prepared by the government of India by inviting 30 locust-affected countries to India. Parshottam Khodabhai Rupala, Union minister of state for agriculture and farmers’ welfare informed about this on Monday in the Rajya Sabha, while quoting the United Nation’s report, ‘Praising India and its states including Rajasthan and Gujarat for their efforts to control locusts.’ Kirori Lal Meena, Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan, expressed his concern over the locust attacks and urged for Centre’s intervention into the matter.

TOI spoke to Rupala on the locust attacks. “Meena ji expressed his concern on the locust attacks. I think the locust attack in various countries is been monitored on a world level and it is a big challenge for the farmers in the country especially in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Punjab. United Nations in its report stated that the swarms of locusts in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Punjab could have moved to Bangladesh if proper measures were not taken by the state governments in Rajasthan and Gujarat and also by the government of India.”

“UN has appreciated India, Rajasthan and Gujarat in its report. Now, we are planning to invite countries (nearly 30) to India including African countries, Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and others to discuss a roadmap for locust control. We are in touch with these countries and will ensure mutual coordination and expect mutual cooperation to ensure that we can avoid and fight locust attacks properly,” Rupala said.

Rajasthan revenue minister Harish Chaudhary on Monday written a letter to PM seeking to declare the cases of locust attack as a “national calamity”.

SECUNDERABAD: It is not stay orders from the court but delay in acquisition of properties, shifting of electrical lines and water pipelines that has affected the completion of East Anandbagh road under bridge (RUB), which was expected to be ready by 2015. This has come to light in the response to an RTI query filed by a resident of Malkajgiri .The reply categorically states that no stay has been granted by the court on construction of the RUB at East Anandbagh, which has been pending for the last six years, and adds that all cases pertaining to RUB have been disposed.The revelation has left residents fuming. They rue how the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has been dissuading them by attributing the delay to pending court cases. “When no stay has been granted by the court and all the cases have been disposed, why is the GHMC delaying completion of the RUB? We have been waiting for the RUB for close to six years and GHMC continues to delay it further,” said B Nagaraj, a resident of Malkajgiri who filed the RTI application with the GHMC and the roads and buildings (R&B) departments.The RUB project at East Anandbagh had commenced on May 30, 2014 and was taken up at a cost of Rs 27 crore. Over the last few years, Malkajgiri residents held protests and submitted multiple representations seeking completion of the RUB, but to no avail.“The leaders have a standard excuse, every time we ask about the status — lack of funds and unending litigation on land acquisition . These arguments only show lack of political will to tackle problems head on,” said PKR Krishnan, a resident of Malkajgiri. “Why did they start the work and close the gate and main road to the public without acquiring the land first? This shows absolute lack of sensitivity to woes commuters,” he added.The GHMC officials stated that the land acquisition has now been completed and that the RUB will be opened for public use this year. “We were facing issues in acquiring four properties near the RUB. However, recently we have acquired them and handed them over to the R&B department. There were also financial constraints due to which the work could not be taken up,” said T Dasharath, deputy commissioner in GHMC, Malkajgiri.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73956860,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-352017,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/land-acquisition-not-court-stay-stalled-anandbagh-rub/articleshow/73943465.cms
174,['5/02/2020'],"Maharashtra: Ahead of summer, Khadakwasla starts second water release for crops","This story is from February 5, 2020

PUNE: The state irrigation department has initiated second rotation of water release for crops ahead of the summer season.

Water will flow to farms in parts of Daund , Indapur, Shirur and Haveli .

The release, which commenced since the last three days, will continue for at least a month. About 2TMC water is expected to be discharged from four dams , which currently hold 21TMC (74%) water stock.

“The release was initiated after demands from the rural areas,” officials in the state irrigation department said.

The irrigation department had initiated earlier water discharge in December which ended last month after release of 2.17TMC water for crops. The water release, expected to continue till February, was stopped before the schedule time. While suspending the discharge ahead of the schedule the irrigation department said that it had decided to go ahead with the “demand-supply” approach wherein water from dams would flow out based on the demand instead of release on continuous basis.

A senior official from the department said that the water has again started flowing into the canal from dams since a sizeable number of fresh demands for water release were received in the last few weeks. Official added that the ongoing release was expected to continue till the second week of March.

“We had planned a collective release of 4TMC water for winter crops. The department will, most likely, stick to the quantum and no additional release is likely during the ongoing rotation,” the official added.

The water rotations for winter crops have been delayed this year by almost two months because of the extended monsoon. The first water release rotation started around mid-December, instead of mid-October. The second rotation, which commenced three days back, started ahead of summer.

Meanwhile, the irrigation department has clarified that the ongoing release of water for crops will not affect the city’s water quota. The city has been lifting 1350MLD water from dams. Irrigation department sources said that water stock in four dams were at a comfortable position this time as against last year when collective storage depleted to 14TMC in the first week of February. Currently, dams have almost 7TMC more water stock compared to last year.

Surat: Regional Transport Office (RTO) will go to the doorsteps of people for fitting their old vehicles with high security number plates (HSRPs) in the Diamond City.

About 15 HSRP fitment camps will be held in different parts of the city from February 4 to cover maximum number of old vehicles moving without HSRPs. The camps will be held in Pal, Varachha, Mota Varachha, Katargam, Mora Bhagal, Mota Varachha and Kapodara.

Official sources said there is a backlog of more than four lakh vehicles in the city plying without HSRPs. The last deadline for fitment of HSRPs in the state expired in November 2019.

DK Chavda, regional transport officer, said, “We will be holding 15 camps in different parts of the city in February. We are going to the doorsteps of people to see that their old vehicles are fitted with HSRPs. We have been organizing HSRP camps every month since October 2019. Every month, we have been covering at least 15,000 old vehicles. This is first time that 15 camps will be held in a single month, where we plan to cover more than 30,000 vehicles.”

According to Chavda, on an average 1,000 vehicle owners are fined in the city in a month for driving their vehicles without HSRPs. RTO and police jointly collect fine amounting to more than Rs5 lakh per month.

RTO has asked residential societies, schools and colleges to avail of the benefit of doorstep service.

PUNE: The Thematic Pune Darshan, a special bus service plan of the civic body to boost tourism in the city, has failed to roll out though four years have passed since its approval.

The Pune Municipal Corporation ( PMC ), in association with the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mandal Limited (PMPML), had planned to introduce special theme-based tours in the city in 2015. These tours included guided travel to Information Technology (IT) park, heritage buildings and gardens. The PMPML was supposed to buy 10 new air-conditioned (AC) buses for the purpose.

“The purpose of the Thematic Pune Darshan was to take the tourists to destinations bearing significance of the city’s history and identity. The project has failed to move forward as expected. The civic body should make sure that such tours are organized soon,” former mayor Prashant Jagtap said. He was also a member of the PMPML board that had approved the proposal in 2015.

PMPML traffic department head Anant Waghmare admitted to the delay in the implementation of the project.

“The thematic tour project is yet to take off. We have, however, started a tour for the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation areas on the lines of the Pune Darshan bus services. We are yet to see much response to the service,” he said.

At present, the PMPML runs AC and non-AC bus services as part of its Pune Darshan service for carrying visitors to several tourist sites. A joint venture by the PMC and PMPML, the service was availed of by around 11,400 tourists in 2019, an official in the transport utility said. The official added that the civic administration generated around Rs4.5 lakh per month through this service.

The municipal budget for 2020-21 had stated to spend funds on repairs and restoration of heritage structures in the city. Along with the conservation, the aim was to promote tourism.

Surat: Eminent tax consultant Mukesh Patel has said that the Finance Minister’s move to provide relief under income tax has confounded the economic analysts.

Speaking at the budget analysis and impact on the economy organised by SGCCI and Gujarat Income Tax Bar Association on Tuesday, Patel said, “The FM has tried to reduce the slab with riders. But ultimately the individual tax payers are not seeing any relief from it. They would rather chose to be with the old tax slabs than going for the new ones.” He further said that the I-T benefits seemed more like illusions. “When people finally worked it out, they found the sops more like a mirage,” he said.

According to Patel, the abolition of DDT has created a lot of confusion. For the high networth individuals (HNIs), DDT is going to increase their tax burden, especially for those earning above Rs 50 lakh. It will also impact individual tax payers, he said. Patel lauded the efforts of the central government for implementing the e-assessment and faceless scrutiny.

“These are the best possible ways to eradicate corrupt practices going on in the department,” he asserted.

The trek route to Pratapgad fort lacks toilet facilities for the tourists. (File photo)

PUNE: Heritage sites across the state, including those in Lonavla and Mahabaleshwar, lack toilet facilities. Tourists have taken to the social media to talk about it and the poor hygiene where they are available.

A tourist, who recently visited Bhaja caves near Lonavla, was told there are no toilet facilities for the ASI staff or the tourists and they would have to go out in the open.

A post on a social media website said, “How do you expect tourists who want to visit the site trek for 5km and not be provided with these basic facilities?’’

“One cannot ignore them or their upkeep when the state is pushing for heritage tourism ,’’ an avid traveller said.

The trek to Pratapgad fort, located 24km from Mahabaleshwar, takes less than a hour, but there are no facilities for tourists along the route.

“The state government has not given any importance to basic needs while promoting tourism,’’ a local villager said. Social media handles have many complaints about other sites too.

Tourism minister Aditya Thackeray must look into these issues, another tweet says. An official from the state tourism department said they will take up the complaints in their forthcoming meeting.

The previous BJP government had declared the entire state open defecation free in both rural and urban areas. But tourists said most heritage sites promoted for tourism are deprived of the mandatory public toilet facility.

The state department has put the onus on the Archaeological Survey of India while those officials said the state government’s tourism and rural departments should have provided toilets. Local villagers at most heritage sites collect a small amount but do not provide proper facilities.

Last year, the government had approved a heritage tourism policy wherein historical forts not in the Archaeological Survey of India’s protected list will be promoted to boost the local economy.

“There are about 350 forts blessed with a beautiful landscape and have a history and tradition and can be used for tourism. We will ensure that toilet facilities are provided here,” a tourism department official told TOI.

In 2019-20, the state received a budget of Rs 188 crore to develop the infrastructure and add new tourist amenities.

An MSRTC bus

MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Tuesday directed the secretary, Transport Department, to take up the issue of recovering a huge amount of money owed by various departments of the state government to the beleaguered Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC).

The court heard a PIL by advocate Datta Mane, which said that MSRTC was suffering losses and one reason for that was concessions to around 25 categories such as disabled, freedom fighters, senior citizens, students, without reimbursement to it. Eight departments of the government are respondents from whom a substantial amount is due. In 2015 the amount due was Rs 3,000 crore.

A bench of Justices Satyaranjan Dharmadhikari and Riyaz Chagla noted that the “benevolent and welfare schemes” of MRSTC have resulted in it suffering losses year after year. Further, that it does not have adequate funds to upgrade and improve the services and compete with private bus operators who are plying on their routes.

The judges directed the transport secretary to “take up this issue with the other functionaries of the government and resolve it as expeditiously as possible.”

“Let all secretaries in the concerned departments cooperate with the department of transport in resolving the issue amicably,” the judges said in their order. They added that, “in the event a resolution is not possible or not attempted, this court will take a serious view and call upon the functionaries to explain as to why MSRTC is not allowed to function independently.”

The judges sought an action taken report on February 28. They told government pleader Priyabhushan Kakade to take instructions from the secretary and MSRTC general manager, and in case of non-cooperation from the departments, to take the matter up with the chief secretary .

Amaravati: As part of its ongoing move to revamp public healthcare system in the state, the government has decided to upgrade all district hospitals into teaching hospitals to take the healthcare infrastructure closer to the people.

The government also plans to set up seven medical colleges, eight super-specialty hospitals, seven nursing colleges and one cancer care hospital in different regions of the state. For better management of medical colleges and nursing institutions, two more health universities would be created in addition to the existing NTR health university.

Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy, who reviewed various health infrastructure projects proposed under the Naadu-Nedu programme with senior officials on Tuesday, said the failure of the previous government to improve the condition of government hospitals crippled healthcare system in the state. “It’s high time we take healthcare facilities in the state to the next level by revamping everything from primary health centres (PHCs) to district hospitals to medical colleges,” the CM said.

He also asked officials to ensure that all Lok Sabha constituencies in the state get at least one teaching hospital each.

“All teaching hospitals should focus on becoming self-reliant to provide the best of healthcare services to the poor. The poor should be able to access proper medical care close to their villages and towns. Sub-centres should be set up and affiliated to the teaching hospitals, which would work as referral centres,” the chief minister added, while urging officials to come up with innovative ideas to revamp the “age-old public healthcare system” in the state.

“Setting up of more medical colleges and super-specialty hospitals will also help us overcome the shortage of specialists in medical care. Ready the proposal to set up three health universities in three regions to manage the medical colleges better,” he said. Health department officials informed the CM that around nine district hospitals, where the existing infrastructure is good enough, would be upgraded into teaching hospitals in the coming months.

Jagan also directed officials to focus on getting more super-specialisation seats in medical colleges in the state. “Segregate the state into five zones to get more super-specialisation seats. Medical colleges should be segregated into these five zones — north-coastal, Godavari districts, Guntur-Krishna, Prakasam-Nellore-Chittoor and Rayalaseema districts — to get additional super-specialisation seats,” he said, and told officials to fill up all existing vacancies in medical and health department by May.

Trichy: District collector S Sivarasu along with the senior officials from Trichy City Corporation on Tuesday reviewed the progress of the Chathiram bus stand redevelopment work. The bus shelter and a commercial complex were completely dismantled for the work at an estimated cost of Rs 17.34 crore using the Smart Cities Mission fund.

Classified as category D bus stand, 225 city buses including 135 private fleets had been using the bus stand. As the existing bus shelter was inadequate to manage the increasing number of passengers, the corporation proposed to redevelop the terminus in September 2018 and the bus shelter was closed in November 2019 for the work. “Almost 90% of the pile foundation work is done, and the basement will be completed before April 2020,” the district collector said. Out of the total 248 pile foundations, work for installing 218 piles is completed.

The corporation said that the remaining work will be completed before February 2021. “The basement area will be completely utilised for two-wheeler parking,” S Amuthavalli, city engineer, said. Pedestrian pathway, passenger waiting hall and food court are the amenities to be set up at the terminus. After the redevelopment, the bus stand can accommodate at least 30 buses at a time; earlier it was 20. Only the city and suburban buses will be permitted to operate from the bus stand. The mofussil buses to Thuraiyur, Perambalur and Ariyalur will continue to operate from outside the Chathiram bus stand.

189,['5/02/2020'],Nagpur University faces NAAC inspection with over 50% vacant teacher posts,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Representative image

NAGPUR: Even as Nagpur University faces National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) inspection in a couple of months, majority of its departments are struggling with massive shortage of faculty.

As per schedule, the NAAC visit was slated in December last year but NU had requested the council to defer it as it had failed to submit the status report. The NAAC had awarded A grade to the NU in 2014.

Reply to an RTI query by activist Abhay Kolarkar brought to fore that staggering 50% regular posts are vacant in 34 NU departments and same is the condition in its conducted colleges.

NU has appointed over 100 contributory teachers on a monthly pay of Rs25,000 in various departments. It has started this practice in the last couple of years following retirement of a large number of faculty and ban on recruitment by the state. Condition in majority of its over 500 affiliated colleges is even worse. Thankfully, NU enforced strict measures that led to closure of over 250 colleges which were operating without a single regular teacher and infrastructure in last 3 to 4 years.

NU officials admitted that efforts of its administration were insufficient for getting a good grade, as it is mandatory to have full-time teachers in departments and affiliated colleges. Even posts of registrar and pro-vice-chancellor haven’t been filled though incumbent Puran Meshram retired in 2018 and Pramod Yeole took up the charge of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University in Aurangabad over a year ago.

Ahead of assembly polls in October last year, BJP government had lifted ban on recruitment and allowed all universities to fill up teaching posts. NU was granted sanction to fill up 93 posts. However, it turned out to be a mere poll gimmick as the state failed to clear roster for reservation in the posts, dispatched by the varsity.

A couple of years back, even the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had passed strictures on NU for meagre staff and not filling up several vacant posts. The situation is likely to worsen in coming days as employees are retiring every month, officials said. According to them, last recruitment took place in 2013, during the tenure of then VC Vilas Sapkal, when 72 posts were filled.

Among the sufferers is Laxminarayan Institute of Technology (LIT), which couldn’t apply for autonomy due to severe shortage of teaching and non-teaching staff.

190,['5/02/2020'],"Lioness attacks, feeds on boy near Pipavav","This story is from February 5, 2020

Rajkot: Early on Tuesday morning , five-year-old Kishore Devipujak suddenly woke up hearing some growling sound. His groggy eyes sparkled seeing two cute lion cubs in the farm in Uchhaiya, a coastal village of Amreli district. He started fondling and playing with the cubs, completely unaware that their mother was around.

Before the little boy could realize anything, the lioness pounced and savagely attacked him. So furious was the lioness that she even ate some of this body parts.

The incident happened sometime between 4am and 5am, 3km from Port Pipavav, a private port run by APM Terminal and 12 km away from Rajula town.

Kishore was sleeping in the open outside his hut in the farm, which is located along side a railway track that leads to the port. His parents work as farm labourers.

Forest officials, however, said that the lioness might have mistaken the boy to be some prey as she had killed a goat at the same place in the recent past.

“The lioness caught the boy by his neck and ran for nearly three km in a grassland opposite the port. His family members and others even chased her. The lioness was familiar with these people as she moved around in the same area,” Sandeep Kumar, deputy conservator of forest, Shetrunji division, told TOI.

“The lioness was very angry. The forest department team has found her location in a near-by grassland and a trap has been set to capture her,” Kumar said.

According to forest officials, the boy’s head and parts of legs were eaten by the lioness. Villagers said some lions were also seen moving around in this area in the morning.

Congress MLA from Rajula, Amrish Der, has demanded creating a new sanctuary for lions in this area. Talking to media after the incident, Der said, “The number of lions in this coastal area is increasing. A sanctuary will help avoid such incidents of man-animal conflict besides providing protection to lions.”

The expanding lion population outside the protected areas and close to human habitats is fast becoming a cause of concern.

On December 23 last year, a farm labourer from Madhya Pradesh, Kadu Bhilad, was dragged and killed by a lion in Jira village of Dhari taluka in Amreli. Bhilad had gone to answer nature’s call and the lion mistook him for a prey as he was covered in blanket.

In December 2018, a lion had ripped off a fisherman named Rama Chudasama on the sea coast near Mahuva.

192,['5/02/2020'],Green zones with regulations may not figure in master plan 2040,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Photo for representative purpose only

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The proposed master plan for 2040 is likely to do away with green zones/strips and may only suggest areas that require conservation although majority of the areas marked as green strips in sanctioned master plan (SMP) were flooded in 2018.

The draft master plan 2031 had pitched planned development and green zones under proposed land use, which was one of the major reasons for protests. The identification of areas that require conservation to prevent flooding and retain natural flora is going to be the major challenge for town planners, given the stress on land development irrespective of need for zoning regulations.

While being forced to forsake the critical aspect of green zones in master plan for 2040, the town planning wing will have to disregard the findings of the report prepared following the flood in 2018 in the district.

As part of the flood report, spatial assessment was done to analyse how far the factors such as proximity to water body, existing drainage pattern and topography influenced the impact of flood throughout the district. Also the sink area percentage and the land use distribution were taken into account to arrive at inferences on the reason and intensity of the flood.

In the flood report, sink areas which are topographically low-lying areas were derived from digital elevation model (DEM) data available for the district. The flooded area in the sink area emphasised the need for building regulations for conservation of such areas, the report noted.

Distribution of sink areas to the total land area in each flooded local body was also marked as part of the report. In city corporation 24% sink area of the total land area recorded flooding.

Further, the study showed that a considerable percentage of built up area was flooded during 2018 and this pointed out the need to implement regulations for building constructions in riverside areas.

The land use distribution of flooded area within the city in 2018 shows that 50.82% built up area and 17.9% agricultural land were flooded.

Flooded areas when compared with SMP of the city showed that majority of the flooded areas fell within the green strip area, proposed for conservation, mostly along the water bodies like Karamana River , Killi River, Pattom canal , Ulloor canal and Amayizhanjan canal.

The draft master plan-2031 had mooted green zones; green areas associated with area earmarked for planned development. It was proposed that these green zones can act as drainage basins during rainy season and during summer season people can use it for recreational purposes or as spaces for morning walks. With local protests mounting against the master plan -2031, the state government was forced not to implement the plan.

Surat: The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) arrested a real estate developer from the city on Tuesday on charges of evading GST payments to the tune of Rs 18 crore.

According to the DGGI, the officials had conducted searches at various locations in the city owned by Raj Mahal developers, a partnership realty firm engaged in the construction business in the city, in November 2019. The DGGI sleuths had received intelligence that the firm was indulging in large scale evasion of GST payments.

The officials had recovered many incriminating documents including dairies relating to their investments and the cash received from their clients in the sale of various projects in the city.

Further investigation revealed that the realtors had suppressed the sale value of shops by receiving major portion of sale proceeds in cash on which no GST was paid. Out of the two partners, the active partner Ramesh Kumar Gupta was confronted with the seized documents.

Gupta admitted to receiving Rs 135 crore cash payments on which more than Rs 16 crore of GST was not paid. In addition, he had also not paid GST of more than Rs 2.8 crore since April-2018 on the cheque components of the sale proceeds.

Bijnor: Work on installation of a 50-Kw solar power plant has begun at Vikas Bhavan building here. The building houses at least 20 government departments.

The district's largest solar plant, constructed at a cost of Rs 23 lakh, will be offering excess power to the electricity department.

According to officials, the solar power generation plant will be a boon for environment as it will curb use of diesel generators during powercuts at Vikas Bhavan. Besides, these generators emit smoke and cause air pollution.

SK Singh, project officer of New and Renewable Energy Development Agency (NEDA), said, “We had prepared a proposal last year and sent it to the authorities concerned. The budget was sanctioned two months ago and work on the installation of a 50-Kw solar plant has started.”

Singh added, “The plant will supply power to 20 departments here. However, we need a 75-Kw plant to meet the power demand. A proposal for a separate plant will also be prepared this year.

“In case the solar plant generates excess power, it will be go to the power corporation. Work is going on and it will bear fruit within one month,” the NEDA official said.

Surat: Police arrested owner of a private limited company for cheating a diamond businessman of Rs4.09 crore from his house in the city on Tuesday. The businessman, who has offices in different parts of the world, had duped a city-based diamond businessman by making purchases of diamonds while being in Hong Kong.

Haresh Dholiya, a resident of Mota Varachha, was arrested for allegedly cheating Subhash Monpara, a diamantaire, and produced him before a court which remanded him in police custody for three days. The accused, a diamond businessman, did not make payment for diamond purchases that he made since January 2018. He had been purchasing diamonds from Monpara and others since 2014 but began to default of late on payment. “We received information that Dholiya was in the city and he was arrested. He spends most of his time in Hong Kong,” police said.

“The accused had allegedly duped many other diamond businessmen too in the city and Mumbai of about Rs38 crore. We registered complaint of Monpara as he was able to produce documents of the deals,” said a police officer of Kapodra police station.

Police investigation revealed that the accused used to visit city and Mumbai during exhibitions and selected diamonds for purchase. Later, he used to place orders from Hong Kong and received the supply there.

“When the accused visited the city initially, he purchased diamonds worth Rs36 lakh. He made payment too, but after a few years he began to default,” police said.

He informed police that he used to purchase products at high rate and sold them at lower rates which caused him massive losses.

Bijnor: Citing serious lapses in framing of charges against the accused, Bijnor courts have released 68 of the 155 accused jailed by police of involvement in “violent” protest against CAA (Citizen Amendment Act) on December 20. Meanwhile, three fresh arrests were made on Monday for the December 20 violence.

Punching holes in UP police’s version, the Bijnor judge said prosecution could neither produce any evidence showing who among the hundreds accused of the firing, had “opened fire in Nagina”, nor of the firearms used. The judge also said prosecution couldn’t furnish any record of shops damaged during the clashes.

“Keeping all facts and circumstances in mind, the accused are granted bail,” the court order, a copy of which is with TOI, read.

According to officials, the protests against CAA in the district spiraled and turned violent on December 20 in seven towns — Bijnor, Nahtaur, Najibabad, Jalalabad, Chandpur, Sherkot and Nagina — where protesters allegedly burnt vehicles, hurled stones at cops and damaged public property.

The two towns most affected in the violence were Bijnor and Nahtaur. Two protestors died of gunshot wounds, while a bystander was injured, in addition to injuries suffered by 31 cops across the district.

After the violence, 34 cases were registered, 3,900 unnamed protesters booked under serious sections of IPC, and 155 protesters arrested. Of these, three were jailed on Monday evening.

On being asked about the high number of released protesters, jail superintendent S P Singh said, “Around 155 protestors were lodged in Bijnor jail since December 20, of whom the 68 released on bail are from Nagina, Najibabad, Jalalabad, Nahtaur and Bijnor.”

198,['5/02/2020'],Import duty on coloured gemstone could lead to job losses: GJEPC,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Surat: The Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) has urged union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to roll back the 0.5% import duty on the rough coloured gemstone to protect the domestic industry.

GJEPC has stated that the gemstone jewellery is 100% exported in the foreign countries and that the imposition of duty on rough gemstones may result in job losses in the sector.

The demand for gemstones has increased with changing consumer preference. Apparently, these colours are connected with the Gods of various caste and creeds. Hence, the demand for every type of gemstone emerges during different festivals.

If suppose a middle-class consumers are planning to buy diamond necklace, they could do it with the studding of the coloured gemstones in the ornaments, thereby reducing the cost by almost 30%.

Moreover, all gemstones are available at hardly 10% of the cost of a diamond and this is the reason why the consumers in India and abroad are attracted towards them. With diamond prices steadily becoming unaffordable due to lack of new mines and rapid depletion of existing ones, the gemstone demand has seen a compounded annual growth rate of 20-25% with the overall gemstone-based jewellery market in India pegged at over Rs 5,000 crore.

According to GJEPC data, the import of rough coloured gemstone between April-December decreased 35% at Rs 1,300 crore compared to Rs 2,000 crore during the same period in previous month.

Rajiv Jain, former chairman of Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) and managing director of Sambhav Gems Private Limited at Jaipur, a leading colour gems stone company told TOI, “This is first time that the import duty on rough coloured gemstone has been increased. The gemstone manufacturing is a cottage industry and the hike in the import duty will directly impact over 2 lakh workers.”

According to Jain, the coloured gemstone are imported from Africa, Brazil and South America. Many African countries producing rich gemstones including Tanzania have banned the export of gemstones weighing one gram or more to encourage local benefaction.

Pramod Kumar Agarwal, chairman of GJEPC said, “The import duty on rough coloured gemstones will disrupt the gemstone manufacturing centre in Jaipur. The annual import of coloured gemstone is $300 million and the export is pegged at $500 million. The government is going to earn less than Rs 15 crore in duty per annum.”

BMC has proposed a 5% hike in fees on trade and market vendor licences as well as birth certificates.

MUMBAI: The BMC , which is exploring “innovative” ways to boost its income without increasing the tax burden, has proposed a 5% hike in fees on trade and market vendor licences as well as birth certificates.

This would translate into an additional revenue of around Rs 120 crore. BMC has also proposed to extend the licence period to 10 years and collect the amount upfront in one instalment.

That apart, it is focusing on trying to recover 10% of Rs 15,000 crore property tax from defaulters that’s pending for years for various reasons, including court cases. It has also tenanted properties through which it expects to earn Rs 125 crore.

Currently, BMC’s trade and market vendor licences, for which it collects fees, need to be renewed every two years. Officials said these fees have not been raised for years and BMC now plans to “keep up with the rate of inflation”.

A pan shop spread over an area of four to 10 square metres, for instance, has to pay Rs 1,155 licence fee currently. This would rise by 5%, or an additional Rs 60 annually.

Other than water charges, BMC will also collect garbage collection and sewage charges.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A leak in the main transmission pipeline, bringing water from Aruvikkara to the city, has affected water supply in the capital for several hours on Tuesday.

Also, a major portion of the Aruvikkara–Kachani Road was damaged due to the leak in Kummi, around 1.5km from Aruvikkara.

The leak was reported in the 1,200mm transmission line, which connects the 72mld plant at Aruvikkara to the observatory tank, on Monday night.

However, before the Kerala water authority ( KWA ) began works, the water gushing out due to the leak had damaged a major portion of the road.

To prevent further damage, KWA initiated work by around 8.30am on Tuesday. A portion of road caved in and cracks had developed, forcing authorities to divert traffic in the area.

After restoration, KWA will hand over the stretch to the public works department (PWD) for rectification works.

KWA executive engineer (Aruvikkara) A Noushad said that the workers have identified the leak.

“The 12,00mm transmission line, made of cast iron, was laid in 1970s. However, the pipes are in good condition. The leak developed in a joint. We completed the works and started pumping by night,” said Noushad.

Though KWA began pumping by Tuesday night, elevated areas will receive water only by Wednesday noon.

Areas such as Vazhutacaud, Thycaud, Palayam, Statue, PMG, Bartonhill, Edapazhanji, Kannamoola, Kumarapuram, Pothujanam Lane , Vikas Bhavan, General Hospital, Pattoor, Vanchiyoor, Karikkakom, Sanghumukham and Veli were affected.

Many of the areas affected by the new pipe leak were the ones which faced water shortage during last weekend when KWA shut down the main pump at Aruvikkara as part of installing a standby pump.

RUDRAPUR: A murder accused from Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh cleared the Uttarakhand Police recruitment test in 2001 and served the police force as a constable for nearly 20 years before his crime came to light about four months back when a court in Bareilly convicted him and awarded life sentence. Officials at the vigilance department said constable Mukesh Kumar has been suspended and action will be taken against him as per the law. A case under section 420 of IPC has been registered against Mukesh Kumar at Pantnagar police station in Udham Singh Nagar district.

Sources said Mukesh was involved in a murder case in Bareilly in 1997 and joined the Uttarakhand Police four years later in 2001 by giving false affidavit about his background. The matter surfaced when Mukesh was convicted by a court in Bareilly and was awarded life imprisonment. According to superintendent of police (city) Devendra Peencha, Mukesh is a native of Abhaypur in Bareilly and joined the Uttarakhand police in 2001.

“Four years after Mukesh committed the crime, he and his family shifted to Sehdora village in Kichha in Udham Singh Nagar district in 2001. He mentioned the Sehdora address in the application form for the post of constable, and this address was physically verified after he cleared the recruitment test,” said SP Peencha.

Constable Mukesh was posted in Almora district when he and five others were convicted by the Bareilly court last year, said Peencha adding that a resident of Bareilly informed senior police officials in Almora and the police headquarters in Uttarakhand that Mukesh had moved an appeal in a higher court.

""The informer alleged that Mukesh had used false affidavit to enter the state police force. An inquiry found that the declaration made by Mukesh in a self-attested affidavit while joining the police force stating that no inquiry or case under the law is pending against him was completely false. The report was forwarded to the Udham Singh Nagar district police seeking action against Mukesh. Following this, the senior clerk at the district's SSP office, Jodh Singh Tomqyal, filed a complaint against Mukesh at Pantnagar police station,” said Peencha. “A case under section 420 (forgery) of IPC has been registered at Pantnagar police station against Mukesh Kumar,” said SHO Ashok Kumar, adding “Mukesh applied for recruitment in the state police force in 2001, four years after committing the crime. The affidavit he provided was entered in his service book, which is a routine practice during recruitment, after his address was verified.”

Udham Singh Nagar SSP Barinderjit Singh said, “After the case was registered against the accused constable, we have sent the report to the vigilance department seeking departmental action against him.”

The SSP added that “appropriate action would be taken against those involved in verifying Mukesh Kumar's credentials prior to his recruitment in the police force.”

The bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy was hearing a contempt case filed against AP and Telangana states for not bringing in SSC and PCA mechanism that would provide independence to police and a mechanism for people to air grievances against police.

Telangana special counsel A Sanjeev Kumar told the court that they wrote a letter to the high court registry requesting the name or names of retired HC judges to head SSC and are awaiting a reply from the HC.

“This letter writing business is not sufficient. First formulate rules and regulations pertaining to SSC and PCAs and then expect this court to make recommendations,” the CJ said.

The state counsel said that he too had advised the authorities to first prepare the rules. “ Pull the officials up. Tell them that their inaction cannot be defended in the court”, the CJ advised the state counsel.

AP counsel claimed that it has already set up SSC and sought time to set up PCA. But the state counsel could not explain whether they framed any rules that govern the constitution and functioning of SSC & PCAs. The bench gave AP a month’s time to file a detailed affidavit on its rules and regulations.

204,['5/02/2020'],Iowa Democrats release some caucus results after long delay,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Iowa Democratic Party chairman Troy Price speaks about the delay in Iowa caucus results on Tuesday, February 4... Read More

DES MOINES, IOWA: Clouded by doubts on a chaotic day-after, the Iowa Democratic Party began releasing partial results of the state's first-in-the-nation presidential caucus on Tuesday.

Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders were ahead in the initial results released by the Iowa Democratic Party, with Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar trailing behind in the tally of State Delegate Equivalents.

The data, made public for the first time nearly 24 hours after voting concluded, reflected the results of 62% of precincts in the state.

While campaigns were eager to spin the results to their advantage, there was little immediate indication that the incomplete results eased the confusion and concern that loomed over the opening contest of the Democrats 2020 presidential primary season.

It was unclear when Iowa's full results would be released.

During a private conference call with campaigns earlier in the day, state party chairman Troy Price declined to answer pointed questions about the specific timeline - even whether it would be a matter of days or weeks.

""We have been working day and night to make sure these results are accurate,"" Price said at a subsequent press conference.

The leading candidates pressed on in next-up New Hampshire, which votes in just seven days, as billionaire Democrat Michael Bloomberg sensed opportunity, vowing to double his already massive advertising campaign and expand his sprawling staff focused on a series of delegate-rich states voting next month.

The party's caucus crisis was an embarrassing twist after months of promoting the contest as a chance for Democrats to find some clarity in a jumbled field with no clear front-runner. Instead, after a buildup that featured seven rounds of debates, nearly $1 billion spent nationwide and a year of political jockeying, caucus day ended with no winner, no official results and many fresh questions about whether Iowa can retain its coveted ""first"" status.

Iowa marked the first contest in a primary season that will span all 50 states and several US territories, ending at the party's national convention in mid-July.

Campaigning in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Warren said she was ""feeling good"" about her performance in Iowa but questioned the state party's plans to release partial results.

""I just don't understand what that means, at least half of the data. I think they ought to get it together and release all the data,"" she said.

The Sanders' campaign told supporters that its internal monitoring showed him in the lead with nearly half the vote in. Sanders himself said late Monday, ""Today marks the beginning of the end for Donald Trump.""

Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, essentially declared an Iowa victory.

""So we don't know all the results, but we know by the time it's all said and done, Iowa, you have shocked the nation,"" he said before leaving Iowa. ""By all indications, we are going on to New Hampshire victorious.""

Biden said he was ""feeling good"" and predicted the results would be close.

The party told campaigns on Tuesday that the problem was a result of a ""coding issue in the reporting system"" that it said had since been fixed. It said it had verified the accuracy of the collected data and said the problem was not a result of ""a hack or an intrusion.""

A Biden campaign representative objected to the party's plan to release partial results before checking them against paper records, saying in the conference call that the plan didn't address ""growing reports"" about problems on caucus night, such as precinct captains unable to get through on the phone to report results.

""The stories and the problems are just multiplying so presumably you're going to have some way of addressing that and explaining to us as you release these partial results why you're comfortable,"" Biden campaign attorney Dana Remus said. ""You need to have enough transparency that other people feel comfortable about it now and we're just not there right now.""

Sanders adviser Jeff Weaver thanked party officials, and encouraged other campaigns not to undermine the party.

""Folks who are just trying to delay the return of this because of their relative positioning in the results last night, I think that's a bit disingenuous,"" Weaver said.

For the first time, the Iowa Democratic Party reported three sets of results: a tally of caucusgoers' initial candidate preference; vote totals from the ""final alignment"" after supporters of lower-ranking candidates were able to make a second choice, and the total number of State Delegate Equivalents each candidate received.

Early polling had suggested Sanders entered the night with a narrow lead, but any of the top four candidates _ Sanders, Biden, Warren and Buttigieg _ was positioned to score a victory. Senator Amy Klobuchar, who represents neighboring Minnesota, was also in the running, while outsider candidates including entrepreneur Andrew Yang, billionaire activist Tom Steyer and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard lagged behind.

Sensing opportunity amid the chaos, Bloomberg's campaign announced plans to double its national television advertising spending, which has already exceeded $100 million , as it expands its paid staff to more than 2,000 people.

Bloomberg is looking to next month, having decided to bypass Iowa's contest and the three other states voting this month in favor of the delegate-rich states in March.

""After more than a year of this primary, the field is as unsettled as ever,"" Bloomberg spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said. ""No one has made the sale or even come close to it. Meanwhile, Mike is taking the fight to Trump every day, doubling down on the national campaign strategy we've been running from the beginning.""

Beyond 2020, the debacle invited fresh criticism about Iowa caucuses, a complicated set of political meetings staged in a state that is whiter and older than the Democratic Party. Many used the moment to question whether it was a quaint political tradition whose time had passed.

The party has tried to accommodate critics before, this year by promising to report three different data points about voters' preferences, presumably improving transparency. But the new system created new headaches.

""I think Iowa is a dumpster fire,"" said Dick Harpootlian, a South Carolina state senator and longtime Biden supporter, who served as an Iowa precinct captain for Biden on Monday.

208,['5/02/2020'],"Since Outbreak In China, Supply Of Components Has Stopped Affecting Production","This story is from February 5, 2020

Agra: The outbreak of the deadly novel coronavirus (nCoV2019) in China has affected the footwear industry in Agra as supply of raw material from that country has stopped completely. Industry sources say raw material worth Rs 15 crore for manufacturing finished footwear is imported from different parts of China to Agra every month. Now, with the virus spreading fast, supply from China has dried up, affecting manufacturing here.

The virus is taking a toll in the economic front as well, shutting down businesses, curbing international travel and impacting production lines of major global businesses. In Agra, which is the largest footwear hub in India, the industry is adversely impacted as manufacturers imports several components such as laces, shoe lining, buckles, ornaments, insoles, outsoles, cellulose board, shank board, foam and packing material from China.

Every year, leather shoes worth over Rs 3,000 crore are exported to European countries from Agra. The US and several African countries are also important destinations for Agra footwear, say industry sources.

Talking to TOI, Puran Dawar, president of Agra Footwear Manufacturer and Exporters Chamber (AFMEC), said, “The spread of coronavirus has affected the shoe industry at a crucial time. January and February are peak months when manufacturing is done for exports during summer. Some of the shoe components are imported from China because these are not manufactured in India as it too expensive here.”

The footwear industry in Agra is renowned for leather products that it sells. Footwear alone accounts for 46% of the overall exports from leather industry. Agra has a share of 28% in the total footwear exports from the country and 65% of the domestic requirement.

Shoe exporter Gopal Gupta said, ""We depend heavily on footwear components supplied from China. The factories in China remain closed for their traditional new year on January 25. Due to the outbreak of coronavirus, factories in that country have shut. Imports from China will remain affected even if the factories there start operating, as delivery of consignment would get delayed due customs and other security clearances. We are searching for alternatives. Footwear components can be imported from Italy or Spain but they cost more as compared to China.”

President of Agra Shoe Factories Federation, Gagandas Ramani, said, “Due to coronovirus outbreak, import of footwear component from China has completely stopped since January. This has affected manufacturing of finished footwear in micro units in Agra. Medium and large scale manufacturers maintain stock of components supplied from China. The footwear industry of Agra will suffer major losses if the situation does not normalise in the next one month.”

According to AFMEC sources, Agra has around 10,000 micro units, 30 medium scale units and around 15 large scale units. On an average, more than two lakh pair of shoes are manufactured in the city every day, and there are over 3.5 lakh people employed in the footwear industry in Agra.

Reputed global brands like Florsheim, Nunn Bush, Stacy Adams, Gabor, Clarks, Nike, Reebok, Ecco, Deichmann, Elefanten, St Michaels, Hasley, Salamander and Colehaan are manufactured under licence in India, especially in Agra. Besides, due to cheap labour, many global retail chains seeking quality products at competitive prices actively source footwear from Agra.

Meanwhile, UP tourism department has issued an alert to travel industries Agra and the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Agra circle, to immediately inform the health department about any visitors from China in the city.

Traders garlanded a pair of donkeys and took them around market

Agra: On the twenty second day of their indefinite strike, traders of Sanjay Place market took out a “baraat” (wedding procession) of donkeys named after mayor Naveen Jain as protest against Agra Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) levy of parking fee at the market. Amid sloganeering and performance by a musical band , traders garlanded a pair of donkeys and took them around the market.

Senior leaders of Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (PSP), including Manisha Singh and Nitin Kohli, attended the protest to extend their party’s support to the traders’ cause. Kohli declared he would go on hunger strike in their support.

Since January 14, traders with shops at Sanjay Place have been sitting on an indefinite strike against AMC, for charging parking fee at 38 places in the market. They claimed it violates norms, as they had already paid a parking fee at the time of purchasing the property.

K N Agnihotri, secretary of the market association, said, “The AMC administration is trying to exploit traders by illegally charging parking fee. We’ve already paid for the parking space. To muzzle the voice of traders, a fake FIR has been registered. We’ll continue our fight against the parking mafia.”

The dispute over parking fee between Sanjay Place traders and AMC is sub-judice. Traders want AMC to cancel the parking contracts till the court delivers its verdict in the matter.

Municipal commissioner Arun Prakash said, “Charging fee for parking on public place is a right of the civic body. The fee collected will be used for development and maintenance of sanitation and hygiene. In this regard, we have planned to constitute a monitoring committee of traders. The contractor has been directed not to charge parking fee from traders. Customer or visitors will not be charged separately at 38 spots, they will have to pay parking fees only once. To put a tab on traffic congestion and vehicle theft, the parking system at Sanjay Place is essential and will be continued.”

Visakhapatnam: Officials of anti-corruption bureau ( ACB ) on Tuesday arrested Manthri Murthy, a foreman at Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), for demanding and accepting a bribe of Rs 10,000 bribe from one Ruthala Yeshu.

Representative image

HYDERABAD: A full-fledged turmeric board , a long-pending demand of turmeric growers of Nizamabad and a promise which BJP had made in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, won’t happen. Instead, Nizamabad will get a regional extension centre of Spices Board now. Telangana is the largest producer of turmeric in the country. Four erstwhile districts of Nizamabad, Karimnagar, Warangal and Adilabad account for 90% of production of turmeric in the state.

Announcing this in Delhi on Tuesday, Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal said the regional centre was being set up to take care of the needs of turmeric and chilli farmers. He said the regional centre would focus on exports of turmeric along with other spices and pulses. The existing divisional office in Nizamabad would be upgraded soon to serve as the regional centre.

BJP’s Dharmapuri Arvind , who in a sensational upset defeated CM K Chandrasekhar Rao ’s daughter Kalvakuntla Kavitha from Nizamabad in LS polls, had promised to get the turmeric board established in the town. Record nominations were also filed by turmeric growers from Nizamabad, drawing national attention on the issue.

Defending the move to set up the regional centre, Goyal said: “The turmeric board’s role is limited when compared to services that can be offered by the regional centre of Spices Board. A deputy director-level officer will head the centre.”Director (marketing), Spices Board, would monitor its activities.

The minister’s announcement, however, evoked a mixed response. Talking to TOI, turmeric grower Padigala Pravin, who filed a nomination as an independent in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Nizamabad, said the regional centre would be of no use. “It will not do any good. A regional centre is already functioning in Warangal. Only a separate turmeric board can help us get a good price,” he said. Pravin said turmeric growers should be paid a minimum support price of Rs 15,000 per quintal to cover their cultivation expenses.

Stating that the new extension centre would begin functioning soon, Goyal said it would not only focus on improving quality of turmeric but also help farmers get access to international markets. “The centre will also help the turmeric farmers get higher yield with better quality. We have given farmers more than what they have been asking for.”

In a separate directive to the secretary of Spices Board, the ministry of commerce said the regional centre will have to coordinate with the state government on production-related issues.

Curiously, Arvind said the Centre took the call after assessing the situation in the last six months. The Centre had realised that what turmeric farmers needed was a regional centre more than a board. “All separate boards for other commercial crops are not functioning as they were expected to. There is a need for a clusters’ system for spices,” he said.

The MP also said the Centre was ready to consider offering MSP for turmeric if the state government sends a proposal.

Joining the issue, Telangana State Planning Board vice-chairman B Vinod Kumar said they have been very clear on a separate turmeric board for Nizamabad. Vinod, who had written to Centre against shifting the regional centre at Warangal to Nizamabad, said: “Kavitha and the party are very clear that Centre should set up the turmeric board in Nizamabad only. She had voiced this when she was an MP. The latest move is further confusing the farmers.”

Meerut: A newborn boy was stolen allegedly by a woman in her forties from Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College on Monday. The family mistook the woman in question as hospital staff when she started helping them. She allegedly stole the baby by asking his father to dispose of a diaper. Within seconds the baby was gone. The man saw the woman running. He ran after her but could not catch her as she disappeared amid the rush.

The baby was stolen from outside the nursery. However, the CCTV cameras were not working near the spot. Hospital authorities are checking the other cameras in the vicinity to track the woman. An FIR has been filed in the matter.

“The patient, Sumaiya, was admitted to LLRM Medical College with complaints of labour pain. She had a caesarean section to deliver a baby boy on Monday afternoon. Her baby was kept in the nursery for observation for two hours. During this time, a woman in her forties struck up a conversation with Sumaiya’s husband, Aasif. She helped him as men are not allowed in the ward where his wife was admitted. Later, she accompanied him to the nursery when he went to take the baby. The woman then volunteered to change the baby’s diaper and asked Aasif to throw away the used one in the dustbin. According to our inquiry, it has been found that in the few seconds that he turned to throw the waste in the bin, the woman fled with the baby. He even tried to follow her but failed,” said Dr Rachna Chaudhary, chief medical superintendent, LLRM Medical College.

Police were informed in the matter and an FIR has been filed against an unknown woman.

There were no CCTV cameras outside the nursery and the others in the surrounding area were not functioning. As a result, the woman could not be captured in any of the CCTV camera recordings. “We are checking videos of more CCTV cameras, which were functional during the time to trace the woman in question,” said Chaudhary.

The hutment where the boy lived.

RAJKOT: Early on Tuesday morning , five-year-old Kishore Devipujak suddenly woke up hearing some growling sound. His groggy eyes sparkled seeing two cute lion cubs in the farm in Uchhaiya, a coastal village of Amreli district. He started fondling and playing with the cubs, completely unaware that their mother was around.

Before the little boy could realize anything, the lioness pounced and savagely attacked him. So furious was the lioness that she even ate some of this body parts.

The incident happened sometime between 4am and 5am, 3km from Port Pipavav, a private port run by APM Terminal and 12 km away from Rajula town.

Kishore was sleeping in the open outside his hut in the farm, which is located along side a railway track that leads to the port. His parents work as farm labourers.

Forest officials, however, said that the lioness might have mistaken the boy to be some prey as she had killed a goat at the same place in the recent past.

“The lioness caught the boy by his neck and ran for nearly three km in a grassland opposite the port. His family members and others even chased her. The lioness was familiar with these people as she moved around in the same area,” Sandeep Kumar, deputy conservator of forest, Shetrunji division, told TOI.

“The lioness was very angry. The forest department team has found her location in a near-by grassland and a trap has been set to capture her,” Kumar said.

According to forest officials, the boy’s head and parts of legs were eaten by the lioness. Villagers said some lions were also seen moving around in this area in the morning.

Congress MLA from Rajula, Amrish Der, has demanded creating a new sanctuary for lions in this area. Talking to media after the incident, Der said, “The number of lions in this coastal area is increasing. A sanctuary will help avoid such incidents of man-animal conflict besides providing protection to lions.”

The expanding lion population outside the protected areas and close to human habitats is fast becoming a cause of concern.

On December 23 last year, a farm labourer from Madhya Pradesh, Kadu Bhilad, was dragged and killed by a lion in Jira village of Dhari taluka in Amreli. Bhilad had gone to answer nature’s call and the lion mistook him for a prey as he was covered in blanket.

In December 2018, a lion had ripped off a fisherman named Rama Chudasama on the sea coast near Mahuva.

219,['5/02/2020'],Advocacy group objects to PPP model for medical colleges,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Vijayawada: The Visakhapatnam-based Praja Arogya Vedika (PAV), a healthcare advocacy group affiliated to the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, a nationwide network of 21 organizations promoting a people’s health movement, on Tuesday urged Union health minister Harsh Vardhan to reject Niti Aayog’s scheme to link new and existing private medical colleges with functional districts. It also objected the setting up of medical colleges through PPP model.

PAV general secretary T Kameswara Rao, in his letter to the minister, said the PPP (public-private partnership) model would eventually lead to increased cost of healthcare by way of imposing user charges for all services rendered in government hospitals. “This suggestion given by the Niti Aayog will reduce the government’s social obligation of being a healthcare provider to its citizens and will pave way for privatization, where the only motto will be profit and which in turn will be a burden on the vast majority of ailing public in the country,” Rao said in the letter.

Once privatization is done, there will be entry of multinational and monopoly capital into healthcare sector, as a result of which the already-widened gap between the poor and rich will further widen, which will further deteriorate the situation of common man suffering due to severe inflation and price hikes, he said.

“The move is contrary to those followed in some developed countries like Britain where healthcare sector is fully funded by the government and the outcomes of the same are also experienced by the people and are hailed around the globe. This proposal also goes against the commitment of universal health coverage charter signed by India,” Rao wrote, and requested the minister not to accept the proposal.

220,['5/02/2020'],Compensation for land acquisition: Arbitration process to restart on Thursday,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: After a long gap, the district administration will now restart the arbitration process pertaining to the land acquired for the widening of the Mukkola-Karode national highway stretch.

The Kazhakottam-Karode national highway action council had earlier announced an indefinite strike from March 15 over the delay in the arbitration process.

In the arbitration process, district collector, who is the arbitrator, will hear concerns of land owners who had approached high court alleging that the compensation for their land was low. The arbitration will be held at collectorate on Thursday.

As per the letter received by Jameela Prakasham, former MLA and patron of Kazhakkoottam-Karode national highway action council, the petitions of land owners in Kottukal, Kanjiramkulam, Thirupuram, Chenkal and Karode villages will be heard at the collectorate from Thursday.

Action council chairman V Sudhakaran said that the district administration agreed to hear the petitions after a gap of over a year. “This happened only after we repeatedly complained about the issue,” he said.

The decision for arbitration was taken after the land owners approached the court against district administration which arbitrarily fixed compensation.

After convening a district-level purchase committee meeting, which ended without forming a consensus on compensation between the then district collector K N Sathish and the land owners, the district administration had announced compensation package in 2014. After land owners challenged this in court, the high court had appointed collector as arbitrator.

During his term, former collector S Venkitesapathi heared 165 petitions and announced a 15 % hike. His successor, K Vasuki, heard 185 petitions and announced a hike of 50%. However, NHAI challenged it in court.

After NHAI approached court challenging the hike announced in the arbitration, the district administration had put the process on hold, though there was no stay on it, Sudhakaran said.

‘The district administration has to hear 1,850 complaints. It had heard only 350 petitions in the past six years. We have demanded them to settle the remaining petitions in six months,” said Sudhakaran.

223,['5/02/2020'],Goa: ‘New bill will penalise landlords who don’t give cops tenant information’,"This story is from February 5, 2020

CM Pramod Sawant

PANAJI: Stating that 85% of rapes and murders in the state are committed by migrants, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday said the government would introduce a tenant verification bill in assembly that would contain provisions to penalise landlords who rent accommodation to migrants without due verification.

The chief minister told the House that Monday’s double murder case in Fatorda — which involved a Karnataka native killing a casual labourer and a ragpicker over alcohol — was cracked within 12 hours of the incident being reported. He said the accused neither had a labour card nor was his tenant verification done.

“If the accused had moved out of state by bus or some other route, the case would have remained unsolved forever as there was no information about him with the state authorities,” Sawant said. “Migrants are staying in Goa without tenant verification.”

Sawant also urged all legislators to support the drive to check how many landlords have conducted tenant verification. “If there is any person renting his premises without tenant verification, bring it to the notice of the government,” Sawant told them.

Reiterating that a law would be enforced to act against people who do not inform the police after renting out their premises, the chief minister insisted that a record of all migrants be maintained at police stations. He said contractors who employ migrants for construction work or any other activity must conduct police verification and obtain labour cards for them.

Surat: Outbreak of novel coronavirus in China is all set to take sheen out of the world’s largest diamond cutting and polishing centre in Surat. Industry experts said polished diamond exports to China, Hong Kong and Vietnam have been hit hard and that the decrease could range between 18 and 20% in the coming months.

Industry sources said Hong Kong, China and Vietnam are the biggest market for polished diamond exports for India. Out of the total exports of polished diamonds from India, about 40% valued at $6 billion are exported to Far East countries.

Majority of diamond offices owned by Gujarati diamantaires are non-operational in Hong Kong as the government has sealed the borders with China due to the outbreak of deadly virus.

According to figures available from Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), gross exports of gems and jewellery to Hong Kong were down by 8.45% at $7.4 billion between April-December 2019 compared to $8 billion during the same period in previous year.

On the other hand, overall exports of polished diamonds between April and December 2019 have decreased by 18% at $14.66 billion compared to $17.86 billion during the same period in the previous year.

Vipul Shah, chief executive officer and managing director of Asian Star Company Limited, told TOI, “China and other countries in Far East are the second largest market for polished diamond exports from India and that the impact of virus on diamond exports will be around 20%. Our sales office in Hong Kong is operational, but we are not getting any customers as the borders have been sealed. We are monitoring the situation and may take a call to shut down the office in a day or two.”

Hitesh Patel, managing director of Dharmanandan Diamonds, said, “Diamond industry is facing problems in Hong Kong and China since a long time. First came the US-China trade war and it was followed by anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Now, it is novel coronavirus. We have called back our staff from Hong Kong office as there is no business. The novel coronavirus is going to hit the diamond industry hard.”

He was also given a letter of appreciation by Brahmbhatt in his office. City police will recommend Rabari for Jivan Raksha Padak awarded by the Government of India.

Rabari spotted a crowd at 9am when returning home in Singanpore after night shift from city traffic police head office in Athwalines. He was crossing the river from the causeway but stopped.

“I noticed that the girl was coming out of water frequently but the woman was taking time to come out. I knew they must have gulped a lot of water by now and hence jumped to rescue them. I did not wait for a team of fire department to arrive,” Rabari told TOI.

Rabari didn’t even wait to remove his wallet before jumping into the waters. He first rescued the girl and then the woman. “The woman had already gulped lot of water and hence I pressed her back and chest after which she began to puke. She was safe after that. The girl was normal,” said Rabari, a native of Khakhrathad village near Than in Surendranagar district.

The girl was picking plastic waste from the causeway’s sloppy side when she slipped into the waters because of algae. In an attempt to rescue her, Rita threw one end of a cloth to Jayshree and tried to pull her out. Meanwhile, Rita too lost balance and fell into the waters. They both started drowning when Rabari arrived there as a saviour.

Rabari is in police for the past six years and was trained at PTS Vadodara.

Panaji: In a tacit admission regarding the difficulty in restarting mining , chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Tuesday his government wants to restart the industry but it isn’t possible since over 70% of surface rights lie with private owners and lease holders, while the government only holds 20%.

Sawant was responding to several members of the House who demanded an answer from him as to when exactly the industry would restart, and why were leases not being auctioned when the state was facing a financial crunch.

His own party colleague, Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate, demanded a categorical answer — “Tell me, when will mining restart? Are people being taken for a ride?” he asked. Another BJP legislator, Clafacio Dias of Cuncolim, said that people in the mining belt are suffering and asked for it to be restarted at the earliest. Tivim MLA Nilkanth Halarnkar too questioned the government about resumption of mining.

Congress MLAs Luizinho Faleiro and Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, and MGP’s Ramkrishna Dhavalikar also grilled the CM, to which Sawant said he is “very clear” that his government wants to restart mining.

“I want to start legal mining,” he said. “I know what problems people are facing due to the stoppage of mining, but there are a lot of hurdles.”

Talking about the steps taken for the resumption of mining, he said that 22 e-auctions of 16.8 MMT of ore extracted have already been held. “Of this, 13.54 MMT has been sold, and revenue earned amounts to Rs 130 crore,” he said.

The review petition filed for restarting mining, Sawant said, is expected to be heard by the Supreme Court soon. Besides, he said, an interlocutory application is before the apex court for allowing handling of dumps based on the recommendations of central empowered committee. He further said that the government has taken a positive stand before the SC with regards to transportation of royalty-paid ore by mining companies. The SC has allowed the petition for transportation of royalty-paid ore.

AGRA: The outbreak of the deadly novel coronavirus (nCoV2019) in China has affected the footwear industry in Agra as supply of raw material from that country has stopped completely. Industry sources say raw material worth Rs 15 crore for manufacturing finished footwear is imported from different parts of China to Agra every month. Now, with the virus spreading fast, supply from China has dried up, affecting manufacturing here.The virus is taking a toll in the economic front as well, shutting down businesses, curbing international travel and impacting production lines of major global businesses. In Agra, which is the largest footwear hub in India, the industry is adversely impacted as manufacturers imports several components such as laces, shoe lining, buckles, ornaments, insoles, outsoles, cellulose board, shank board, foam and packing material from China.Every year, leather shoes worth over Rs 3,000 crore are exported to European countries from Agra. The US and several African countries are also important destinations for Agra footwear, say industry sources.Talking to TOI, Puran Dawar, president of Agra Footwear Manufacturer and Exporters Chamber (AFMEC), said, “The spread of coronavirus has affected the shoe industry at a crucial time. January and February are peak months when manufacturing is done for exports during summer. Some of the shoe components are imported from China because these are not manufactured in India as it too expensive here.”The footwear industry in Agra is renowned for leather products that it sells. Footwear alone accounts for 46% of the overall exports from leather industry. Agra has a share of 28% in the total footwear exports from the country and 65% of the domestic requirement.Shoe exporter Gopal Gupta said, ""We depend heavily on footwear components supplied from China. The factories in China remain closed for their traditional new year on January 25. Due to the outbreak of coronavirus, factories in that country have shut. Imports from China will remain affected even if the factories there start operating, as delivery of consignment would get delayed due customs and other security clearances. We are searching for alternatives. Footwear components can be imported from Italy or Spain but they cost more as compared to China.”President of Agra Shoe Factories Federation , Gagandas Ramani, said, “Due to coronovirus outbreak, import of footwear component from China has completely stopped since January. This has affected manufacturing of finished footwear in micro units in Agra. Medium and large scale manufacturers maintain stock of components supplied from China. The footwear industry of Agra will suffer major losses if the situation does not normalise in the next one month.”According to AFMEC sources, Agra has around 10,000 micro units, 30 medium scale units and around 15 large scale units. On an average, more than two lakh pair of shoes are manufactured in the city every day, and there are over 3.5 lakh people employed in the footwear industry in Agra.Reputed global brands like Florsheim, Nunn Bush, Stacy Adams, Gabor, Clarks, Nike, Reebok , Ecco, Deichmann, Elefanten, St Michaels, Hasley, Salamander and Colehaan are manufactured under licence in India, especially in Agra. Besides, due to cheap labour, many global retail chains seeking quality products at competitive prices actively source footwear from Agra.Meanwhile, UP tourism department has issued an alert to travel industries Agra and the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Agra circle, to immediately inform the health department about any visitors from China in the city.",agra,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73951431,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-80639,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-footwear-industry-stares-at-losses-due-to-coronavirus/articleshow/73943684.cms

238,['5/02/2020'],Mango farmers expect bumper crop this year,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Surat: Love mangoes, then rejoice. Mango farmers of south Gujarat are hopeful of a good harvest this season. The cold atmosphere after Diwali has ensured there was no additional vegetative growth, which in turn pushed heavy flowering in the plants.

For the past two years, the region has been witnessing only 50 per cent production and mango farmers want to reap at least 80 per cent harvest this season.

South Gujarat region is called Gujarat’s ‘Mango Bowl’, especially in the districts of Valsad and Navsari, where the famous Hafoos mangoes grow in abundance. Inclement weather played spoiled sport for the region in the last two years, disappointing not only the farmers with massive dip in production, but also mango lovers with less fruits in the market.

Yield of Hafoos mangoes came down drastically in that period due to flowers drying up before maturity and falling off owing to diseases, rued some farmers.

Some of the farmers replaced Hafoos with Kesar mangoes and others took to Nilgiri farming.

“This year, the onset has been very good. Soon after Diwali, winter set in which resulted in no new vegetative growth on the plants. The plants already have single and heavy flowering which will, hopefully, firm up as fruits by March,” said Dinesh Padaliya, assistant director of horticulture, Navsari.

Padaliya further said that with mercury remaining between 12 and 18°C at present, the climate is very conducive for good fruit. More so, this year there is single heavy flowering, unlike past years. This is good as then it eliminates chances of mucus setting on trees and getting a bumper crop, he added.

A progressive mango farmer from Gandeva village in Navsari district whose orchard is home to 1,500 trees, said, “Flowering has taken place a little late, but it is very good. With nights cold and warmer daytime temperatures, I feel it will help in a good output and can even go up to 80 per cent.”

241,['5/02/2020'],BMC aims to elevate Mumbai on happiness index,"Bruhanmumbai municipal corporation

MUMBAI: In a controversial move, the cash-strapped BMC’s Budget 2020-21 has proposed to regularize misuse of non-habitable areas inside commercial and residential buildings.In several buildings, people illegally use flower beds, lofts and car decks by amalgamating these areas into their flats or offices. Now, the civic administration plans to provide conditional floor space index (FSI) to regularize this misuse by charging a fee— 15% of the ready reckoner value of the unauthorized use. It hopes to raise Rs 600 crore with this initiative.Experts said this regularization must be in accordance with new building rules. “Else, they would violate permissible FSI, which will be both illegal and undesirable,” said former municipal commissioner Subodh Kumar. He further said the BMC will not be able to implement it unless relevant sections of the MRTP Act are modified.Justifying the proposal, municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said, “Occupants have made changes to their premises without any permission. The BMC cannot go home to home to check such unauthorized use of space. So, we are providing an option of regularization.”Housing activist Chandrashekhar Prabhu said Development Control Rules 2034 already provide for 35% extra (fungible) FSI for all existing built areas. “If illegal spaces which have been built over and above that available free of FSI are sought to be regularized, then it can raise legal issues,” he said.Architect Manoj Daisaria described it as a “good move”.“It will not only regularize unauthorized extensions but avoid unnecessary litigation by payment of a premium. This is reasonable.”The civic administration said under the 1991-2012 DCR, areas such as flower beds, car decks and lofts were free of FSI.But people in residential and commercial establishments illegally use them as habitable spaces without seeking any permission.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73949744,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-615459,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-aims-to-elevate-city-on-happiness-index/articleshow/73943693.cms

While creation of the zone was officially announced in February 2019, there has been no further progress till date. Nor has the new railway zone found mention in the Union Budget.

A senior railway official said, “Though bifurcation was announced earlier, the AP Reorganisation Act came into effect on June 2, 2014. Similarly, the date of commencement of the SCoR will be announced later.”

Official sources in the railways said a demand for retaining the residual portion of Waltair division in the new zone may have delayed the announcement and allocations in the Budget, adding that some sections have been insisting the Centre include Waltair in the newly-created zone.

Tirupati: Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR) DG Trilochan Mohapatra, who is also the secretary of department of agricultural research and education (DARE), has called upon veterinary graduates to help the Prime Minister achieve the goal of doubling farm income by 2022.

Delivering his address at the ninth convocation of Sri Venkateswara Veterinary University (SVVU) here on Tuesday, he spoke on making farming remunerative by linking it with veterinary, fishery and horticulture and by turning every farmer into an entrepreneur. “The required business skills have to be imparted in farmers. Agriculture has to be viewed in that perspective and this narrative has to be brought into farming and allied sectors”, he pointed out. Mohapatra also added that it requires market linkage, productivity enhancement, diversification into allied areas, food processing and value addition.

While the country has succeeded in hiking milk production by touching 176 million tonnes and growing at an unparalleled 6% rate, he maintained that the per capita milk availability has also exceeded the level recommended by World Health Organisation (WHO). Similarly, the poultry and fisheries sectors grew phenomenally to reach impressive figures, fetching over 7 billion USD through export. Crediting cattle rearers for production, he appreciated the scientific fraternity for bringing modern vaccines at affordable rates and introducing induced breeding programmes, slashing the cost of animal feed, all of which went into enhancing productivity.

Governor and chancellor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan called upon the graduates to take up a pivotal role in tackling air, water and industrial pollution, but also in reaching out to animals desperately waiting for medical intervention in the countryside. He spoke on the evil effects of pesticides and the need to promote greener alternatives. He later presented gold medals and awards to meritorious students .

In his annual report, vice-chancellor Y Hari Babu listed down the developmental activities taken up in the year such as new buildings under construction, farmer training programmes, health centre and so on.

Coimbatore: A 43-year-old man was detained on Tuesday for cheating an elderly woman of Rs 50 lakh by promising to get education loan for her grandson.

Police identified him as K Dhanraj of Tatabad near Sivananda Colony in the city. “The incident happened in 2017. Sixty-year-old C Rajammal of Nagammapudur near Annur was trying to get education loan from a nationalised bank for her grandson. Dhanraj, who was Rajammal’s tenant, told her that he was working in a nationalised bank and would help her get loan by pledging property. On September 22, 2017, Dhanraj told her to come to a private bank branch at RS Puram with property documents. He got her signatures on some papers and told her that Rs 50 lakh would be credited to her account within a week,” a police officer said.

Rajammal contacted Dhanraj after she failed to get the money. “She came to know that he had obtained Rs 50 lakh loan against her property. He had transferred the amount to the account of his accomplice Jesintha Mary. Dhanraj threatened Rajammal with dire consequences when she demanded the money,” the officer added.

The Annur police registered a case against the Dhanraj and Jesintha Mary under sections of 467, 468, 471, 420 and 506 (i) of Indian Penal Code on January 13, 2019.

HYDERABAD: Iconic Charminar , which is synonymous with Hyderabad, is vulnerable to air pollution. This was stated by Union minister for culture and tourism, Prahlad Singh Patel in Lok Sabha on Monday as he listed 11 other monuments facing a similar threat.The minister revealed that NOx (oxides of nitrogen) and relative humidity were damaging the Charminar. The area around the 439-year-old structure has high levels of suspended particulate matter as well as high sound levels.Track the pollution level in your cityOther monuments in the country facing a similar threat are the Taj Mahal, Red Fort, Hoshang Shah’s tomb and Mandu, Agra fort, Akbar's tomb at Agra, Bibi ka Maqbara at Aurangabad, Shore Temple at Mamallapuram and the Dwarkadhish temple at Dwarka among others.Charminar was built in 1581 AD by Mohammed Quli Qutb Shahi, the fifth sultan of the Qutub Shahi dynasty, to commemorate the end of a deadly plague that had hit the city then.Archaeological Survey of India superintending archaeologist Dr Milan Kumar Chouley told TOI, “The lime plaster is deteriorating due to pollution. Lime reacts with chemicals in atmosphere and loses its binding property. The last time a chunk of the monument fell and we crushed it, it turned powder. The oxide of nitrogen pollution will have a similar effect as acid rain due to which the surface of the monument is affected.”He added that in the 1800s, the Nizam had re-plastered the entire Charminar because of a similar problem. “Lime normally has a life of 800 years, but when exposed to nature and chemicals, it can lose it property and become weak, which is what is happening to Charminar,” he said.The ASI official said that given Charminar’s location and setting, it is difficult to reduce the pollution levels around it. “But larger measures similar to those taken for the Taj Mahal can be taken up. When Taj Mahal’s marble was turning black, larger pollution prevention measures were taken. We need similar measures for the whole area here,” said Chouley. “The sound levels have come down after vehicular movement has been regularised.”P Anuradha Reddy, convener of INTACH Hyderabad, told TOI, “Besides pollution, the central government should also look at other issues concerning the Charminar, like encroachments, insufficient funding, maintenance, preservation measures and security.”",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73948291,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-157431,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/charminar-vulnerable-to-air-pollution-min-tells-lok-sabha/articleshow/73944824.cms

Trichy: Though the state government’s decision to cancel the board examinations it announced for class V and VIII gave a sense of relief for city school teachers, they say the decision could have come earlier rather than at the eleventh hour. With only a month left for the scheduled date of board examination, teachers were engaged in preparatory work apart from training the students for it.

Trichy district chief education officer S Santhi had a meeting on Saturday with teachers on conducting the board examination. A detailed discussion on teachers going to other schools for invigilation and evaluation of answer scripts took place. However, suddenly the examination has been cancelled.

“We don’t regret the preparation for board examination but the preparatory work on conducting the examination had much of our time wasted which could have been avoided had the announcement come a bit early,” said the principal of a government aided school. Most schools say they were prepared for the board exam and were even confident of making the students pass. But when asked about the reason for opposing the exam, a city school teacher said the very idea of board exam was contentious.

There would not have been any issue if the state government had announced a common question paper across the state for class V and VIII. But the very idea of board exam will instil fear in tender minds in class V as they will have to go to other schools and write the exam in front of unknown invigilators. They may not be able to perform even if they know the answers, said the teacher. We suspected that the board exam for class V and VIII was a move to victimise teachers, said Arockiaraj, district secretary, Tamil Nadu Primary Teachers Federation (TNPTF).

“Initially the government said that board examination for class V and VIII was for namesake and there was nothing to worry. Later a government statement said the real idea of board exam for class V and VIII was to test the teachers and not children,” he said. There are many primary schools in the state operating with two teachers. Preparing children for the board examination was very difficult with such less teachers, he said.

251,['5/02/2020'],"Cash-strapped govt cut Rs 7,700 crore to 74 depts over past 3 yrs","This story is from February 5, 2020

Panaji: Lack of funds and over estimation during the budget process left government departments facing a Rs 7,733.3 crore shortfall in their budgetary allocations for the last three years. Data released by chief minister Pramod Sawant indicates that the electricity department lost the largest quantum of allocation among all the other departments every year.

A total of Rs 1,136.8 crore could not be utilised by the power department because “estimates prepared were not materialised fully during the year, as some of the expenditure was deferred for next financial year”.

The information, provided to Saligao MLA Jayesh Salgaonkar, states that of the Rs 30,184.4 crore allocated to government departments in budget documents, over 20% of the budgetary allocation was not sanctioned due to “rationalisation of expenditure” a phrase used by the finance department when it runs short of funds.

It also clearly mentions that delay in financial approvals, austerity measures and non-execution of sanctioned works led departments to forego the funds.

TOI had reported on February 3 that the state faces a liquidity crisis and had quoted a government bureaucrat who said that “just 75% of the budget is spent. We are able to spend only 75% of the allocations”.

The power department missed out on Rs 478 crore, Rs 337.6 crore and Rs 290.5 crore in 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 respectively. Data for 2019-20 has not been compiled since the financial year is still on.

For the health department, “economic measures” and rejection of bills by the accounts departments led to Rs 550 crore being unutilised. The department also surrendered funds that were sanctioned to pay salaries for new recruits as the recruitment process was stalled.

At a time when local self-governing bodies have been crying for funds, the department of municipal administration and panchayats found themselves denied of Rs 851.3 crore and Rs 279.2 crore over the last three financial years. Documents tabled in the assembly attribute the reason to “economy measures”.

Several departments could not utilise the funds allocated to them as not enough beneficiaries came forward to avail of schemes. The departments of sports, industries, handicrafts, vigilance and many others found no takers for sanctioned funds.

252,['5/02/2020'],Child rights panel trains teachers to detect &amp; prevent exam stress in students,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Bhopal: In an attempt to reduce exam stress and rate of exam-related suicides, the Madhya Pradesh Commission for Protection of Child Rights — in collaboration with the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights — on Monday organised a ‘Pareeksha Parv’ at the Regional Institute of Education. In the programme, counsellors and experts trained the teachers to detect signs of stress among children and help them deal with it in a healthy way.

Master trainers, who undergo training in Bhopal, will pass on the tips to school teachers of their own districts to implement the programme at the grassroots level. District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) principals of all districts, block-level officers and principal of Jabalpur CTC institute were present at the event.

Psychologist Dr. Vinay Mishra asked the teachers, “Do you, as a teacher, recognize students with symptoms of stress during examination? What do you do to boost the morale of students before an exam? Do you know how to treat depressed students and what not to do?” He explained to them what they can do to keep children away from stress. Counsellors Bhavana Sharma and Ankush Verma were also a part of the event.

The programme’s main objective was to mentally prepare the teachers so that they could identify and help the stressed students.

The programme was inaugurated by the chairman of NCPCR, Priyank Kanungo.

“The idea is to celebrate exams instead of fearing them. Students need to be told that marks — good, bad, average — are not the end of life and that there are several opportunities that they will get in life. The suicide rate due to exam stress and scoring low marks is increasing in the state, as well as the country. So it is important to counsel parents not to put unnecessary burden on students,” he said.

Member of MPCPCR, Brajesh Chouhan, said that this program has been designed keeping in view the incidents of suicide during examinations in children in the past years.

“It is important that teachers understand that unnecessary pressure will only stress children out and lead them to take drastic steps. Along with students, parents also need counselling,” said Chouhan.

Dr Mishra advised teachers and parents to refrain from using words like ‘loser’, ‘dumb’, etc and not discourage the students if they are not academically strong.

“Telling children that they will not succeed in life or will not be able to do anything worthwhile will only harm their self-image and they may go into depression. Just exam and studies don’t necessarily build pressure, the attitude of the teachers and parents towards students is a major factor. It is important to tell them that stress can actually make them do better as they will work harder and strive to do better,” he explained.

The three counsellors together talked about ten steps to make exams a success. These included self-confidence, small goals, moving forward, diet management, sound sleep, memory tricks, revision, managing emotions, yoga exercises and sports, resource management and stress management.

The counsellors also prepared a questionnaire for both parents and teachers so that they can understand how to treat a child.

Around 300 odd such unused bicycles had been abandoned and getting rusted in the university

TRICHY: After BDU cycle, a free bicycle lending service on the main campus of Bharathidasan University at Palakalaiperur, became a hit among students , the university administration is keen on making the faculty members use the facility. There are two bicycle docking stations set up on the campus with 78 bicycles, and the university is planning to add around 100 more bicycles to the fleet in a week for the faculty members to use it.

These bicycles were abandoned by outgoing students after use during their stay in the university. Around 300 odd such unused bicycles had been abandoned and getting rusted in the university. The university administration has refurbished them and offered it to the university staff and students to use it on the campus free of cost.

We wanted to make use of the ‘scrap’ in an eco-friendly manner and bring down the number of motor-vehicles on the campus, said BDU registrar G Gopinath while speaking to TOI. “We are glad that students are effectively making use of it. But it has not picked up well among faculty members. One reason is that students take them to hostels and not return them to the docking stations. We have now decided to induct more bicycles as 100 of them are ready after refurbishing, so that more people could make use of the bicycles,” he said.

Cycling isn’t a status symbol if we see it from sociological perspective of a university teacher. That is largely the reason why most teachers could not make use of it, said Yenda Srinivasa Rao , head, history department, BDU.

As the in-charge of BDU cycle program, Rao has been trying to change the mindset and promote the habit of cycling through his ‘weekend cycling group.’ Residing within the campus, a 30-member group has been taking part in the weekly cycle expedition with Srinivasa Rao. The idea is to make more teachers make use of it, he said. There are two docking station on the campus, one near the entrance and another one near the library. As the university spreads across 700 acres, bicycle facility provides a non-motorised and eco-friendly option for people to commute on the campus.

Madurai: The dean of government Sivaganga Medical College has been directed by the Madras high court to constitute a committee of medical experts and submit a report with regard to the pregnancy termination of a 23-year-old disabled woman who was sexually assaulted in Sivaganga district.

In her petition, the woman’s mother, residing in Sivaganga district, stated that she has two daughters. While her elder daughter is married and living with her husband, she is residing at her house with her 23-year-old differently abled younger daughter.

On January 23, her elder daughter came to her house and noticed some abnormality in he sister’s body. When she took her younger daughter to the Sivaganga government hospital for a check-up the next day, the doctors after examining her informed that her daughter was 12 weeks pregnant.

On inquiry, she learnt that a person named Kasi, who was their neighbour had allegedly sexually assaulted her daughter. The woman said she used to go out to take the goats for grazing and return home in the evening. She stated that Kasi had taken advantage of the situation and sexually assaulted her daughter when she was alone at the house.

Based on a complaint, police had registered a case, and arrested Kasi and remanded him in judicial custody.

Since her daughter was not in a condition to deliver a child, she moved the high court Madurai bench seeking for a direction to terminate the pregnancy.

When the petition was heard on Tuesday, justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana gave the direction to the dean.

The court adjourned the case to a further date.

Goa CM Pramod Sawant

PORVORIM: Chief Minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday said that files going missing was a matter of concern, and that probes should be conducted and officials concerned held accountable. He was responding to an accusation by former deputy CM Vijai Sardesai that the agriculture minister may be responsible for two files pertaining to community farming going missing from the department.

On November 3, 2019, TOI published a frontpage lead report on how files pertaining to the investment promotion board went missing from the chief minister’s office.

“Files from any department should not be lost,” CM said. “It is important to track the inward and outward movement of files. Those who are in charge should be held accountable.”

Sardesai said that around 13,408 hectares of land was lying fallow in the state.

“If the government wanted to make use of this land, the only alternative was community farming, he said.

“This government may be allergic to me, but they should not be allergic to the scheme,” said Sardesai, a former agriculture minister. He said he doesn’t suspect officials of the agriculture department involved in the files going missing, but pointed a finger at the agriculture minister.

Pointing to agriculture minister Chandrakant Kavalekar, Sardesai said, “I think on your instruction, the file has disappeared.” Kavalekar admitted that the files were missing, and said the ‘disappearing act’ happened when the former agriculture minister was sacked.

“I am not going to benefit in any way by taking the file,” Kavalekar said. “As soon as the former agriculture minister left, the file went missing. Where it went or where it got stuck is a mystery. We tried to trace the files and now we have also taken steps to recreate the files.”

CHENNAI: An exclusive aerobridge will be linked to flights that carry passengers from China and seven other countries affected by novel coronavirus. All passengers will be screened in an isolated area before they are sent home for the 28-day mandatory quarantine. Those who show flu-like symptoms such as cold, fever or respiratory distress will be taken to the nearest tertiary care centre for quarantine.Meanwhile, police said a 45-year-old man was admitted to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital with symptoms of coronavirus late on Tuesday. He had travelled to China between January 14 and January 22. He was referred to the hospital after he complained of cold and fever to doctors at Tambaram PHC.Earlier in the day, health minister C Vijayabaskar said there were no confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the state. “We know we won’t be able to stop people from travelling to the country, but we are doing all we can to stop the virus from spreading. There is no positive case in the state so far,” he said at a press conference. “We advise people not to travel to affected country or state,” he said.In the last two days, the number of passengers coming into India from China has come down, he said.

Madurai: The Madras high court has ordered notice to the central and state governments on a plea which urged the central government to release funds for the two Harijan Sevak Sangh (HSS) schools functioning in the state.

In his petition, S Muthuselvam, a law student from Madurai, stated that the HSS was founded by Mahatma Gandhi in 1932 with an objective to eradicate the prevalence of untouchability and for the upliftment of scheduled caste and downtrodden people. He stated that he came across a news item published in ‘The Times of India’ dated October 5, 2019 which mentioned that the Union social justice and empowerment ministry has not released funds for HSS for the past three financial years. There are two HSS schools in the state- N M R Subbaraman memorial residential primary school in Madurai, established in 1979 and a residential middle school at Thirukoilur in Villupuram district (presently Kallakurichi district), established in 1993.

He stated that an RTI information revealed that funds were not released for these schools since 2016-17. Since funds were not released to these schools, they are functioning with great difficulty. He added that if funds are not released these schools may shut down.

Since Right to Education (RTE) is a fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution, the ministry is duty-bound to release funds every year for the effective functioning of these schools. Though he sent a representation to the authorities concerned, no steps were taken so far. Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench seeking to release funds for both these schools.

COIMBATORE: Gone are the days when authorities would release the vehicles, used for smuggling rice distributed to the poor under public distribution system (PDS), after levying a small fine.

Taking a firm stand to curtail rice smuggling to neighbouring Kerala, as many as 250 such vehicles seized by the district supply office (DSO) last year, have not been released to the owners.

“We followed the directions of collector K Rajamani and decided not to release the vehicles. As it turns out, PDS rice smuggling has come down by 40%,” said a district administration official.

The smugglers mostly used lorries and two-wheelers. “Earlier, they would pay a penalty and get back the seized vehicles to go on with their business. Now that the vehicles are not released, some of them have stopped smuggling,” the official told TOI.

The smugglers source rice from Madurai and Tirupur. “As there about 40 routes connecting Coimbatore with Palakkad, rice is smuggled through the city,” he added.

The office of DSO is keeping 678 vehicles seized for smuggling rice over the years. It has sought permission from the Tamil Nadu civil supplies department to auction 170 of them.

Last month alone, DSO officials had seized three vehicles and recovered 16,835 kilograms of rice from smugglers.

Bhopal: Congress and BJP were embroiled in a war of words after the ruling party’s minister Govind Singh on Tuesday attacked the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the BJP’s ideological parent.

On Tuesday, minister for cooperatives Govind Singh targeted the RSS and its chief Mohan Bhagwat .

Speaking to reporters, Govind Singh, who is one of the senior-most cabinet ministers in the Kamal Nath government, said that RSS is not a non-political organization like it claims. He claimed RSS works like a political party and Dr Mohan Bhagwat “should remove his mask” and take charge of the BJP.

“RSS wants to push the country into the fire of communalism while BJP functions like Hitler’s dictatorship,” Govind Singh said.

“For 50 years, RSS has been saying that it is not a political organization. But when Mohan Bhagwat can decide on the chief minister and appointment of Governor, then it is clear that RSS is a political party.”

The minister also alleged that RSS offices have become lavish after the BJP has come to power. “I want to ask Sangh leaders that after BJP formed government, how did RSS get so much money to have air-conditioned offices,” Govind Singh said. “And camps are being held everywhere. RSS needs to explain.”

Responding to Govind Singh’s remarks, the BJP on Tuesday said that RSS is a non-political organisation and that Congress leaders are making controversial statements on the RSS to make the party high command happy.

“Congress leaders have no status to speak on RSS and Sarsanghchalak ji (Mohan Bhagwat). Sangh is dedicated in the work of nation-building, society and individual. RSS is not a political organisation. In what capacity, Congress leaders are making comments on the organisation?” said BJP MLA Vishwas Sarang.

A day earlier, senior Congress leader Manak Agrawal had also hit out at the RSS chief saying, “Wherever RSS chief goes, he instigates communal riots. The state administration and police should be alert.”

The BJP said Congress leaders were raking up controversies to create headlines. “The Congress leaders are making statements against RSS chief to please their party high command and remain in the headlines,” said Sarang.

It is the teachers, who should explain about the importance of hand washing and inculcate discipline,” Aparna told TOI.The school education department had directed government schools to spend 10% of the school grant to maintain cleanliness and hygiene. The initiative is a part of the Swachh Bharat mission.Senior specialist in Tamil Nadu Urban Sanitation Support Programme (TNUSSP) Niladri Chakraborty said that only sophisticated places like airports, shopping malls and restaurants have soap dispensers at wash areas. “Other public places lack soaps. It is mainly due to two reasons – lack of awareness and additional expenses,” he said.Explaining the need to bring in a behavioural change, the official said that public would start washing hands out of habit if they have access to soap and water at all the places. “But making it a habit is a tough task.”Most of the public toilets do not have separate hand washing stations, said D Jayakandhan of Clean Toilet. “Bacteria can spread from one place to another by mere touch,” he said.The situation is same in educational institutions, Jayakandhan said. “Hand washing techniques are being taught to students in over 70% of schools. But it could not be made a habit due to lack of sustainability and negligence,” he added.Officials of the school education department said that they conducted several sessions to teach hand washing technique to students and also displayed the steps on the walls of washing stations to create awareness.Pointing out that 10% of the school grant would be used to maintain hygiene, an official said that school managements have been purchasing soaps using the fund.",coimbatore,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73951891,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-233231,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/public-areas-lack-soap-for-handwashing/articleshow/73944820.cms

267,['5/02/2020'],HC seeks status report on enumeration of waterbodies,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Madurai: The Madras high court has directed the district collectors of four southern districts to submit a status report with regard to the enumeration of waterbodies and digitalization of the records. The court also sought a report with regard to the prevention of release of drainage water inside Vaigai river stretch.

When a batch of petitions regarding the restoration of waterbodies in southern districts were taken up for hearing on Monday, a senior counsel who was appointed as amicus curiae by the court, after an inspection on January 25, submitted that drainage water from bathrooms and toilets on the northern banks of Vaigai river in Madurai was let out into the river, thereby polluting it.

R Murali, standing counsel of Madurai Corporation submitted that the government had accepted the recommendations of the corporation to develop the sewage system on the northern banks of the river under the Smart City Mission. He further submitted that it would bring a permanent solution to this problem.

Taking cognizance of the submissions, a division bench of justices T Raja and B Pugalendhi questioned if similar steps are taken by other districts administrations to prevent pollution in the river. Hence, the judges directed the revenue divisional officers of Theni, Dindigul, Sivaganga, Ramanathapuram districts to carryout inspections to take remedial steps to prevent the flow of drainage water inside Vaigai river from Theni to Ramanathapuram districts. The judges further observed that while taking such remedial measures, the officials should also ensure that no other waterbodies are subjected to pollution with drainage water. The judges sought a report in this regard on February 11.

The judges also observed that the special government pleader V R Shanmuganathan brought to their notice that the Vaigai river was heavily contaminated following the release of drainage water from Panthalkudi channel. The standing counsel of the corporation informed the court that works have commenced for installation of modular sewage plant in Panthalkudi channel to prevent the flow of drainage water into the river. The judges observed that the amicus curiae told them about the status report filed by Madurai district collector where chief secretary had given several instructions including to digitize the entire records of waterbodies after removal of encroachments. The judges cited that he also requested the court to call for a report from the district administrations in this regard. Taking cognizance of the reports submitted by Madurai, Sivaganga and Theni collectors, the judges directed the collectors of Ramanathapuram, Dindigul, Virudhunagar and Tirunelveli districts to file a status report on February 11.

KOLKATA: The Met office said there were yet no signs of winter bowing out of Kolkata, which experienced yet another chilly day in February , with the minimum temperature touching 12.3 degrees Celsius on Tuesday.

Not often had Kolkata experienced sub-15 degree temperature in February, said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director G K Das. “It doesn’t happen very often but winter is not over till February 15. This season, we have had frequent western disturbances that led to rain , paving the way for the chilly northwesterly to blow in. This has kept the temperature low for a considerable period,” he said.

While the mercury is likely to rise on Wednesday owing to an approaching cyclonic circulation that could lead to rain on Friday , the minimum temperature is predicted to slide once the system blew away by Saturday. “With the moisture sucked out by rain, the northwesterly will return, bringing the chill back. This has been the pattern this season and it will continue till at least early next week,” said Das.

A cyclonic circulation over Madhya Pradesh is set to form and lead to rain across south Bengal on Friday. It could trigger moderate rain in the western districts of Bengal but the intensity in Kolkata is not clear. “We expect thundershowers similar to pre-monsoon spells. But the system is yet to form and so, it’s too early to predict the impact on the city weather. But showers are likely on Friday,” added Das.

Since 2013, last month was the wettest January in Kolkata, which received 42.5 mm rain. The previous two Januaries saw zero rainfall. In 2012, Kolkata received 94.4mm rainfall, highest for the month in the past one decade. The following year, the count was 12.2 mm but after that, it was never more than 3.2mm in January. “It was unexpected as this has been a very cold and severe winter across north and east India. Cloud cover and rain tend to pull the temperature up but we had short spells of shower repeatedly in January. So, the periods of high temperature were short,” said a weather scientist.

269,['5/02/2020'],Uzhavar Sandhai: Where traders have a field day,"This story is from February 5, 2020

On Monday, 20 traders from Ooty were not allowed inside the market by the agriculture officer in charge of Uzh... Read More

All is not well with Uzhavar Sandhai (farmers’ market) at RS Puram in the city.

Instead of farmers from the district, some traders and vegetable sellers from other districts get space in the market using benami ID cards.

Though the agriculture marketing department has begun taking some measures to rein in on traders and farmers from other districts, it is time for the state government to revamp farmers’ markets.

On Monday, 20 traders from Ooty were not allowed inside the market by the agriculture officer in charge of Uzhavar Sandhai, Kannan. A woman trader lost Rs 10,000 worth of business. However, the traders accuse officials of accepting bribery to set up stalls on the pavements outside Uzhavar Sandhai. Collector K Rajamani refused to support them for the simple reason that all 20 of them were traders and not farmers.

Farmers at R S Puram Uzhavar Sandhai concur with the collector. “The Nilgiris farmers who were thrown out on Monday, are not farmers but traders,” said P Thanamani, a farmer from Alandurai, who sells tomatoes. “They buy vegetables from Mettupalayam market and sell it here. They even live in the city and we have seen agents from Mettupalayam come and deliver vegetables to them,” he said. “Some of their ID cards are not even theirs but of their parents, aunt’s, uncles’ and even a benami,” a farmer from Annur said.

But why and how are these ‘traders’ from the Nilgiris are allowed inside Uzhavar Sandhai.

TOI on Tuesday found at least six shops run by people “who don’t farm” but belong to “self-help groups”. “We work for the farmers’ cooperative or self-help group, bring vegetables from their godown, sell it and hand over the revenue earned. In the month end, we get a salary. So, it is still farmers selling it but through employed people like us,” said JD Joseph, a seller from Annur. The agriculture officer in the market also admits that 15 of the 170 shops are allotted to self-help groups.

A few of the remaining farmers too admit that sometimes when their farm vegetables sell out and the next cycle is too young to harvest, they do buy vegetables from neighbouring farms and sell them at the market, which amounts to trading. The market also limits vegetables that can be sold by self-help groups and some farmers. “We genuine farmers have no such restrictions,” Balakrishnan, a farmer from Karamadai who cultivates almost six different crops, said.

Bribery too used to take place in the market, farmers said. “These benami card holders used to pay bribes, some offered bribes to bring more vegetables than they can and even for daily shop allotment. But it doesn’t happen anymore,” a farmer said.

To start filtering traders, the Uzhavar Sandhai last year issued new updated cards. “The cards were issued after verifying our agriculture land ownership or lease documents and verifying the vegetables that we grow,” a farmer from Karamadai, Kannan Rangarajan , said. Though many of the Nilgiris traders did not manage to get new identity cards, they were trading inside till last week.

The district collector said he has ordered the newly appointed deputy director of agricultural marketing service to do an audit of all the four Uzhavar Sandhai in the district and submit a report in a fortnight.

“Once I get the report, I will come up with ways to clean up the system entirely. But preference will always be given to farmers from the district,” he said.

State secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasaigal Sangam P Kandasamy said many traders have begun entering Uzhavar Sandhai in the past few years.

“Soon farmers began staying away. This will improve only if the agriculture officer in charge knows the situation in farmers lands and is pro-farmer. It is they who have to ensure farmers are given preference over traders,” he said.

270,['5/02/2020'],"No effective hygiene practice in place in schools, public places","This story is from February 5, 2020

Trichy: Frequent washing of hands is said to be a basic protective measure against the spread of novel coronavirus (nCoV). But a random check has revealed that city schools are yet to take it seriously. Same is the case with other places of mass gathering, be it bus stands or railway stations in the city.

Going by the nature of nCoV, the possibility of the disease spread is high in crowded places. But the authorities concerned are yet to wake up to the reality, which demands effective steps to create awareness on the disease. The only relief is the fact that there have not been any positive cases of nCoV reported in the state so far.

Washing hands using alcohol-based hand sanitizers or soaps is found to be effective in curbing nCoV, but only a very few government schools in the city have hand wash in lavatories. The practice is equally poor among other schools. The state government too is yet to issue any specific directive to schools on taking preventive measures .

“The habit of washing hands using water has been encouraged among students, but unavailability of soaps or other hand wash is a matter of concern,” said an employee of a government school. Children are taught to wash their hands, while coming out of lavatories or playground. But on most occasion, they do it with just water, which may not be effective against nCoV,” said the staff.

A teacher from a middle school having more than 300 children in Manapparai said that non-availability of water in lavatories too is a discouraging fact. Another school teacher said that they ask students to wash their hands, but not many are using soaps that are kept in the toilets. There is a need for further inculcate such habits that indeed lack in government schools. Meanwhile, lack of facilities for safe hand wash continues at the Central bus stand in Trichy. Urinals for men near Thanjavur bus bay lacks basic infrastructure including a washbasin and a dedicated tap for the users to wash their hands. People often spend some money to purchase bottled water for cleaning their hands. Soap is still an ‘expensive’ facility as water itself remains a luxury in the bus stands.

MADURAI: Pramod Mahajan, a 68-year-old farmer from Sangli village near Pune, is on his second pan-India ride on his bike to create awareness on the importance of organ donation . The father of four who had donated one of his kidneys to an ex-serviceman, a total stranger, 19 years ago says he is committed to removing inhibitions from the minds of prospective donors.

During his first Bharat Organ Yatra in 2018, he covered 12,800 kms across 19 States in 100 days. “This time he is on Bharat Organ Yatra 2.0 that started from Pune on January 18. He will be covering 17,500 km in 25 states over 132 days,” said Rajesh Shetty, the president of ReBirth Foundation, an NGO spreading awareness on organ donation which is funding a major part of the yatra. The local riding clubs in all the 94 cities where he is visiting makes arrangement in hospitals and educational institutions for him to create awareness. Starting from Pune, he rode through Goa, Karnataka and Kerala before reaching Madurai through Thiruvananthapuram and Tirunelveli.

274,['5/02/2020'],Dindigul farmers urged to take up millet cultivation,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Dindigul: About 55,057 hectares in Dindigul is under millet cultivation which is more than the average millet cultivation area of 51,500 in the district, and farmers should explore the cultivation of these healthy varieties more, said district collector M Vijayalakshmi.

Speaking at a seminar on millet cultivation here on Tuesday, Vijayalakshmi said that millets were predominantly used in the traditional foods of Tamil Nadu in the past. But, in accordance with the changing food habits and industrial development, people moved away from these healthy foods. As a result, children and youth are affected by nutrition deficiencies. In order to revive millet cultivation, late chief minister J Jayalalithaa introduced schemes to promote cultivation under the National Food Security Scheme. Due to this, the sale of millets such as pearl millet, sorghum and ragi, had increased in recent times.

The government was taking many steps to encourage the cultivation of millets among farmers. They are being given a subsidy of Rs 6,000 for purchasing quality seeds, vermicompost and cultivation. When farmers use certified seeds they get a good yield.

A subsidy of Rs 30 is also given for purchasing seeds. Farmers should get the quality of their soil tested and use manure accordingly to enhance the fertility of the soil. When natural fertilizers are used it could go a long way in maintaining and sustaining the nature of the soil and they could also reap good harvests, she said and urged the farmers to use natural fertilizers, instead of chemical ones.

KOLKATA: The city is set to put on its running shoes as the inaugural edition of Times Half Marathon is flagged off around 6am on Sunday .

Track the pollution level in your city

Around 3,000 people from across the country are expected to converge on Red Road , where the event will be held around grand and famous landmarks of Kolkata.

With an aim to promote the importance of keeping the environment clean, participants can register in any of the three categories—Fun Run (3km), Timed Run (10km) and Apollo Gleneagles Run (21km). To run for a “breath of fresh air” seems apt as Kolkata only recently recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 343, which falls in the ‘very poor’ category, at the Fort William automated air monitoring station in Maidan, the city’s green lungs.

Among some of the prominent runners who will be part of the event are entrepreneur Sudhir Ahuja, fitness expert Anwar Wahhab, functional and rehabilitation of sports athlete Sumana Dutta, entrepreneur Gagan Sachdev, fitness enthusiast Abhishek Lodha, Kolkata airport’s general manager (ATC) R S Lahauria, fitness enthusiasts Swati Poddar and Monalisa De and marathoners Vernon Morais, Bharat Bagla and Harsha Banthia. Also present will be Rana Dasgupta, CEO of Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, Amit Das, director (HR) and CHRO, Bennett Coleman & Co Ltd (Times Group), golfer Indrajit Bhalotia and actors Prasenjit Chatterjee and Ritabhari and actor-cum-MP Nusrat Jahan.

“Running is not just about physical endurance or fitness. It is a combination of physical, mental, emotional and spiritual wellbeing, which helps you become stronger and focused. I applaud every single participant, who are running, to create awareness about cleaner air for better and sustainable environment. All the participants need to support each other not to just reach the finishing line at this marathon, but also to continue this journey to save the environment,” said Das.

Monalisa De, who owns two cafes in Kolkata, plans to be at Maidan early on Sunday. “I have participated in multiple marathons over the past few years. I was awarded a silver medal for being a podium finisher in a marathon in 2018. Given the opportunity, I will give my best to make every event reach its zenith.”

THANJAVUR: The Brihadeeswarar Temple (Big Temple) in Thanjavur is all set for the mega consecration ceremony on Wednesday, which is taking place after a gap of 23 years. The ceremony rituals will be conducted in both Tamil and Sanskrit, as the court has ordered to hold rituals and pujas in accordance with the agama principles and Tamil should be given due place by chanting Thirumurai. As per the court order, a team of Odhuvars will recite Thevaram, Thiruvasagam, Thirumurai and other hymns in Tamil during the consecration.

Tight security is in place with drone surveillance and over 5,500 police personnel pressed into service to maintain law and order and provide security to devotees. The event is being organised in coordination with multiple government departments including Hindu religious and charitable endowments (HR&CE), PWD, health department, police, tourism department, Thanjavur municipal corporation among others.

Commissioner of municipal administration K Baskaran visited the temple and examined drinking water, rest room, and other basic amenities provided by the municipal corporation. In view of the ceremony, food has been arranged at the Raja Raja Samaya Sanga marriage hall near the temple. He also examined the quality of food prepared at the mahal.

To avoid a repeat of the fire during the consecration in 1997 which claimed about 50 lives, fire and rescue services has been pressed into service to avert any such incidents, authorities said.

“Bursting of firecrackers has been banned during the ceremony. This was the reason for the fire that caught on the thatched pandal in 1997. This year, metal sheets have been used to erect pandal,” authorities said.

Apart from special trains, Southern Railway has opened two additional counters at the main entry booking office and one at the rear entry booking office have been opened.

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court recently quashed and set aside an FIR registered against a woman from Mumbai who was booked by the Ahmednagar police along with other accused in a case involving dowry demand to the tune of Rs 10 lakh.

The 31-year-old woman had approached high court through lawyer DR Jaybhar seeking to quash and set aside the FIR registered against her based on a complaint lodged by her sister-in-law (25).

The complainant had alleged that her husband and other in-laws, including the petitioner, had sought Rs 10 lakh from her for repaying a loan amount. When she expressed her inability to pay the money, the in-laws would beat her and had driven her out of home in May 2017.

The FIR was lodged on November 16, 2018, on basis of which offences punishable under sections 34, 498-A, 323, 504, 506 of the Indian Penal Code were registered in Ahmednagar’s Kotwali police station.

While allowing the Mumbai resident’s criminal application, the bench observed: “On perusal of the FIR it is seen that the allegations against the applicant are vague and general in nature. No specific act is attributed to the applicant. An omnibus statement is that all the accused started demanding Rs 10 lakh for repayment of loan on failure of which she was subjected to ill-treatment. The applicant is the married sister of the husband of respondent no.2 (the complainant), a resident of Kedgaon in Ahmednagar district. The applicant is not the resident of Ahmednagar i.e. matrimonial place of the complainant. Even as per the chargesheet she is a resident of Mumbai.”

KOLKATA: Suspected jailed Islamic State operative Mohammad Masiuddin alias Musa — who was earlier questioned by FBI for his alleged links with the Islamic State (IS) — threw his shoe at a lawyer in the Bankshall court where his hearing was scheduled on Monday afternoon. The shoe hit the lawyer Soumyajit Chakraborty, who reportedly received injuries.

“Musa became violent in the open court. Before throwing the shoe, Musa began shouting. He also passed some objectionable remarks about the legal procedure,” said NIA ’s special public prosecutor Tamal Mukherjee.

Police said Musa, a resident of Birbhum’s Labhpur, tried to assault the lawyer once he entered the court room. “His behaviour is troublesome and hampers work at the court. We have requested the judge to ensure the safety of everyone in court,” said a lawyer.

The incident happened exactly a month after Musa had attacked the head warder of Presidency Jail and a little more than two years after he had slashed the throat of an Alipore Central jail’s warden.

The NIA sleuths, probing the case, want the trial be conducted through video conferencing as Musa has hinted that he would commit suicide. Earlier, the STF of Kolkata Police had recommended video-conference trial for him, along with American Centre attack mastermind Aftab Ansari.

Cops spoke to the legal cell and lawyers about how to beef up security at the court. Meanwhile, the security personnel at the central lock-up are taking no chance even after putting him in solitary confinement.

“He is being monitored every minute. The guards have been briefed accordingly,” sources said.

280,['5/02/2020'],Doc forces husband to watch porn; he finds her sex video online,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Bengaluru: A 32-year-old doctor who forced her techie-husband to watch porn with her and enact whatever they saw landed in trouble after he saw an online video of her having sex with another man and walked out on her.

The woman has now knocked on the doors of Parihar family counselling centre in the police commissioner’s office to save her marriage.

The woman, 32, from Kolkata and the man, 33, from Uttar Pradesh, met on a matrimonial portal, tied the knot in 2018 and began living in east Bengaluru.

She’d told him before marriage that she had a relationship with a man in the past but had later separated. All was well between the couple though she always forced her husband to watch porn videos and enact the scenes with her. He was not used to watching such videos but did so to fulfil her desire.

However, he was in for the shock of his life when he saw a video of her in a compromising position with a man on her mobile phone. She claimed he was her former boyfriend who used to blackmail her with the old video and she had saved it in case she needed to produce it in future. Though the husband was unhappy, he consoled her and asked her to move on.

However, in the third week of January, he found a porn video online featuring his wife and another man. When he confronted her, she confessed to having had many relationships before marriage but didn’t know how the video was available online.

Hurt, the man left her and began living separately. She later approached Parihar and alleged her husband was not living with her on her in-laws’ advice and was not taking care of her.

BS Saraswathi, senior counsellor at the centre, summoned him and brought the couple face to face. The man revealed his wife was addicted to watching porn videos and also forced him to do so. Also, he said he’d separated from her as he was upset that she hid details about her past.

“The man wants a divorce but the woman wants to save her marriage by forgetting whatever happened in the past. We are counselling the couple,” Saraswathi said.

Box: More such cases reported

Parihar counsellors said there’s an increase in cases of porn and social media addiction leading to marital disputes. Rani Shetty, coordinator of the centre, said recently they got a case of a man assaulting his wife to enact porn scenes he had seen online. “We had to inform police and later had to counsel the couple as they wanted to save their marriage. He would watch porn for two hours at least every day. His wife was pregnant but he forced her to do things that were unpalatable to her. She approached us and we eventually sent him to Nimhans to get treated for addiction,” Rani said.

Mumbai: The BMC has reduced its garden department budget to Rs 226 crore for the coming financial year from Rs 277 crore currently. Besides, it will give special emphasis to the municipal commissioner’s favourate subject—creation of urban forests through the Japanese Miyawaki method of tree plantation.

The BMC intends to plant four lakh plants through the Miyawaki method in the coming financial year in 65 municipal gardens.

Meanwhile, civic officials confessed in the budget book the BMC had granted permission to cut 25,000 trees over the past five years.

The BMC maintains more than 1,000 gardens and grounds in the city and requires Rs 100 crore annually for their maintenance. The remaining budgetary provision will be used to develop gardens and grounds and to plant trees. While explaining the cut in the department’s budget, an official said the BMC has decided to not construct boundary walls around parks to reduce development costs. Congress corporator Asif Zakari said, “By reducing funds for the department, the BMC is indicating it wants to give out the spaces to private entities.” — Vijay V Singh

283,['5/02/2020'],Karnataka: Vegetable vendor’s daughter is VTU gold medallist,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Lalitha says her parents’ hard work inspired her to burn the midnight oil

BENGALURU: When Lalitha R walks up the stage to receive gold medals for securing highest marks in aeronautical engineering during the Visvesvaraya Technological University convocation on Saturday, her story of grit and dedication will inspire many. Lalitha, the daughter of a vegetable vendor-couple in Hiriyur of Chitradurga, will receive two medals at the event.

The student of East West College of Engineering (EWCE), Yelahanka comes from a very humble background. Her father has studied till class 1 and mother till class 5 and together they run a vegetable shop in the town. “They leave home at 4.30am every day to buy vegetables from farmers. The shop opens at 6am and they are there till 10pm. Seeing them work this hard motivates me to toil as much. After college, I get to studies by 5pm. I take a break later and then study at a stretch from 10pm to 3am,” said Lalitha.

Lalitha, 22, completed SSLC from Vagdevi School, Hiriyur with 94% and PU from SRS College, Chitradurga with 87%. After clearing CET (with a 20,000 rank), she joined EWCE under CET quota, for a fee of Rs 18,000 per annum. “I am a first-generation graduate in my family. So, I thought something like aeronautical engineering would be special for my parents. And it turned out to be new, exciting and interesting,” she added.

The small-town girl, who came to Bengaluru for the first time in 2015, took some time getting used to life in a metro. After getting selected at a National Skill Development programme, she is now interning with an aerospace company and hopes to get placed with the same firm.

The college waived Lalitha’s final year hostel fee. “We recognised her potential in academics and decided to waive the last year’s fee. We also gave her a separate room so that she could focus on studies. The credit also goes to the department, which is a relatively new branch, with lots of young faculty, who motivated her,” said Santosh Kumar G, principal, EWCE.

An elated Rajendra said he wanted to give his daughters the opportunity to study, something he missed out on. “First, I wanted my brother’s children to do well. But, they didn’t. I then started focusing on my kids. Lalitha has been a topper since childhood. Today, other vendors in my market are celebrating as if she is their daughter,” Rajendra told TOI from Hiriyur on Tuesday. Lalitha is a familiar face in the market as she often goes to the shop when she is visiting her hometown. Her two younger sisters are pursuing diploma in fashion designing and civil engineering.

“I want to do my MS in aerospace engineering and have applied for GATE. The biggest lesson life has taught me is that only hard work will take you somewhere,” said the youngster.

284,['5/02/2020'],Karnataka: Miner appointed to wildlife board; greens call it conflict of interest,"This story is from February 5, 2020

BENGALURU: The recent appointment of a mining company owner to the Karnataka State Wildlife Board has led to a controversy with questions being raised in wildlife circles about the conflict of interest involved.

The person in question is Dinesh Singhi, owner of Bharat Mines and Minerals, Ballari. A copy of the government notification dated January 18, 2020, accessed by TOI, shows Dinesh and three others were appointed non-government members of the board.

The three other fresh appointees are Naveen JS, Alok Vishwanath and Chethana B. They replaced four existing members and have been described as conservation experts, ecologists and environmentalists. The order issued by the department of forest, ecology and environment bears the signature of Gayathri L, undersecretary to the government.

“This is a clear case of conflict of interest as the person happens to be a mining company owner. The wildlife board reviews applications of developmental projects such as mining, highways and dams in or around tiger reserves, wildlife sanctuaries, national parks and other protected areas,” said an environmental activist on condition of anonymity.

Another activist involved in wildlife conservation said the appointment is a matter of concern at a time when a mining company is lobbying to denotify Kappatagudda Wildlife Sanctuary in North Karnataka.

Appointments to the state wildlife board have been controversial in the past too. In 2017, appointment of a mini-hydel firm owner, who was facing cases of forest offences, to the board had raised eyebrows. Environmentalists allege controversies arise due to political appointees.

Interestingly, the state wildlife board is chaired by the chief minister himself and has about 10 expert members, besides officials from forest and other departments.

While the CM’s office said it will look into the matter, repeated efforts to reach forest minister CC Patil, who is also vice-chairman of the board, went in vain. His personal staff are yet to get back on the issue.

Principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) did not respond to calls and messages. A senior manager with Bharat Mines and Minerals also didn’t revert.

285,['5/02/2020'],"MBA students delay entrepreneurship: want experience, pay off loans","This story is from February 5, 2020

Representative image

BENGALURU: Due to the rising cost of education in premier management schools, the number of students opting out of placements to begin their own venture/pursue their passion has decreased over the years. For, the priority of a large majority is to land lucrative jobs to clear loans.

At Indian Institute of Management-Bangalore (IIMB), where final placements are due to begin on February 10, only two of a class of 440 students in the flagship MBA programme have opted out of placements this season. This is in contrast to around 16 students who had done so in 2011, when the batch size was 348. Only one student didn’t sit for placements in 2019, five in 2018 and 10 in 2017. In both 2016 and 2015, the number stood at five.

“Barring a handful, most students prefer to sit for placements and bag a high-paying job as soon as their studies are over. This is perhaps because most of them have the obligation to pay EMIs for student loans they would have taken. At the same time, those students who have a flair for entrepreneurship get to work with startups as a large number of them hire from the campus. The requirement for a well-paid job and the opportunity to work with startups make students sit for placements,” said Sapna Agarwal, head, career development services, IIMB.

Sapna said many students may get into entrepreneurship a few years after they graduate. However, the placement office does not keep a track of alumni activities. The current fee for the flagship MBA programme is Rs 21 lakh and will be increased to Rs 23 lakh in the next academic year as reported by TOI earlier.

Pursuing passion later

IIM-Kozhikode, which recently completed its final placements, had 3-4 students opting out of placements. “The number of students opting out of placements on our campus has always been below 10. But we see a large majority of students sitting for placements, thanks to the huge education loans they take. Many of them pursue their passion, entrepreneurship, after a few years of graduation,” said Shovan Chowdhury, chairperson, placements, IIM-Kozhikode.

HYDERABAD: The judgement against Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terror suspect Abdul Karim Tunda in 1998 Saleem Junaid module, which was scheduled to be given on Tuesday, was deferred to February 18 by the Nampally court on Tuesday. Earlier, the court had fixed Tuesday for the judgement against Tunda, who is presently lodged in Ghaziabad jail. He is expected to be brought to Hyderabad on February 18.

SIT officials had arrested Tunda in October 2013, a few months after he was nabbed by central security agencies near the Indo-Nepal border. Tunda is accused of training youngsters to carry out terror activities in India. One of these youngsters was Pakistani national Saleem Junaid, who was nabbed in Hyderabad when he and few other members of the module were planning to carry out a terror strike during Ganesh festival in 1998.

Ochira Yadav has fitted her vehicle with a beacon and an IB board

KOLKATA: A 47-year-old woman was known to her neighbours as an “influential person with contacts in Delhi”. Everyone in her locality at Purbalok near Jadavpur stadium thought she was an Intelligence Bureau officer until cops from the East Jadavpur police station hauled her away on Monday for impersonating as a senior government officer and duping at least one job-seeker.

Ochira Yadav, who had faked her designation to near perfection by fitting her SUV with a blue beacon and a ‘Govt of India, Intelligence Bureau’ board on it, reportedly has a PhD from a top Delhi university. Her husband was a Customs officer and her father had retired as a senior forest official in Assam, police said, adding she shifted to her current address from Kasba in 2017. She spent years in Guwahati and Tinsukia in Assam.

According to joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma, they arrested Yadav after Satyabratu Basu Roy, a 23-year-old resident of Bansdroni, lodged a complaint at the East Jadavpur police station that Yadav promised him a government job in exchange for Rs 5 lakh. “She allegedly posed as a senior police officer. She travelled in an Innova Cresta, to which she had fitted a blue beacon and a plate, with ‘Govt Of India’, ‘Intelligence Bureau’ written on it. She even flashed a fake IB card,” he said. Suspicious over such an offer, when Basu Roy tried to carry out Yadav’s background check, he was allegedly threatened with dire consequences. Police claimed even after her arrest, the woman refused to admit to her fault. “She appears firm in her stand but we have to find out how many others were duped and who were involved,” police said.

Basu Roy’s complaint coincided with a recent alert from the state Intelligence Bureau. Around 10 days ago, when Yadav’s vehicle was stopped at check naka, the cops pulled her up for using the fake IB board on her vehicle and using a forged IB card. But at that time, she pleaded innocence and apparently promised the cops that she would remove all the official boards. She was let off but the IB alerted Kolkata Police about her activities, said a Lalbazar source.

“We have arrested the accused under sections sections 170, 171, 419, 420 and 506 of IPC and forwarded her to court. Yadav lived alone and struggled to make ends meet. She apparently bought the SUV soon after settling in Kolkata and it is registered in her name. The flat is also registered in her name. Her husband, Subodh Chandra Chowdhury, was a Customs officer,” an officer said.

Black-and-orange flycatchers are insectivorous birds

BENGALURU: Black-and-orange flycatchers , weighing about 10 grams each, are endemic to Shola Sky Islands , the highest reaches of Western Ghats. Their adaptation to climatic features specific to some parts of the Ghats have severely limited their range .

VV Robin, an evolutionary ecologist who has been studying birds on the sky islands of Western Ghats, said these bird species could be considered relict endemics. “The terminology refers to those species which may’ve in the past had a great range but reduced thereafter owing to climatic and geographical changes,” he explained.

Robin, who is also an assistant professor of biology in Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Tirupati, was speaking at an international symposium on India’s biodiversity at the Indian Institute of Science on Monday.

“While birds are impacted across landscapes, a few species are isolated when compared to others. The common notion is that birds can fly, so it shouldn’t be a problem for them to spread across landscapes. But this is not so, specifically for these insectivorous birds. The Shola habitat does not permit a high diversity of species. But they do have a high proportion of endemism, which means the species are unique to a particular geographical location,” said Robin.

One of the most important barriers in the southern Western Ghats for the bird species is Palaghat gap (a low mountain pass between Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu and Palakkad in Kerala) as it is one of the deepest valleys in the region. Robin and his students’ study, which also looked into genetic data from the bird endemic to Shola Sky Islands, found the fragmentation of landscapes had severe impact on the species apart from their flying range.

“When we tested it on one bird species, we found the contemporary gene flow had reduced across human-modified landscapes,” Robin said. Their group studied bird songs and found that dialects of birds are different on different sky islands and even across deforested landscapes.

BENGALURU: A 44-year-old head constable who tried in vain to get his wife’s night blindness cured in will light up the lives of two visually impaired people after his death. The cop’s family donated his eyes after he was killed in a freak accident on Monday night.

The eyes of Bhaktharam SY, a resident of Saptagiri Layout, Vidyaranyapura, and head constable attached to Nandini Layout police station, were harvested by Dr Rajkumar Eye Bank of Narayana Nethralaya.

Bhaktharam was riding back home on his scooter when he met with the accident at Pipeline Road Junction near Goraguntepalya around 8.45pm. According to Yeshwantpur traffic police, a speeding truck coming from the Hebbal side on Outer Ring Road tried to overtake a car from the right, but the driver lost control and hit the median built of cement bricks.

The impact sent four bricks flinging into the air: three of them hit Bhaktharam riding on the opposite lane and the fourth landed on a car behind him.

“His right hand, leg and ribs were fractured and he collapsed on the road. Passersby rushed an unconscious Bhaktharam in uniform to a nearby private hospital where he succumbed to injuries by10pm,” traffic police said. “We have arrested truck driver Hari Prasad, 31, a resident of Turuvekere, Tumakuru district,” an investigating officer said.

Police handed over Bhaktaram’s body to his family on Tuesday morning. His last rites were conducted at Hebbal crematorium.

“Bhaktharam’s wife Sumangala suffers from night blindness. But no treatment could cure her and even transplantation was ruled out. As the family knew about the problems faced by the visually impaired, they decided to donate Bhaktharam’s eyes,” said Shashikumar N, DCP (north). The couple has two kids.

Bengaluru police commissioner Bhaskar Rao tweeted: “Extremely inspirational act in hour of tragedy.”

BENGALURU: Some 300 persons staged a demonstration in the city on Tuesday criticising police for repeatedly grilling the students of Bidar’s Shaheen Primary and High School for staging a play over the Citizenship Amendment Act .

The protesters — mostly teachers, parents and social activists — participated in a candlelight vigil at Mysore Bank Circle. Slamming police for charging a teacher and parent of a nine-year-old student with sedition for staging the play, the protesters asked: “How can cops repeatedly interrogate students inside the school? Why has everyone turned a blind eye to what they (police) are doing?”

Dwiji Guru, a parent and food-tech expert who participated in the demonstration, told TOI: “The arrested parent is a widow; her child is being taken care of by a neighbour. Slapping sedition charges and arresting them just like that is a clear example of the government trying to instil fear among students and parents and telling them to never question the authorities. It is horrifying and an inhumane act.”

Athiya Firdose, a homemaker, said police machinery is being used to scare schoolchildren. “Several things are happening in the country, but why is the government hell-bent on questioning kids and arresting parents,” she asked.

Recounting another incident in Mangaluru where students of a school run by a Hindu activist enacted the Babri Masjid demolition, another demonstrator Vinay Raj said: “If no action was taken against the school authorities in Mangaluru, why are kids and parents of the Bidar institution being harassed?”

HYDERABAD: A 30-year-old managing director of a private hospital in LB Nagar committed suicide by hanging on the health facility premises on Tuesday morning due to alleged harassment by the hospital building owner and his associates.

The victim was identified as Ajay Kumar, a resident of BN Reddy and managing director of Sri Vaishnavi Hospitals at Omkar Nagar, LB Nagar. Ajya Kumar founded the hospital in 2014 and started functioning out of a multi-storied building owned by Karunakar Reddy.

After a financial dispute, building owner Karunakar Reddy allegedly harassed Ajay Kumar to vacate the building and even filed a case in court with the help of his associates — relative, Kondal Reddy, former Turkayamjal sarpanch Shiva Kumar, Saraswathi Nagar colony president Megha Reddy.

The victim’s family alleged that Kondal Reddy had earlier snapped power to the hospital and threw nurses out at midnight. Megha Reddy allegedly warned office staff and told them to leave the premises, the family added.

On Tuesday, the victim went to his office around 9am. Later, when the staff knocked on the door of his office chambers, he did not respond. When they broke open the door, they found him hanging.

“The victim was allegedly vexed by their harassment, which was also affecting his reputation for the past few months. Due to this, he took the extreme step,” LB Nagar inspector V Ashok Reddy said.

Police found a message, written in Telugu in his notebook, stating that he took the extreme step after harassment from the four. A case of abetment of suicide was filed against the four persons and the body was shifted to hospital for an autopsy. No arrests were effected so far in the case.

292,['5/02/2020'],Farmers’ market gives this BE graduate a lifeline,"This story is from February 5, 2020

At the R S Puram Uzhavar Sandhai, along the line where a majority of Karamadai farmers have set up shops, is a tall young man sporting a T-shirt and jeans, standing in front of a shop that has three varieties of bananas. Kannan Rangarajan’s shop in the market, though relatively new, is well-known for his fresh, ripe bananas. Not many people know that a little over a year back, Rangarajan, was considering giving up farming altogether due to cut throat middle men and agents. The 32-year-old says introduction into Uzhavar Sandhai (farmer’s market) changed his life.

A little more than two years back, Rangarajan, a BE graduate, was working in Dubai as a site engineer earning Rs 3 lakh a month. However, an accident at his workplace brought his career crashing down and Rangarajan was left recuperating in his home with three to four bulged discs in his back. “They said even if I go back, I can’t even climb a flight of 10 stairs,” he said. After a few months of mulling over career options, he decided to join his parents in farming their 8 acres of land spread across Sirumugai, Moolayur and Ammanpudur.

However, the first time he took his bananas to the Mettupalayam vegetable market, he was shocked to find agents offering him just Rs 2.50 for a bunch of bananas. “I was ready to give up farming or sell it in front of my house myself,” said Rangarajan. That was when a member of his father’s farming cooperative suggested he take his vegetables to one of the uzhavar sandhais and sell it himself. “Here, after all my expenses, including my own travel to town daily, my transport costs of Rs 2 per kg of vegetables, I make a profit of Rs 1,000 per day, or Rs 30,000 to Rs 35,000 a month on an average,” he said. “This is the only way agriculture becomes sustainable,” he added.

There are several farmers like Rangarajan who believe that the Uzhavar Sandhai is a critical factor that has made agriculture sustainable. “In uzhavar sandhai, we get Rs 5 more per kg of produce than in the market daily. In fact, we would get Rs 7 more, if we had free buses from Karamadai, which we don’t. But still Rs 5 per kg or per bunch of greens, means we earn more than Rs 300 to Rs 400 per day than what a middle-man would give us,” S Balasubramaniam, who owns 23 acres of land at Thimampalayam Pudur, said.

A 14-year-old boy walked into the Tirupur collectorate on Monday to meet the collector, claiming that he has found a herbal cure for novel coronavirus (nCoV). Displaying a bottle with a dark green liquid, he said the concoction was made from 11 herbs. The Class IX boy attributed his herbal knowledge to his grandmother and insisted that his concoction could be sent for lab tests to ascertain its efficacy. The officials received a petition by him in this regard and sent him off.On Tuesday, the boy visited the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital demanding to meet the dean. He was given a liberal dose of advice and sent away by the hospital authorities. If the boy was innocent enough to approach health authorities with such a claim, there may be others who are not so naïve coming up with similar claims.An alternative medicine practitioner from Chennai made a similar claim that he has a cure for nCoV. The man said the herbal extract he has formulated would cure all sorts of viral infections and would be effective in treating multi-organ failure caused by nCoV.Quite similar to claims made by several people during the outbreak of infections right from chikungunya to dengue in the past, this time too dozens have sprung up offering ready remedies for nCoV. Social media has been abuzz with people claiming to be practitioners of alternative medicine offering solutions ranging from garlic rasam to thulasi syrup. There were customised yoga sessions for nCoV too.Health officials have warned that in general it was not safe to try any unproven methods of treatment for any viral infection. “People should understand that none of these treatments has actually been proven to be effective simply because we don’t have even one case in our state to test,” said deputy director of public health G Ramesh Kumar.Health minister C Vijayabaskar said, “We don't have much information about the virus yet.

F-21 fighter jet, which will be made in India if the US company wins a contract

Lucknow: Visitors to the Defence Expo will be able to experience the working of an aircraft competing to join the Indian Air Force.

A model and simulation set-up of the F-21 fighter jet, which is specifically configured for the IAF, is on display for visitors at the expo. A product from US defence major Lockheed Martin, it will be manufactured locally under the Centre’s ‘Make in India’ initiative if chosen by the IAF for its fleet. The US defence firm will build the plane in collaboration with Tata Advanced Systems.

All major fighter aircraft manufacturers including Sukhoi and MiG from Russia, Boeing from US, Eurofighter consortium from Europe and Saab from Sweden are competing to supply 114 jets to the IAF.

IAF had invited requests for information early last year for the project, which is under the defence ministry’s ‘strategic partnership’ model.

The deal, valued at Rs 1.5 lakh crore, is expected to be the biggest ever in terms of the number of aircraft and the amount of money involved. IAF is carrying out trials of all the participants to select the multi-role combat aircraft.

The process is expected to be completed over the next few months.

India needs to fulfil the shortage of fighter planes in the IAF, which is looking to replace the MiG-21, MiG-23 and MiG-27 with more advanced jets.

Lockheed Martin had unveiled the F-21 jet at Aero India in 2019 last year.

Meanwhile, vice-president and chief executive of Lockheed Martin India William (Bill) Blair said that the company aims to identify additional strategic partners including MSMEs and startups during the expo.

297,['5/02/2020'],RTE recognition certificate for schools may soon come online,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Representative image

NAGPUR: The education department is planning to shift online the application process for recognition certificate for schools , which is mandatory under the Right To Education (RTE) Act. The RTE recognition is valid for three years after which it has to be renewed by getting it endorsed by the local primary education department. The current block of recognition, 2019-22, has been put on hold by the education department till a final decision is taken on the online portal.

This part came to the fore after it was revealed that over 2,000 schools have not renewed their RTE recognition certificate . Chintaman Vanjari, education officer (primary), said, “The entire process has been put on hold for sometime. The state government is in the process of shifting the entire application and approval process online and that is the reason we are holding back. I will wait till March to see if something concrete happens. Otherwise, we will revert to the offline process.”

Vanjari added that since he took charge, in June 2018, just over 1,600 schools have got RTE recognition certificate. “We are monitoring schools closely regarding RTE recognition as that certificate is needed for them to claim reimbursements and get other permissions,” said Vanjari.

Education activists say the bigger question is how RTE admissions can happen if these schools are illegal. Shahid Sharif, an activist, said, “Only 20 schools have got the RTE recognition renewed in the 2019-22 block. The rule says that schools which do not have RTE recognition are technically illegal. Now, the education department is going ahead with admissions under RTE quota, but how can admissions be done in schools which are technically illegal?”

Though free admissions under RTE is a topic which attracts maximum attention, the Act actually covers a wide range of factors concerning schools. Infrastructure of a school is a major factor for getting RTE certificate and it gets renewed in fixed blocks of three years (the current one is 2019-22) after a ground level inspection by the education department.

Bhubaneswar: The state government on Tuesday sealed the poultry farm of the Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology ( OUAT ) in view of the flu outbreak there.

Ratnakar Rout, director of the animal husbandry department, said, “Poultry production in the farm will be restricted for one year. The farm premises will be disinfected every 15 days to ensure that the area is infection-free,” he added.

The farm was sealed after culling of the birds and burying of carcasses in the presence of a specialised team from the Centre, which is currently in the city to monitor the situation. The move comes after Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) confirmed the H5N1 — the avian influenza virus — in the samples of dead birds from the poultry farm at the College of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry under the OUAT on January 27.

Following the flu outbreak, all poultry birds from shops, business establishments and houses within one km radius of the infected area were culled. “The restriction on selling of chicken and eggs in the infected area is for one month. This apart, consuming chicken and eggs after cooking and boiling them has been declared safe in other parts of the state,” Rout said.

Rout added that the area within 10 km radius of the epicentre – OUAT farm – was under surveillance. “We collected samples from 76 villages in and around Bhubaneswar to ensure that there is no occurrence of H5N1 virus in birds. The reports are negative so there is nothing to worry about,” Rout said. A medical team from the state government also conducted health checks on people, who are residing in the infected area and had complained of cold and cough.

HYDERABAD: The city now has around 50 startups working in the field of cancer research or developing products related to cancer. Right from focussing on basics like platforms to connect specialists and patients to sophisticated research like developing biosimilar drugs for exorbitantly priced ones, these startups are doing research at par with the world community. Many of the researchers and scientists have in fact returned after having careers in different countries to launch the start-ups here.“Considering the alarming statistics of cancer cases in India and the urgency needed to tackle the disease, the solutions developed by these startups have immense potential to provide technologically advanced and affordable methods for early detection and treatment of cancer. These startups need support from clinical organisations and regulators,” said Rohini Pimple, director - Lifesciences RICH.Sapien Biosciences, is one such startup biobank managed professionally to use ‘medical waste’ for healthcare innovation. “The biospecimens collected as well as associated digitized data is used for establishing advanced cell and molecular research platforms. We work with diagnostic companies to enable them to validate their tests using our samples and detailed treatment and survival data collated by us,” said Jugnu Jain, co-founder and chief executive officer of the startup.Reagene Biosciences founded by Dr Uday Saxena and Subhramanayam Vangala is one of the handful of firms (in India) working in the cutting edge 3D bioprinting of human cells technology which is used to recreate human organs. “90 per cent of the drugs fail in clinic trials. The primary reason is that the drugs are developed using animal models. We are trying to create human-like tools using human cells, like taking cells from a lung cancer patients to mimic a human lung. Human-like tools will better predict how a drug will behave in human being,” said Dr Uday.Another start-up is now ready to go for preclinical trials for biosimilars to cancer drugs, ‘Keytruda’ and ‘Herceptin’, that it has developed. “Since these drugs are extremely costly (Rs 2.5 lakh per injection) and 6-7 doses are required for treatment, we are working on developing biosimilar drugs which are affordable,” said Dr Sudharshan, founder of Oncosimis Biotech Pvt Limited.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73944872,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-392118,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-an-incubator-for-firms-engaged-in-war-on-cancer/articleshow/73944872.cms

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: On Tuesday, a day after the district primary education officer (DPEO) rejected the application of Delhi Public School ( DPS ) East to operate Classes 1-8, the school considered filing an appeal before the director of primary education, the Government of Gujarat. The DPEO, in a letter issued to the school on Monday, denied permission to operate the classes from the same premises (Hirapur, Ahmedabad) under the same name. The letter said that the school management could not furnish the requisite documents including the building-use permission, the certificate from a structural engineer, and the no-objection certificate from neighbouring schools.

“The application to the DPEO has been deemed unacceptable for now. A period of 30 days has clearly been given to appeal again and submit necessary documents online to complete the application,” said Unmesh Dixit, OSD, DPS-East. “The students’ academic interests being paramount, the school is taking necessary steps to not only protect students’ welfare but also the welfare of the academic staff.”

M N Patel, DPEO-Ahmedabad, said: “We have denied permission to the school because it did not have necessary documents and permissions. According to legal provisions, the school has a 30-day window to appeal.”

The school’s affiliation with the CBSE was cancelled on November 30, 2019, after it was found that the school had forged an NOC obtained from the state education department. Following the development, the management of DPS-East had re-applied for permission with the DPEO on January 16.

Well-placed sources revealed that the school management has also initiated the procedure for obtaining its affiliation with the CBSE. A source privy to the developments said that the school has all documents in place except the BU permission which the management is hopeful of getting soon.

“Once their appeal is submitted, an appropriate decision will be taken,” said Mahesh Joshi, the director of technical education, the Government of Gujarat.

Parents, however, have raised concerns over the school resuming operations from the next academic year. Bhaskar Patel, president, Gujarat State School Management Association, said that according to Bombay Primary Education Act, 1947, a school management can approach the director of primary education in the form of an appeal. And if that too is rejected, the management can approach courts. “Even if they produce all the documents in 30 days, the time limit for applying for a new school or additional classes is over,” he said. “The usual time limit for applying to start or close a school is six months. I do not think that the school management will be able to begin classes by April this year.”

Madurai: A team of food safety officials lifted samples from oil stores selling loose cooking oil varieties in East Veli Streets and adjoining areas on Tuesday. Officials said that appropriate action against the owners will be taken based on the outcome of the results.

The 16-member team of officials, led by designated officer for food safety for Madurai district Dr S Somasundaram took around 40 samples from 20 stores. This is in addition to around 50 samples lifted last week. Officials said that so far, they have covered only a couple of wards in the city. Lifting of samples will take place throughout the 100 wards and subsequently the whole of Madurai district would be covered. Officials said that at least 500 samples will be taken to test the quality of oil sold to the public.

Being the gateway for southern districts, huge quantity of oils is being sent through Madurai after repacking in the city. There are hundreds of oil stores selling loose oil in Madurai alone posing difficulty to officials in ensuring that right quality is sold to the customers.

Somasundaram said that good quality of gingelly oil cannot be sold for anything less than Rs 400 per kg, but it is available starting from Rs 220 in the market.

Similarly, groundnut oil is being sold from Rs 150. “How can oil be sold at such a lower price? So, we have a suspicion on the quality of the oil and decided to check it by testing it in the lab,” he said.

Somasundaram said that selling oil in loose is banned by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) due to rampant adulteration.

The traders have been repeatedly warned to stop selling in loose for the past few months. While a few have started selling in packets, some have come forward to put a sticker on the vessels mentioning the name of the oil.

Kolkata’s love story with Russian literature continued at the 44th edition of the International Kolkata Book Fair . Bolstering the image of Russia, the theme country at the fair this year, the Publishers and Booksellers Guild, along with the Russian Consulate, made elaborate arrangements to get the most popular Russian classics translated into Bengali. Understandably, the Russia pavilion, where the books have been displayed, has been drawing huge crowds, as book lovers flipped through titles, like ‘Shishu Kahini’ by Leo Tolstoy, ‘Alta Jaba’ by Sergei Aksakov, ‘Byanger Visvadarshan’ and Maxim Gorky’s ‘Ma’ and ‘Choruichhana’. Childhood nostalgia, coupled with the sheer appeal of the books, saw them flying off the shelves in no time. Students also took home engineering and medicine books. Even Russian readers has ostensibly developed interest in Bengali literature as poet Subodh Sarkar said his book had been translated into Russian.

Bringing AJC Bose to people

Bose Institute, a repository of all contents that Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose wrote, has brought special editions and volumes of the scientist’s books, scientific essays, letters and memoirs capturing the pioneering science movement of the time. The idea, said an official, was to bring Bose to people. “Apart from his pioneering contributions to the fields of radio and microwave optics and to plant studies, did you know that he was also one of the first writers of science fiction in Bengali? He is almost an unknown planet and we want to present him holistically to the city. Hence this effort,” the official at the stall said.

Promoting wildlife

Books on wildlife have always been a favourite among readers here, and multiple new titles were unveiled at the fair, “forests of Bengal” being one of the most popular themes. Nature, Environ and Wildlife Society, which works for the welfare of forests and wildlife, also brings out a magazine, Environ. Given its unusual coverage of tigers, wild dogs and grizzly bears in the country, the magazine seemed an instant hit. Honey, mats, Dudheshwar rice and sonamug dal, all sourced from the Sunderbans, were also stocked at the stall.

Senior Citizens’ Day

Celebrating Senior Citizens’ Day, the Publishers and Booksellers Guild invited residents of old age homes in the city for a tour of the fair. Some of the visitors had physical incapacitation and had to be assisted while moving from stall to stall. The physical fatigue notwithstanding, they enjoyed themselves at the fair and returned home with books gifted by the Guild.

303,['5/02/2020'],Govt draws up plans for 24x7 water supply in state,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Bhubaneswar: To ensure round-the-clock water supply to every household, the Water Corporation of Odisha (Watco) here has come up with short-term, mid-term and long-term plans.

According to the short-term plan, which will be implemented within a year, the Watco has proposed to install water meters in every household and will set up a meter testing lab while a cell to address the issues of non-revenue water (water lost during supply and due to pilferage) will also be set up in the city.

It is also proposed to establish a centralised customer care centre with interactive voice response system for redressing urban water supply grievances. The districts will be divided and named district metered areas for concept planning, an official source said.

The Watco has planned to procure mobile water quality testing laboratories for continuous monitoring of water at taps of consumers. “We have also decided to initiate a customer tap sampling programme as part of which samples will be collected for quality monitoring,” Watco managing director Chitta Ranjan Jena said.

He said a GIS-based water supply asset database will also be created for management purposes.

Similarly, as part of the mid-term plan, which will be implemented within two years, the Watco has proposed to set up a state-of-the-art institution for capacity building of the engineers and officials. The institution will also support research programmes in the field.

A water supply central control and command centre will also be established for effective monitoring of works, incident response and maintenance of water supply system 24x7, another official of the corporation said.

The mid-term plan will also address the issues of non-payment of dues as part of which an innovative system will be adopted. It is proposed to restrict water supply by the use of specialised valves instead of disconnection of the defaulting consumers.

In the mid-term proposal, a water safety plan will be prepared and implemented while another emergency and risk management plan will be put in place to prevent water-related disasters for effective incident management.

As part of the long-term plan, which will be implemented within five years, policy framework and guidelines will be prepared for water conservation and groundwater usage. A framework for enforcement measures will also be developed for the purpose, an official said.

“Odisha is one of the states where water scarcity is not yet a problem, but there is a need to conserve and manage the available water. I am hopeful that the plans of the administration will yield good results,” social worker Alok Kar said.

AHMEDABAD: The concept of trusteeship, primarily the one propagated by Mahatma Gandhi , can work as antidote to potential deviations from public interest, said Prof Michael Spence, noted economist and 2001 Nobel laureate . He was speaking at the inaugural session of the day-long symposium on ‘Trusteeship and the Future of Capitalism’ at IIM, Ahmedabad (IIM-A).

“In representative democracies, and in other forms of government, interest groups matter, and they differ in their power to influence and organize. The result is potential deviation from what we might call the public interest in the formulation and implementation of policy,” said Prof Spence. “The antidote: the thing that is supposed to limit these deviations, is public service or trusteeship.”

The Mahatma had suggested trusteeship as a concept where a certain part of an individual’s wealth was held in trust for the greater good of society.

“By and large this system worked pretty well, when applied. But its application has been narrower than it should be and certainly than Gandhi envisioned in a more expansive social version of it... It used to be part of the concept of public service. These days, with a few exceptions, I don’t think most politicians think of themselves as trustees. Nor do leaders in business,” said Prof Spence.

ERODE: A female elephant aged around 22 was found dead in the Kadambur forest range in Erode district on Tuesday. Forest officials said the elephant suffered from intestinal infection.

After being alerted by tribals of Makkampalayam village, forest officials and veterinarians reached the spot. The autopsy was performed on the spot and later the carcass was buried in the forest.

“The elephant had been suffering from intestinal worms and stopped eating. Subsequently, its health condition deteriorated and it died,” a forest official said.

“Elephants usually have round worms in their intestines. But, when the number of worms increase, it may become fatal as elephants stop consuming food,” one of the veterinarians who performed the autopsy said.

MADURAI: A plus two student was admitted to the Tenkasi government hospital on Tuesday with neck and hand injuries after he was attacked by a classmate. The victim had close to 12 stitches on his neck but is said to be out of danger. and the attacker was nabbed by the police.

The incident which happened on the way to Government Anna Boys higher secondary school at Veerakeralampudur was the fallout of a clash on Monday between the two boys, both 17-year-olds. According to the police, the victim hailed from Veeranam and the attacker from Veerakeralampudur.

Police said a teacher had asked the victim on Monday evening to inform the other student to meet him over academic reasons. The other boy was offended as the boy called out his name aloud in front of other students and picked a quarrel with him. Tension prevailed as the boys clashed and the teachers made the victim go home first and made the other boy wait for some time to avoid a clash outside the campus. On Tuesday morning, the victim got down from the bus at Veerakeralampudur and was walking to the school. Suddenly, the other boy surfaced and picked a quarrel with the victim. Quite unexpectedly, he attacked him with a sharp blade used to sharpen pencils.

The boy suffered cuts on his neck and left hand, seeing which the locals rushed him to the hospital. Meanwhile police in plain clothes picked up the attacker for questioning. Tenkasi district SP G Suguna Singh told TOI that the neck injury was accidental and that the attacker did not intend to cause any life threatening injury to the victim. “He tried to scratch the boy on his hand using the blade,” the SP said.

Singh added that an FIR was not registered in this connection as there is a Supreme Court direction that a case should be registered against a minor only if they he committed an offence that could attract a minimum punishment of seven years imprisonment – like an attempt to murder. A community service registry (CSR) was registered so that the incident does not become a bad trendsetter, the SP said. The SP said that the attacker will be produced before the juvenile justice board in Tirunelveli , which in turn will decide on the further course of action.

308,['5/02/2020'],Final plan of Puri corridor likely by 1st week of April,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Bhubaneswar: The final architectural plan of the ambitious heritage corridor project around the Puri Jagannath Temple is expected to be ready by April first week with focus on the Kalinga style of architecture.

Eminent personalities like Puri King Gajapati Dibyasingha Deb, noted sculptor Raghunath Mohapatra, retired bureaucrat and researcher Subash Pani and servitors suggested necessary changes in the draft plan as Bengaluru-based Bhumiputra Architecture Firm made presentation on the draft plan at a meeting here.

Briefing reporters after the meeting, Mohapatra said there is a need to focus more on Kalinga architecture while preparing the final plan of the mega project.

State works secretary and Jagannath Temple chief administrator Krishan Kumar said there will be more consultation with people associated with the Jagannath culture before preparing the final plan.

Some of the key issues discussed in the meeting include streamlining the traffic movement in the streets/localities surrounding the shrine, developing the Ratha Khala where chariots of the deities are made, developing the ritual paths from the shrine to other religious places and developing facilities like advanced queue management system, cloakrooms, toilets, brief resting facility en route and provision for washing feet, said Kumar.

On Mohapatra’s concern over lack of Kalinga architecture in the draft plan, the works secretary said, “We have emphasized on Kalinga architecture in the draft plan. Since the plan is on the consultation stage, we have requested Mohapatra to guide the architecture team to ensure that Kalinga architecture is reflected in the final plan.”

Major suggestions made by the Puri King include special arrangement for Sankirtan and to perform other rituals within the heritage corridor.

Similarly, the state government and temple administration have also planned to develop facilities through which over 5,000 people can partake of Mahaprasad at a time.

“The corridor is being planned keeping in mind the Jagannath culture and tradition of Shrikshetra (Puri). Steps are being taken to popularise the culture across the globe,” said the Puri King, who chaired the meeting.

The state government plans to spend around Rs 800 crore for development of the heritage corridor around the 12th century shrine and it is one of the top priority of the state government at present. The project is targeted to be completed in two years.

309,['5/02/2020'],Street vendors to be streamlined at 4 spots,"This story is from February 5, 2020

About 1,680 street vendors have been identified at all the four places for the project

MADURAI: Madurai corporation has obtained sanction for streamlining street vendors at four places – Town Hall Road, East Chithirai Street, Thalavai Street and Thiruparankundram Road - under National Urban Livelihood Mission by providing them similar-looking space-saving street furniture. The corporation will get a fund of Rs 5.41 crore soon to execute the project.

Corporation commissioner S Visakan said streamlining the vendors will help them operate without affecting traffic or pedestrian movement at the proposed places. There will be similar-looking stalls which suit the needs of various vendors like eateries and those selling vegetables or flowers. Other than Madurai corporation, only Greater Chennai corporation has received the fund in Tamil Nadu and the latter is planning to introduce a similar project on Marina beach. Works for the construction of stalls will start once the allotted fund is received, corporation officials said.

About 1,680 street vendors have been identified at all the four places for the project. They include 437 vendors on Town Hall Road, 390 at East Chithirai Street, 354 in Thalavai Street and 499 on Thiruparankundram Road.

They have been categorized under three divisions — fast food under one, flower sellers under another and vegetables, fruits, puja items, footwears and other things under the third category. Among the 1,680 street vendors there are 305 selling flowers and 314 selling fast food while the rest comes under the third category, officials said.

Assistant city health officer B Vinodh Raja told TOI that street vendors will be given stalls at the same place where they have been operating for long. They would be allowed to operate in such a way that others on the road are not affected. Already, all the street vendors in the city have been enumerated and are being issued identity cards.

The process started a few years ago and the street vendors have undergone various training programmes where they were told about their rights and responsibility. The identification of four locations and beneficiaries was carried out a few months ago. Officials said a minimum charge will be collected from the street vendors once the project is implemented.

However, other modalities like whether it would be collected every day or monthly are being worked out.

Representative image

CHENNAI: In a setback to telecom major Bharti Airtel , the Madras high court has refused to quash a criminal proceeding initiated against the company by a customer for failing to stop obscene text messages being sent to his mobile.

Dismissing the plea moved by Airtel, Justice P Velmurugan directed the chief judicial magistrate in Egmore to conduct the trial proceedings in accordance with law and complete it within four months.

The issue pertains to a police complaint lodged by advocate V S Suresh in 2011 against Airtel and its former chief executive officer Rajiv Rajagopal for failing to stop obscene messages sent to his mobile.

Based on the complaint, the cybercrime cell of CCB registered an FIR under Sections 292, 292A (distribution of obscene contents) and 294 IPC and Sections 3, 4 and 6 of Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act and Sections 2, 3 and 6 of the Young Persons (Harmful Publications) Act.

After investigation, the CCB police filed a chargesheet in 2013. Taking cognizance of the chargesheet, the magistrate ordered summons to the accused. Aggrieved, the petitioners filed the present petitions seeking to quash the criminal proceeding.

Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the company is only a service provider and it has no role in sending such messages as it has no occasion to see the messages transferred from one customer to another.

Therefore, the petitioners are not liable to be held for the alleged offence, he said. He further submitted that the messages said to have been received by Suresh were also not obscene as defined under the IPC and therefore, the petitioner has nothing to do with the messages received by Suresh.

Refusing to concur, the judge, referring to the statement recorded by police, said it shows prima facie evidence and also the advocate made a complaint before the petitioners, for which they have not taken any action.

Whether the petitioners are liable, or they have any direction or not, all those matters are to be decided after trial and not at this stage. Therefore, the court does not find any valid reason to interfere in the criminal proceeding, the judge said while dismissing the plea.

Rajinikanth had visited injured Sterlite protesters after the police firing incident on May 22, 2018

MADURAI: Actor Rajinikanth has been summoned for an inquiry by the one-member retired Justice Aruna Jagadeesan Commission that is probing the anti-Sterlite protest and the police firing on May 22, 2018, that claimed 14 lives. The actor has been asked to appear before the commission during the 19th sitting of the inquiry in Tuticorin at 10am on February 25.

“On the directions of the (Aruna Jagadeesan) commission we summoned actor Rajinikanth from Tuticorin by post on Tuesday. It has been sent to his Poes Garden residence in Chennai. We expect it to be delivered in a day or two and are awaiting acknowledgement for the same,” a source in the commission told TOI.

The reason cited for summoning the actor is quoting his comment to journalists in Tuticorin on May 30, 2018, after his visit to the violence-hit southern coastal city that ‘intrusion of anti-social elements’ was the reason for the mob turning violent and eventually ended with the police resorting to firing at them.

Pointing out that the actor had also stated that he knows those behind the instigation and that he will reveal it at the right place, the source said that on these grounds Rajinikanth has been asked to appear and reveal those vital details.

Sources in the commission also said that Naam Tamilar Katchi (NTK) coordinator Seeman and advocates-cum-activists S Vanchinathan and A Viyanarasu were among the many who had given written submissions before the commission to summon Rajinikanth for an inquiry.

It may be recalled that the commission’s counsel Vadivel Murugan told Tuticorin reporters on January 25 – after the 18th sitting inquiry – that Rajinikanth would be summoned if needed.

Ahmedabad: A city sessions court denied anticipatory bail to former Godhra MLA Haresh Bhatt and a builder named Sunny Patel, in connection with a complaint filed with Vasna police against them for an alleged illegal sale of land.

A lawyer, Kanti Pandit, lodged an FIR accusing Bhatt and others of cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy. Pandit, the chairman of Manjushree (Vasna) Owners’ Association, accused Bhatt of selling the piece of land to Patel for Rs 1.55 crore though they are not members of the association.

Additional sessions judge P M Unadkat denied pre-arrest bail to Bhatt and Patel with the observation that economic offences are on the rise. Granting anticipatory bail to them would send a wrong signal to society. The legal protection against possible arrest would also cause issues with the process of custodial interrogation, the court said.

SALEM: In separate incidents, an unidentified man has killed two men sleeping on the roadside in the city in the past two days.

Deputy commissioner (crime and traffic) of city police S Senthil said on both occasions, the man used boulders to smash his victims’ head. “But the reason for his actions is yet to be ascertained.” He said 16 special police teams are searching for the accused.

On Tuesday morning, A Angamuthu, 85, of Sadagoban Street of Ponnammapet, was found dead in front of a commercial complex near old bus stand with his head smashed with boulder, a police officer attached with the Salem town police station said. The victim was working in a fruit shop and used to sleep outside the shop.

When police checked CCTV footage from nearby shops, they found the accused throwing a boulder on Angamuthu’s head. “We were shocked as the accused had killed a 39-year-old alms seeker at Kasakaranur on Sunday night. He was caught on camera throwing a boulder on the unidentified victim’s head,” the police officer said.

“We will intensify patrolling in the night as the killings happened between 11.30pm and 3am,” the deputy commissioner said, adding, “We don’t know the motive. He could have some mental illness.”

COIMBATORE: SSVM School of Excellence at Uppilipalayam on Monday adopted ward 64 of the city corporation to keep it clean and tidy.

“The purpose of adopting the ward is to make the surrounding area cleaner and to appreciate, motivate and support the sanitary workers for the work that they carry out. It is only the corporation workers who carry out the work and our job is to stand with them and make them feel motivated,” trustee of SSVM institutions S Mohandoss said.

“We are planning to conduct periodical review meetings with corporation officials and workers. Issues pertaining to sanitation will be discussed and necessary actions will be taken to rectify them,” he added.

By involving students in the activity, we could turn them into responsible citizens who would keep society in mind while doing an activity, he said. The school has started a Swachh Bharat Club.

Apart from providing safety gears for sanitary workers and push carts, the school has come forward to provide breakfast to workers on regular basis. It has also agreed to send volunteers to educate the public about source segregation of wastes, said R Raveendran, a Swachh Bharat ambassador.

“By doing so, we are not just creating awareness among the public, but also educating the students about solid waste management,” he said, adding that sanitary workers had been facing an issue or other while they do it on their own. The school has also come forward to carry out two mass cleaning activities per week based on the suggestions given by the public, he added.

About a couple of months ago, CRI pumps had adopted ward 28 at Saravanampatty and had distributed safety gears to the sanitary workers and conducted medical camps for them, he said, adding that another educational institution had shown willingness to adopt another ward.

Chief Swachh Bharat ambassador Shanthi Priya Powroji and founder and managing trustee of SSVM Institutions Manimekalai Mohan participated in the inaugural function.

Dehradun: Lack of infrastructure, skills and markets is hindering mushroom cultivation in Uttarakhand, claim mushroom cultivators in the Himalayan state, adding that despite the inherent potential that the edible fungi has, the state hardly has shops that sell mushroom seeds (spawns) and there are very few laboratories either which produce spawns.

Social entrepreneur Divya Rawat, who is also hailed as the ‘mushroom lady’ of the state, for motivating and training many people to take up mushroom cultivation, told TOI, “The state has no shops that sell spawns and many of those engaged in mushroom cultivation in the state do not have technical knowledge. Also, the farmers don’t have markets to sell their produce.”

Notably, there are two types of mushrooms cultivators in the state — seasonal producers (small units) and all-season producers (controlled units). According to government data, there are 25 controlled units in the state and around 225 small ones. The regions which lead in mushroom cultivation are Haridwar, Dehradun, Pauri and Tehri as per government data.

According to Sanjay Kamal, chief mushroom development officer of Uttarakhand, the Himalayan state is the sixth largest mushroom producer state in the country and production here can be increased if alternatives of wheat chaff like mungretha, chingura and mandua chaffs are made available.

HNB Garhwal Central University’s professor RP Bhatt said, “There are over 65 species of edible wild mushrooms that grow in Uttarakhand which could be used commercially but no authority is working to expand this market. Our scholars are researching on the possibilities of cultivating wild mushrooms as these are expensive.”

Meanwhile, Subodh Uniyal, state agriculture and horticulture minister, when queried on what is being done to expand the mushroom market in the state, told TOI, “The government provides 50% subsidy on spawns and fertilisers. We also provide free training to mushroom cultivators in different parts of the state. Under the ‘Integrated Horticulture Project’, the state government will set up a Centre of Excellence for Mushroom where research will be done on increasing the quality and quantity of our mushroom produce. We will start the facility as soon as the World Bank approves the fund for it. Our department’s main objective is to double farmers' income in the state.”

GANDHINAGAR: On Tuesday, Gujarat government officials visited the Sabarmati Gandhi Ashram to explore an itinerary that can be suggested to US President Donald Trump ’s team in case his visit — with Prime Minister Narendra Modi — is confirmed. Sources in the general administration department were tight-lipped. But it is expected that PM Modi will personally escort Trump through the ashram and the recently inaugurated Charkha museum within the ashram campus.The year 2020 marks 90 years of Gandhiji’s famous Dandi March that began from the ashram on March 12, 1930. Almost three decades later, in 1963, Gandhiji’s march had inspired Dr Martin Luther King Jr to lead the famous non-violent civil resistance in the US. King had organized ‘March over Washington’ as part of his campaign.King had visited the ashram on March 1, 1959, with his wife Coretta Scott King. They spent a day at the ashram. King also visited a few places on the Dandi route that year. King’s close associate, James Farmer Jr, visited the Ashram in August 1980 as part of the US consulate delegation. Farmer had led the Congress for Racial Equality. A staunch devotee of Gandhiji’s non-violent strategies, Farmer planned the historic Freedom Rides, which led to interstate travel desegregation. He was introduced to Gandhiji’s Satyagraha while at Howard University in 1941. In February 2009, King’s son Martin Luther King III visited the ashram as well as Gujarat Vidyapith to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his father’s visit.“As of now, there is no official communication from the state or the central government about Trump’s visit,” said a senior Sabarmati Gandhi Ashram official.

Berhampur: Over 1,900 quintals of ganja worth around Rs 40 lakh were seized from Dengaosta under Digapahandi police station limits in Ganjam district on Monday night . The driver of the pick-up van in which the narcotic substance was being illegally transported, was arrested on Tuesday.

He was identified as Biswaranjan Biswal of Puruna Sasan under Balianta police station limits in Khurda district, said sub-divisional police officer (Chikiti) S N Murmu. He was the only person in the vehicle during the raids, he added.

The ganja was being illegally transported from Mohana in Gajapati district to Puri, when police seized the contraband during night patrolling, said the SDPO. The contraband was packed in 60 gunny bags with each weighing around 30 kg. “We are probing to zero-in on the main accused,” he said.

This was the second major seizure of ganja after January 4, 2020. On that day, around 800 kg of ganja was seized near Dasanapalli Chhaka under Aska police station limits.

Bhubaneswar: The premier Utkal University started the online application process to fill up 118 vacant posts of assistant professors, associate professors and professors on Tuesday. March 4 is the last date to file online applications. Printed copy of the application should reach the university by 5 pm of March 11.

The university has been facing an acute shortage of guides for research scholars in the last five years with 44% of faculty posts, mostly at the senior level, lying vacant. Vacancies have also affected teaching.

Altogether 30 professors, 42 associate professors and 46 assistant professors will be recruited for different departments. The institution has 119 vacant posts against 257 sanctioned teacher posts. One director-level post will be filled up later, said Dayanidhi Nayak, the registrar. In June, the ministry of human resources development cautioned that it will revoke Rs 100 crore grant given to Utkal University under Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan scheme unless it recruits teachers against more than 100 vacant posts.

LUCKNOW: The Indian defence forces may get a powerful ‘armour’ to protect their personnel from any Pulwama-type terror attacks in the future.

This would be made possible with the introduction of indigenous armoured protected fighting vehicle that can provide side blast protection against 50kg of TNT explosives. A prototype of the vehicle, named ‘Kalyani M4’ and currently in trial stage, will be on display at the Defence Expo in Vrindavan Yojana .

The need for such vehicles for the defence personnel was felt after a suicide bomber blew up a convoy of Central Paramilitary Reserve Force (CRPF) in Pulwama of Jammu and Kashmir in February 2019, killing 40 soldiers, said Baba Kalyani, the chairman of Bharat Forge Limited — the maker of this unique and indigenous vehicle in the country. Addressing a press conference in Lucknow on the eve of Defence Expo, Kalyani said their focus is now on manufacturing lighter products to facilitate easy movement of troops. Keeping this goal in mind, Bharat Forge is producing various lighter products, including a super light artillery gun, he added.

Hailing the upcoming defence corridor in Uttar Pradesh , Baba Kalyani stressed on increased participation of private sector defence manufacturing companies in the project. Bharat Forge has signed an MoU with UP government for setting up an ammunition factory in the state under the defence corridor project. The company has also scouted some locations in Jhansi to set up the factory.

Col(retd) Rajinder Singh Bhatia , CEO of Bharat Forge, said one of the greatest challenges in combating terror is ensuring the safety of the security personnel and ‘Kalyani M4’ would be of immense importance in such situations

MADURAI: The mahila court in Tuticorin on Tuesday awarded 10 years jail to a 34-year-old conductor of the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) after he was found guilty of abetting the suicide of his wife. The incident took place in the victim Gomathi’s house in Tuticorin in June 2014.

Special public prosecutor (SPP) of the mahila court V Subashini said Gomathi had got married to her maternal uncle’s son Murugan in May 2010 and the couple was residing in the house gifted to them by her mother in Rajiv Gandhi Nagar.

“Murugan repeatedly harassed Gomathi mentally, saying she is not beautiful,” the SPP said and added that the couple frequently quarrelled over these. “On June 24, 2014, Murugan left the home in the morning, saying that she should end her life before he returns or else he will kill her. The woman took the extreme step by dousing hersel.”

Nithyananda

AHMEDABAD: The father of the two girls allegedly missing from the Nithyananda ashram , on Tuesday approached the Gujarat high court seeking transfer of investigation into his complaints to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The complainant’s main contention was that the central agency would be better placed to investigate and coordinate with Interpol because the prime accused Nithyananda and his two daughters are not in India. Local cops would find it difficult to investigate his complaints.

The complainant express dissatisfaction with the investigation, which has culminated in a chargesheet, by Ahmedabad rural police. He claimed that the investigation was not carried out in a neutral manner. It is by handing the probe over to CBI that lacunae in the local police’s investigation can be filled.

The complainant also demanded further investigation because the evidence gathered by police with regard to illegal confinement of children and the missing girls was not enough, the petition said.

The HC may take up this petition later this week.

On January 17, Vivekanandnagar police filed a chargesheet against the two ashram administrators, Harini Chelappan alias Pranpriya and Riddhi Ravikiran alias Priatatva, and showed Nithyananda as an absconder. Police have had Interpol issue a blue-corner notice against Nithyananda and have obtained an arrest warrant from a local court.

The two administrators, who are behind bars since the registration of the FIR in November, have been accused of illegally confining children, abusing them and putting them to labour.

Thakore manages to extract the exact register from millions of musty and dust-laden records stacked at the office since 1932.But now this lone oracle of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), an office assistant, is retiring in February leaving this highly shortstaffed department of 10-odd personnel shaken and overwhelmed.The reason is that over the past nine weeks, people from across the city have begun to rush for their and their parents’ birth verification. People want to have the documents ready before officers verifying birth and death records for the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the 2021 census come knocking at their doors.This department is staffed to solve 20-odd queries a day; queries have risen to 115 to 140 a day since mid-December.“People often break down when they don’t find their records in our digital archives, fearing that they won’t be able to make it into the NRC,” said a senior clerk at the office. “Seeing them in pain has been disheartening for us over the past few weeks. In such cases, Jayantikaka comforts and reassures the families by pulling out the right register. No one can pull off a miracle like he does.”Thakore explains the complexity of municipal record-keeping. “Ward boundaries have changed with each election delimitation,” Thakore said. For instance, prior to 1953, registers for Dariapur and Madhupura were one. Then in the 1960s, they were separated. Later, a new ward — Kazipur Dariapur — came into existence. Many of the records dating between 1932 and 1979 stacked together are in tatters. Small chunks of paper pieces lie strewn on the department’s floor as they are repeatedly brought out for verification.“If you tell me the year and the month of your birth, I can get the relevant ward file,” Thakore said. He gives the example of Gheekanta area, where records are scattered across Kalupur-3, Khadia, and Shahpur wards. Then there are supplementary records which are extensions of registers in which incomplete birth or death details were amended.“For births that have taken place before 1973, we look up ward records. For births that have occurred after this year, we look up hospital records even before referring to details in ward registers,” Thakore said. He is now worried for the poor who cannot pay the minimal charges for re-registering or hiring lawyers for court procedures. A senior officer at the registrar’s office explained that panchayat records of newly inducted areas such as Vastrapur, Jodhpur, Bodakdev, Mithakali, and Sola have made many mistakes in surnames and father’s names. “A birth and death record cannot go wrong and that is the pressure we deal with in each verification query,” Thakore said.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/kagaz-king-amid-nrc-jitters-amcs-records-genie-to-retire/articleshow/73944983.cms

Bhubaneswar: Famous Ollywood director Dilip Panda has landed in trouble after a CCTV footage featuring his alleged unruly conduct in a restaurant in Kharavel Nagar here on Sunday went viral on social media on Tuesday. The restaurant owner, Sitanshu Mishra, lodged a complaint against Panda in Kharavel Nagar police station on Tuesday.

While police are verifying the charges and examining the CCTV footage, Mishra demanded an appropriate legal action against Panda. Mishra alleged that Panda along with three others arrived at his restaurant after it had shut around 10.30 pm.

“Dilip Panda entered my restaurant in an inebriated state. He ordered food. My staff politely said the restaurant is closed as it was 10.30 pm. Panda flew into a rage and started threatening my staff by brandishing a knife. Panda also thrashed my staff,” Mishra told media persons.

Mishra’s cook, Maheswar Mohanty alleged that the Ollywood director heckled him and threatened him of dire consequences if he did not prepare food for him. “He shouted at me and picked up a knife from our hotel. He threatened to stab me. They left the restaurant after creating nuisance for several minutes,” Mohanty said.

Panda dismissed the allegations. “I was not drunk. I am a regular visitor to the restaurant. On Sunday night (around 10.30 pm), I and three of my friends visited the restaurant and asked for food. The hotel staff asked whether we would have chicken biryani. In view of bird flu, I requested him to serve some other dish,” Panda said. The director alleged that the restaurant staff misbehaved with him. The staff hurled abuses at me and asked me to leave the hotel. “I picked up the hotel’s knife to help the cook chop onions and not to stab him,” said Panda.

BAREILLY: A year after the suspicious death of a man, police have filed an FIR under sections of murder against two brothers , after the viscera report confirmed the victim had been poisoned.

Rajendra Prakash Bhargava, a resident of Izzatnagar in Bareilly , went missing on February 25. Two days later, his dead body was recovered from a guava orchard. The reason of his death couldn’t be ascertained in the autopsy, and the viscera were sent for lab test.

Police have booked Santram and his brother Ayodhya Prasad in this case but none of them is arrested so far.

Bhargava was a clerk in the district administration’s cane department. He went missing after leaving for office on February 25. On February 27, his body was recovered but since there were no injury marks on the body, prima facie it appeared he had died of some illness. However, his family alleged he was murdered by Santram and his brother over a property dispute so the body was sent for autopsy.

After the autopsy failed to confirm exact cause of death, viscera samples were sent to the forensic lab in Lucknow, whose report was received by police recently, after which FIR was registered on the complaint of victim’s daughter Anu Bhargava .

According to sources, both brothers booked by police are land mafiosi and share good rapport with influential politicians of Bareilly. Many complaints against them are pending because of their political influence, and officials refrain from taking any step against them.

Izzatnagar SHO A K Verma told TOI, “We’ve filed an FIR against two persons under IPC sections 302 (murder), 328 (causing hurt by poisoning) and 120B (criminal conspiracy). We have started investigating this case and the accused have been informed about the complaint against them. None of them will be arrested at this moment, because we are trying to identify if the victim was poisoned by them or by someone else. Action will be taken as per law.”

MADURAI: In the wake of the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus (nCoV) across the world, the health department and district administration are emphasising on washing hands with soap as one of the major modes of infection control and prevention. Among the primary target audience are school students who are given hand wash lessons.

But effectively bringing it to practice to tackle spread of the disease in city schools have to go a long way. Speaking to TOI, Madurai district chief education officer R Swaminathan said that adequate steps are taken to keep schools clean though there were still no particular instructions in relation to nCoV.

Under Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan scheme, funds are allocated as school maintenance grant to maintain toilets clean and keep the campus hygienic. “It includes providing soaps and facilities for hand washing,” he said. A government school teacher claimed that they used 10% of the grant to maintain toilets clean and ensure that students have adequate soap and water to wash their hands.

“We try our best but cannot force every last child to follow,” added the teacher. Several government, aided and corporation schools admitted that despite the funds provided they would run short of soaps, hand wash solutions and even cleaning solutions for toilets. “Either teachers are forced to spend money from their pockets or sometimes sponsors step in to provide such supplies,” said the headmaster of a corporation school.

Principal of a private school in Anna Nagar admits that “it is highly impractical to provide soaps through the year because of the large population. It is already a struggle to provide adequate water through the year in the toilets.”

Lucknow: Breakthroughs in Ramjet projectile technology, the science which drives BrahMos missile system, will be showcased by a team from Indian Institute of Technology-Madras (IIT-Madras) at DefExpo-2020 which kicks off in the city on Wednesday.

“We are on the verge of a breakthrough in Ramjet technology for incorporation in artillery projectiles. If all goes well, we will be able to double the range of attack. This will make a substantial difference in India’s combat capabilities,” professor of practice Lt Gen (retd) PR Shankar from the department of aerospace engineering, IIT-Madras, told TOI.

He has also served as director general of Indian Artillery. Defence sources said IIT-Madras is likely to unveil a potentially revolutionary concept of 155mm Ramjet-powered pseudo-missile shell that can hit targets more than 70-80km away.

Sharing details of the technology, Lt Gen Shankar said, “Most engines convert chemical power into motion. Power is generated when chemical mixture of oxygen and fuel is compressed and ignited. Power generated on combustion propels motion. Normal fuels have significant amount of oxygen while the remaining part is igniting agent.” Adding that the ratio of oxygen and igniting agents is related to the range of an aircraft or jet, he said: “Whenever oxygen content in the fuel is reduced or increased, the range goes up or down. Ramjet is about carrying fuel rich propellants devoid of oxygen to use atmospheric oxygen to burn fuel.”

He said in defence sector, Ramjet-powered artillery was of cutting-edge technology. “What makes our effort significant is that it is made in India. The breakthrough can cut India’s expenditure on imported Ramjet missiles by up to one-fifth,” he said.

IIT-Madras will also showcase indigenous multi-role expendable UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) and next generation fire control network which will ensure that all guns and missiles in an area work in synergy to produce a force multiplicative effort.

NEW DELHI: Challenging BJP to declare its chief ministerial candidate, AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said that people want to know whom they are voting for before polls are held on February 8.Kejriwal, who is ready for an on-camera debate with BJP’s CM face, said if the saffron party doesn’t announce its chief ministerial candidate by Wednesday afternoon, then he will return to make an announcement.Since BJP and Congress have already released their election manifestos, Kejriwal feels there is a need for an extensive debate on the key initiatives by different parties. “What if BJP makes an uneducated and unworthy candidate the chief minister (after coming to power)?” he asked.“In a democracy, it is important to have a detailed debate and discussion on the key initiatives addressed by different parties in their manifestos. People should be able to ask questions and give opinions on the key poll promises. I would like BJP to declare its chief ministerial candidate and I will challenge him to a debate with me,” Kejriwal said after unveiling AAP’s manifesto at the party’s headquarters.In the past, BJP had gone to polls with a CM face, but avoided it this time. Congress has also not announced a chief ministerial candidate. Because of this, AAP has been trying to take a political high ground. AAP has been questioning the absence of BJP’s CM face on multiple platforms and asking the saffron party, “Kejriwal versus who?”Underlining the importance of a CM candidate, Kejriwal asked how would people vote for a party if they didn’t know who would be leading it. “Amit Shah said that he will decide the CM face after BJP is voted to power. But the real power to decide the CM lies in the hands of the people. Shah cannot claim this right as per the Constitution,” Kejriwal said, adding that every vote for AAP will go to him, but every vote for BJP will be wasted.BJP slammed Kejriwal for his remarks and said that in a democracy people vote for MLAs, who elect the chief minister. “AAP is a one-man show, but BJP is a party of millions of workers. This election has turned into one between an anarchist and the nationalist people of Delhi who want a government that works for five years for their welfare and not just a few months before elections,” said Delhi BJP functionary Praveen Shankar Kapoor.East Delhi BJP MP Gautam Gambhir at a rally on Monday had said, “AAP says Kejriwal vs who?

We are concerned about you and your needs...We will make sure that by the next elections, Yamuna is so clean that you don’t have to go all the way to Ganga for a holy dip. I will take all the people of Narela to take a dip there”.The CM claimed that if BJP won the elections, it would end all welfare schemes started by the Aam Aadmi Party government. “BJP functionaries have been saying that they will stop everything that’s given for free to the citizens. If you want that to happen, you should vote for them...Else, vote for us. We have worked towards improving education, power, health and transport, offered free bus rides to women... the list is endless. And, we pledge to continue working like that in the next five years,” Kejriwal said.“Till the time I am with you, I promise that all your needs will be taken care of by your son, like they have been in the last five years. We will change the face of this place and make it more liveable,” he added.“I want that the people who support BJP and Congress should also see the work that AAP has done in the last five years and vote for our party this time. I am not asking for votes for my selfish reasons. I want everyone to vote for progress,” he said. “I have worked for the welfare of every citizen, keeping aside which party you supported in the previous polls...but, this time, everyone should side with a party that will help you progress.”Kejriwal concluded his speech by saying that the citizens of Delhi had created a special kind of bond with him and now they should vote for AAP again, so that they could take forward their relationship.As the CM left for his next stop — Bhajanpura — men, women and even children danced to the tunes of the party’s anthem, “Lage Raho Kejriwal”.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73950816,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-683079,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi/will-fix-broken-roads-in-4-months-says-kejriwal/articleshow/73945007.cms

NEW DELHI: BJP’s Kapil Mishra, formerly of AAP, is not new to controversies, but his recent provocative comments on Shaheen Bagh protests have added further spice to a triangular contest in the North Delhi constituency of Model Town. Mishra is pitted against sitting AAP MLA Akhilesh Pati Tripathi, who is aiming for a hat-trick of wins here, and Akanksha Ola of Congress.The constituency has a diverse mix of electors: while Model Town and Kamla Nagar are primarily inhabited by trader and business communities, Gulabi Bagh and Rana Pratap Bagh are home to lower middle class residents and slum dwellers.Tripathi bagged 38,492 votes in his win in 2013. In 2015, he did even better, garnering 52.4% of vote share at 54,628. He sought to strike a chord before the elections. “I have worked a lot in the last five years. People here have accepted me like a family member and I am committed to fulfilling the vision of CM Arvind Kejriwal,” he said.Calling himself a “100% work MLA”, Tripathi said while other states were in turmoil, Delhi’s economy was faring well because of the work done by AAP government. “This government has worked for the youth, providing scholarships and free coaching to them; for women, by installing CCTV cameras and giving them free bus rides; and for the elderly, by increasing their pensions and launching the free pilgrimage scheme,” he added.Promising a tough fight to Tripathi is Ola, who is the daughter of three-time Congress MLA Kanwar Karan Singh, who, incidentally, was at the receiving end in the 2015 polls.“My father is my identity and I am his shadow. I have been working with him since I was 21 years old and people know me well. He accompanies me for my padyatras and door-to-door campaigning,” she said, adding “the good work done by my father under Sheila Dikshit is remembered by all.”Ola alleged that five major infrastructure projects started by her father had come unstuck during Tripathi’s tenure. “Roads, sewer lines and parks have not been maintained,” she claimed.In a similar vein, BJP’s Mishra said that the government machinery had “completely collapsed”. He said: “This government has done nothing but blame the Centre, corporations and neighbouring states.” Calling for a “new vision”, Mishra said he would work towards improving the basics in the area, which, according to him, were ignored by AAP government.In a clear bid to polarise voters, Mishra had recently compared the February 8 elections with an India-Pakistan match. He had claimed that the protests at Shaheen Bagh against the citizenship law were Pakistan sponsored. Tripathi attacked Mishra by stating that “his statements prove that he has lost his mental balance”.BJP’s move to field Mishra, an MLA from Karawal Nagar, has been questioned by rivals and locals alike. Jaspreet Singh, a shopkeeper in Kamla Nagar, said: “We haven’t seen him in our area. He is not from here.”Ola agreed. “I can’t comment on why BJP gave him a ticket in Model Town. Perhaps, he didn’t do any work in Karawal Nagar. People who can’t ask for votes on the basis of their work will talk of India-Pakistan or Hindu-Pakistan,” she said.Mishra countered: “The public will respond to these questions. I was born in Gupta Colony and studied in DU. Those who have no work of their own can rake up these issue to get votes.”",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73950592,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-914447,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi/work-of-5-years-legacy-and-nationalism-in-3-way-clash/articleshow/73944975.cms

CHENNAI: Four Tamil Nadu cities – Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai and Trichy – with more than one million population each have been allocated Rs 556 crore for cleaning up their air and handling solid waste management.The 15th Finance Commission ’s recommendation, which has been accepted by the Centre, is for the next financial year. In all, Rs 5,344 crore has been allocated to local bodies in the state for 2020-21. Out of that, Rs 1,737 crore is for urban local bodies. Chennai will receive the maximum assistance of Rs 362 crore.The commission has also separately allocated Rs 100 crore to Chennai to prevent flooding in the city. “A targeted allocation of Rs 500 crore has been made in 2020-21 from the National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) to enable cities with a population of more than 5 million to prepare integrated solutions for flood management in view of the regular incidence of flooding, leading to heavy loss. Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata will get Rs 100 crore each in the coming financial year,” said the interim report of the commission presented in Parliament on Saturday.The commission has provided grants to all three tiers of panchayats in rural local bodies and also to cantonment boards in urban local bodies.“While 50% of grants to rural local bodies are untied, the remaining 50% will be tied as grants for sanitation and water supply which are identified national priorities. For rural local bodies, no conditions have been prescribed for getting the grants in 2020-21. However, from 2021-22 onwards, the entry level condition for rural local bodies getting these grants is timely submission of audited accounts,” said the report.For the first time, the finance commission has differentiated cities into million-plus cities and those with less than one million population.Larger cities have a tendency to grow faster. Grants are provided to 50 million-plus cities on agglomeration basis with special emphasis on meeting challenges of poor air quality, ground water depletion and sanitation. “For non-million-plus towns, 50% of the funds are untied and the remaining 50% is tied, with an equal share for drinking water and sanitation,” the report said.The commission has not recommended any conditions for urban local bodies in 2020-21, but has recommended two entry-level conditions in the subsequent years. Apart from timely submission of audited reports, the urban bodies will have to increase their own revenue.The commission has recommended that states make allotment of grants on the basis of population to the cantonment boards within their territories. The report has identified two cantonment boards in Tamil Nadu — St Thomas Mount in Chennai and Wellington in The Nilgiris district which have a total population of 63,257 people.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73952604,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-596068,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/city-to-get-rs-462cr-to-clean-up-air-check-flooding/articleshow/73944966.cms

MADURAI: The school education minister’s announcement scrapping board exams for Class V and VIII on Tuesday saw teachers and students from several schools in Madurai celebrate their relief by distributing sweets.

Teachers, students, parents and activists alike welcomed the government’s decision. Minister for school education K A Sengottaiyan in a circular has said that the department has withdrawn the order passed last year to conduct board exams for Class 5 and 8 from this academic year. “The decision has definitely removed the mental pressure of students. Education is not something to be forced upon students, but rather a natural process in which everyone deserves a chance. We have always seen many achievers who may have done poorly in academics,” said a government primary school teacher.

The SFI celebrated the announcement by distributing sweets. “These board exams would have increased the number of dropouts and many young children would have been forced into child labour. Similarly, it would have also forced girl children into marriage at an early age. Though it was promised that students would not fail, mental pressure would have been there in families,” said Vel Deva, SFI district secretary.

On the other hand, the Private Schools Correspondents Confederation (PSCC), an association of private schools affiliated to the state board, pointed out that such random and arbitrary announcements cause immense harm to the children’s education system. “In future, any decisions taken by the department of school education should be done in consultation with the stake holders and any changes should be announced at least a year before its implementation,” said Senthilnathan M, president, PSCC.

Teachers and educationists said that if such board exams were a test of quality of teachers in government schools, then teachers need to be appraised with a different system rather than just experience.

Uddhav Thackeray

GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government reacted sharply to remarks by Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray about the bullet train project, terming Thackeray ’s comments as `negative’ and `unfortunate’. In an interview, Thackeray called the bullet train project a white elephant , saying a decision on it would be taken after he was convinced it would boost the industrial development of Maharashtra.

“Who will benefit from the bullet train? How will trade and industry in Maharashtra get a boost because of it? If it is useful, convince me and then let’s go before people and decide what to do,” Thackeray said in the interview. He added, “We have to see what is urgent and not take up something because we are getting a loan at zero interest or low interest. We acquire farmers’ land for no reason and then look after these white elephants. This is not right.”

Deputy CM Nitin Patel, who is also the government spokesperson, in Gandhinagar said, “The Maharashtra CM’s remarks on investment in the bullet train are unfortunate. Uddhav Thackeray needs to understand the project and its benefits for the country. The project will not only help thousands of commuters who travel between the two states, but it will also bring more investment and jobs to both states.” Patel added that instead of spreading negativity about the project, Uddhav Thackeray should correct his statement.

Referring to the bullet train project, which has faced opposition from farmers and tribals whose land is to be acquired, Thackeray said there should be a comprehensive discussion on its viability. Of the 508.17km bullet train corridor, 155.76km will be in Maharashtra, 348.04km in Gujarat and 4.3km in Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

Around 800 small and big dairies are currently operating within the city

BAREILLY: The municipal corporation is planning to shift dairies that are operational in five wards under Bareilly Municipal Corporation ( BMC ) to some other location, considering the cattle menace and civic problems being faced by residents.

Around 800 small and big dairies are currently operated within the city. The civic body is planning to shift dairies from five city wards — Azam Nagar, Rampur Garden, Siklapur, Gandhi Udyan and Naumehla. According to BMC, these wards are worst affected with clogging of drains and pits, frequent waterlogging and garbage due to the dairies.

Sanjeev Pradhan, environmental engineer, BMC, said, “BMC is considering shifting dairies in five wards — 9 (Naumehla), 20 (Azam Nagar), 32 (Gandhi Udyan), 57 (Rampur Garden) and 64 (Siklapur) — which were identified on the basis of the seriousness of civic issues faced by residents and commuters. We are yet to identify the alternative place for shifting these dairies, but most likely, they will be relocated to some place in the city outskirts.”

Locals and commuters alleged cattle waste from the dairies is discharged directly into local drains or disposed along roads, making it difficult for both group of people. Shubham Singh, a resident of Rampur Garden, said, “Cow dung is discharged into our drains, clogging them, causing waterlogging after even mild showers.”

Biharipur resident Aabid Husain said, “With dairies operating in city limits and residential areas, there is a cattle menace on roads, which often brings traffic to halt, when cattle strays in groups on prominent city roads. They also injure people sometimes.”

According to BMC, there are around 800 small and big dairies, including illegal ones, functional across the city, including areas such as Sanjay Nagar , Joginavada, Biharipur, Choupla, Baankhana, Civil Lines, Subhash Nagar, Madinath, Swale Nagar, Gulab Nagar , Premnagar, Cantonment, etc.

Madurai: Highlighting the importance of early diagnosis in treatment and prevention of breast and female genital cancers, a workshop was held at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) for village health nurses (VHNs) from across the district.

During the workshop held as part of ‘World Cancer Day’, the nurses were sensitised about breast and female genital cancers like cervical and ovarian cancer, which are easily preventable if diagnosed in the early stages. Doctors from the Department of Surgical Oncology at the GRH addressed nearly 200 participants, including VHNs and tutors from the school of nursing at GRH, on breast cancer, female genital cancers and myths surrounding cancers in women.

“Cancers in women can be cured completely if diagnosed early. Awareness is required at the grassroot level which is why we conducted this workshop for VHNs. We trained them to look for symptoms of cancers in women, on how to conduct a breast examination and other techniques that help in early diagnosis,” said Dr M Ramesh, Head of the Department of Surgical Oncology at GRH.

The participants were asked to watch out for some of the common symptoms of female genital cancers and breast cancer like an unusual white discharge or bleeding in the vagina, unexplained lower back pain and heaviness of the abdomen, and painless lumps in the breast.

The GRH performs around 1,000 oncology-related surgeries per year while close to 3000 patients undergo medical treatment for cancers in a year.

340,['5/02/2020'],"In times of climate change, schools chant ‘cli-fi’ mantra","This story is from February 5, 2020

CHENNAI: Cli-Fi or ‘ climate fiction ’ are books presenting the real science behind climate change to readers. Interestingly, several schools in the city are slowly incorporating them into their curriculum , teaching students current climate effects and what the future may hold if they do not protect it.

“Children enjoy reading novels and when they read novels on these subjects, they pay more attention to climate change and work on it,” said Srinivasa Raghavan, principal of Bala Vidya Mandir.

Novels like ‘The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable’ by Amitav Ghosh, ‘The Year of the Flood’ by Margaret Atwood, graphic novel Snowpiercer, which talks about the last remaining members of humanity travelling on a train after the earth succumbs to treacherously low temperatures, are among those that have made it to middle and high school classes in institutions like Vael’s, Arsha Vidya Mandir and some others.

“After reading the novel, we also watched the movie ‘Snowpiercer’ and discussed the challenges we’ll face if we ignore the current climate crisis,” said Ankita T, a Class VIII student of Vael’s Billabong and a big fan of climate activist Greta Thunberg. “For next week, our teacher has asked us to read Greta’s latest book ‘No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference’, so that we learn and improvise on her ideas of global warming and climate change.”

Srinivasa Raghavan explained that reading such novels inculcates a better understanding of climate change apart from the routine tree planting or cleanliness drives. “It makes children imagine and think about the ‘what-ifs’. This is an important genre and we see our children make sustainable choices in their daily lives,” he said.

The cli-fi classes are held at least twice a week for Classes V to X. Every week, children are prescribed a climate fiction novel by teachers, which they bring to class, read and discuss with their peers. After reading, they are given a project work. The initiative was begun recently and schools are happy with the response.

At the Hindu Primary School, students were asked to create a model of how the earth would look if it was filled with garbage and there was no water, based on the children’s books they were asked to read. “They came up with interesting ideas and conclusions, showing barren and abandoned lands, with no life forms,” said S Raja, the school principal.

The students, however, are not marked for these classes and projects, as teachers fear they would otherwise lose interest. “More than imposing, we want to gradually inculcate reading habits and make them aware of their surroundings, their planet, though it’s mandatory to read one cli-fi book a week,” he said. He pointed out that many children have stopped wasting water, whether leaving the taps open in toilets or watercoolers, and he also finds them picking up waste from roads and disposing it in bins.

However, most schools still do not discuss climate change, as teachers say it’s outside their subject area.

“But it’s not the answer. We need to discuss, especially with the younger generation,” said Arun Krishnamurthy, founder, Environmentalist Foundation of India. He said many times schools do not take up such innovative methods because of parents’ pressure. “Parents only want their children to score marks, and because of this schools are unable to go a step forward and help children learn. We need an overall change in attitude — right from, parents, teachers and even school managements. They need to know that climate change is real,” he said.

NAGPUR: Indian doctors are known world over for providing optimum health care despite problems like dearth of surgical devices, shortage of medicines and geographical challenges. Hundreds of doctors from England got first-hand experience of the skill sets of Indian doctors between January 30 and February 1, when Dr Madan Kapre and his team performed 115 major surgeries in Chikhaldara , in the foothills of Melghat .

Conducting an international thyroid surgical workshop in Chikhaldara is an annual exercise for Nagpur-based Head and Neck Foundation, Indian Society of Thyroid Surgeons, and Rotary Nagpur South for the last 27 years. This year’s workshop was special as, for the first time, it was live webcast to three locations, one of them being St Mery’s Hospital of Imperial Healthcare College in London.

“We perform all surgeries here for free. From last 19 years, it has also become an academic event. Doctors across the country participate in this surgical workshop and learn thyroid surgery techniques,” said Dr Madan Kapre, who has been leading the initiative for last two decades.

Prof Neil Tolley, from the department of thyroid surgery, Imperial College, attended this workshop as international faculty some three years ago. He was impressed with the way complicated surgeries are conducted in limited resources here, and still top-class results are achieved. He decided to live telecast the surgeries in his college.

“Several ENT, endocrine and surgical oncologists had gathered specially to witness the Chikhaldara magic in London. Prof Tolley was coordinating with Dr Abhishek Vaidya from our team in this live two-way transmission,” Dr Kapre added.

UK doctors were especially impressed to see the technique of cervical epidural anaesthesia, where thyroidectomy is performed while the patient is still awake. This was demonstrated by Dr Vidula Kapre. Dr Madan Kapre demonstrated his unique technique of thyroid surgery. Prof Devendra Mahore, Dr Neeti Kapre and Dr Rajendra Deshmukh ensured smooth running of the operation theatre.

Dr Tulsidas Bhilavekar took responsibility of all post-operative and follow-up care of the patients. Pathology team under the guidance of Prof Sadhana Mahore, anaesthetists Dr Shubha Deshmukh and Dr Pratibha Deshmukh contributed towards the peri-operative management of patients. Eklavya Ekal Vidyalay teachers identified and motivated tribal people to take advantage of this project funded mainly by the state forest department.

Are these Hindus and Sikhs who are coming back Pakistanis? You (Kejriwal) can consider them whatever you want, but they have the same rights here as you and I,” said Shah.Alleging that AAP provoked the minorities and Muslims by telling them that their citizenship would go away, Shah said, “No one will lose their citizenship as CAA aims to grant citizenship. They (AAP) caused riots in Delhi. Didn’t everyone see that? For two days, Delhi was burning. Buses, cars and bikes were all burning. Delhi was in a crossfire. Will Delhi remain safe if these people return to power? No, they are not capable of keeping Delhi safe. Only Modiji can keep Delhi and the country safe.”Speaking at a jan sabha in Delhi Cantonment constituency in the evening, Shah hit back at chief minister Arvind Kejriwal stating that BJP didn’t need to rely on a single “chief ministerial face”. “Do you all want to know who the chief ministerial candidates are? Every voter in Delhi is like a chief ministerial candidate for us. We don’t need to rely on just one face,” he added.Shah was speaking in favour of BJP candidate Manish Singh, a former Armyman. He was accompanied on stage by MP Meenakshi Lekhi.Describing Kejriwal as a roadblock in the development of Delhi, Shah said the CM was stopping the filing of the chargesheet in the “tukde tukde” gang case and he was likely to cause problems even in the Sharjeel Imam case.“This roadblock can be removed if you have us (BJP) in power in the capital. It will be like a briefcase with three digits to open a lock. You have put Modiji in two of the three locks, but the briefcase of development will not open if you put Kejriwal in the third slot,” said Shah.The minister said on February 8, it won’t be an election between different parties, but different ideologies. “On one hand, there is a nationalist party who entered the homes of our enemies.

Ahmedabad: Disappointed with no clear booster measures to revive the slowing economy in the Union Budget, industry experts said that while the budget may help improve long-term demand, there is little short-term relief likely.

Hiranand Saviani, CFO, Astral Polytechnik Ltd along with Sanjay Shah, CEO, Prudent Corporate Advisory Services Ltd, Piruz Khambatta, CMD, Rasna Pvt Ltd and Nitin Parekh, CFO, Zydus Cadila Healthcare Ltd, were present at a panel discussion, ‘Unboxing Budget 2020’, organised by HDFC Bank Spectrum in association with The Times of India, in Ahmedabad on Tuesday. The panel discussion was moderated by Sunil Parekh, senior industry advisor and founding curator of AGS, an initiative of the World Economic Forum.

“The budget doesn’t meet short-term demands in terms of increasing consumption. The industry had expected solid steps to boost consumption. One way of doing this was reducing goods and services tax (GST) rates to make products available at a lower cost to boost consumption, which in turn would have encouraged industry and investment,” said Nitin Parekh. “What has been done in the name of economic development will certainly have fruits, but in the time to come,” he further added.

Shah said, “The NBFC crisis is one big reason for slowing demand. If the NBFC issue was addressed, it would have helped boost consumption.”

Khambatta felt that measures taken in the agriculture sector would certainly benefit FMCG growth.

344,['5/02/2020'],Tharu women learn about poultry to raise their income,"This story is from February 5, 2020

BAREILLY: Central Avian Research Institute ( CARI ) in Bareilly has launched a project for socio-economic uplift of women hailing from the tribal Thuru community by teaching them about rearing poultry. Six Tharu villages of Lakhimpur district have been chosen for the project under the tribal sub-plan of Indian Council for Agriculture Research .

The project is aimed at making women self-reliant. Scientists at CARI have provided chicks and grain to the Tharu women and educated them about scientific ways of rearing the birds. The chicks provided to these women are a cross of native chicken and improved chicken. The project has been introduced at Bela Persua village, Dhakhaini village, Shastripurwa village in Nighasan block and at Persiya village, Saunaha village and Poya village in Palia block of Lakhimpur Kheri district.

Sanjeev Kumar, principal scientist, avian genetics and breeding division, CARI, told TOI, “We first conducted an awareness camp at these villages and found that only a few families had hens, which were left to eat whatever they got. In the second phase, we distributed four- to-five-week-old chicks to women and gave supplements to the beneficiaries so that it would last for four weeks. We told people that it is necessary to give at least 25% supplement to chicks for better productivity. We created awareness among them on scientific ways of rearing chicks and how it can help them in earning more money. We will check the body weight of chicks after a few weeks to see if they are being reared in the right way or not.”

Sandeep Saran, principal scientist, agri-business incubation centre, CARI said, “The agri-business incubation centre will introduce the technology to these beneficiaries for their economic gain. We will encourage them to become entrepreneurs and produce more eggs and chicks by developing low-cost hatcheries.”

Other scientists who are part of this project are Chandradev, principal scientist of the feed processing division, and Divya, principal scientist of the nutrition division.

Laxman Rana, head of Persiya village, said, “Our village is situated on the outskirts of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve and most of the families living here come from poor backgrounds. As CARI has provided a good variety of chicks and explained about methods of rearing poultry, we are hopeful that it will be profitable for tribal women.”

Ganga Devi, one of the beneficiaries and a resident of Persiya village, said, “We are family of five with three small children. We were entirely dependent on farming on a small plot of land but we believe that if we expand poultry farming, we can generate more income.”

HYDERABAD: With Charminar being named among monuments that are most vulnerable to air pollution by the Centre, experts said that acidic gas was primarily responsible for corrosion of the monument.

While cautioning against alarm, Milan Kumar Chauley, superintending archaeologist, ASI, Hyderabad, said, “Lime is essentially calcium, which turns brittle when it reacts to water and pollutants. While lime mortar can last up to 800-1,000 years, its strength diminishes with exposure to nature.”

In Charminar’s case, Chauley said, “The impact of pollutants can be seen on the stucco work and outer layers of the monument where lime has been used exclusively. The lime plaster has peeled off at several places and stucco work has fallen due to pollutants and natural elements.” The main structure itself remains intact, he said. Incidentally, a chunk of lime mortar from the South west minaret fell last year.

Air pollution expert, Sagar Dhara, said acidic gas, such as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, can cause a lot of corrosive on monuments. “If lime is part of the structure, the gas oxidises it, causing blackening and deterioration.” He said that monuments, water bodies, vegetation and even humans’ mucous membrane can get damaged because of oxidisation.

Stating that vehicular pollution remains the primary source of acidic gas in the city, he said burning of garbage and pollutants released from power plants are other major sources. Last year, NOx (oxides of nitrogen) levels near Charminar were the highest in May at 47.8 ug/m3, as per data available with Telangana State Pollution Control Board. Though well within the range of around 80 ug/m3 considered satisfactory in India, Dhara says the figure is high and would be considered so by international standards. “Acidic gas can travel far with the wind, corroding everything on the way,” he said.

The Charminar area saw high levels of particulate matter above 10 microns (PM10) last year. The figures touched 155 ug/m3, higher than 100 ug/m3, which is considered a satisfactory standard. This type of pollutant also comes from industrial and transport sources.

Simplifying the effect of pollutants on heritage structures, conservation architect, SP Anchuri said, “Buildings breathe because they are porous in nature. The superstructure is corroded when pollutants distress monuments. They also decrease the strength of bonding material, leading to cracks.”

Speaking about what can be done to protect our heritage, Anchuri said, “Periodic simulations must be carried out to check the impact of pollutants. Traffic limitations around monuments are necessary and the use of different fuels or non-motorised vehicles may minimize the effect of pollutants that can travel vast distances.”

Representative Image

BAREILLY: A 47-year-old man, a ‘ tantrik ’ (an occultist) hailing from Shahjahanpur , allegedly tricked five women into marriage in different cities and “forced two of them into prostitution”. When one of his wives came to know about his marriage with the other four women, she allegedly committed suicide in Kanpur.

After the tantrik’s first wife, 32, a resident of Mainpuri district, and the third wife from Nigohi lodged a complaint with deputy inspector general of police ( Bareilly range) Rajesh Pandey , the DIG ordered Shahjahanpur senior superintendent of police (SSP) Shivasimpi Channappa to probe the matter and take appropriate action. “It’s a sensitive matter. I have ordered the SSP to take strict action in accordance with the law,” said the DIG.

The accused, who is at large, has been booked under sections 498 (enticing or taking away or detaining with a criminal intent a married woman), 376 (punishment for rape), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and section 495 (marrying someone without disclosing the fact of his second marriage) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Nigohi police station. The two women were sent for a medical examination on Tuesday.

Tantrik’s first wife told TOI, “We got married in 2005 and we have a 10-year-old son. Only a year after the birth of our son, my husband forced me to leave his house and married another woman. Left with no option, I took shelter at my parents' house and lodged a police complaint against my husband.

""However, a few months ago, I came to know about my husband’s third marriage in Nigohi. When I met his wife, she told me that he forced her into prostitution. When we further investigated, we were shocked to learn that he married two more women in Kanpur and one of them (the fourth wife) had committed suicide.”

“After knowing the truth, I contacted other wives of my husband and an FIR was lodged at the Nigohi police station, but police didn’t take any action. Meanwhile, our husband was repeatedly threatening us of serious consequences, forcing us to withdraw the case. This is the reason why we met the DIG in Bareilly. We believe police will arrest my husband and take appropriate action against him,” she added.

Nigohi police station SHO Indrajeet Bhadauria told TOI, “The accused is a tantrik, and doesn’t stay at one place. He is absconding, but we will arrest him soon.”

347,['5/02/2020'],Cancer in India: 1 in 10 Indians to get cancer in lifetime,"NEW DELHI: One in 10 Indian will develop cancer during their life-time and one in 15 Indians will die of cancer, says the World Cancer Report released by World Health Organisation (WHO) which has pointed out “socio-economic inequalities” as a major cause for the rapidly increasing burden of the disease in the country.Lower socio-economic status is associated with oral and cervical cancer while urbanization, improvement in education and increasing disposable income with higher overall socio-economic status are associated with an increasing risk of breast and colo-rectal cancer cases besides such lifestyle-related types.India had an estimated 1.16 million new cancer cases and around 7.84 lakh cancer deaths in 2018. The six most common cancer types are breast, oral, cervical, lung, stomach, and colo-rectal cancer. Together, these accounted for almost half (49%) of all new cancer cases.The report shows over 90% of patients with oral cancer have lower socio-economic status in India because non-awareness about harms of tobacco use is common among these people. Similarly, cervical cancer disproportionately affects women with lower socio-economic status, who have limited access to public health services for prevention and early detection. India accounts for about one fifth of the global burden of cervical cancer, despite decreasing incidence in several regions of the country.On the contrary, incidence of colo-rectal and breast cancer is increasing in the most developed states in India and in urban population.Experts say improvement in socio-economic status and urbanisation have led to sedentary lifestyle, more stress, less of breast-feeding, poor eating habits and higher prevalence of overweight and obesity – all of which are risk factors for breast cancer, colo-rectal cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer.The report also shows households with high socio-economic status spend less on cereals, millets and vegetables and more on beverages, processed foods, dairy products, meat, eggs and fish.IT suggests “highly focused and tailored public health interventions” to target different socio-economic groups to reduce disparities in cancer prevention.The UN agency warned that if current trends continue, the world will see a 60% increase in cancer cases over the next two decades with the biggest increase (an estimated 81%) in new cases in low and middle-income countries, where survival rates are currently the lowest.WHO pointed specifically at low socio-economic status, consumption of tobacco products and poor child and maternal health along with limited health resources for combating infectious diseases as reasons for the rapidly increasing cancer burden. It also stressed on the need for health services to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer.“This is a wake-up call to all of us to tackle the unacceptable inequalities between cancer services in rich and poor countries,” said Ren Minghui, WHO assistant director-general for universal health coverage. “If people have access to primary care and referral systems, cancer can be detected early, treated effectively and cured. Cancer should not be a death sentence for anyone, anywhere.”",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73953303,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-27350,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/1-in-10-indians-to-get-cancer-in-lifetime/articleshow/73947229.cms
348,['5/02/2020'],Sarabhai or CAA? Speculation over cancelled convocation at NID,"AHMEDABAD: Four days before it was to host its 40th convocation, on February 7, the prestigious National Institute of Design (NID) cancelled the event citing ‘unforeseen circumstances’. Miffed students and many faculty members see two possible reasons for the unexpected move: inviting well-known danseuse Mallika Sarabhai — a critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi — as the chief guest; or the fear that the occasion would be used to show solidarity with anti-CAA protesters. At Cept University , a leading planning and architecture institute in Ahmedabad, students had sported black armbands while receiving degrees at the convocation on January 28.Several NID students had participated in the anti-CAA stir in Ahmedabad in December at various venues. Sarabhai was part of some of those events.A graduating student from Bihar, who did not wish to be named, said that students have heard rumours that the event was cancelled because Sarabhai had been invited. “But I personally believe that the authorities did not want a repeat of Cept convocation episode,” the student said. “That could be a big mistake; it could trigger impromptu protests.”The student said that a large number of students are coming to the campus because they did not get the message in time or could not cancel tickets. “This has irked them all,” he said. “While all students are not part of the anti-CAA movement, the cancellation has showed how the institute’s authorities are bending over backwards to ensure that it remains immune to protests.”The authorities informed students about the cancellation of the convocation on Sunday. Tarun Deep Girdhar, the student activity chairperson, mailed the students on Sunday afternoon invoking the ‘unforeseen circumstances.’More than the cancellation of the big event of their lifetime, the abrupt manner of scrapping has angered the students. In all, 318 students were to graduate at the ceremony.In 2016, Sarabhai had criticized the PM for not condoling the death of her mother, Mrinalini Sarabhai, a Padma Vibhushan awardee. Sarabhai wrote a post on Facebook stating: “My dear Prime Minister. You hate my politics and I hate yours. That has nothing to do with what Mrinalini Sarabhai did to promote the culture of this country, to the world over sixty years.”Sarabhai has been a vocal critic of Modi since he became the chief minister of Gujarat in 2001. She had filed a PIL in the high court against the Modi-led state administration over the 2002 riots and had organized protests against the BJP government.The state police had filed a case against Sarabhai for illegal trafficking of Indians to the US, allegedly taking people there as members of her dancing troupe. However, the courts had given a clean chit to her.Praveen Nahar, the NID director, could not be reached for comment. Sarabhai too could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.A few faculty members told TOI that the move was sudden and few knew about it before Monday. “Once, the chief guest was changed because the original invitee could not attend,” said a faculty member. “However, the event was not cancelled.” Accompanied by parents, students come to their alma mater — NID campuses in Gandhinagar and Bengaluru — for their big day, said the faculty member.Students plan to approach the authorities on Wednesday for clarifications. A faculty member said, “In the worst case scenario, the students may get degrees by post.”",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73955082,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-191208,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sarabhai-or-caa-nid-speculates-over-cancelled-convocation/articleshow/73945044.cms

JAIPUR: To expedite construction of Jhotwara elevated road project, the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) will soon initiate the long-pending process to rehabilitate affected property owners.

During an inspection on Tuesday, the Jaipur Development Commissioner (JDC) directed the officials to remove the structures which are hampering construction work. The civic body will shift Fauji Kacchi Basti from the construction site to Anand Lok I constructed under the basic services to urban poor scheme.

According to an official, 17 slabs and 15 piling works are scheduled to be carried out this month. Thirty girders till Ambabari will be installed.

“A review meeting of the project will be held in every 15 days to resolve the issues and expedite the work,” said the official.

Sources in JDA said that 604 structures will be demolished for construction of elevated road. The JDA has proposed to rehabilitate affected shop owners of Jhotwara on the government land situated in Jhotwara Industrial area. The JDA has decided to relocate them to Niwaru Road and Kalwar Road. The 2.3-km Jhotwara elevated road will ease traffic in one of the most congested areas of the city and provide relief to over 6 lakh residents. However, the continuous delay is mounting the problem of the residents as they face long traffic jams daily.

An official source at JDA said, “The foundation stone of the project was laid on July 2 and deadline set for December 2020. Looking at the progress of the project, it looks nearly impossible to meet the deadline. The project is expected to be delayed by a year.”

In 2016-2017 Budget, the BJP government had announced the construction of elevated road to give relief to commuters travelling in Phalna’s Jhotwara region. The project is crucial as the narrow flyover has become a major bottleneck. As no land is available on either side, the JDA is left with no option but to construct an elevated road.

350,['5/02/2020'],Press lotus button to free Delhi from anarchy: PM Modi,"This story is from February 5, 2020

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that February 8 was not a “chhutti” (holiday), but a day to send those who engaged in anti-national politics on leave (rashtra-virodhi rajneeti karne walon ki chhutti karne ka din).

Addressing a rally in Dwarka, Modi urged people to press the lotus button on Saturday to make “Delhi safe”, free it from “anarchy and violence” and turn it into a “21st century word-class capital”.

Taking a dig at AAP, Modi said BJP didn’t believe in working only before polls. “Some begin working just six months before the elections. We start at the beginning itself... Haven’t you seen how fast we are moving (after the 2019 general election victory)?”

In a nearly hour-long speech, Modi mounted an attack on the “ruthless AAP government” for obstructing central schemes meant for the poor, while drawing up a long list of projects that were executed by the Centre and others that were in the pipeline. “No matter what political differences you have, how can anyone even think about obstructing schemes meant for the vulnerable? What vikrit maansikta must they have to do this? Here’s a ruthless government that doesn’t worry about your lives,” he said.

Modi asked if a Delhi resident fell ill outside the city, would AAP move a mohalla clinic there to treat that person.

Modi also blamed Delhi government for delaying work on Metro’s Phase IV.

He said Delhi needed a government that empowered the nation and “stands by our brave soldiers” and not ones “who weaken us and give an opportunity through their statements to our enemies to target us”. Seeking support on issues of “national interest”, such as CAA and Article 370 abrogation in J&K, the PM said: “For selfish motives and appeasement, they (opposition) are instigating people. These people can weep for terrorists of Batla House. They can raise questions over our security forces, but can’t develop Delhi”. He added: “Delhi can’t be developed by vote-bank politics, of hate and wrong intentions.”

The PM said that the next decade would belong to India and its progress would depend on the decisions taken now. He projected the elections as a fight between decisive and obstructive sides, adding that Delhi needed a government that gave it “direction” and not excuses.

Modi credited the Centre with regularising 1,700-odd colonies and promised that a separate board would be set up for their holistic development. He said the Centre had developed modern infrastructure in form of peripheral expressways and Delhi-Meerut Expressway, apart from setting several projects in motion like rapid railways, metro expansion, and so on.

In an indirect swipe at AAP, the PM said: “They use indecent words for police while we honour 33,000 martyrs by setting up a memorial. We are working on creating a one-nation-one-ration-card to help Delhi’s poor. Yaha ration card banwane ko lekar kaisi kaisi samasya thi, I don’t even want to talk about them.”

He claimed that the Centre had transferred over Rs 10,000 crore to people of Delhi through various schemes.

BAREILLY: The health department on Tuesday evening collected samples of three people who are suspected to have contracted novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019). Two suspected patients are from Bareilly and one from Pilibhit . The samples will be sent to a laboratory in Lucknow.Of the two suspected cases whose samples have been taken in Bareilly, one person is a city-based industrialist who returned from China on January 12. Officials said another person, who is a native of a village under Sheeshgarh police station in Bareilly district, is a farmer in New Zealand and returned to India on January 17. His flight had a changeover in China. Similarly, a 55-year-old woman from Pilibhit’s Puranpur had travelled to Canada but she had to switch her flight in China.According to officials, the state government had provided a list of 47 persons to the health department in Bareilly who had returned from China in the last one month. When rapid response team constituted to deal with novel coronavirus contacted these 47 persons, it found that a few people were out of station while two persons were suffering from fever and cough.Additional chief medical officer, Bareilly, Dr Ranjan Gautam, said, “According to the guidelines of World Health Organization and health ministry, we have collected samples of two persons who travelled to China and had fever.

KOLKATA: If you have a three-cottah plot and want to build a house on an area not exceeding 500 square metres, get hold of an architect or a licensed building surveyor (LBS) who will be empowered to sanction plans for the building under a special civic scheme.

Sources in the Kolkata Municipal Corporation buildings department said civic authorities will officially recognize the credibility of a section of architects or LBSs who have never been booked for flouting rules.

Initially, the department bosses have decided to select 20 architects and 20 LBSs who will be empowered to sanction building plans under a special KMC plan. This will offer relief to land owners and a section of real estate developers from unnecessary hassles.

After series of discussions, the buildings department’s top brass will go through records of architects and LBSs empanelled with the civic body. “We have chosen the architects and LBSs based on their performance. They were evaluated based on whether they had ever faltered in ensuring a completion certificate for their clients in the last three years,” said a KMC building department official.

Once names of these 40 architects and LBS are notified, land owners or promoters want to avail a special KMC plan where instead of depending on the KMC building department, an architect or LBS could approve sanction of building plans in 30 days, could get hold of anyone of them and apply for sanction of their building plans.

A KMC official said the credibility of an architect or LBS depended on getting a completion certificate (CC) of an under-construction building from the buildings department to ensure that flat or land owners were entitled to all civic amenities like water supply, drainage connections provided by the KMC borough offices. “We often get flooded with complaints that without taking a CC, a promoter sells the flats, leaving flat owners in the lurch. Without a valid CC, we can’t offer water or drainage connections to a building,” an official said.

JAIPUR: Improper planning of the greenfield airport project by Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) has left many farmers near Shivdaspura area in the lurch.

Nearly two years ago, JDA had planned to acquire 2,094 hectares in 20 villages for the airport. Following the announcement, JDA had imposed a ban on land conversion and issuing of lease deeds in Shivdaspura. This has inconvenienced thousands of land owners who are not able to utilise their own land.

Former zila parishad member Ashok Mehta said, “The project is far from reality as there is no formal permission from the Airports Authority of India (AAI). The owners of the land in these villages cannot utilise their own land for other purposes.”

Farmers said in the city’s master plan 2025, these villages have been earmarked as a special area. The land use of these villages will be decided on the directions of the state government.

Ajay Singh, a land owner said, “After the change in regime, we submitted a memorandum to CM Ashok Gehlot but nothing has been done till date. For the past many years, the district lease committee (DLC) rates of the area have not increased. Farmers alleged that in Lok Sabha, civil aviation minister had replied that no airport was proposed in Shivdaspura. Still, the land was kept reserved.”

In 2018, the developers and locals had also submitted a memorandum to the Urban Housing and Development (UDH) department to regularise their land as the new airport still remained on papers. However, the developers were stumped after advocate general (AG) and committee constituted by the then UDH minister Shrichand Kriplani recommended state government not to regularise the reserve land.

“As per Section 54 (B) of Jaipur Development Authority Act, 1982 , there is a provision that land reserved for any project cannot be regularised even if it is not acquired. This was recommended by the AG and the committee constituted by the minister. The committee also mentioned that high court has banned regularisation of such land,” said an official.

357,['5/02/2020'],Devotees protest after BMC seals marriage hall of Banke Bihari temple for not paying taxs,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Bareilly: Committee members of Banke Bihari temple in Rajendra Nagar staged a dharna on Tuesday, after the tax department of Bareilly Municipal Corporation (BMC) sealed the rear portion of the temple’s complex, a portion of which is used for commercial activities. The tax arrears of the complex amount to around Rs 60 lakh.

According to information from BMC officials, as soon as the team reached the spot and sealed the area, which is leased out for hosting weddings, scores of temple committee members gathered and staged a dharna near the premises.

Vipin Kuldeep, the zonal officer of BMC’s tax department, told TOI, “There is a space at the rear of Banke Bihari temple that is leased to wedding parties. Although spiritual places such as temples and mosques are exempted from paying tax, if a portion is used for commercial purposes, it becomes taxable. The wedding hall has tax arrears of around Rs 60 lakh for several years. Therefore, tax department sealed the place on Tuesday.”

Around 400 people, including temple committee members and devotees, gathered at the temple premises and sat on dharna against BMC’s move. Agitators also alleged the BMC team had misbehaved with people opposing the move.

The zonal officer retorted, “Protesters tried to create a ruckus, raised slogans against BMC for sealing the property and were demanding we remove the seal. Legal action was initiated after we were given directions by senior corporation officials for the same.”

Speaking to TOI, Bareilly municipal commissioner Abhishek Anand said, “The civic body has intensified its action against tax defaulters in the city, and have been regularly cracking down on those who have tax arrears. The space at the rear of the temple is being used for commercial activities, and has tax dues pending for several years. Though the seal has been temporarily removed, the concerned people have been directed to clear the dues at the earliest. If they fail to pay up, action will be taken.”

Representative image

JAIPUR: JMC has started its Material Recovery Facility (MRF) at Mathuradaspura landfill site where the waste collected by ragpickers will be recycled.

Under the project, uniforms and identity cards are being given to the ragpickers. Around 200 of them have already started working with the centre.

At the centres, JMC will purchase the waste collected by the ragpickers, who won’t have to travel to the city for the purpose.

Another MRF centre will soon be established at Sewapura landfill site.

Executive project engineer Banne Singh said the project has been designed keeping in mind the contribution of ragpickers in recycling and plastic waste disposal. “Right now these ragpickers are collecting plastic which can be sold to the dealers at higher rates. They usually collect plastic items which are big in size or heavy. They do not collect glass bottles, shoe soles or tyres. At the MRF centres, all kinds of dry waste will be accepted and ragpickers will be paid on the spot. This will also save time spent in travelling to the city and rule out middlemen,” said Banne Singh.

The MRF centres will be run by NGO Sarthak. This is the same NGO that has done similar work in Indore which ranked No. 1 in the country in Swachhta Survekshan 2020.

The MRF centres will have bailing machines, fatka machines and shredding machines that will minimize the size of the waste. “The bailing machines will compress the waste material in a sheet. Fatka machines will pack the waste in one packet and shredding machines will shred the plastic into small pieces. The plastic shreds can be utilised in cement sector. Machines have been purchased and they will start functioning soon. They will make our work easier,” Banne Singh added.

Moreover, medical camps will be organised for ragpickers to protect them from any diseases caused due to working with garbage.

Jaipur: Fire tenders rushed to Malaviya National Institute of Technology ( MNIT ) after receiving information of fire inside its campus on Tuesday morning. The incident occurred around 6.30am when a pile of garbage in the campus caught fire.

Around five fire tenders rushed to the spot and after around one-and-a-half hours of struggle, they were able to control the fire. The cause of fire is not yet known but some MNIT staffers claimed that it was caused due to accumulation of piles of garbage in the campus. Nandlal Kumawat, head of the non-teaching staff at MNIT said that for years, garbage is not being disposed of properly, and is being dumped inside the campus.

“Due to years of accumulation, the rear end of the campus looks like a landfill site. The place where garbage caught fire is situated near the non-teaching staff quarters. This would have been dangerous for us but the institute is not paying attention to it. There are 5,000 students studying at MNIT and last year, many students were found positive for dengue. Authorities should start focusing on the issue,” said Nandlal.

The authorities at MNIT, however, said that the cause of fire is not yet known.

NAGPUR: Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) declared results for CA Foundation exam on Monday and as per the latest information provided by some local coaching institutes, the Nagpur chapter of ICAI has at least nine students in the top 50 list.

Since no official merit list is declared, the top three spots keep changing as per information coming in from local coaching institutes. Though TOI on Tuesday wrote about Tanvi Agrawal (AIR 25), who still continues to hold on to the top position in the Nagpur chapter, there are changes to the number two and three slots. Saachi Jaipuriya (AIR 30) and Akshat Agrawal (AIR 38) now join Tanvi to make the top three.

Speaking to TOI, Jaipuriya said “I was consistent at my studies and revised all the concepts on a regular basis. I tried my best to not get distracted while studying. I practiced the habit of not checking my phone and tried to stay away from social media.” Akshat Agrawal said “Time management is an essential factor that helped me prepare for my exams. Besides, I kept revising the notes on a regular basis and solved the mock test papers from the official cite. ICI Module helped me in preparation for the exams. Accounts and economics were a bit difficult whereas subjects like maths and law were easy to solve.” Saachi and Akshat’s guide from VPA institute, CA Vipul Vora said, “Question papers were above average but students with conceptual clarity could easily crack the examination.”

The next Chartered AccountantsFoundation Course exam will be held in the month of May. Candidates are advised to check dates depending on the format (new or old syllabus) they are appearing for.

362,['5/02/2020'],"Second rally in two days, PM Modi focuses on national issues","This story is from February 5, 2020

NEW DELHI: “Desh badla, ab Dilli badlo” — so goes BJP’s election pitch. With the party going to polls without naming a chief ministerial face, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the second of his election rallies on Tuesday, sought to strike a chord with the public on national issues.

The two rallies on successive days were also aimed at energising the party cadre. The Dwarka event was targeted at 20 assembly constituencies of West and South West Delhi. All the 20 candidates held lotus-shaped placards in their hands as they shared the stage with the PM. Local MPs Ramesh Bidhuri and Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma were also present.

Verma, having served a 48-hour ban for a provocative speech, raked up Pakistan yet again and attacked chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. “It is being alleged that we are making this election communal. I want to ask why the CM gave salaries to imams and assistants of mosques. He is reading Hanuman Chalisa now, but he wore a skull cap for five years... With defeat imminent, he (Kejriwal) is now remembering Hanuman Chalisa,” he said.

He added: “For five years, he kept saying LG and PM were not allowing him to work. Has Pakistan allowed him to work in the last six months?”

Bidhuri said he wanted to respond to Kejriwal’s question on who the CM face of BJP would be. “BJP has thousands of CM faces, but Kejriwal should ask why he has not made a single new school or college,” he said.

Chants of “Bharat Mata Ki Jai”, “Jai Shri Ram” and “Modi” rang in the air even as the different speakers took turns to woo voters. Speaking immediately after the PM arrived, BJP national president JP Nadda attacked AAP for not fulfilling its promises. “This is such a unique election where our competitors are using unadulterated lies in their campaigns. They failed on all their promises and have now found a new way of campaigning. Instead of carrying out jan sabhas where people can ask them questions, they are taking out roadshows,” he said.

Considering Dwarka’s proximity to Haryana border, Dushyant Chautala, deputy CM of the neighbouring state, was also present.

364,['5/02/2020'],‘Reintroduce bill for proper utilisation of SC/ST resources’,"This story is from February 5, 2020

JAIPUR: Civil society groups have asked CM Ashok Gehlot to reintroduce the Rajasthan Scheduled Castes Sub-plan and Tribal Sub-plan Bill 2013 for ensuring proper planning, allocation and utilisation of financial resources meant for the SC and ST groups in the state.

Social activist Aruna Roy’s SR Abhiyan held a workshop here presenting a revised draft of the bill. The groups have demanded that announcement of the bill be made in the state budget.

The bill was introduced by Gehlot in 2013 but before it could be tabled his government, lost the polls the same year.

Nesar Ahmed of Budget Analysis and Research Centre Trust (BARCT) said after the central government and the state stopped the plan and non-plan classification of the budget, it resulted into inffective implementation of SC and TSP schemes.

“It has also become difficult to track schemes and one has to rely on the nodal department reporting made by the department concerned on the implementation of the schemes. The Act will make it mandatory for all the departments to spend budgetary allocation according to the norms and also ensures proper monitoring mechanism as suggested in the draft bill,” said Ahmed.

Underlining the importance of the Act, Ahmed said the state cannot achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) until the vulnerable groups like SCs and STs are mainstreamed.

Dalit activist Bhanwar Meghwanshi said in the light of changes in the budget, it has become apparent for them to bring a law. “We will start a state-wide campaign to press for our demands to bring an effective law. In the absence of the law, the budgetary allocation for SC and TSP is losing its relevance and impact. Soon our delegation will meet Gehlot to remind him of the bill introduced by him in 2013,” said Meghwanshi.

Mukesh Goswami of SR Abhiyan informed that similar act are present in four states and government should introduced it as soon as possible.

TimesView There are penalties laid down in the rule book for cars that have been parked illegally; damaging them while trying to tow them away is not part of those rules. Towing van staff should be careful while going about their job.

KOLKATA: Facing a repair estimate of Rs 80,000 for his damaged sedan, Baruipur film-maker Sanchayan Chakraborty on Tuesday shuttled between the repair workshop off EM Bypass and the Bidhannagar police headquarters, seeking reimbursement. Chakraborty’s insurance company has, prima facie, made it clear that he will not be reimbursed as the vehicle was damaged while being towed away by police from a no-parking zone. Chakraborty has urged them to reconsider their decision.Chakraborty, in his complaint to the police on Monday, said he had parked the car behind Bidyut Bhavan in Salt Lake’s DJ Block around 4.15pm and gone to the book fair. Around 7.45pm, when Chakraborty and his friend, Palash Haq, returned, they found the car was missing. They were informed by the Karunamoyee police outpost that the sedan had been towed away by cops. They found the car on the road in CJ Block, but its front portion was severely damaged.TOI sought an estimate from an expert who said, it would cost Rs 70,000-Rs 80,000 to repair the damage . “The front bumper, hood, grill, moulding, radiator, condenser and bumper beam need to be replaced. These will cost approximately Rs 80,000,” the expert said.Chakraborty alleged that when he went to the Bidhannagar East police station to lodge a complaint, an officer told him to pass it off as an accident. “I was told that if I lodged an accident complaint, I would be provided with an accident report, which, in turn, will allow me to claim compensation for damages. I refused,” he said. A senior officer said police will investigate if they receive a formal complaint.Cops, till now, have refused to shoulder any responsibility for the damage. “According to the Motor Vehicles Act, if any car is parked unattended in the no-parking zone, obstructing traffic, cops are authorized to tow it away. However, at times, the car may suffer damage during towing. Something similar might have happened in this case, but it was, after all, the car owner’s fault as he had parked in a no-parking zone,” an officer said.Negligent towing of vehicles is not uncommon in the city where people find designated parking spaces in prime areas, such as those around the book fair full on days like a holiday. Apart from damage to the vehicles, absence of a system to alert owners of the vehicles being towed away by the police compounds the matter further, an officer said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73955604,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-139748,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/car-tow-row-insurance-co-refuses-to-pay-for-damage-police-blame-owner/articleshow/73945095.cms

367,['5/02/2020'],Indian assault rifle giving stiff competition to latest Russian AK,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Nagpur: Even as the AK-203, the latest version of the dreaded Kalashnikov rifle, will be made in India in collaboration with the Russians, a comparable fully indigenous rifle has also been developed, and is already in use. The Indian weapon will be on display at the Defence Expo in Lucknow starting February 5. Known as the Trichy Assault Rifle ( TAR ), after Ordnance Factory Tiruchirapally (OFT), where it is made, the Indian rifle claims to be at par in terms of functionality with the Kalashnikov.

Information gathered by TOI says the AK-203 has an added feature of Picatiny rails, which can be used to fix reflexer or laser designator. Sources say the rails can be put in TAR too, and are basically add-ons. The TAR, which is made of solid metal, is also fundamentally said to be sturdier than the AK-203, which is made of sheet metal. Lately, there has been a shift to solid body in rifles in other countries too, said sources.

The AK-203 will be made at Ordnance Factory Korwa in Uttar Pradesh’s Amethi district by Indo Russian Rifle Private Limited (IRRPL), for the Indian army. The IRRPL, which is a joint venture between Russia’s Kalashnikov Concern and the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), has a mandate to make over 7 lakh rifles. The agreement is an outcome of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Russia last year.

Now as an inter-government deal has been struck between Russia and India, the Army would be going ahead with the Kalashnikovs. TAR, on the other hand, is being pushed for the paramilitary forces, which are already buying it. The deal gives a major boost Russia’s Kalashnikov Concern for entering the Indian market. OFB sees the TAR as the means to regain its trust, which it lost over the Insas rifle. OFB, which had drawn flak over its plan to corporatize the set up as a revamp move, is hoping to continue with orders from the paramilitary, with even the AK-203 being manufactured parallelly.

The production is to start in a year, as OFT has already begun making the TAR. This year, the factory has an order for nearly 40,000 pieces from the central paramilitary forces coming under the ministry of home affairs (MHA). CRPF is the major buyer.

A comparative analysis using data accessed by TOI shows that TAR, AK-47, and AK-203 have the same rate of fire at 600 rounds a minute, and muzzle velocity of 700 to 715m/s. All the three rifles can hit up to an effective range of over 350 meters.

The range depends on the length of the barrel and calibre of ammunition. The three guns have a barrel length of 415mm and use ammunition of 7.62x39 mm calibre. The ammunition will be made at the Ordnance Factory Warangaon, near Bhusawal, and will also be used for the AK-203 after it is inducted in the Army.

The range also meets the Army’s specifications for the assault rifle it needs, said sources. Even the picatiny rails that are in the AK-203, are being put in TAR on the basis of orders, a source said.

TAR was also offered to the Army initially, which had reverted with demand for a few corrections, said sources requesting anonymity. In the meantime, the gun was accepted by the paramilitary forces. TAR is now set to replace the Bulgarian AK-47 made by Arsenal Joint Stock Company, from where the paramilitary has been mainly sourcing its rifles.

Over 15,000 rounds were fired to test the TAR’s life cycle and over 2,400 for reliability, said sources. The trials were carried out at the CRPF Academy in Gurgaon after which a final approval was given. With more orders in sight, the ordnance factory is planning to increase production capacity at Tiruchirapally.

After the Army rejected the 5.56 Insas rifle, which was also used during the Kargil war, OFB preferred to eye paramilitary forces instead, said sources. Apart from operational issues reported in the Insas, the Army did not prefer it because Insas having a smaller ammunition of 5.56mm did not have the lethality, It would rather injure the enemy than kill.

Earlier, the Army had preferred the 5.56mm ammunition going by the theory that an injured enemy is of more use than a dead one. Later, considering the requirement in counter-insurgency areas, it was decided to have the 7.26mm round for which TAR was made.

Porvorim: Opposition MLAs are set to ask for a 30-minute discussion on the financial status of the state in the ongoing budget session of the Goa legislative assembly as they feel the state is on a borrowing spree and has entered a debt trap.

While they tried to bring up the topic during Question Hour on Tuesday, it could not be highlighted in totality due to paucity of time. The question, tabled by Goa Forward Party (GFP) MLA Jayesh Salgaonkar, came up for discussion a few minutes before Question Hour ended.

Later, speaking to reporters, opposition members said that they have been provided with different figures on the total debt of the state. “After studying various replies pertaining to state finances, we realised that we have been given different answers to the same question,” said opposition leader Digambar Kamat. “In one reply, the debt is Rs 20,412 crore; in another, liability has been shown as Rs 16,000 crore,” he said.

Kamat said the reply given to his question shows borrowings for 2019-20 to be Rs 1,767.8 crore, but to a question by Ponda MLA Ravi Naik, the figure for the same period was shown to be Rs 2,148.9 crore. The difference in the two figures, he said, could only be explained by the chief minister.

He further pointed out that revenue receipts are of Rs 8,475 crore and revenue expenditure Rs 8,100 crore, a surplus of Rs 375 crore. “The logical question is this, if there is a surplus, why is the government borrowing? It indicates that the figures are fudged,” he said.

GFP president Vijai Sardesai said that as per a reply given to the opposition, the capital expenditure was shown as Rs 859 crore, but it was actually spent on paying salaries. “This is blatantly illegal,” said Sardesai. “We wanted to expose the government today.”

He further pointed out that figures available with them show that the state has only Rs 400 crore to run the government till the financial year ends in March, but it has to pay Rs 767 crore to various contractors.

Salgaonkar pointed out that Goa’s share of Union taxes and duties has reduced drastically. It dropped from Rs 3,330 crore to Rs 2,480 crore, he said.

Of the losses, Lourenco said only around Rs 4 crore has been recovered

PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant , who also holds the mines portfolio, told the Goa legislative assembly on Tuesday that 42 mining companies would be sent notices within a month for recovery of mining losses.

Sawant was responding to charges by Congress MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco during question hour.

“We will recover all mining losses as early as possible,” said Sawant. “Nobody will be spared. Notices to 42 mining companies will be issued within a month.”

Lourenco said BJP used to be in the forefront to accuse Congress of illegal mining, but that BJP itself has done nothing to recover the mining losses, pegged at Rs 35,000 crore by the Justice M B Shah commission report.

Lourenco said that the government has so far been able to only recover Rs 3.99 crore, and wanted to know when the total losses would be recovered. A committee of 16 chartered accountants appointed by former chief minister Manohar Parrikar had estimated the total loss to the state government on account of illegal mining at Rs 1,200 crore.

Lourenco had sought to know the total loss in revenue Goa suffered as a result of illegal mining.

While declining to reveal figures of mining losses, Sawant said that an exact number would be known once the SIT concludes its investigation. The investigations would be fast-tracked, Sawant said.

Nine cases were registered against various persons and companies for their alleged role in illegal mining, and there has been an acquittal in one case. Sawant said a revision petition has already been filed in the high court against the acquittal.

However, he declined to disclose names of persons and companies involved, since investigations are yet to be completed.

Temple committee members and devoteese sit on a dharna near the temple premises in Rajendra Nagar in Bareilly ... Read More

BAREILLY: Committee members of Banke Bihari temple in Rajendra Nagar staged a dharna on Tuesday, after the tax department of Bareilly Municipal Corporation ( BMC ) sealed the rear portion of the temple’s complex, a portion of which is used for commercial activities. The tax arrears of the complex amount to around Rs 60 lakh.

According to information from BMC officials, as soon as the team reached the spot and sealed the area, which is leased out for hosting weddings, scores of temple committee members gathered and staged a dharna near the premises.

Vipin Kuldeep, the zonal officer of BMC’s tax department, told TOI, “There is a space at the rear of Banke Bihari temple that is leased to wedding parties. Although spiritual places such as temples and mosques are exempted from paying tax, if a portion is used for commercial purposes, it becomes taxable. The wedding hall has tax arrears of around Rs 60 lakh for several years. Therefore, tax department sealed the place on Tuesday.”

Around 400 people, including temple committee members and devotees, gathered at the temple premises and sat on dharna against BMC’s move. Agitators also alleged the BMC team had misbehaved with people opposing the move.

The zonal officer retorted, “Protesters tried to create a ruckus, raised slogans against BMC for sealing the property and were demanding we remove the seal. Legal action was initiated after we were given directions by senior corporation officials for the same.”

Speaking to TOI, Bareilly municipal commissioner Abhishek Anand said, “The civic body has intensified its action against tax defaulters in the city, and have been regularly cracking down on those who have tax arrears. The space at the rear of the temple is being used for commercial activities, and has tax dues pending for several years. Though the seal has been temporarily removed, the concerned people have been directed to clear the dues at the earliest. If they fail to pay up, action will be taken.”

The Chingrighata crossing will see a surge in traffic once the Metro station starts operation

KOLKATA: The state government is planning a detailed traffic management masterplan for EM Bypass, with special focus on the Chingrighata crossing and other spots where Metro stations are being set up.

A day-long joint survey was conducted by senior officials of KMDA , RVNL, officers of Kolkata traffic police and bridge experts at the Metro construction sites on EM Bypass.

IIT, Kharagpur , has been engaged to prepare a road map for proper traffic dispersal around Chingrighata, the most important crossings on EM Bypass. A Metro station and the proposed flyover will make the crossing busier.

Officials said the main focus of Tuesday’s survey was to check if the Metro pillars were obstructing the EM Bypass carriageway in any way. “The priority are the locations of the Metro pillars being set up on EM Bypass as they occupy considerable space, resulting in traffic congestion. Besides, with the Metro stations slated to start operations soon, there will be a huge surge of both pedestrian and vehicular traffic. So, a detailed traffic management plan must be kept ready once the stations start operating,” an official said.

A foot overbridge near Dhapa crossing, a vehicle underpass near Captain bheri and a small flyover from the Chingrighata crossing to Hyatt More have been proposed to deal with the surge. KMDA is also working on a proposal to set up a flyover from Captain bheri to New Town via Chingrighata and Sector V.

A foot overbridge is being constructed at Chingrihata crossing. In future, the existing Chingrighata flyover is likely to be razed.

Tiger poaching accused

CHANDRAPUR: Five more persons were arrested on Monday evening in connection with the poaching of tiger in Saoli range last month.

The accused were produced before the court of judicial magistrate first class at Saoli on Tuesday and remanded in judicial custody . With this, total number of arrests in the case has now reached 12.

The poaching was carried out around a month back and it was not clear whether the animal killed was leopard or tiger. However, the whiskers and paw recovered from the poachers suggested that the animal was a tiger. The accused had laid electrified wire in the forest near Kapsi village and the tiger was electrocuted in compartment no. 201.

Forest department had earlier arrested Suresh Gedam and Ramesh Bhoyar and detained a juvenile. They had also recovered bones of the poached animal. Investigation revealed that the accused were habitual poachers involved in herbivore killing.

However, during one such endeavour, a tiger was electrocuted. The accused had confessed to poaching the feline in the last week of December. Later four more accused were arrested.

The five arrested on Monday include Bapu Bhoyar, Madgu Sakhare, Manohar Kosre, Devaji Gedam and Angadas Sakhare. All belong to Kapsi village.

4 detained for poaching leopards, bears

Meanwhile, forest officials of Bhadrawati range have detained four suspects in connection with poaching of two leopards and two bears in DSC Colony area of Chanda Ordnance Factory.

The poachers had laid electrified wire for poaching wild herbivores, but pairs of leopards and sloth bears were killed due to electrocution. Their carcasses were recovered on January 1.

Sources claimed that officials had started searching for the suspects with the help of CCTV footage. They had zeroed in on two suspects from Piparbodi village and two others from Bhadrawati town. All four were detained for questioning on Tuesday, sources in the department said.

NEW DELHI: After scanning the mobile phone and the laptop of Sharjeel Imam , arrested on sedition charges , the Crime Branch has claimed that the plan to block Shaheen Bagh and Jamia Millia Islamia was hatched on December 3 when the JNU student and some of his associates started chalking out the routes that could be blocked to cause a chakka jam.

The cops have found some pamphlets on Sharjeel’s phone regarding plans to stall traffic in different parts of Delhi for the injustice done to the Muslim community by demolishing Babri Masjid, an officer alleged. The pamphlets also reportedly mentioned that people who would not figure in the list made under the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) would be sent to detention centres.

Sharjeel claimed to have said that the pamphlets were to be sent only on WhatsApp groups of different universities. Police have allegedly found that these were designed just two days before the violence broke out on December 15 in relation to CAA. He would also be questioned regarding his role in the violence, a source said.

It has been found that the pamphlets were shared on two groups, the members of which are being identified. The content of the chat on these groups are being analysed. These were also shared through the Facebook messenger and emails, a source claimed. Police will question Sharjeel’s close friends with whom he had shared the plan.

Sharjeel told the cops that none of the posters was distributed physically and the recipients were asked to forward it only to relevant groups. The pamphlets also had fabricated figures about the deaths in Assam during the anti-CAA protests, the source claimed.

The JNU PhD scholar, who is in the Crime Branch custody, will be separately interrogated for his role in all cases of violence reported in Delhi between December 15 and 20, a source said.

The anti-CAA activist, who was on the run after sedition charges were slapped on him in five states for allegedly making inflammatory statements, was arrested from Bihar’s Jehanabad district on January 28.

PANAJI: The Ponda approach ramp and the Panaji arm of the Atal Sethu project, which have been delayed by over a year, are nearing completion, chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Tuesday. The project is expected to be complete on February 29, he said.

Sawant also informed the legislative assembly that while the contract to construct the cable-stayed bridge was awarded for Rs 403 crore, Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation has spent Rs 546.8 crore on the project.

The final cost of the project, however, will be known once the work is completed and the final bill is approved. “The final bill is not yet prepared as this work is not declared as complete,” Sawant said in his written response to a question raised by Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte.

Sawant said the expenditure finance committee granted a sanction for Rs 517 crore, which includes contingency costs and consultancy fees, for the 5.14 km long structure.

HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB) has decided to call for tenders to conduct a detailed study of the quality of air, water and other pollution issues plauging Greater Vishakapatnam.

The study has gained significance in the wake of Andhra Pradesh government’s decision to shift the state’s administrative capital from Amaravati to Vishakapatnam.

APPCB member secretary, Vivek Yadav, told TOI that as the pollution levels are high in certain areas in Vishakapatnam due to the presence of port and industries, and usage of coal, a detailed study has been taken up.

“APPCB is floating tenders to finalise an agency to conduct the study. The study will cover all sorts of pollution including surface water, groundwater, marine and air. A detailed study will be done on all environment-related issues in Greater Vizag and the agency will come out with an action plan. This action plan would cover both short term and long term objectives,” Yadav said.

He added, “Vizag has been one of the polluted cities for the last few years. The bowl-shaped area from Yerada to Dolphin Nose records more pollution, specially during winter. Several industries and the port is concentrated along this coast.”

Speaking about the factors contributing to the spike in pollution levels, he said, “ The city has been expanding and SEZ and pharma city have come up. We should have an action plan to mitigate the pollution as Vishakapatnam is one of the largest cities in Andhra Pradesh.” The Air Quality Index Vishakapatnam on Feburay 4 is 68, according to the Central Pollution Control Board and was deemed satisfactory.

379,['5/02/2020'],Instagram handle owner seeks settlement with artist Subodh Gupta,"This story is from February 5, 2020

NEW DELHI: An anonymous Instagram handle that had posted sexual harassment allegations against artist Subodh Gupta on Tuesday offered to seek an amicable settlement with him.

The owner of the Instagram account ‘ Herdsceneand ’, through counsel, submitted before the Delhi high court that sh/e was exploring if the dispute with Gupta — who has filed a defamation suit asking for Rs 5 crore in damages — could be settled out of court and sought a week’s time.

Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw had, on the last date of hearing, asked the holder of the account to clarify if sh/e wanted to represent only the anonymous 'victim' (who has claimed sexual harassment by Gupta) or all such persons who have used the platform offered by the account to level charges against other men.

Appearing for the artist, advocate Neoma Vasdev said his client’s reputation has been damaged but he is willing to wait and see what the other party has in mind by way of a resolution, prompting the HC to grant a week’s time.

The 'victim' has not yet been arrayed as a party in the case while the identity of the person running the Instagram account, which published allegations against several men in the wake of #MeToo movement, has been kept secret on the court’s directions for the time being.

The HC order, seeking clarification on where the account holder stands in the defamation suit, came after the holder earlier revealed sh/e is only a “whistleblower” and has not been harassed by Gupta. The person said the handle is only a neutral platform intended to bring out instances of sexual misconduct and harassment in the art fraternity, as part of the #MeToo movement.

Justice Endlaw took a dim view of this revelation, pointing out that a “ghost” can’t be allowed to have a “superghost”.

The account holder had also stated that in the absence of an internal committee to deal with such instances, the victims of sexual harassment wrote to it about their personal experiences, knowing that the anonymity offered by the platform would protect them from retaliation in the hands of influential members of the art fraternity. The HC, however, had disagreed, noting, “On one side you reveal the other person's identity but you do not want to reveal your identity.” It underlined that Gupta has the right to know who is levelling the allegations since the other party has not initiated any legal proceedings.

Gupta had filed a defamation suit against ‘Herdsceneand’ and others last year, following the publication of anonymous sexual harassment allegations against him.

Nagpur: Underworld don Arun Gawli has once again knocked the judiciary’s doors for seeking parole of 45 days, this time for attending his ailing wife Asha. Earlier, he had sought leave for looking after his old mother, who later passed away.

A division bench comprising justices Pradeep Deshmukh and Pushpa Ganediwala on Tuesday issued notices to state government and other respondents asking them to reply within two weeks.

The gangster-cum-politician had moved the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court through counsel Mir Nagman Ali praying for grant of the parole. Earlier, his application for parole was rejected by the divisional commissioner on the grounds that his presence many led to law and order situation in Mumbai, after which he moved HC .

The noted gangster was convicted for murder of Shiv Sena MLA Kamalakar Jamsandekar on August 3, 2012 along with 11 others and was awarded rigorous life imprisonment.

He was first released on parole on May 5, 2015, and then on furlough on April 13, 2016. He was again set off on parole on October 21 in same year and on furlough on April 2017.

Last year also, the HC had granted furlough to Gawli in March.

All five times, the Mumbai don reported back before the deadline for surrendering before the jail authorities, Ali said.

KOLKATA: Railway minister Piyush Goyal will unveil the East-West Metro on February 13 but you will get to ride the swanky coaches the day after, on Valentine’s Day.On February 14, the trains will chug out of Sector V and Salt Lake Stadium stations at 8am. The ticket counters will open at 7.45am. The last trains from both the stations will leave at 8pm and ticket counters will close at 7.55pm. This will also be the general schedule that will be followed for the curtailed 5km services. Sunday services will start late, though. The first trains will start at noon but the closing time will remain the same — 8pm.Initially, it was decided that commuters will be able to avail themselves of East-West services on February 13 itself, immediately after the inauguration. But officials said the inauguration ceremony on February 13 may commence in the afternoon and not in the morning as was planned earlier, when the authorities had prepared the schedule for a December launch.Initially, Metro will run 37 pairs of services between Salt Lake Sector V and Salt Lake Stadium. Trains will run at an interval of 20 minute initially but the frequency may be tweaked depending on footfall and demand. Of the 11 BEML rakes that are in Metro’s possession now, two would be used for daily services while a third will be kept on standby. The rakes used will not be the same every day. Of the 11 rakes, about six have been fitted with necessary equipment till now. All of them will be tried out on a rotational basis.“We will have 18 motormen who have been trained in Bengaluru. They have also received training in Hyderabad about the Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) system. They are now fully adept at aligning trains with the platform screen doors at stations. On Sundays, we shall start services from noon. There will be 25 pairs of services on Sundays but this can change depending on demand. It takes 13 minutes to complete the journey from Salt Lake Sector V to Salt Lake Stadium. So two rakes will be sufficient to operate along the stretch. One rake will be kept on standby,” said a senior official of Metro Railway .The first phase will cover six swank elevated stations. Central Park is the only single-floor station where the platform and the concourse are on the same level. It has three platforms, the third one will be used for trains to enter from the depot, which is right next to this station. From Central Park station, the train will travel to the terminal Sector V station and start its journey.More than 100 Metro staff members have now taken over the section from Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), which is implementing the East-West Metro project. Even as KMRC is implementing the project, Metro Railway, which runs the north-south section, will be in charge of operations.“We have trained all drivers and other staff from Metro Railway to operate the CBTC and signalling systems and run trains from the operation control centre, maintain signals and halt the trains in coordination with the platform screen gates,” a KMRC official said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73948711,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-694648,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/8am-on-valentines-day-your-date-with-east-west-metro/articleshow/73944004.cms

Lucknow: Close on the heels of mega defence exhibition DefExpo-2020, which begins in Lucknow on Wednesday, IIT-BHU and IIT-Kanpur are set to disseminate knowledge, conduct quality research and play a key role in skill development in defence sector.

UP government has joined hands with both the IITs to establish centre of excellence for defence industrial corridor and start certificate courses.

Dean, research and development (IIT-BHU) Rajiv Prakash said the institute was likely to start certificate courses for skill development in defence industries.

“We will promote indigenous defence industries and startups as beginners will not have hi-tech research and will need knowledge support, which will be provided by the institute,” he said.

“Suppose a new startup or an indigenous defence industry decides to manufacture a particular arm but faces problem regarding metals or alloys used in it, we at IIT-BHU will be the knowledge partner for the industry,” he said.

Prakash said such problems could not be resolved easily as defence industrial units keep their technical know-how confidential and in such cases IIT would help new startups.

“We will be of great help to international defence industries setting up units in UP. We will provide them trained hands by developing manpower. We will soon start certificate courses in skill development in defence sector,” he added.

Similarly, IIT-Kanpur will be instrumental in sharing knowledge in the field of advanced research in nanomaterial, cybersecurity, UAVs and electronics, and communication.

Panaji: Plans are afoot to undertake restoration of Colvale ’s St Minguel Fort which dates to 1635.

“We have sent a proposal for its restoration to the state government. Work is expected to start sometime after monsoon this year, following necessary sanctions from the government,” an official from the directorate or archaeology said.

Eleven forts across the state are notified under the Goa Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act of 1978 and Rules 1980. Under this, regular inspections and maintenance work such as debris clearance, vegetation clearance and minor repairs of the forts are carried out every year.

The Colvale fort, however, needs further attention in terms of structural conservation.

“For now, clearing of vegetation around the premises, routine cleaning and installation of dustbins at the fort are regularly done. But this fort needs to be restored. We will take this up as a major project this year,” the official said.

The fort is believed to have been built by the Portuguese as a barrier against the inroads of the Marathas and Bhonsles.

Keri: Within days of four buffaloes being attacked and one cow being killed in Huland along the Karnataka-Maharashtra border just outside the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, the state’s forest department has managed to trap images of the tiger.

Stating that these latest images clearly established tiger presence in the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, range forest officer (RFO) of Kankumbi, Kavitha Y, told TOI, “We have the camera trap image of the tiger that killed a buffalo in Huland. We are now in the process of verifying whether it has moved from the Mhadei sanctuary into Huland.”

While the state forest department was not able to trap images of the tiger that killed a cow in Derode just days earlier, it was able to do so in Huland.

On January 28, the tiger killed four buffaloes at Nisaniche Mal in Huland. The animal, however, could not eat its kill as the villagers drove it away. On January 29, the big cat attacked at Hal in Huland where it killed and ate a cow partially. Confident that the tiger would return to its kill, forest officials set up a camera trap and were successful is securing evidence that it was indeed a tiger that had killed the cow.

Incidents of tigers attacking cattle in the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary have showed an increased frequency since January. Among the cattle claimed by tigers are a cow in Derode, a sub-adult bull in Satre, a sub-adult buffalo in Surla, all in Sattari, and most recently, four buffaloes in the reserve forest of Huland bordering Goa.

As per information and evidence collected by state forests officials and verified with Karnataka forests officials, it has been established that the tiger that killed the cow in Derode came from the Kali Tiger Reserve in Joida, Karnataka. The big cat travelled more than 100km into the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, forest officials said.

“The Tillari region bordering Goa and Karnataka has tigers. We have evidence of the presence of a tigress and two cubs in the Tillari valley. There is urgent need for coordinated efforts by forests officials of Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka to protect them,” wildlifer Girish Punjabi, who is studying the presence of tigers in Tillari, told TOI.

Lucknow: The 11th Defence Expo beginning in the state capital from Wednesday will host an India-Africa conclave for the first time in the history of the biennial event. The conclave assumes significance as India has been seeking to strengthen military ties with African nations, especially at a time when China is making inroads in the continent.

Both Union and UP governments will be rolling out a red carpet for around 14 defence ministers from African nations attending the expo and seek better strategic ties.

India’s engagement is not limited to inviting investment from African nations, but also to look for markets for its defence production under ‘Make In India’ scheme.

“We will explore their markets along with the possibility of a mutually beneficial trade relationship between India and African nations. This includes not just investments in India, which of course would be very welcome, but also the possibility of new markets for Indian defence goods,” said a senior government official.

The conclave, to be held on February 6, will be presided over by defence minister Rajnath Singh.

UP chief minister’s office said Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, Gambia, Lesotho, Sudan, Tanzania, Rwanda, Niger, Seychelles, Uganda, Zambia, Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, Zimbabwe and Namibia have already confirmed their participation in the conclave and Defence Expo.

A ministry of defence official affirmed that it was for the first time that an India-Africa Defence Conclave is being organized during Defence Expo.

As part of increasing India’s military outreach among African nations, air chief marshal RKS Bhadauria visited Egypt last December for talks with top military brass of the country. The Indian Army conducted its first Africa-India field training exercise in March 2019, in which 18 countries, including Egypt, participated.

After taking over as defence minister, Singh’s first foreign visit was to Mozambique, while chief of defence staff Bipin Rawat also visited Tanzania and Kenya when he was army chief.

India has also been holding defence cooperation talks with Botswana, Morocco, Namibia, Nigeria and Uganda.

387,['5/02/2020'],Sealdah station to start before East-West Metro’s second phase completion,"This story is from February 5, 2020

The subsidence in an area in Bowbazar has delayed the East-West project by several months

KOLKATA: Metro Railway will not wait for the completion of East-West Metro’s second phase to throw open the Sealdah station, general manager Manoj Joshi told TOI on Tuesday.

The first phase, between Salt Lake Sector V and Salt Lake Stadium, which will be thrown open for commercial services on February 13, will hopefully be extended till Phoolbagan around May. Though a date has not been fixed for extension till Sealdah, it will happen before completion of work from the Esplanade side.

“One tunnel-boring machine (TBM) is stuck underground. The other one will have to be sent to complete the tunnel between Esplanade and Sealdah. There are issues pending before Calcutta high court. Hopefully, the stretch from Howrah Maidan to Sealdah would be ready for commissioning in two years. But we will not wait that long for commissioning the Sealdah station and linking it to the stretch up to Salt Lake Sector V. Work for completion of the Sealdah station is continuing. As soon as the technical issues involving sending off the second TBM to complete the tunnelling is resolved, we plan to start operations between Salt Lake Sector V and Sealdah,” Joshi said.

Operationalization of the Sealdah station is crucial in the grand scheme of things as footfall will increase once the network is connected to a major transport hub. In fact, even before construction of the corridor had started, railway experts like D C Mitra had suggested that work be started from Sealdah towards both directions. They had suggested that truncated services be thrown open as soon as a new station was completed. This would ensure a steady flow of passengers. Phase I of the the corridor will actually not be of great help to those commuting to work from Salt Lake to central Kolkata. It would be popular among those who wish to reach EM Bypass quicker and more comfortably.

“Once the corridor gets connected to Sealdah, passenger count will go up manifold. People from Salt Lake who work in central Kolkata or even in the south or north would just need to reach Sealdah for a comfortable ride home. Even those who travel to the suburbs on work would benefit. This is why there is an urgency to complete the stretch till Sealdah. We can’t wait for two years for this connectivity to take place. Once the connectivity to Phoolbagan is completed, there will be an increase in the number of passengers and the number of services may have to be increased. Once we link Sealdah to the network, not only services, we will also have to extend the timings as many people would be leaving home early or returning late,” a Metro official added.

Saligao: President of Congress’ Aldona block Amaranth Panjikar, on Tuesday condemned waste management minister and Calangute legislator Michael Lobo’s demand to legalise matka (gambling). He said that the legalisation of matka would spoil the state’s social fabric.

Lobo had advocated the legalisation of matka, stating that it was causing a huge loss to the state exchequer as goods and services tax (GST) was not levied on it. Lobo had also stated that matka could be brought under the purview of the law and GST could be levied on the game.

“By attempting to legalise matka, the government is sending out a wrong message, especially to jobless youth, to take up vices,” Panjikar told reporters.

Ponda: A 12-foot-long adult male crocodile was rescued from the bank of a stream at Mardol, on Tuesday.

The mugger, who was trapped in a cable snare laid to poach wild boar, has sustained injuries to his nose and face, animal rescuer Sricharan Desai, said.

He further said that the reptile weighed around 450kg and could well be over 40 years old. It is likely to have gotten trapped in the snare after it came onto the bank in search of food, Desai added.

Animal rescue volunteers were summoned by the local panch member, Varad Mardolkar, after locals noticed the crocodile in distress.

“These sweet water muggers are not man-eaters and feed on fish or small creatures found in water. It seems to have been hungry for several days as it was weak,” Desai said, adding that the animal will be released at a suitable place on Friday.

KOLKATA: Metro Railway could well have celebrated 2025-26 as its centenary year had the British gone ahead with their plans for a ‘Tube Railway Scheme’ in Kolkata. Ahead of commissioning of the Metro’s second line in the city, a senior official has dug into archives to retrieve documents on how the British had planned a network akin to the London Underground in Kolkata way back in 1919. The London Underground started in 1863. According to the official, there may have been an earlier plan but he is yet to retrieve documents to establish this.

As per records, for the British, a Metro network in the city was not a novelty but an essential to allow people reach their workplaces on time. They were keen that people avoid the additional expenses of living in the city and migrate to places like ‘Dum Dum and Baraset’. At the same time, they were worried that such people would not be able to reach their offices on time and get chastised by their bosses or be penalized. Following which, the September session of the Imperial Legislative Council at ‘Simla’ in 1919, followed a motion moved by Sir W E Crum, set up a committee that recommended a Metro for Kolkata after 14 sittings.

“We are of opinion that direct communication between the suburban stations and the business centre is required to enable suburban passengers to reach their destination without a change of vehicle. Requirements can only be met satisfactorily by the provision of an east and west tube railway from Eastern Bengal Railway to the East Indian Railway,” the committee had recommended. However, things didn’t move smoothly thereafter. The agency appointed to study the business aspects of the project stated in its report that the ‘three annas’ to be charged from passengers would not meet the costs involved in such a project.

“I found the documents tucked away in a museum of the Railway Board. The matter didn’t end in 1919. In 1921, the then Railway Board appointed one Dalrymple-Hay, consulting engineer to the Tube Railways in London, to study the possibility of a Metro network in Kolkata. It seems that Hay was actually born in Birbhum, West Bengal, before moving to England . In 1921, he was busy in restoring the London Underground stations and sent his chief assistant Ogilvie to carry out a study in Kolkata. The cost of the project that would connect the city with Howrah was pegged at £3,526,154. It was estimated that the project would take four-and-a-half years to complete,” the official said.

Why the project never took off is not too clear. Given the spurt in the Independence struggle following the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the British may have realised that their days in India were numbered. Less than a decade later, World War II started and no more effort was made to have Tube Railways in Kolkata.

Panaji: BJP has demanded an inquiry into the approvals given by the South Goa Planning and Development Authority to a commercial project at Aquem , Margao.

General secretary of the Margao BJP mandal Navin Pai Raikar, along with party spokesperson Sharmad Raiturkar, have demanded a thorough inquiry into the entire episode of the conversion of an ‘open space’ earlier marked for recreational purposes to settlement.

Raikar said that while the owner’s application for change of zone was rejected as the land was low-lying, it nevertheless was shown as a commercial zone in the 2011 outline development plan (ODP) for Margao. He further said that a sanad was issued by the district collector in 2012 and that permission to develop a mall was issued, following which it was purchased by relatives of opposition leader Digambar Kamat.

PANAJI: In a bid to make Goa College of Architecture a permanent hub for showcasing Goa’s architectural identity in terms of building typologies and heritage complex, the Indian Institute of Architects ( IIA ) – Goa Chapter, has made a representation to the chief minister Pramod Sawant regarding up-gradation of the institute besides its relocation to new premises.

“Goa College of Architecture has to be elevated to a different level, in particular to a new complex which will be in tune with the norms set by the Council of Architecture, New Delhi,” IIA Chairman Manguesh Prabhugaonker stated in the proposal to Sawant.

The IIA said that the college could be potentially shifted to the Lyceum Educational Complex in Altinho . Currently housing the high court building, the Lyceum complex is said to have five blocks and could serve as a roof for the institute.

The IIA further stated that they would like to assist the state government with “a long-term institute building strategy and a design friendly road map” to create a design centre in the country.

The architecture college is also planning to start post graduate programmes in architecture– one each in masters in urban design and another in sustainable architecture. Sources said the college is seeking accreditation from the Council of Architecture, which is a pre-requisite to start these programmes in Goa.

IIA Goa chapter suggested the creation of an outdoor museum for the architecture graduates that could help in experimentation through building materials and its application techniques and also to curate a research laboratory

“In addition, IIA would like to facilitate the architecture college in setting up a planning cell that could offer services in architecture and planning in various expertise with resources available among architects practicing in Goa.” the proposal read.

NEW DELHI: The total number of persons isolated at various Delhi hospitals with suspicion of coronavirus infection has gone up to 12. While seven people with the history of travel to China are admitted at Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital, five others are at Safdarjung Hospital.Officials said admissions had been done as a precautionary measure because they had symptoms such as fever and cough. The tests reports are still awaited.Meanwhile, five of the evacuees, who were shifted to the Army’s Base hospital from Manesar camp, tested negative for coronavirus, an Army source said on Tuesday. “We are not taking any chances. Anyone with history of travel to China, where the novel coronavirus infection is widespread, is being screened and isolated until tests confirm that they don’t have the virus,” said an official.Among those admitted to RML hospital is a 38-year-old man who returned from China on Sunday.At Safdarjung hospital, doctors said, five people admitted to an Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) facility after being evacuated from coronavirus-affected Wuhan in China were shifted on Tuesday. “Among those shifted are three men and two women. The five have been shifted as a precautionary measure after they showed basic symptoms like cough and sneezing. Some had a medical history,” said a doctor.A total of 406 people have been quarantined at the ITBP facility in Delhi’s Chhawla area since the last week after they were brought in two batches from Wuhan onboard separate Air India flights.ITBP spokesperson Vivek Kumar Pandey said the centre now has “401 inmates and they are being well taken care of”. Another official said that samples of all the people quarantined at the facility have been collected by doctors in coordination with National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), and they are being sent to laboratories at AIIMS and Pune for further tests.Over 600 Indians were evacuated from Wuhan. The remaining evacuees have been kept at another quarantine facility set up by the Army in Manesar (Gurgaon).According to Chinese government officials, the death toll from the coronavirus epidemic has risen to more than 420 while the number of those affected by the deadly disease has crossed 20,000.India has reported three cases of coronavirus so far, all from Kerala.

395,['5/02/2020'],Officials delay in handing bldg meant for Colva panchayat to govt,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Colva: Commercial business at the Colva panchayat ghar building continues even though the local body has cancelled the trade licences of the establishments operating there and has revoked the perpetual leases of all 10 shops.

An order was issued directing that the shops be sealed and that the collector take possession of the shops. The entire premises was then supposed to be handed over to the government.

In 1992, 500sqm of land belonging to the tourism department was handed over to the panchayat to build a panchayat ghar. However, instead of a housing the panchayat office, the building which was inaugurated in 2000 had 10 shops on its ground floor and a hall on the first floor, violating an agreement signed with the tourism department.

Repeated requests by the department to stop commercial activity at the premises were ignored. It finally directed South Goa collector Ajit Roy to take possession of the land and premises and hand it back to the government.

In October 2019, a showcause notice was issued to the panchayat by the collector asking why the land given to the local body for a panchayat ghar and community hall should not be handed back to the government. The panchayat then issued showcause notices to the lease holders of the shops. In its reply to the collector, the panchayat said it had issued showcause notices. The collector rejected the reply and in November, 2019, directed the mamlatdar to take possession of the Colva panchayat ghar within seven days.

Colva panchayat secretary, Amol Tilve said the talathi was ordered by Salcete mamlatdar Prataprao Gaonkar to seal the premises.

An order dated December 16, 2019, from Gaonkar directed Tilve to hand over the property to the talathi with seven days. However, it was not complied with. Another memorandum to this effect was sent to Tilve in January. It also stated that if the premises were not handed over to the talathi, they would be sealed and costs recovered from the secretary himself.

Tilve denied receiving the memorandum and said the mamlatdar could not direct him as his superior was the block development officer. He also said sealing of the premises needed to be done by the talathi because the Goa Panchayat Raj Act does not permit a secretary to do so. Tilve further said that one of the leaseholders of the shops had approached the district court and had received an ex parte order not to cancel the trade licence.

CHENNAI: Not halting before the stop line or scooting away before a red signal turns green may look like ‘minor’ traffic offences, but the two violations have killed more people in the state compared to drunk driving, distracted driving or driving down the wrong side. Yet police do nothing to stop the deadly menace, nor has the state government accepted the central government’s suggestion for a higher penalty .

Statistics from National Crime Records Bureau show that in 2018, 763 people died and 4,204 were injured in 3,807 accidents reported at traffic signals and stop lines. The number of accidents was three times higher than the number of accidents that occurred when the driver was drunk.

Besides putting the lives of road users at risk, these offences create chaos on the road, hamper movement of vehicles and cause bottlenecks.

“It’s the attitude,” said Dr Nappinnai Seran, consultant psychologist and counsellor in the Madras high court. “Many riders feel that waiting for a signal to turn green is a waste of time,” she said.

On Tuesday, TOI was a witness. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research – an autonomous research body -- estimates at least 250 vehicles to cross the Nandanam Signal from Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar Road and enter Venkatanarayana Road in T Nagar in one signal cycle (one minute). But only 150 crossed the signal because vehicles coming from Saidapet blocked half the lane in the opposite side.

But this isn’t a problem just at the Nandanam signal. It is everywhere. Worse, policemen ask two-wheeler riders to go past the stop line and wait for the signal to turn green. “Where is hope when police themselves are inviting public to violate rules,” asked R Dinesh, a resident of Nandanam.

Often, bikers rev up and cross roads between signals. “This can be dangerous in Chennai where distance between stop lines on opposite sides in a traffic signal is 100 metres or more. The risk of the violators hitting against those travelling in opposite direction is higher,” said S Kamal Soi member of National Road Safety Council.

More than 5,000 lost their lives in such accidents in Tamil Nadu between 2013 and 2018 – the highest in the country. Soi said automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) could be a deterrent.

But these machines come with the problem of plenty, something the Chennai City Traffic Police is bad at handling. In one day, more than 90,000 challans were generated by ANPR in Anna Nagar. But less than one-fourth of the violators were fined because the traffic police are yet to post the remaining challans. “We don’t have the staff who can post that many challan. We need automatic challan systems too,” said a senior police officer.

Rama Rao, president of Chennai Traffic and Transportation Forum, said police should use CCTV cameras at signals to fine violators. “Police at control room, monitoring CCTV footage, can manually take note of violators, generate challans and send them to their addresses,” he said.

He then visited Trilokpuri to support Kiran Vaid, campaigned for Anil Goyal at Krishna Nagar and for Anil Bajpai at Gandhi Nagar.“I have come to appeal that when you go to the booth with your family on February 8 and press the button with the lotus symbol, do not think that you are making the BJP candidate victorious. Think that you are ensuring the development and security of Delhi and the country,” Shah said.On Kejriwal’s challenge for a debate, Shah said he, too, wanted to ask the AAP chief questions regarding his development claims.“I challenge him to tell me how many of the 50 colleges have been built from 2015 till now? Bring the list. We will give the money to name them by advertising in newspapers. The truth is that Kejriwal did not build any colleges. No school was built. No development happened in AAP’s tenure in the past five years,” said Shah.On Ram Mandir, Shah said, “Aap chahte ho bhavya raam mandir bane? Toh Congress aur AAP ko vote mat do.”In Video: Delhi Elections: Amit Shah cuts short crowd chanting ‘goli maaro’ at Kondli rally",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73974046,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-159838,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/shah-cuts-short-crowds-chants-of-goli-maaro-/articleshow/73974070.cms
399,['5/02/2020'],The Northern Lights and my first brush with spirituality,"This story is from February 5, 2020

The Northern Lights or the Aurora Borealis occur when highly charged electrons from the solar wind interact with elements in the Earth’s atmosphere near the North Pole.

The Lights symbolise all that is magical, mystical and unknown about the world. There are various myths and legends surrounding the Northern Lights. The locals believed that these dancing waves of colour are our powerful guardian spirits; the spirits of our ancestors who come to meet and bless us. The native Cree people called it the Dance of the Spirits.

Standing under the midnight sky, beneath the shining stars, in around minus 15 degrees Celsius and braving the bone-chilling 30 kmph wind speed, I wasn’t sure if it was a good decision to hunt for the Lights. Soon enough the Lights started casting their magic spell.

It is impossible to witness such a beautiful phenomenon without a sense of awe. I am not sure what the Lights are, but I am sure there is something very special about them.

Just like looking into the stars or gazing at a rainbow, sunset or other natural miracles, the Lights give us a feeling of awe and powerlessness — a knowing that there is something greater and more powerful than us and we can connect with them.

Just because we can explain them in scientific terms does not negate the spiritual reality. I didn’t know I was having a spiritual experience at that time, but looking back, that’s what I would say it was. Standing beside the bonfire and looking up at the Lights, I felt that my long gone near and dear ones came to greet me, to assure me that they are there to guide me. I felt an instant connection with all that is in nature. As if, I belonged there since the beginning of time.

This awe-inspiring and wordless state was spirituality for me. Everything came together at that moment — the Aurora, the Universe and Me.

When the Universe calls, stop and listen. You will receive blessings beyond measure. That is what I chose to do.

NEW DELHI: Even BJP workers accept that children in Delhi government schools are getting the best education , deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia claimed on Wednesday while addressing a public meeting at West Vinod Nagar falling under his assembly constituency, Patparganj “A prominent BJP worker, who had been campaigning against AAP’s education initiatives, recently took out his daughter from a private school and got her enrolled in a Delhi government school,” said the education minister, who was campaigning along with Bhagwant Mann , the party MP from Punjab’s Sangrur.Crediting school teachers and the education team for the improvement, he said, “Even at private schools, we never allowed any fee hike. In comparison, the fees at Noida and Ghaziabad schools are way higher.”On the development work in his constituency, the MLA said there was not even a single stretch in Patparganj that was not carpeted in the past five years. “Due to the rebates in electricity and water bills, 72,000 households are getting zero electricity bills here.”While earlier development work used to get delayed due to a corrupt system, “an honest government is now working day and night for the city”, Sisodia said, adding that he felt proud to be part of a government working for the uniform development of society.“This election is not about any particular party or candidate but about the kind of development and governance model people want to see in future,” the minister said while urging the crowd to vote for AAP if they wanted the government’s welfare schemes to continue.Mann also requested people to choose the real issues over the politics of polarisation. “I am sure the people in Delhi will vote for development over those trying to divide society on the basis of slogans.” Slamming BJP’s politics of arrogance, Mann said the election commission even had to act against some BJP’s functionaries. “Senior BJP MPs have only one issue — Shaheen Bagh. When your government has brought this law, it is your responsibility to find a solution.”Reminding the crowd that BJP is calling a chief minister who has worked hard a terrorist, Mann said, “February 8 is an opportunity to give answers to such people.”",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73974110,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-188424,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi/honest-govt-worked-day-and-night-for-you-sisodia/articleshow/73970744.cms

Gachibowli encroachment

Trucks are parked on the road throughout the day near HMWS&SB, Gachibowli section office, Financial District. As the road gets narrower, it causes a lot of problems for pedestrians. Even for commuters, it becomes a tough task negotiating the stretch. I request the authorities to look into the issue and take prompt action.

Road closure causing chaos

The closure of an arterial road leading to Park Hotel in Somajiguda and diversion of vehicles to the road leading to Katriya Hotel since the past week or so is creating severe traffic chaos. I am not aware of the reason for the closure, but I wish to draw attention to the increased movement of vehicles that is causing disturbance to residents in the area due to constant honking by impatient motorists trying to get ahead of each other. Earlier, while returning home from my office in Khairatabad, I used to take the Park Hotel / Necklace Road Station route. Now, I am have to drive all the way till Somajiguda Circle and then take a U-turn to reach home. It is a wastage of time and fuel. I request the authorities to kindly look into the issue.

No streetlights

The arterial roads in Nacharam does not have adequate streetlights and are filled with potholes. The area is far removed from the rest of the city making it vulnerable to higher rates of crime. There are also several engineering colleges on this stretch. Therefore, keeping in mind the safety of commuters along this route, I request authorities to ensure that the roads are well-light and in good condition.

Open dumping ground

The area around Hashmathpet lake has turned into a dumping ground. Those residing in and around Bowenpally use the area as a dumpyard and an open toilet. This has led to a rise in the pig population in the area, which is a serious health hazard. Though beautification work has begun at the lake, we hope that authorities don’t limit restoration works to the lake, but also consider the surrounding areas.

403,['5/02/2020'],Aurangabad: Teacher booked for showing porn to three Class 8 girls,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Representative image

AURANGABAD: A city-based school teacher has been booked by the police for allegedly showing pornographic content to three Class VIII girls.

Though the incident took place inside the teacher’s cabin on January 6, the family members of one of the girl students broke their silence earlier this month by writing a letter to the police commissionerate.

Police had visited the school for inquiry last weekend and had also recorded the statements of the girl students. “No offence, however, was registered in the case then as parents were unwilling to come forward,” investigating officer Ashlesha Patil said.

However, as the news about the incident spread within the school, police on Tuesday booked the teacher under the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012.

Police have also slapped section 354d (foster personal interaction) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the teacher. The offence was registered on the basis of recorded statements of the girl students with police being the complainant.

“The accused took the three students in his cabin on the pretext of some important work, but allegedly showed them a porn clip on his mobile. He later warned the students with dire consequence if they spoke about it to anyone,” police said.

The girls, however, shared the incident with some of their teachers and family members.

“One of the family members of the affected girl wrote a letter to the Damini squad of the city police through the police commissionerate. After that, women cops visited the school on two occasions over the past weekend. The girls’ statements were also recorded, but the parents were against registering an offence at that time. We have registered an offence against the teacher after several parents sought stern action against the teacher,” Patil said.

Meanwhile, the school management, which had merely transferred the teacher after the incident surfaced the first time, said the accused would be terminated from the services on Wednesday.

A section of parents also accused the school principal of being lenient towards the accused teacher. The principal, however, refuted such allegations. “There is no question of backing anyone. We have decided to terminate the teacher,” the principal said.

404,['5/02/2020'],Nirbhaya: HC to decide on hanging plea today,"This story is from February 5, 2020

NEW DELHI: Can the Nirbhaya death row convicts be hanged separately, since at least two of them have exhausted their mercy plea? Delhi high court may answer this question on Wednesday as it gives verdict on the Centre’s plea challenging the stay by a trial court on execution of the four convicts, since one of them had filed a mercy plea before the President.

After an urgent hearing on Saturday followed by marathon proceedings on Sunday, Justice Suresh Kumar Kait had reserved orders on the Centre’s plea arguing that pendency of the mercy plea of one convict in a case of multiple death row inmates can’t be used as a ground to stay hanging of those who have exhausted all available legal options or are yet to exercise it.

A day after the trial court postponed indefinitely the execution of the four men, the Centre and Delhi Police had challenged it, accusing the condemned prisoners of “testing the patience of the nation”.

Before the HC website reflected that judgment will be pronounced on Wednesday, Nirbhaya’s parents on Tuesday mentioned the issue before Justice Kait and pleaded for an expeditious decision.

The trial court on January 7, had issued black warrants for the execution of all the four convicts in Tihar Jail at 7am on January 22. But they could not be hanged due to pendency of mercy petition of one of them. Later on January 17, the trial court fixed February 1 for the hanging at 6am, but the court was forced to stay the execution again as the counsel for three convicts — Pawan Gupta , Vinay Sharma and Akshay Thakur — urged it to adjourn the matter “sine die” saying their legal remedies were yet to be exhausted.

While the mercy plea of Mukesh Singh and Sharma were rejected by the President, Gupta has not yet filed it even as Thakur’s mercy plea filed on February 1 is pending.

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta had contended it is a deliberate and calculated design of the convicts to “frustrate mandate of law” by getting their execution delayed and they were not entitled to any more time. But advocate AP Singh — appearing for Gupta, Thakur and Sharma — had opposed the petition questioning the “hurry to execute the death sentence in this case only... Justice hurried is justice buried.”

The counsel for the convicts also protested against the fresh plea wondering how it can be entertained when the Centre was never a party in the case proceedings before the trial court. Senior advocate Rebecca John, appearing on behalf of Singh, had said that the “Centre has sought the setting aside of the order of the Patiala House court” when “an earlier HC order has clearly said that any order of the trial court should be challenged in apex court only.”

CHENNAI: To put a stop to mass cheating by medical students during examinations, the Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University has asked all 35 examination centres across the state to live stream the exams. A team of officials are monitoring the live streams from a control room in Guindy. Some 12,000 students are writing the exams this year.

In 2019, the university barred two self-financing colleges — Madha Medical College and Hospital and Melmaruvathur Adiparasakthi Medical College — from conducting MBBS examinations after CCTV footage showed mass copying by students with even invigilators helping them out in some cases. An inquiry committee found students exchanging notes, passing answer scripts and dictating answers at the exam hall. This year, students of Madha Medical College are writing their exam at the university campus, while students Melmaruvathur college have been given a separate examination centre. “The second and third year examinations are going on now. They are being live streamed,” said university vice-chancellor Dr Sudha Seshayyan. The colleges will have to send the complete video footage of the examinations, she said. “We will caution or warn centres from the control room if we see any malpractice. We have started live streaming from Monday,” she said.

The university, she said was in talks with companies for an artificial intelligence-driven system which can monitor examination venues in real-time.

Technology is available to provide proactive automated directions through instant alerts during exams. “We are hoping to make the process more stringent to reduce malpractices. We can debar colleges from holding exams and students too will be asked to repeat examinations or be debarred if malpractices are detected,” she said.

Students are given bar-coded answer scripts for the exams. Question papers are now sent to examination centres half an hour before the examination. To prevent leak, exam centres should downloaded the question papers using unique password and print them out minutes before they hand it over to the students.

Dr V S Jog addresses the gathering

Nagpur: “‘Lokgeet’ holds great significance in Hindi literature, the examples of which can be seen in some of the wonderful Bollywood songs,” said VS Jog, adding, “‘De de Allah ke naam pe de de’ is an amazing creation. It brings back childhood memories which are incomplete without the presence of a beggar in the locality.”

Speaking as chief guest on the topic ‘Bhartiya sahityat loksahityache sthan’, Jog explained the importance of folk literature in India, a subject that interests him immensely.

The programme staged at Vidharbha Sahitya Sangh (VSS), Sutabuldi, was organized by Grantha Sahavas of VSS in memory of Sarojini Babar on Monday.

Arundhati Vaidya, who conceptualized the event, gave a brief introduction about Sarojini Babar, saying, Maharashtra is richer due to her contribution in the field of folk literature. Babar was a renowned Marathi writer and a politician. She was considered one of the finest writers because of her contribution to various sections of literature. She has not only written novels but penned poems as well.

The programme, ‘Nandapeepa loksahityacha’, suggests that Babar is like a lamp that burns forever and holds a special place near god. “Babar’s contributions to folk literature are remarkable and evergreen, just like the lamp that never stops giving light. Her writing will live forever,” said Vaidya.

Various forms of literature were wonderfully presented to the audience. They included stories, poems, riddles and much more.

Abha Mude presented a story titled ‘Dhakneche akal’ written by Babar. The story revolves around two boys who defeat the demon with their wit and free their sister from his claws.

Shushma Mulmule explained the origin of ‘Ukhana’ in literature and recited several examples of the same. It was popular among married women as they directly would not mention their husband’s name.

Vijaya Raut laid emphasis on stories of God that he termed as ‘Devit katha’ in folk literature. Vasudha Vaidya shed light on ‘Kodya’ which means riddles. The programme was anchored by Vinita Hinge.

Porvorim: Before banning Goans from entering casinos, the state government should crackdown on local gambling matka and godgoddo business. Even those at the level of minister, MLA, sarpanch and panch are involved in these, former deputy chief minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar said in the assembly on Tuesday.

“Goans have been banned from going to casinos. But we also need to stop matka, godgoddo and then stop Goans from going to casinos. MLA, minister, sarpanch, panch are involved in this. Gambling is not good. There are those who go to dance bars. We should start from our friends in the House. We should start from under our nose. Only then we will go from darkness to light, as the governor had said while opening his address to the House,” said Dhavalikar, urging his fellow MLAs to refrain from gambling as well.

He said that Goans were being completely cheated over the Mhadei issue with 50% of the water already diverted.

When WRD minister minister Filipe Neri Rodrigues said that his department had been monitoring the situation on a day-to-day basis and asked how Dhavalikar had arrived on the figure of percentage of water diverted, Dhavalikar replied that it was “visible from the flow” when one observes from the river’s starting point in Goa.

“Yesterday there was a congratulatory motion on CAA, but the House has no time to discuss burning issues like Mhadei. Some say it is our mother,” said Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte. “Dhavalikar has said 50% of water has already been diverted. When salinity of the river water increases and people will be unable to cultivate fields, they will then know what the actual impact of the diversion is,” said Khaunte.

VIJAYAWADA: A day after holding a trial run along Benz Circle Flyover, authorities of Krishna district on Tuesday announced that they were ready with the detailed project report (DPR) for the second flyover. Traffic snarls have become prevalent on the National Highway at Benz Circle Junction with the movement of heavy vehicles. The first flyover was constructed at Benz Circle after a decade’s demand by the people.

The then Telugu Desam government proposed two flyovers on either sides of the national highway and work was started on one. The much-delayed project was completed on February 1. District collector A Md Imtiaz and police commissioner Ch Dwaraka Tirumala Rao monitored the trial run.

The collector said the project would be officially inaugurated by central ministers in March. He pointed out that the project could be called complete only after the construction of the second flyover. “We have now completed the first flyover.

Heavy vehicles travelling towards Chennai will now pass over the new flyover and land at Skew Bridge Junction. Similarly, traffic towards Kolkata will pass through the proposed second flyover,” Imtiaz said. “We are keeping all efforts to make the project a reality soon,” he asserted. Meanwhile, locals TOI spoke to expressed relief at the first flyover becoming operational. “It almost took 40 minutes to cross three traffic signals at executive club junction, Nirmala Centre and Benz Circle. Half of the highway traffic will now pass through the flyover. This is a major relief. We hope the Centre allocates funds for the second flyover soon,” said Kundeti Shalini, a student of Maris Stella College.

NEW DELHI: The Upper House on Tuesday continued to function in the pre-lunch session despite loud protests by opposition members over CAA, NRC and controversial remarks made by BJP leaders in the run-up to the Delhi elections.

After AAP member Sanjay Singh raised the Nirbhaya issue, MPs from all parties came together to demand speedy execution of the death sentence to the four convicts. Sloganeering stopped for a while when the Nirbhaya issue was brought up.

Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu said the matter was “very sensitive and serious” and the court judgement must be implemented at the earliest.

Singh earlier said while the entire country was on the streets following the gang rape and murder in 2012, the culprits have been able to get a new date every time to delay the execution. “Tarikh par Tarikh (date after date),” Singh said, while expressing frustration over the delay in execution of the death sentence.

TMC and Congress MPs, who were raising slogans against CAA, NRC and NPR, stopped sloganeering as the issue was discussed.

Observing that people are agitated and concerned over the delay in execution, Naidu said those in the system must fulfil their responsibilities.

He said the convicts were given all legal opportunities. “We cannot allow such things to go on in the country. People are getting restive. It must be seen that the judgement is implemented at the earliest,” he said.

Union Minister Prakash Javadekar blamed the Delhi government for the delay.

Earlier, some TMC MPs trooped into the Well of the House and started raising slogans like “Goli marna band karo” (Stop firing bullets) and “Loktantra ki hatya nahi chalegi” (Won’t tolerate murder of democracy).

The chairman, however, held his ground and ensured that members could raise issues listed for the Zero Hour.

SECUNDERABAD: After residents of Aswini Colony, West Marredpally, reported about overflowing sewage in their locality using TOI’s Citizen Reporter app, officials of Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) swung into action and plugged the leakage. Residents said that the overflowing sewage had become a source of agony for them and they feared the spread of vector-borne diseases.

“Finally, our woes have come to end. The issue was fixed after we aired our grievances on the TOI app . I thank TOI and the authorities for fixing the issue,” said Janaki Lakshmi, the citizen reporter.

Savio M, a resident of West Marredpally, said the sewage spill had added to their commuting woes. “The road in Aswini Colony is filled with potholes. With sewage water overflowing, our commuting woes multiplied and further damaged the road too,” he said.

Another resident from East Marredpally said that additional measures should be taken even after the issue has been resolved. “Once the issues related to sanitation are solved, officials should take up fogging in the locality,” said Vikrantt Mohan, a resident of East Marredpally, while appreciating the Citizen Reporter app.

Officials of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) said that they have forwarded the complaint to SCB. “Though GHMC officials inspected West Marredpally, they forwarded the complaint to SCB, as the locality falls under then,” read a statement issued by GHMC.

Officials of SCB said that the sewer lines were choked and so they overflowed. “We resolved the issue the day the grievance was published. However, the onus of keeping the city clean also lies on the residents. Many people throw garbage irresponsibly in nalas, blocking them,” said a SCB official.

Rama Krishna, vice-president of SCB, said that cleaning choked maholes was only a temporary solution. “The drainage lines are unable to bear the load. I am sure the manholes in West Marredpally will overflow again, even if there is a short spell of rain. Replacing the old lines with new and bigger ones is the only solution,” said Rama Krishna.

413,['5/02/2020'],Moving vigilance due to lack of space: AG,"This story is from February 5, 2020

VIJAYAWADA: The state government on Tuesday told the high court that the decision to shift offices of vigilance commission and commissionerate of enquiries was due to space constraints at the secretariat and for administrative convenience.

A bench headed by Chief Justice J K Maheswari and Justice Ninala Jayasurya questioned advocate general why the decision was taken while the bills proposing decentralization of the capital were in pending in the upper house of the assembly and Public Interest Litigations challenging the bills were pending with the high court.

Karumanachi Indraneel Babu, advocate for the petitioner, said the government’s decision to shift the offices of vigilance commission and commissionerate of enquiries to Kurnool was illegal and arbitrary.

Advocate general S Sriram told the high court that the decision was taken due to lack of space at the secretariat. The Chief Justice asked the advocate general why the government wanted to shift the offices to Kurnool instead of creating space by constructing a building in Amaravati . The AG told the court that the government has taken a policy decision to shift the offices for administrative convenience.

At one stage, the Chief Justice said that the high court would maintain the status quo till the next hearing of the batch of petitions that challenge the bills proposing shifting of the capital from Amaravati as it was only a matter of two weeks.

The Chief Justice observed that the offices can continue to function from Amaravati for another 15 days as they were for the last two years. The advocate general, however, sought three days’ time to file counter affidavits in the matter.

As a lunch motion was moved by another petitioner over the same issue, the bench said they would resume the hearing post-lunch.

Lakshminarayana, advocate for the petitioner who moved the lunch motion, argued that both the offices were part of the capital which is notified under Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) Act. He argued that the decision to shift the offices while CRDA Act was in force was illegal.

The AG said that there was no office of permanent nature at the secretariat for the vigilance commission. He said that the commissioner of enquiries would be formed based on specific requirement. He said both offices can function from anywhere in the state.

The high court asked the AG about the functions of vigilance commission and commissionerate of enquiries and under which statue these two offices were established. As the advocate general sought time to furnish the details, the HC posted the matter for further hearing to Wednesday.

Porvorim: Taking aim at the state government over various issues on Tuesday, GFP Fatorda legislator and former deputy chief minister Vijai Sardesai claimed that the ruling side was suffering from a “talent deficit”.

Sardesai, who spoke during a discussion on the motion of thanks to the governor ’s address called the ruling side “a float of 27 frogs” who were suffering from a “talent deficit” and have a psychological condition where “confidence stems from talent deficit”. He went on to say that science and technology minister Michael Lobo himself had made a statement that there is a talent deficit in the government.

The GFP president also said that governor Satya Pal Malik ’s address had some ‘lies’ such as wrong projections of GST collections.

Stating that the Mhadei water diversion issue was “a complete sellout of Goa”, Sardesai said Karnataka’s project, which is aimed at diverting the river’s water, costs more than Goa’s budget. He also that only after the governor had had a word with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was the letter giving permission to Karnataka for the project on the Mhadei kept in abeyance.

“The governor’s speech in the House made him look artificial. It looked like when he spoke outside the assembly on the Mhadei, he was speaking from his heart. On January 7, it looked like he was just doing a job in the House,” he added.

While taking on chief minsiter Pramod Sawant , he said, “The chief minister announced in January that he would give 5,000 jobs. I have been told now in a written reply that it cannot be quantified. The announcement was nothing but a ‘chunnavi jumla’ (election gimmick) to win the upcoming zilla panchayat polls.”

VIJAYAWADA: City police on Tuesday arrested Bhavanipuram murder accused Gavirneni Anil Kumar (37), a resident of Chodavaram village in Penamaluru mandal .

Anil quit his job at a function hall and began targeting women who stay by themselves to make money, police said and added that he was “inspired” by crime reports in vernacular television news channels.

On January 31, he allegedly killed Yedupati Padmavati (56) by slitting her throat at her house in Pappula Mill Road under Bhavanipuram Police Station limits. Her family noticed that the jewellery she was wearing had gone missing.

The case was challenging for the police as it took place in a busy area and Anil Kumar sprinkled chilli powder at the crime scene with an intention to prevent sniffer dogs from identifying him. However, after verifying CCTV footage from multiple cameras in the vicinity and analysing mobile tower data logs the police zeroed in on Anil Kumar as the prime suspect in the case.

Upon scrutinising his recent transactions, they confirmed that Anil Kumar was behind the murder. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, city police commissioner Ch Dwaraka Tirumala Rao said Anil Kumar’s modus operandi was to target women while they were alone in their houses. He would roam around the city looking for houses with doors kept open.

On July 10, 2019, Anil Kumar entered the house of one Nukala Sumalata and threatened her with a knife. He robbed her gold ornaments and ran away. He took a loan of about Rs 1.56 lakh from a bank by pledging the ornaments. On January 31, he entered Padmavati’s home when she was alone and killed her before fleeing with her gold. Cops recovered the knife used to kill Padmavati, Anil Kumar’s blood-stained cloths and the gold ornaments he pledged.

NEW DELHI: Despite being lodged in Mandoli Jail , a 30-year-old man managed to plan a robbery of Rs 50 lakh . The incident occurred on January 20. Asif arranged for the logistics and the weapons to help his accomplices rob the employees of a construction firm in Keshavpuram .

Police have recovered Rs 28.74 lakh, three pistols and the motorcycle on which they carried out the robbery.

“Other accused have been identified as Zahid (36), Asif Ali (24), Chand Mohammad (26), Radha Ballabh Sharma (36) and Dilip (27). With their arrest, six cases of robberies, which occurred in Keshavpuram, Bara Hindu Rao, Roop Nagar, New Friends Colony, Pandav Nagar and Jamia Nagar, have been cracked,” said Vijayanta Arya, DCP (Northwest).

The prime accused, Asif, hails from Etah in Uttar Pradesh. He is lodged in Mandoli Jail and has over 30 cases of robbery, snatching and arms act registered against him. “He was in constant touch with his associates through a mobile phone and planned the entire robbery,” said a source.

Ahmedabad: On passing the Ajit Mill Crossroads and looking around localities in the vicinity such as Rakhial and Bapunagar, which are Muslim ghettos in eastern Ahmedabad, protest messages such as ‘No CAA, NRC, NPR’ can be seen on houses and shops nearly everywhere.

Slogans opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) have been visible at several crossroads in these areas and even on government advertisement boards for about 15 days.

Local police have begun an inquiry into who has been posting these slogans and whether these can cause law and order problems, even as two protests are under way, at Ajit Mill Housing Colony in Rakhial and Morarji Chowk in Bapunagar.

A police official told TOI, “We have seen these messages and began an inquiry into who put them up, as it seems as if they have been stamped on to walls. Though the two protests in the area are peaceful, but if such messages are written on houses of other communities, it could create problems.”

A local activist, Kaleem Siddiqui, who has been organizing the protest at Ajit Mill Compound, said he was unaware of who had put them up.

One resident, who had an anti-CAA message outside his house, said it was just his medium for silent protest.

Artistes enthral the audience during the event

Nagpur: It was a lively environment in which four enthusiastic Kathak and Lavni performers captured the audience’s attention in a programme called ‘Pag ghungroo’ which showcased the combination of the two dance forms at Chitnavis Centre on Sunday.

The programme commenced with a salutation to Lord Ganesha in the form of a hymn, ‘Sur niragas ho’. It was followed by performances in ‘gavdan’ and ‘thumri’.

Amruta Guha and Arshia Tarkunde were the Kathak performers while Manasi Sharma and Amiya Anerao came up with performances in Lavni. The dancers kept the audience captivated and entertained throughout the programme with charm and perfection. They were guided by Priyanka Abhyankar from Sanskar Kathak group.

Baithkachi Lavni, a famous variation of lavni, was brought out in a very expressive manner by the performer. It was widely appreciated by the audience and was a big hit.

The other performances, depicting Kathak and lavni in their purest form, were also presented. ‘Aamad’, ‘Tihaayi’, ‘Paran’, ‘Tode’, ‘Atagat’, ‘Gatinikas’ and ‘Tatkaar’ were Kathak-related performances. The performance was quite refreshing. Lavni was performed on ‘Nesali pitambar jari’. ‘Tarana’ was yet another pure Kathak dance performed and ‘Chhabidar chhabi’, a song from the movie Pinjra, was presented in the form of lavni. The audience truly enjoyed the bliss of a combined lavni and Kathak programme performed entirely on instrumental music.

Anchor Ravindra Durugkar highlighted the true meaning of traditional dance forms and stated that such programmes keep the Indian dance styles and Indian culture alive. Avantika Chitnavis, trustee of Chitnavis Centre, welcomed and felicitated Abhyankar.

Sanskar Kathak Kendra presented this traditional programme in collaboration with Chitnavis Centre.

PATNA: Is the humble ‘pakora’ costlier than a bullet? Two youths from Buxar district may agree because they chose to fire two costly bullets rather than pay Rs 5 for the local delicacy, leaving the pakora seller and his brother injured.

It all started on Monday evening when two youths refused to pay the paltry sum after having a plate of pakauras from a roadside vendor at a village in Buxar’s Naya Bhojpur area. An altercation followed, which was “settled” after the intervention of local residents.

But the two youths returned on Tuesday and shot the vendor, Kanhaiya Kesari (35), in the leg. His brother Pintu was also shot in the leg when he came to his brother’s rescue. Both were referred to PMCH in Patna.

The victims told police that they were fired upon by two youths—Chunnu Yadav and Golu Yadav, over Rs 5 for the pakaura they had eaten on Monday evening. “Each bullet costs something between Rs 100 and Rs 200. Thus, they spent around Rs 500 but refused to pay Rs 5 to the vendors,” Dumraon SDPO K K Singh told this newspaper over phone.

The SHO of Naya Bhojpur outpost, Rajiv Ranjan Rai , said the accused, stated to be in their early 20s, have no criminal records. “They are absconding after the incident. Raids are on but they are yet to be arrested,” the SHO added. The SHO attributed the spurt in crime in the area to easy availability of illegal weapons at throw away prices.

NAGPUR: With changed lifestyle, pollution, and risk factors like tobacco, cancer is more of a lifestyle disease today. As cancer prevalence is increasing in both urban and rural population, time has come to create public awareness about it. More screening for cancer, early detection, and proper treatment should be the focus to deal with the disease, said experts during World Cancer Day celebrations on Tuesday.

A series of events were organized at Rashtra Sant Tukdoji (RST) Cancer Hospital, National Cancer Institute (NCI), HCG NCHRI cancer centre, and many other hospitals in city on February 4.

RST Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, which is now a tertiary cancer care centre, took out an awareness rally in the premises of the institute. Dr Subrajit Dasgupta, director of the research centre, said Vidarbha youths need to take additional care. “In Vidarbha, tobacco consumption starts as early as 11 years of age, which is a big cancer risk. Kharra, khaini and other tobacco habits must be avoided,” he said.

More than 20 organizations, colleges, and social groups participated in events at RST Cancer Hospital. Students from two colleges performed street plays on cancer. A poster exhibition on cancer was also held. Joint director Dr BK Sharma said the hospital has procured a cancer screening bus, which will travel across Vidarbha and screen people for cancer.

Events at National Cancer Institute (NCI) focused on ‘Freedom from fear of cancer’. Number of cancer cases have risen in the urban areas partly due to lifestyle changes like high stress levels, poor eating habits, irregular sleeping hours, early onset of menarche, late menopause and increasing maternal age. All these points were highlighted in the events at NCI.

On behalf of HCG NCHRI Cancer Center, awareness campaign was organized in the premises of Nagpur Central railway station , where volunteers interacted with commuters and told them about the dangers of cancers and prevention methods.

He further said that after completion of construction of the bridge, dredging will be done of the mud filling, which has been carried out during the work in Cortalim on the left hand side of the Zuari.

The new Zuari bridge project’s four-lane approach road will begin near the Bambolim Cross on the northern end and lead upto Verna industrial estate, covering 13.7km, including the new bridge.

The new Zuari bridge is an ambitious Rs 1,403 crore project funded by the Union ministry for road transport and highways.

Vice president M Venkaiah Naidu

AMARAVATI: A delegation of farmers from Amaravati met vice president M Venkaiah Naidu in New Delhi on Tuesday, urging him to stop the state government from moving the capital city from Amaravati.

The group explained to the vice-president their ordeals after the state government decided to trifurcate the capital city and recalled how Venkaiah had fought to protect the interests of the state during its bifurcation, persisting even after the NDA came to power.

The Centre had agreed to several projects and setting up of institutions in the state only due to the proactive role played by Venkaiah, the farmers said, adding that the Polavaram project wouldn’t have been a reality were it not for Venkaiah’s argument in Parliament. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for capital city Amaravati. It would be an insult to the Centre if the state government unilaterally moves it to other places,” a representative of the group reasoned. He added that Amaravati’s farmers had parted with their fields in the faith that their land would be used for the construction of the capital city and would give them reasonable returns. “We thought that future generations would be benefited by the capital city and gave up our lands. The present state government has ruined the state’s future as well as theirs,” a farmer said.

Vijayawada: YSRC will organise state-wide awareness programmes and protests against Telugu Desam’s opposition to the government proposal to set up three capitals in the state.

MLA Jakkampudi Raja on Tuesday told media that the party’s students and youth wings will launch a week-long programme on February 6. Senior leaders, MLAs and MPs will coordinate the programmes, Raja added.

YSRC will form human chains across the state in support of decentralization of administration and relocation of the executive capital in Visakhapatnam and judicial capital in Kurnool while retaining legislative capital in Amaravati.

Raja said that the central government had said that the capital issue came under the purview of the states and the Centre has no role in deciding it. It was high time that TDP leaders stopped making it an issue at least now, he said.

427,['5/02/2020'],‘Farrukhabad hostage-taker wanted 2 cops who harassed him punished’,"This story is from February 5, 2020

AGRA: Four days after a murder convict was shot dead by police to rescue 25 children, a man who tried to mediate during the nine-hour-long stand-off claimed on Tuesday that the abductor wanted punishment for two policemen who “tortured him” in custody in a theft case and sought “sexual favours” from his wife in lieu of his release.

When contacted, senior district police officials rejected the charges, but assured a probe into the allegation and the role of the two policemen.

Subhash Batham was shot dead on Friday while his wife died hours later on way to hospital after being attacked by locals in Farrukhabad ’s Kathariya village. Batham had organised a birthday party for his daughter and then held 25 children hostage on Thursday.

On Tuesday, when TOI contacted Anupam Dubey alias Balloo, who was shot at by Batham while trying to negotiate peace, said: “During my interaction with Batham, he accused two Farrukhabad police constables of torturing him in custody. He also alleged that the policemen had also asked for sexual favours from his wife in lieu of his release in a theft case.”

Dubey was approached by Bhojpur MLA Nagendra Singh to talk to Batham during the stand-off. “Everyone present there heard Batham but no one did anything. The entire drama was set up to attract administration’s attention to punish those two policemen,” said Dubey.

Additional superintendent of police Tribhuwan Singh said, “Batham planned the entire situation for months to extort money. He demanded Rs 1 crore for each child taken hostage. He constructed a basement in his house months ago and also gathered explosives to target policemen.”

428,['5/02/2020'],Bill seeking 3 years jail for striking workers introduced,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Panaji: The state government on Tuesday introduced the Goa Essential Services Maintenance (ESM) (amendment) bill, 2020, seeking to increase the prison term for committing offences under the parent law. The bill also makes the offence cognisable.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant moved the bill. It states that violations under the present provisions of the act are non-cognisable in nature, which limit police action as they have no powers to arrest violators without warrant.

This results in cessation of work by the persons employed to provide essential services, thereby inflicting hardship to public at large. Also the period of prescribed punishment is on the lower side, which is required to be enhanced in order to prevent strikes for maintenance of public utility services, the bill said.

The bill seeks to amend sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Goa ESMA, 1988, so as to increase the provisions for punishment in said sections, to have a deterrent effect and prevent offences. Under the bill, those starting, instigating or participating in a strike declared illegal under Goa ESMA will now face possible imprisonment of up to three years.

The bill also gives more powers to police to act against violators.

For commencing a strike, the bill proposes to increase the jail term from six months to three years, and for instigating others to participate in one (Section 5), it has proposed to increase the imprisonment term from one year to three years.

Margao: Nearly six years after the PWD issued tenders for construction of new buildings for police quarters at Arlem after demolishing the existing ones that are in a dilapidated state, the project is yet to take off from the drawing board.

Replying to a question posed by Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai, chief minister Pramod Sawant said that the proposal was to construct 42 ‘B’ type police quarters by demolishing existing 48 ‘A’ and ‘B’ type quarters at Arlem, for an estimated cost of nearly Rs 7 crore. He said that though the PWD had tendered the work on May 30, 2014, the tender failed to elicit any response from contractors, leading to retendering of the work by the PWD on April 25, 2016, Sawant said in his written reply tabled in the House.

Subsequently, the estimates were revised by PWD to nearly Rs 10.67 crore as per the revised Goa Schedule of Rates 2019. Following the revision of estimates, the project “is under consideration of the government for taking the work in a phased manner”, Sawant said, while also stating that the work of constructing a new building was taken up upon the recommendation of the PWD.

He said the condition of buildings A1 to A4 (24 quarters) and B1 to B2 (24 quarters) was verified by PWD’s executive engineer at Margao. “It was decided to conduct Non Destructive Test (NDT) on these buildings. After conducting NDT, PWD recommended that the 48 quarters be demolished, and have a new construction in their place due to high cost of restoration, etc,” Sawant said in his written reply.

NEW DELHI: The Union home ministry on Tuesday informed Lok Sabha that there were 66 protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act in the capital, which led Delhi Police to register 11 cases in which 99 people were arrested.

Replying to a question, junior home minister G Kishan Reddy said around 115 vehicles including four buses, six cars, 80 motorcycles, two police vehicles and 23 other vehicles, as well as 32 barricades, a police booth and a divider railing was damaged during the anti-CAA protests in Delhi. Incidents of violence, unlawful gathering, stone pelting and damage to property marked the protests in Jamia Millia Islamia , Chand Bagh mazaar, Seelampur, Old Seemapuri and Shaheen Bagh.

Meanwhile, the Centre has received anti-CAA resolutions adopted by state assemblies.

Sharing details of police action in the Jamia Millia Islamia campus in December and the January 5 violent clashes in JNU, as reported by Delhi Police, Reddy said three cases were registered against the mob found to be involved in unlawful activities and defacing public property while protesting against CAA in vicinity of Jamia. Police said it entered the campus chasing the violent congregation of students/mob, to nab/disperse the offenders, control the situation, protect government property as well as save the lives of “innocent” students on the campus.

15 people were arrested for the Jamia violence while 62 police personnel and 127 people, including 36 students, were injured.

On the JNU clashes last month, Reddy said a case was registered at Vasant Kunj North police station with regard to the attack against students and teachers by masked people armed with rods and sticks. 51 people sustained injuries and all were medically examined. Some rioters involved had been identified, the minister said. “No case has been registered against the injured students at JNU. Details of probe cannot be divulged at this stage,” Reddy told the House.

They have to spend a minimum of 14 days at the facility while they undergo tests to rule out a coronavirus infection.Some of the quarantined residents told TOI they were appreciative of the Army’s hospitality but hoped the camp would fix its sanitation urgently because a hygiene problem cannot be allowed to fester at a sensitive facility like this one.A student who asked not to be named said lack of adequate hot water in the current harsh cold weather conditions was also affecting residents. “The toilets in the facility are a bit congested and dirty,” said another. However, both said Army officers responsible for building the facility are doing the best they could.Another student said, “There are just five mobile toilets for over 300 people here. Each barrack has 22 beds. The toilets are in bad shape but we have been told the issue is being solved. There are only three electricity ports for charging in every barrack accommodating 22 persons. Overall, there are 10 barracks.”The student also claimed there was only one bucket for eight people to use. “And it becomes really difficult to bathe for everyone as hot water is available only for a little over one hour. Hot water comes only during the early hours of the morning. If we miss it, we don’t get it later in the day,” added the student.Only male evacuees are housed at this camp. “The facilities for those who are staying in other places where women and couples are staying are much better. But I don’t want to compare. They are trying their best and we are pointing out if we need any changes,” said another student, who was in Wuhan to study.“When we told them (Army officers) about the issues, they were very warm and listened to us. When we realised they got less than 48 hours to arrange everything from scratch, we understood that time constraint was an issue. They have started cleaning the toilets more regularly and have promised to resolve other issues too,” said one of the residents.There was, however, satisfaction with the food. “From bed tea to dinner, everything is given on time. And honestly, the food is just awesome,” said a student.An Army officer said the facility had been set up in very little time and everything had to be outsourced. “We are cleaning toilets as per the norms prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The mobile toilet effluent is being treated as per international guidelines so that no infection goes out.

The MLAs also raised concerns over the deteriorating conditions of cooperative societies and banks. “Under the act, we don’t have powers to make arrests in such cases,” Sawant said. Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco and Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao had moved a calling attention motion to raise apprehension and anxiety in the minds of shareholders and depositors of various co-operative credit societies and in particular, of the Visionary Society, over the alleged Rs 39 crore fraud.

Both sought to know what action the government would propose against the directors, besides the auditors who failed to detect the irregularities in time, and the steps to prevent such scams in the future and recover the amount by attaching properties of those responsible.

Replying to the motion, co-operative minister Govind Gaude said they have appointed auditors in Visionary Urban case, and a report will be submitted within 20 days. “Based on the report, action would be taken,” he said.

He also said the auditors during 2007-2008 to 2009-2010 span had reported various illegalities in the functioning of the society whereby funds were misappropriated by the management and staff members.

Pushpender went missing from his house on Sunday evening

NEW DELHI: A 35-year-old man was murdered and his body partially dismembered to be stuffed into a bag in Mangolpuri on Sunday. The accused, Mohammad Saleem and Pankaj, were known to the man and stayed in the same area. Pushpender’s body was dumped in an unused room of a building in which one of the accused stayed.

The accused duo, who were later arrested from the area, had even called up the deceased’s family members to demand a ransom of Rs 15 lakh a day after the murder.

Pushpender went missing from his house on Sunday evening after being invited for dinner by a “friend.” A complaint was later registered with police. On Monday, his father, Ram Ganesh, received calls from Pushpender’s number.

“The caller demanded Rs 15 lakh from us. When we expressed our inability to pay the amount, they suddenly agreed to accept Rs 12 lakh. They were even ready to negotiate more, which raised doubts. We were suspecting the role of his friends,” said Ganesh.

Pooja, the deceased’s sister, added that on Monday, Saleem and Pankaj visited their house to express concerns over Pushpender’s disappearance. “When they heard of police’s involvement in the case, they left the place in a hurry. We informed police about their behaviour and they were detained,” she said.

During questioning, Saleem told the cops that he was having an affair with Pushpender’s wife. He claimed that Pushpender would misbehave with his wife due to which her health was deteriorating. Hence, he decided to teach him a lesson.

He roped in Pankaj, who also had a grudge against Pushpender. On Sunday, Pankaj invited Pushpender to his place for lunch on pretext of helping him settle an old monetary issue. After he reached there, Pankaj hit Pushpender with a gas cylinder on his head due to which he fell unconscious. The duo then slit his throat with a blade and left him to die. They returned after sometime only to dismember his body and stuff the body into a gunny bag. They made the ransom call the next day, presuming that the family had accumulated a lot of money by selling land.

437,['5/02/2020'],Sand mining comes to rescue of Azhikkal,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Kannur: The plan to restart the cargo movement from Azhikkal Port here during the new year is yet to become a reality owing to technical issues, but at the revenue front the port is doing well thanks to the sand mining there as part of dredging to deepen the draft to facilitate the entry of bigger ships.

In December 2019 alone, the revenue from the sales of sand was Rs 4.96 crore, and in 2019 the total revenue was around Rs 38 crore according to the officials.

After the government decided to directly sell the sand and the booking was facilitated through the official website - portinfo.kerala.gov.in - the process has become easier and this benefits both the port and the people, they said.

Previously, there were cooperative societies engaged in sand mining and this had led to many controversies. Later, the government decided to sell it through the local bodies and now it has become more economical, said the port officials.

The rate of the sand has now reduced by over 30% and the quality has also improved, according to them, and the central government is said to be exploring the possibility of extending the Kerala model nationally, they said.

At the same time, the real purpose of the mining is to deepen the channel to bring bigger ships here but the discussions in this connection has not brought the desirable results, they said. The discussion is still going on, as the companies that agreed to operate service demanded Rs 3 per metric tonne per kilometer as incentive, while the government was not ready for this. This was the old rate given to the companies when the cargo ships operated from here for a few months a few years ago, and they want to retain it, said official sources.

The incentive is offered to compensate for the lack of the return cargo. If there is sufficient return cargo it would also solve the issues but for that the shipping service should be established first.

Though the authorities keep on promising that the shipping service would begin from here, the uncertainty has led to the general feeling that the port would end up being a place for sand mining. Though it is a profitable business, the goal of setting up the port is not to mine sand, and the general feeling is that the authorities should expedite the measures to start shipping service from here.

CLEARED SKHER

Nashik: The district election officials have said that in some parts of Malegaon city, the residents are reluctant to share their personal details for the voter verification drive because of fears regarding the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) and National Population Register (NPR), but local elected representatives have dismissed their claims.

Election officers claimed that the locals are unwilling to share details like Aadhaar number, proof of residence, date of birth, election photo identity card to the booth-level officers (BLOs), who are engaged in the voter verification drive. The Malegaon Central assembly constituency, where the election officials have experienced the reluctance, has been witnessing peaceful agitations over CAA and NPR.

“The exercise is being carried out at a satisfactory pace across the district barring Malegaon Central assembly segment. A section of the residents are scared of sharing any personal data due to issues like CAA and NPR,” a senior official of district election department said.

The voters verification exercise in the district started in November last year in all the 15 assembly segments of the district on the instructions of the Election Commission. It will continue till February 15. In the district, Malegaon Central has reported the lowest verification (54%) till now. The remaining 14 assembly constituencies have reported voter verification in the range of 62% to 88%.

“Electoral verification programme is nothing but updating the voters’ list. Through BLOs, we will try to clarify doubts of people. Voting is a constitutional right and everyone must come forward to keep their voters record up to date,” district collector Suraj Mandhare told TOI.

Local AIMIM MLA, Maulana Mufti Mohammad, rejected the claims of the election department. “The low percentage of verification in our constituency is because the BLOs are not visiting households for verification. There could be a small section of the voters, who are not ready to share their personal data due to CAA. But it is also a fact that BLOs are not working efficiently in the constituency,” he claimed.

He said he had already raised the issue with the sub divisional officer and requested him to direct the BLOs to visit houses of the voters.

Local Congress leader, Asif Shaikh, claimed voters of the constituency are apprehensive that such personal data could be used for CAA and NPR.

“Hence, the voters are not forthcoming to share the personal details to the BLOs. Unless the Centre withdraws CAA, the voters of this assembly segment will continue to oppose any such exercise that deals with furnishing personal details,” he added.

A file photo of Central Market in Mangaluru

MANGALURU: The long pending demand of people in the city for a full-fledged market complex at the Central Market area has suffered a setback due to a lack of bidders.

Though the project was envisaged several years ago, it was not implemented due to technical reasons. Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) had prepared plans to construct a new market complex having all the necessary infrastructure more than 10 years ago.

At present, the Mangaluru Smart City Limited (MSCL) has earmarked Rs 145 crore for the redevelopment of Central Market. A proposal to demolish the old Central Market building and build a new one in the Central Market area was approved at the MSCL board meeting in October, 2018. However, no bidders have come forward to take up the work.

MSCL managing director Mohammed Nazeer said the proposed Central Market complex will have a separate space for retail stalls of fruits, vegetables, flowers, fish and meat. It has been designed to give citizens a special shopping experience by providing all modern infrastructure. As per the proposal, the complex will also have a separate space for office premises and other commercial establishments, he said.

“We have plans to build it in the public-private partnership (PPP) model. Since it is a big budget project, most of the contractors are not confident of taking up the project as it requires a huge deposit. We have found two bidders, and very soon the tender process will be completed for the project,” he said.

“In addition to the redevelopment of Central Market, the MSCL also have plans to redevelop the city bus stand. At present, all inter-city buses too are entering the city. After the completion of an integrated bus terminal, which is proposed either at Pumpwell or near Padil, the intercity bus stand will be shifted. To redevelop the city bus stand, the MSCL has allocated Rs 25 crore. It will have 30 bus bays and all other necessary facilities for the convenience of passengers, Nazeer said.

Jaipur: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday gave a nod to projects under which all the agricultural produce markets in the state will be lit by solar power and Muhana mandi will get a compost plant.

The plan is to make these agriculture markets self-sufficient and to create a sanitized environment at Muhana mandi, which is one of the largest agricultural markets in the state. For the Muhana mandi project, a compost machine will be installed and Rs 33 crore has been sanctioned. This will help to utilise all the solid waste generated at the mandi and will help to keep the premises clean.

Moreover, as per the proposal sent by the agriculture marketing department, the agriculture markets that have sufficient funds to construct a solar plant will be given assistance under the CAPEX model and those who do not have sufficient funds will be given assistance under the RESCO model. RESCO and CAPEX are a kind of solar rooftop that have their unique way of functioning.

To make this process a success, about 70-80 per cent funds from various banks will be arranged. Gehlot has given Rs 12.32 crore financial sanction and even administrative sanctions to this project. The idea to install solar plants in the agricultural markets is to provide cheap electricity to the businessmen there.

446,['5/02/2020'],CBSE to open DigiLocker accounts for Std IX &amp; XI students,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Nagpur: CBSE has decided to open DigiLocker accounts for all Std IX and XI students from its affiliated schools and put their registration cards in the secure digital depository.

Till now, only Std X and XII board mark sheets were stored in the accounts of students concerned. A registration card for Std IX and Std XI contains vital details about the student like full name, subjects chosen, date of birth etc, which is then used the following year for board exams.

This registration card helps CBSE prepare well in advance for the board exams as they have a clear idea on potential number of students appearing, for which subjects and their details which need to be printed in the crucial mark sheets. The registration card, made in Std IX and XI itself, helps students identify and then rectify errors like name spelling or date of birth. With ample time in hand, the board can make changes required so that the eventual mark sheet is error free.

CBSE has been on a spree of student-friendly initiatives and this one is the latest that involves technology. The central board had recently issued a circular announcing its decision to allow calculators in board exams for students who have dyscalculia.

From February 5, the download of registration cards (from CBSE portal) will begin for schools. Parents and students both have to sign the card thus verifying that the information is correct.If any errors are noticed, then the rectification application has to be routed through schools. By May 15, CBSE will open DigiLocker accounts for all students and upload their rectified (if needed) registration cards online.

DigiLocker is a flagship initiative of Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY) under Digital India programme. DigiLocker aims at ‘Digital Empowerment’ of citizen by providing access to authentic digital documents to citizen’s digital document wallet. The issued documents in DigiLocker system are deemed to be at par with original physical documents as per Rule 9A of the Information Technology.

447,['5/02/2020'],Politics heat up on drive against encroachments,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Nagpur: Politics is heating up over Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) drive against encroachments . Congress corporators Praful Gudadhe and Kamlesh Chaudhary have demanded an end to the action, terming it against the bylaws, while mayor Sandip Joshi said it would continue as it is legal, and is as per the high court order.

NMC discontinued the drive against vegetable markets on footpaths and roads on Monday and Tuesday, after two days of action on Saturday and Sunday, after municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe left for Mumbai for official meetings. In the last two days, vendors earlier selling vegetables and fruits by encroaching on footpaths and roads have returned as hawkers, selling produce on hand-carts.

Joshi had framed a policy for continuous action against all types of encroachments. He also approved formation of enforcement squads in all ten zones. Through the general body, he also approved a new policy to levy hefty penalties and take action against encroachers.

After assuming charge, Mundhe had directed officials of zone, market, health, enforcement departments and nuisance detection squad (NDS) to take action against encroachments, especially vegetable, fruit and meat markets running outside of designated places. Action was taken against 62 markets in all ten zones on Saturday and Sunday.

On Monday and Tuesday, vendors returned and were seen selling produce in the same spots, especially at Khamla, Mahal, Gokulpeth, Jaffar Nagar etc. Only difference was that NMC had demolished sheds and temporary shops.

Mundhe is in Mumbai since Monday morning and likely to return on Wednesday.

Only NMC Hanuman Nagar Zone conducted the drive on Tuesday and demolished 128 encroachments on footpaths and roads under the guidance of assistant commissioner Raju Bhivgade.

NMC sources told TOI vendors are adapting, and have turned into hawkers to avoid action. “Earlier, they used to sell vegetables, fruits etc by erecting temporary shops. Now, they are selling it on hand-carts, which brings them under the policy related to hawkers,” sources said.

Gudadhe and Chaudhary said in a press conference they will stop action against hawkers by showing provisions in the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation Of Street Vending) Act-2014. “The ongoing drive is illegal and against the Act. NMC cannot seize materials, hand-cart and levy fine on hawkers. As per the Act, NMC formed Town Vending Committee, which has been submitted to state government for approval. The committee has to conduct survey, register hawkers, develop hawking and no-hawking zones. Action can be taken against hawkers only if they sell outside of hawking zones. We will meet guardian minister Nitin Raut and request for a stay on the action,” he said.

Gudadhe added, the drive is also anti-public as it deprives people of convenient purchase of day-to-day commodities. “There are no designated markets, so existing ones are running for years,” he said.

Gudadhe also said the policy framed by the general body to levy hefty penalties also can be brought into effect only after completing process as per the Act.

In reply, Joshi said, “I am with the people of this city and not encroachers. Maximum people selling vegetables etc by encroaching on footpaths and roads are from out of the city. Even people want action against these encroachments. We are not taking action against hawkers. Action is being taken against encroachers as directed by HC to free footpaths and roads from encroachments,” he said.

Joshi said he was ready to hold ‘Walk and Talk With Mayor’ with vendors in the presence of Gudadhe and Mundhe. “Traffic congestion and accidents are rising due to encroachments. Also, encroachments cause unhygienic conditions,” he said.

Shockingly, NMC administration is yet to implement policy framed last month to levy hefty penalty and take stringent action against encroachments. NMC officials said policy was pending with civic chief for approval.

JAIPUR: Rajasthan College’s cultural programme ‘Mridang’ was embroiled in a controversy after a teacher and a student got involved in a verbal duel over the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ).

The spat took place when Noman Khan, a student of Rajasthan University’s MA political science (previous), objected to a controversial remark of Shitabh Sharma, an assistant professor of Kanodia College . Sharma was invited as a judge for a debate competition titled ‘CAA Is In The National Interest.’

In the viral 36-second video, Sharma was heard saying, “You (Muslims) are divided between Sunni and Shia and are radically opposite to each other and you talk about not including Muslims in the CAA.” Elaborating her point, she said Gambia was declared the 57th Islamic country the moment it became a Muslim majority nation.

“Hum Hindu zyada hain, hum ne aaj tak Hindu rashtra ghoshit nahi kiya. Aur karenge bhi nahi, kyunki Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam ki bhawna hai (Hindus are in majority, but we have not declared a Hindu nation. And we will never declare India as a Hindu Rashtra as we believe that the world is a family),” Sharma can be heard saying in the video.

The clip ended with Sharma saying “CAA should not be opposed whether you are a Hindu or a Muslim.”

Khan told TOI that he confronted Sharma when she first asked Hindus to raise their hands and then asked Muslims to do the same. (This portion is not in the video).

In the second video which lasted 44 seconds, Khan can be seen confronting Sharma when she asked his name.

“App sacche rashtra bhakt hain toh boliye Godse Murdabad,” Khan was heard as saying in the video amid chaos.

“Principal KG Sharma called police who detained me for two hours. The college didn't allow me to raise a complaint against the teacher for her communal remark,” said Khan over the phone. Despite repeated attempts, Sharma couldn’t be contacted for her comments.

Dharmasthala: D Veerendra Heggade , dharmadhikari, Sri Kshetra Dharmasthala , led devotees in offering 216 kalasha padabhisheka to Lord Bahubali at Ratnagiri on Tuesday. A grand ‘agrodhaka’ procession was taken out prior to this ritual. Lalithakeerti Bhattaraka Swamiji of Karkala, who offered benedictions, said the sacrifice of Lord Bahubali is important at a time when injustice, anger, hatred and cheating abound in the world.

“India is a land known for its dharma and culture. Qualities of abdication, non-violence and self-control over senses are awakened in individuals by worshipping the statue of Lord Bahubali installed through observing ‘panchakalyana’ rituals. This in turn fosters feelings of love, trust, peace and amity,” the Swamiji said, adding every individual must strive to inculcate the rare and unique qualities inherent in Lord Bahubali in their lives and become better people.

Accordingly, one must pray to the almighty to give all his inherent qualities to one who offers prayer to him, the Swamiji said. Let there be world peace through the qualities of non-violence, sacrifice, abdication that Lord Bahubali practiced during his lifetime, the seer advised. ‘Kshullaka’ Dhyan Sagar Maharaj also offered benedictions.

Thrissur: The forest department team led by Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University head of the department, Dr Syam K Venugopal examined the Guruvayur tuskers on Monday and submitted a report to Thrissur ACF.

The ban of Guruvayur Valiyakesavan will continue and the ban of Guruvayur Padmanabhan will be lifted, said the team’s report.

After considering the current health condition of Padmanabhan, the report found that he is fit to be used in the routine temple rituals inside the Guruvayur temple. The report also said that the tusker should only be used for parading during the cooler time of the day and should not travel or be paraded between 10am and 4pm. Additionally, the temple authorities should assure proper rest to the elephant and ensure that travel and temple parades are strictly restricted to two times a week. The report also recommends that the tusker should not be made to work in hot and severe weather conditions.

The report also said that the tusker Guruvayur Valiyakesvan, was found to be healthy. To determine if he has been afflicted with tuberculosis we need a specific diagnosis. A special competent team should be constituted to collect clinical samples with intimation to state epidemiology officer and chief disease investigation officer of the animal husbandry department. Till the clinical examination is completed, the tusker should given rest and restricted within the Punnathur Kotta, recommends the report. After the results the forest department will take further action, adds the report.

The forest department had imposed restrictions on Guruvayur Padmanabhan and Valiyakesavan on December 7 from participating in any functions due to age and health-related issues. It was imposed based on the complaint by member of Kerala state animal welfare board M N Jayachandran. Last month chief wildlife warden Surendrakumar formed a three-member expert committee to inspect the health condition of the tuskers.

“We will lift the ban of Guruvayur Padmanabahan as per the report by expert committee. But the elephant is not allowed at any functions outside the Punnathur Kotta. The ban of Valiyakesavan will be decided after completing the clinical examination,” Thrissur ACF P M Prabhu told TOI.

453,['5/02/2020'],Coronavirus treatment: How far effective are anti-HIV drugs in treating Novel Coronavirus?,"With more than 20,000 cases in China and numbers rising outside the country, Coronavirus is fast turning into a global crisis.As experts try and find out how to treat the Novel Coronavirus, which has been declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organisation, a newfound development was made in Bangkok recently when a team of medical doctors reported success rates in treating a patient infected with the virus by using a cocktail of drugs usually given to HIV patients.As per reports, the patient, a 71-year-old woman showed positive signs and better recovery just 48 hours after being administered the drugs. While the case is still under study, there is no sure shot evidence that this is the cure-all drug for treating the deadly disease. There remain a lot of questions to be answered about the same.Applying a clinical approach, Thai doctors used a combination of drugs, mainly, anti-retroviral medicines to treat the disease.Claiming it to be an effective ""cure"", a report released from the hospital read:""This is not a cure, but the patient's condition has vastly improved. From testing positive for 10 days under our care, after applying this combination of medicine the test result became negative within 48 hours,""With a vaccine still potentially years away, scientists are hopeful the trial could offer a critical breakthrough.Newer case studies and trials have emerged out of China, which show that doctors are actively relying on HIV fighting medications to treat high-risk patients.Of all the experimental studies and trials, a combination of antiviral medicines used in the treatment of severe flu and infections are currently showing the highest potential of all the drugs.The kind of therapy being brought into use, known as combination therapy is not a new concept at all. Combination therapy, in the past, has been used to treat certain regressive forms of cancer and many severe forms of chronic illnesses.The drugs which are being used to treat novel coronavirus on a few patients are lopinavir, ritonavir, which act from the root and strip the virus's ability to attack or reproduce the body's immune system, hence, curbing the problem of further infection as well. This combination acts on an enzyme, protease, which is used by both the Human Immunodeficiency Virus as well as coronaviruses to attack the protein cells in the body and multiply their numbers in the body.Doctors are also experimenting with the added usage of another drug, Oseltamivir, which is used to treat flu, in the hopes that this combination will not strengthen the coronavirus's efficacy and instead, break it down.In the past, anti-HIV drugs have been used to treat patients suffering from SARS, who showed positive clinical benefits after the treatment and the results of the same have been published in The Lancet as well.Chinese doctors, too, are making use of this combination therapy, testing it out on some patients infected with the coronavirus. While some showed a sort of allergic reaction, while some showed positive development.Like with all therapies, while these medicines can prove effective, they do carry certain side-effects. And hence, there is no potential proof that this brand of HIV fighting drugs could work in treating all cases of coronaviruses.A big reason for this is that the family of coronaviruses are comparatively stronger than other viruses and therefore, it has been difficult to find out the root cause of spread till now. Doctors also say that while the medicines may have worked in limited cases, a lot many more studies and conclusive researches are needed before we establish the same. Scientists are also working to prepare potential vaccines which will act as a preventive measure. However, this may take months to come.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73935983,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-975810/73935983.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/health-news/coronavirus-treatment-how-far-effective-are-anti-hiv-drugs-in-treating-novel-coronavirus/articleshow/73935983.cms

NEW DELHI: Junior minister for finance Anurag Thakur said in Rajya Sabha on Tuesday that bank fraud amount has declined to Rs 5,244 crore in the first three quarters of this fiscal because of improved detection and reporting.

“Bank frauds, which stood at 0.58% during 2009-14, have come down to 0.16% in the last two and half years. In the first six months of this year, frauds were only 0.04 %. This has happened because our government has taken right steps towards fraud reporting and detection,” Thakur said in the Upper House.

According to Thakur, bank frauds reduced significantly from Rs 38,548 crore in the 2016-17 fiscal to Rs 16,084 crore in 2017-18 fiscal.

It rose slightly though to Rs 18,893 crore in 2018-19 but declined again to Rs 5,244 crore in the first three quarters of 2019-20 fiscal, he said during Question Hour . To check fraud, the minister said, “We came out with a framework for improved detection and monitoring. We also reviewed the quality of assets, cleaned up the bank balance, and recapitalised banks.”

NOIDA: The Noida traffic police have created space for an additional lane on the Delhi-Noida side of DND by squeezing a portion of a U-turn, hoping to somewhat ease snarls on the busy arterial road.

The decision has been taken keeping in mind the additional traffic load DND has been witnessing ever since the Kalindi Kunj border was sealed on December 15 in the wake of CAA protests at Jamia Millia Islamia and Shaheen Bagh. So, vehicles, which would have ideally taken the Kalindi Kunj route, are now being diverted to DND. Officers said the DND-Maharani Bagh stretch has been one of the worst-affected in terms of traffic.

After the tweak in arrangement, the U-turn on the Noida-Delhi side, which would earlier lead vehicles to the third lane on the right of the Delhi-Noida carriageway, will now open into a fourth lane. Since the size of the U-turn has been squeezed by placing barriers, it has made available this additional fourth lane, which was already there but not in use.

Officials said the decision was taken on Monday following a survey of master plan 1 road (DND-Sector 12/22/56 intersection) by a two-member team of the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) and traffic police.

DCP (traffic) Rajesh S said, “The U-turn space has been squeezed in such a manner that vehicles can easily pass through and the extra space is utilised by commuters travelling from Delhi. This minor change will help commuters who get stuck on the stretch towards Mayur Vihar loop”

At least 50 extra barriers have been placed to ensure those travelling towards Mayur Vihar don’t merge with the traffic moving towards Sector 16. The DCP said the situation would be reviewed again after the Kalindi Kunj route opens.

NEW DELHI: Congress Tuesday demanded that BJP expel its MPs Anant Kumar Hegde and Pragya Thakur to prove its “much professed and publicised love for Mahatma Gandhi”.

AICC general secretary K C Venugopal said the BJP leadership was paying lip service to Gandhi while its members were repeatedly insulting the Father of the Nation. He termed as sham the BJP’s demand for an apology from its MP Hegde, recalling that another MP Pragya Thakur recently called Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse “a patriot”.

“It is a sham to maintain the fig leaf that now barely covers the naked hatred and contempt that BJP and RSS have towards the Mahatma, as indeed generations of freedom fighters who gave away their life in the cause of an Independent Mother India,” he said.

BJP MP Anantkumar Hegde

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Anantkumar Hegde ’s remarks on Gandhi and the freedom struggle rocked Lok Sabha on Tuesday as the opposition disrupted proceedings and accused the saffron party of being the inheritors of the legacy of Gandhi’s killer Nathuram Godse. The opposition forced adjournment of the House right at the start, washing out question hour.

With members trooping into the well raising slogans, Congress’s leader in the House Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury accused Hegde of denigrating Gandhi, who he said was a “worshipper of Ram”.

Congress members raised slogans of “Godse party, down down”; “Mahatma Gandhi amar rahe”; “maafi mango, maafi mango” as they tried to block the business of the House when it reconvened after an hour of adjournment. They demanded that PM Modi come to the House and clarify the matter.

The protests turned into a clash when parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said Hegde had been asked to express regret despite having clarified that he did not make the remarks attributed to him. Joshi said BJP MPs took out 150 km of padayatra each to commemorate Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary.

“These people are unnecessarily making an issue. We are the real followers of Mahatma Gandhi. These people are the followers of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi,” Joshi said, as sloganeering targeting BJP became louder.

The comment turned the clash shriller as Chowdhury called BJP “inheritors of Godse’s legacy”.

While this was going on, BJP MP from West Bengal Locket Chatterjee started to allege that the state government was following “appeasement politics” and that Saraswati Puja was not being allowed to be performed in villages, linking it to protests against CAA . She likened the situation in Murshidabad district to that in Pakistan .

Such experiments have successfully been implemented in the last 25 years and even government think-tank Niti Aayog has taken note of this and come out with draft guidelines, he said during the Question Hour . The minister asserted that the step is permitted under Sector 2(5) of the Medical Council of India ( MCI ) Act 1999 and made it clear that it is not being done to promote the private sector. Responding to a supplementary query, Vardhansaid: “We will offer district hospitals to the private sector without compromising the interest of patients.”

“A private sector can have medical colleges but cannot have hospitals with patients. The government has many district hospitals with patients. The private sector has money to run the hospitals,” he said. He also disagreed with CPI MP’s view that the entry of private sector in medical education was eroding its quality.

Ahmedabad: Hair loss is a major cause of concern for women undergoing cancer treatment involving chemotherapy. City-based medical experts said a novel method of ‘scalp cooling’ can prevent this loss to some extent.

Dr Mansi Shah, a medical oncologist, said the initial results of patients undergoing the treatment were satisfactory in terms of physical and psychological well-being. “Chemotherapy targets fast-dividing cells in the body. Hair is the second fastest dividing cell and hence chemo drugs cause hair loss,” she said.

The therapy causes blood vessels in the scalp to shrink, reducing the amount of chemo reaching the follicle cells.

Various city-based hospitals observed World Cancer Day on the theme ‘I can and I will.’ At Civil Hospital, about 100 cancer survivors participated in a celebration-cum-awareness event. Suresh Prajapati, 50, a resident of Naroda, in his speech said that he had lost his grandmother to oral cancer. “Ever since, I have been spreading awareness about the perils of tobacco consumption in different parts of Ahmedabad,” he said.

Tanmay Panchal, a tongue cancer survivor, said that more than the five years of excruciating treatment, it was society’s approach that hurt him more.

“I now run a video channel to dispel myths about cancer,” he said.

Ahmedabad: Remember the video of a canteen worker at the Sola Government Medical College using his feet to clean potatoes? The college administration had been forced to ‘terminate’ the contract on January 22, after the video went viral. Now, the same contractor is back, and the medical college has decided to allow him to resume work. The AMC on Monday took off the seal on the canteen after collecting Rs 25,000 in administrative charges.

Students of the college had written to the apex body of medical colleges in India and sent the video with it. The students questioned the authorities’ reinstatement of the contractor even after it was established that the contractor was using unhygienic practices.

A group of students questioned the move and claimed that despite several complaints, the contractor has been continuing since 2011. The students claimed that they had not only stopped using canteen services but had also made several earlier representations.

“The contractor is supposed to get a certificate from the AMC, but no such certificate was acquired, and he was awarded the contract. The contractor even used dirty water for cooking. We made several representations, but the authorities failed to hear the issue after which we went on a strike in 2013. After assurances were made of a new contractor, the same one has continued for more than seven years,” a student said. The contractor has not resumed services since the controversy broke.

“We issued a show-cause notice to the contractor. We have decided to allow him to continue till March 31 after getting his reply,” said a medical college official.

“His contract ends on March 31, 2020, after which it will not be renewed,” said in-charge dean Dr H R Jadav. About the unhygienic methods of the contractor, he said the AMC had taken action against him and then removed the seal. There is no problem in allowing him to continue till March 31.

The contractor claimed the video was an old one. He contended that the potatoes seen were of inferior quality and were being cleaned in that manner so that they could be fed to cows.

465,['5/02/2020'],Maruti-Auto-Show,"This story is from February 5, 2020

New Delhi: India's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India ( MSIL ) has no immediate plans to launch electric vehicles (EV) and will instead introduce cars with clean fuel and hybrid technology. Mahindra, Hyundai and Tata Motors have already introduced EVs and other auto companies like MG, Kia as well as Mercedes-Benz and Audi have announced plans to introduce EVs later this year.

Speaking to TOI, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MSIL) executive director (marketing & sales) Shashank Srivastava said the carmaker was in no hurry to jump on to the EV bandwagon and would wait till it became a viable option for both the customers and the company.

""At present, electric cars are unviable. First, the battery technology is too expensive; second, charging infrastructure is non-existent; and third, there is range anxiety among customers. Unless these issues are addressed, there won't be mass acceptance of EVs,"" Srivastava argued.

With only 12-15% car owners actually having access to a permanent parking space, even night time charging is an issue. Range of EVs drop dramatically when heater or air-condition is in use.

Though MSIL is currently conducting trials of 50 electric Wagon-R vehicles in different climate and terrain conditions across the country, the company executive said they were leanings for the R&D team and not for introduction of the vehicle in the market.

""We see hybridisation and use of clean fuel like CNG as a practical option in the intermediate stage between internal combustion engines and full EVs. At present, 8% of our sales are CNG vehicles. Going ahead, as the CNG infrastructure improved, sales will increase. In 2020-2021, we are looking at 50% increase in CNG car sales against 2019-2020. We are also using mild hybrid technology in cars and have invested in a battery plant in Gujarat with Denso and Toshiba,"" he pointed out.

Srivastava also pointed out that the inflexion point for a shift to electric was still a while away and would happen only when battery cost that today comprised 50% of vehicle cost gets reduced substantially.

The company, meanwhile, has stopped manufacturing BS IV vehicles and has migrated nearly all its vehicles to BS VI. The BS VI versions of three models that remain -- Brezza, Ignis and S-Cross -- will be introduced over the next few days. All of them will undergo a makeover during the emission norm migration.

At the Auto Expo 2020, MSIL will showcase the new compact SUV Brezza with petrol only engine; concept car Futuro-e that is positioned as an SUV coupe, New Ignis as a tough urban SUV and Jimny, a compact SUV. The production version of the Futuro-e is expected to roll out in a couple of years but MSIL is yet to take a call on Jimny and says it will gauge customer feedback at the auto show before taking a decision.

Though MSIL has increased marketshare in January 2020 to 53.3%, up from 49.6% in January 2019, it clocked a 11% decline in retail sales. The company top brass remains anxious about how 2020 will pan out given the rise in vehicle cost due to migration from one emission and safety regime to another. Also three-year, third party insurance was introduction following a Supreme Court order. “Between July 2018 and now, cost of acquisition of cars have gone up by 8-14%. Though we have seen good adoption of BS VI products, what happens in the months ahead remains to be seen,” added Srivastava.

469,['5/02/2020'],Coronavirus China: How Wuhan outbreak became sixth global health emergency in 10 years,"Passengers wear face mask to protect against coronavirus (AFP)

Why is 2019-nCoV a global public health emergency?

What happens in a PHEIC? Why is the Wuhan outbreak called a ‘novel’ coronavirus?

Is this the first time a coronavirus has been designated a global public health emergency? What was the case with Nipah in

?

What is the economic impact of a disease outbreak?

NEW DELHI: The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the coronavirus outbreak in China’s Wuhan a global health emergency. More than 20,000 cases of the disease have been confirmed in little more than a month after the first case was confirmed on December 31 last year. Apart from the human toll, the disease is a concern because similar outbreaks in the past have extracted a significant economic cost. Kenneth Mohanty explains what a global health emergency is and why the 2019-nCoV, as the Wuhan virus is being called, has received this tagA public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, which is what the 2019-nCoV has been declared to be by WHO, is defined as “an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response”. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), under which a PHEIC is declared, was enacted in 2007. When a PHEIC is declared, WHO helps coordinate an urgent response with the affected country and the international community. While WHO notes that circumstances that lead to a PHEIC declaration can extend beyond communicable diseases, the six times that PHEIC declarations have been made were all due to communicable diseases:IHR is an agreement between 196 countries and, as an international treaty, is legally binding and all countries must report events of international public health importance. Under IHR, all countries should be able to detect a potential threat, assess its gravity, report its occurrence, and respond adequately to it. It also lays down specific measures countries can take at ports, airports and ground crossings to limit the spread of health risks across borders. But a 2018 article in the BMJ Global Health journal echoed a WHO finding that only about a third of the countries have the ability to satisfactorily assess, detect, and respond to such emergencies. WHO said the key factor behind the global emergency tag for 2019-nCoV is “not what is happening in China but what is happening in other countries” with the concern that it could spread to countries with weaker health systems.It is especially important to note in this regard that the Wuhan outbreak is being called a novel coronavirus as it is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. Although it is from the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, it is not the same virus.While coronaviruses are nothing new, the 2019-nCoV is the first coronavirus to get a PHEIC designation. You see, coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing illness in people and others that circulate among animals. Three major coronavirus cases — SARS in 2003, MERS in 20112, nCoV 2019 — have all been traced to bats but are understood to have jumped to humans from an intermediary animal, civet cats and camels, for SARS and MERS, respectively. The 2019-nCoV is said to have originated in a seafood and animal market but what the intermediary animal may be has not been established yet.Nipah virus, which struck Kerala in 2018, too, arose from bats, but is not a coronavirus infection even though respiratory trouble is one of the symptoms. In fact, several viruses carried by bats can cause disease in humans and the coronavirus is just one of them. The Kerala Nipah outbreak killed 17 of the total 19 people afflicted with a fatality rate of 89%. WHO was notified within a month of the first death and notes that no new cases or deaths were reported since June 2018 and humanto-human transmission of Nipah virus was contained in Kerala.A 2017 paper published by US National Library of Medicine estimated that the expected losses from pandemic risk stood at about $500 billion per year, taking into account both lost income and the health impact. The total global economic cost of the 2003 SARS outbreak was estimated at $40 billion. It is well-established that disease outbreaks have a slowingdown effect on the economy. Travel and trade restrictions in the wake of the outbreak have already caused big losses to businesses and Bloomberg reported that China may cut its economic growth expectations for 2020 due to the coronavirus outbreak with JPMorgan slashing quarterly growth estimates to 4.9% from 6.3%. Why a slowing China is worse for the global economy today than when the SARS outbreak, which too took a substantial economic toll, is because China now accounts for about a third of global growth, a larger share than the US, Europe and Japan combined, Financial Times said.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73947745,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-620318,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/how-wuhan-outbreak-became-sixth-global-health-emergency-in-10-years/articleshow/73947640.cms

The selected road is very narrow and situated in a densely populated area.

Khan told TOI that construction of the cement concrete road using PPCP technology has solved various problems. “The PWD got funds for concretization of a road with a length of 480 metre at Rajiv Nagar, connecting two highways, under the central road fund (CRF). The road was around 3 metre in width and is the only access to many areas; so, it cannot be blocked for traffic.

“Curing, which is very crucial for durability of cement concrete road, would have been not possible due to movement of people. Therefore, we used the PPCP technology. Through a private contractor, we cast cement concrete panels at a plant in Khadgaon. We ensured sufficient time for curing. Then, we placed panels on the road. It took six hours to convert a stretch of 100 metre into a cement concrete road,” he said.

PWD is planning to complete works on the entire road within three days.

Khan said, “We ensured the cost of road was less than the conventional system, which is another major achievement. The conventional system costs much more than PPCP technology. We could achieve this by keeping thickness at 200mm as against 300mm in conventional system.”

“But the strength and life achieved is five times more than the conventional system. There will be no cracks as it was cast and cured in a friendly and idle atmosphere. It will be easy to replace panels whenever required in future,” he added.

From the earlier width of around 4 meter, now the road is of 10 meter with a 5.50 metre carriageway, footpath and stormwater drains on two sides. Each panel is 2.75 metre in width and 3.50 metre in length. The two panels have been fixed for a carriageway of 5.50 metre. There is a jetting system in PPCP, which also ensures proper elevation and no undulation.

Khan said the cost of cement concrete road using PPCP technology can be lesser where strength of the existing road is good. “We can mill top of the existing tar road till it gets proper strength, followed by placing of panels. In the conventional system, we need to lay dry lean concrete (DLC) layer before pavement quality concrete (PQC), which is the top layer of cement concrete,” he said.

Khan said urban local bodies can construct cement concrete roads in congested areas, especially slums, using PPCP technology.

The technology can help the NMC to a great extent. Since the last nine years, the NMC is blocking roads for months for construction of cement concrete roads.

VNIT had invented the technology. Thr PWD had concretized a small stretch of Inner Ring Road using the technology in November 2018 on an experimental basis.

471,['5/02/2020'],Women who rarely step out fill city’s Shaheen Bagh,"Nagpur: Wearing burqas, women virtually stepped out of the veil as they prepared to spend a night under the domes at the protest venue in Teka Naka’s Farooq Nagar ground where a Shaheen Bagh-like atmosphere is attempted to be created.Nearly 600 women volunteers stayed put under one of the domes set up at the venue on Monday night until another group took over on Tuesday morning.A majority of them were young girls or women who otherwise remain confined to their homes and also those who work as daily wagers, who had come down at the cost of their earnings. This was the first time Nagpur women agitated all night, though without public address system.“I stay at home,” says 24-year-old Fatima Sheikh from Mominpura when asked to introduce herself. She discontinued education after class XII and went for soft courses like mehandi design and tailoring. “I hardly step out of home but the agitation has instilled courage in many other like me to take to the streets,” says Fatima, one of the volunteers who would take up night time agitation at the venue.Seen at the venue was 68-year-old Habib-un-Nisa who adds up to the family income by working as a daily wager in the onion trade. “I don’t mind if I don’t earn but will continue coming here,” she says.The CAA-NRC has prompted them to step out of homes and protests, was the stock reaction of the women. For CAA , they said the government will allow nationals from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan except Muslims and NRC will lead them to detention centres.“I’ll stay here in nights but not give up my veil. It’s my own choice,” says Fatima.Sheikh said before this, there were unsuccessful attempts to take away their hijaab as well by this government. “Mob lynching and triple talaq were among several other issues on which we remained silent. We never step out of home without a specific reason as we adhere to the purdah system. But, PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah have forced us to step out,” she said.Against the backdrop of shootings at Delhi on anti-CAA-NRC protesters, the women raised the slogan ‘Tum goli chalalo, hum nahi hatenge’ for most part of Tuesday. The second day of the agitation saw a bigger turnout of women who left the venue domes only during namaz timings.Homemaker Yasmeen Sheikh said she stayed back all night, though she rarely ventures out of home for anything else other than household affairs or functions. “At the end, it was announced to volunteer so I stayed back. All women were not allowed because of safety concerns,” she said.Yasmeen said the stay over is a silent protest.Fatima said she was disturbed by what was going on in the country. “Many lawful citizens will be thrown out of country after NRC,” she said.Shehnaaz Abdul Kalam, another homemaker, who prefers to stay within the realms of home, ridiculed Modi and Shah stating that it is because them they have unwillingly stepped out of homes. “To search for some thieves, they are checking the whole city,” she said.Homemaker Shabnam Ansari said they were ready to agitate for any number of years under the Shaheen Bagh dome. Similarly, Shamima Khan said they will not allow division on religious lines.Asked what if they face Delhi-like situation, they said, “Allah is mightier than the evil.”In Video: Anti-CAA protest: Women who rarely step out fill Nagpur's Shaheen Bagh",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73944087,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-86519,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/women-who-rarely-step-out-fill-citys-shaheen-bagh/articleshow/73944088.cms

Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The Congress may spring a surprise in Delhi like it did in the elections in neighbouring Haryana last year, senior party leader Randeep Singh Surjewala claimed as campaigning for the February 8 polls in Delhi closed on Thursday.

""Some news channels were giving us just two seats in Haryana but we won 31. It is going to happen again,"" he told a press conference.

Terming the BJP , which is in power at the Centre, and the ruling AAP in Delhi as ""Jhoothon ki Sarkar aur Jhoothon ke Sardar"", Surjewala accused them of failing in areas of health, pollution mitigation, education, clean drinking water supply and public transport in the national capital.

Union home minister Amit Shah has ""panicked"" as he feels that this time the BJP may not win more that the three seats it had won in the 2015 Delhi assembly polls, the Congress leader said.

473,['5/02/2020'],"Signs of rift in MVA govt? Cong leaders accuse NCP, Sena of ignoring them","This story is from February 5, 2020

Nagpur: Even as coalition partners in newly formed Maha Vikas Aghadi government are claiming that everything is hunky dory in their ranks, the situation is otherwise. Leaders, particularly from Congress, are deeply upset over the alleged humiliating treatment meted out to them by other two partners, which are stronger in numbers.

A Congress minister told TOI that they were not taken into the confidence by other two partners while taking major decisions. It was initially decided to have two deputy chief ministers from NCP and Congress each but at the end, they were ‘forced to settle’ with the Speaker’s post to Nana Patole, he said.

Endorsing the minister, the newly elected legislators from grand old party said they had even formed a group with a view to pressurize the ministers to do work in their respective constituencies. “We’ve decided to go together to any minister’s cabin so that our voices are heard. Otherwise, we’re hardly entertained by ministers, which included those from our party too. Being first timers, we’re not aspiring for ministerial berths, but want to focus on development works in our constituency, so that voters could re-elect us again,” a couple of them told TOI.

The cracks between the coalition partners are evident even at local level during Zilla Parishad polls. After winning the polls with a big margin, Congress leadership led by animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar allegedly refused to give deputy chairman’s post to NCP led by home minister Anil Deshmukh. The latter had wanted it for his son Sahil Deshmukh, according to NCP local activists.

While admitting that Congress leadership had denied them deputy chairman’s post, Deshmukh during a media interaction in the city had informed that they had requested for two important posts in the ZP later and expect the Congress to follow ‘coalition dharma’. When confronted, Kedar denied his involvement stating that all decisions were taken by former MPCC chief Manikrao Thakre and others.

A senior Congress leader told TOI that in the cabinet meetings Congress ministers were not given any weightage. “Even portfolios granted to us were of less significance which led to differences between our top party leaders. It was precisely the reason, our high command had earlier opposed our induction into the ministries and suggested only outside support to Shiv Sena and NCP,” he said.

Earlier, relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar from Congress was upset over allocation of poor portfolios to him, which was later rectified. In the meantime, the sulking minister not only skipped cabinet meetings, but also the special assembly session in Mumbai. There were rumours that he would eventually join BJP and was even invited by former minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule, after which he was allocated proper portfolios.

474,['5/02/2020'],"Mumbai gang siphons off Rs 20 crore with 4,000 fake FASTag refunds","This story is from February 5, 2020

Representative image

MUMBAI: The cyber crime cell of the city crime branch busted a gang running an online fraud to siphon off crores. By taking advantage of a loophole in a banking system, the gang had made 4,259 fraudulent FASTag recharge-refund claims and siphoned off Rs 20 crore.

A FASTag is fixed onto the windshield of a vehicle, and allows a motorist to make toll payments directly from a linked account, thus reducing the long queues at toll plazas. FASTags use Radio Frequency Indentification (RFID) technology to allow the direct payments.

The cyber crime cell arrested four people from parts of Karnataka who were beneficiaries of the fraud money. The four accused, identified as Purshottam Revanna (40), Kiran Manju (35), Rajesh Shivanna (34) and Rasanna alias Prakash Shivanna (37), were booked under the Information Technology Act and under sections for cheating and forgery of the IPC.

The complainant in the case, a bank, said that they had launched e-wallet services for their customers to purchase FASTags via apps. The bank also purchased software to handle the day-to-day transactions of this system.

After downloading the app, anyone could buy or recharge their FASTags using UPIs, said a police officer. A UPI, or a Unified Payments Interface, powers multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application, merging several banking features under one application.

Initially, the bank investigated the fraud internally, and found that unidentified persons had claimed huge refunds for FASTags. Some of the accounts that had claimed refunds were non-functioning or had zero balance.

A police officer said, ""Further technical investigations found that the gang had taken advantage of a loophole in the system to claim 4,259 refunds, and had siphoned the money from the bank ledger account. Between January 2019 and January 2020, the gang made 4,259 recharge transactions on FASTags, and then claimed a refund by showing that the KYC submission was erroneous. They caused a wrongful loss of Rs 19.8 crore.""

After forensic investigation, the cyber crime police tracked the beneficiaries of the refunds to Chennai, Bengaluru, and other parts of Karnataka. Four were arrested from Karnataka, while the police are looking for a few more people involved in the racket. The king pin of the fraud is also absconding.

The police added that the investigation would take a little longer to complete, as the accused had transferred money from one account to several different accounts in different parts of the country and withdrawn money from different ATMs, which would take time to track.

Nagpur: Lakadganj cops have procured permission from their superiors to visit Delhi to help the prosecution team of counsels, representing Maharashtra, ahead of the final hearing in Yug Chandak case on February 11 before a Supreme Court bench.

Though there was no official compulsion or requirement, cops volunteered to extend help to ensure gallows for the kidnappers and murderers of eight-year-old Yug in September 2014.

Yug’s murderers, Rajesh Daware and Arvind Singh, were awarded capital punishment by the trial court which was later upheld by the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court in 2016. The convicts had preferred appeal before the Supreme Court, which was last heard in 2018.

Following a plea by the counsels of Maharashtra, assisted by private advocates Rajendra Daga and Raheel Mirza, the apex court has fixed February 11 as the date for final hearing.

Senior PI Narendra Hiware of Lakadganj police station said he wanted to rush himself to help the prosecution team with the finer details of the case, but had to alter the plan. “I will send two constables who know the case in detail and share minute details with the prosecution before the hearing. Though there was no compulsion, we thought that it was moral responsibility to ensure gallows for Yug’s murderers for the sake of society,” he said.

476,['5/02/2020'],Govt to hold meet on civic body’s working,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Nagpur: In probably a first-of-its-kind move, the state government has organized a meeting to take review of Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) working. It is seen as Maha Vikas Aghadi’s (MVA) yet another step to take control over the BJP-ruled civic body.

On February 4, the state urban development department sent a letter to municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe asking him to be present in the meeting organized at 4.30pm on February 7 at Committee Hall, Mantralaya, Mumbai. “Chief secretary will take the review. He has directed him to appear in the meeting with detailed information related to the NMC,” letter stated.

It is a hot topic in the NMC that Mundhe, who is known as no-nonsense officer, has been posted here by the MVA government to take control over the civic body.

Earlier, the MVA government had appointed a committee of its ministers to control Nag River Pollution Abatement Project despite NMC being the executing agency. Guardian minister Nitin Raut had requested chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to again appoint Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) as the planning authority for gunthewari areas, which are currently under the NMC. Accordingly, Thackeray had sought opinions from the NMC and NIT.

To query on Mundhe being sent by the MVA government to take control over the NMC, mayor Sandip Joshi said in a press conference, “The government is the authority to appoint municipal commissioner, so he has nothing to do with it. Mundhe is a good officer and loves transparent governance. Therefore, I have welcomed Mundhe’s appointment at the NMC.”

“Mundhe could not meet me as I was out of the city for a couple of days when he assumed charge. Then, Mundhe went to Mumbai for meetings. Mundhe told me he is implementing decisions taken by me and the general body. The drive against encroachments is a fine example as Mundhe is implementing it because the general body framed a policy,” he said.

477,['5/02/2020'],It’s a boy! Baby born to Thai mom flying Qatar airline in Indian sky,"This story is from February 5, 2020

Kolkata: It was a tale of two happy landings. The first happened around 10km above sea level, the second at the Kolkata airport about an hour later.

The first was a touch-and-go affair, ending in the birth of a healthy baby who, legal experts said, could be spoilt for choice of citizenship.

The second, too, was an “emergency landing” but a much smoother affair, which saw a Qatar Airways flight touch down at the Kolkata airport before daybreak. It had taken off from Doha, Qatar, with 370 people on board; by the time it landed here — after a journey of more than 3,800 km — there was one extra flyer, weighing a little more than 2.5kg.

No one aboard flight QR 830 — least of all 23-year-old Wassana Promkasikorn — had bargained for all this when it left Doha at 10.30pm (IST) on Monday. Promkasikorn, working in Oman’s Sohar, was flying back home — in Bangkok, Thailand — to deliver her second child; she was 36 weeks pregnant and labour, her doctors had told her, should be a couple of weeks away.

All that, however, changed mid-air as Promkasikorn complained of labour pains a little less than four hours into the journey. Five crew members, trained to tackle medical emergencies, and a doctor travelling on the same flight gathered around the 23-year-old and helped her deliver a boy, around 2.15am on Tuesday, as the flight passed east of Raipur, Chhattisgarh, at a speed of 900-plus kmph and 10km above sea level.

The pilot, in the meanwhile, had contacted the Kolkata air traffic control, seeking a “medical emergency landing”. The flight landed safely — with one more passenger than it had when it started the journey — at Kolkata airport around 3.15 a.m. with emergency medical officers waiting in the airport’s apron area.

Mother and baby were wheeled into an ambulance and taken to Charnock Hospital on VIP Road, where both were doing fine. Flight 8R 830 continued its Bangkok journey a little later, Qatar Airways officials said.

Single-mother Promkasikorn, however, will have one more decision to make: about her son’s citizenship. “There are two primary options. Article 5 of the Indian Constitution allows anyone born in Indian territory to claim Indian citizenship. But the child is also eligible for a Thai citizenship (based on his mother’s nationality). So it will be the mother’s decision that will determine the boy’s citizenship,” Kolkata lawyer Anirban Guha Thakurta said.

478,['5/02/2020'],"Guv gets chopper, state chief secy meets him","This story is from February 5, 2020

Kolkata: Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha paid a visit to Raj Bhavan and spent more than two hours with Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Tuesday while the state government provided helicopter service to the governor for his Santiniketan trip during Basanta Utsav on March 6.

The developments came three days ahead of the Assembly session that begins on Friday when the governor will read out the speech prepared by the state government. Sinha called on Dhankhar at 6.10 pm on Tuesday, 24 hours after parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee and state finance minister Amit Mitra went to Raj Bhavan and spent 90 minutes with the governor. Chatterjee had been to Raj Bhavan even on Sunday.

Even as there is nothing unusual in Nabanna’s coming closer to Raj Bhavan, the recent spurt in visits marks a departure from the state government giving a “cold shoulder” to the constitutional head of state on grounds that he was acting “partisan”. Sources in Raj Bhavan hinted that senior ministers wanted Dhankhar to go by convention, pointing to the practice followed by his predecessors. The request comes a week after Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan put his difference with CM P Vijayan on record over CAA in the Kerala Assembly. Dhankhar has said he will abide by the Constitution in letter and spirit.

Dhankhar has repeatedly flagged his difference on various issues, ranging from the state’s anti-CAA stand to law and order and from running state universities to tackling students’ stir on campus. When CM Mamata Banerjee took to the streets against CAA in December, the governor had said: “People holding constitutional posts are bound by law to follow Constitution. And this law (CAA) is part of the Constitution.”

Dhankhar is likely to reiterate the view to the chief secretary if there is something against CAA in the draft speech. The state government withdrew advertisements against CAA after Dhankhar pointed out that the state government can’t do it. Law and order and higher education could be the other concern areas for agreement between Raj Bhavan and Nabanna.

Sensing this, the state government didn’t want to open another front with Raj Bhavan. The government readily accepted the governor’s requisition for copter service to Santiniketan, though it has denied the services on quite a few occasions.

State urban development minister Firhad Hakim said: “Helicopter service is provided as and when it is available. One should not link this to the other aspects of state administration.” Earlier, the governor was denied the service while travelling to Domkal in Murshidabad, Santipur in Nadia and Visva-Bharati in the recent past.

KOLKATA: More than 10,000 passengers who have reached Kolkata from China in the past two weeks have been allowed to leave the airport only after a thermal screening and filling up a self-reporting form about their personal and recent travel details. None of the passengers that TOI spoke to said they had been advised “home isolation” for 14 days — one of the most “stressed” points in an 8-point advisory issued by the Union health ministry on January 30.According to doctors, all these flyers are potential “silent carriers” who may show symptoms later, by when they would have already come in contact with hundreds of others and transmitted the disease. The novel coronavirus (nCoV) that has killed 425 people in China has an incubation period of up to 14 days.TOI spoke to multiple passengers who reached Kolkata from China and Hong Kong over the past four days and all of them said that neither the airport health officers nor anyone at the immigration had asked them to stay in home isolation for the next fortnight.“I had no clue I had to stay home. I returned on February 1 and over the next two days I caught up with two sets of friends, watched a movie, visited a shopping mall, ate at a restaurant and attended a family function. It was only on Monday that I learnt from media reports that we are supposed to be in isolation,” said a resident of Gariahat who works in Hong Kong.A student of Shangdong First Medical University who took a China Eastern flight back from Kunming on January 31 said she visited multiple hot spots in Kolkata and stayed at a friend’s house in Odisha before travelling to her home town in Haryana . All the while she used public transport.“At Kolkata airport I was not asked to undergo any tests apart from the thermal scan and was asked to fill up a form that had questions like my name, address and the cities I have visited in China and whether I had been to Wuhan in Hubei province in the last 14 days. It also asked if I had any symptoms of fever, cough or cold. I cleared the test and thought I was safe and didn’t need to stay indoors,” she said.Since January 30, all the three confirmed cases of nCoV in Kerala were diagnosed almost a week after they returned from China. And, all three first touched down in Kolkata and then took domestic flights to Kerala when they were already carrying the virus.“The virus may take up to 14 days to manifest. The majority of the infected people could remain without symptoms for more than a week, but they pose a bigger threat as many unsuspecting people come in contact with them. A fortnight’s screening is the only real full-proof measure to prevent the transmission,” said Joydeep Ghosh, internal medicine consultant at Fortis Hospital.In their defence, airport officials said, the last line of the self-declaration form the passengers have to sign asks the signatory to stay in isolation at home. Besides, fresh notices put up at the airport mentions home isolation.“We are asking passengers coming from Wuhan to stay indoors and are also reporting their details to the state government,” said Kaushik Bhattacharjee, the Kolkata airport director. He added that from Monday they have begun screening passengers coming from Bangkok and Singapore as well. “We have also isolated four aerobridges and flights from these destinations are being attached to these aerobridges only,” Bhattacharjee said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73948737,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-376471,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/10000-recent-arrivals-from-china-not-in-home-isolation/articleshow/73945900.cms

Kolkata: Padmaja Naidu Himalyan Zoological Park, also known as Darjeeling zoo, will soon get red pandas from Europe and Australia.

West Bengal Zoo Authority member secretary V K Yadav said the idea is to introduce new bloodlines to the current population at the zoo. “The international studbook keeper and the convener of Global Species Management Plan (GSMP) have agreed in-principle. While the females will be brought from zoos in Europe, the males will be brought from an Australian zoo. We won’t divulge the names of the zoos now,” Yadav said.

Two red pandas, Joel and Shine, will be sent to Berlin zoo from Darjeeling zoo on Wednesday. Yadav said they would be sent under an exchange programme under which five Mishmi takins were brought to Darjeeling zoo.

Mamata Banerjee addresses the gathering at Bongaon Stadium on Tuesday

BONGAON/RANAGHAT: Mamata Banerjee reached out to the border districts of North 24 Parganas and Nadia on Tuesday and asked people not to provide family data to census officers visiting them for household surveys.

The National Population Register (NPR) exercise is the first step towards NRC, the chief minister said, evoking epic ‘Mahabharata’ and calling on residents to frustrate “dussashan” BJP and the Uttar Pradesh CM’s ploy to bulldoze their writ by dividing people. “They are talking bullets to silence voices of dissent voices across the country,” she added.

Lashing out at BJP’s “conspiracy trap”, she said: “Don’t tell them everything. Don’t provide documents like land or house documents and ration cards if they ask for them. Don’t entertain them even if they come with West Bengal government identity cards. Some religious fanatics may reach your home with false identity cards. Pay heed only after I tell you to.”

Banerjee instead held that the Narendra Modi government could have emulated the developed countries and introduced green cards that give automatic citizenship to outsiders after some years. “There was no need for CAA. All these are being done to divide people, divert their attention from pressing needs like education and jobs,” the CM said, pointing to the mad rush for certificates in front of ration shops and municipalities. “They (BJP) looted piggy banks of mothers during notebandi, and are now trying to sell out Air India, BSNL, railways and public sector banks.”

Speaking at a packed Bongaon Stadium, she reminded the audience how Bengal gave a miss to the NPR meet in Delhi on January 17. “I didn’t go to the NPR meet. But representatives from other states who attended it said there are six clauses in NPR. Of them, one demands certificates (birth certificates) of three generations as proof of citizenship. States are opposed to the clause. The Centre has said it is not mandatory, but hasn’t dropped the clause. Now, if you don’t provide these documents, they won’t ask for it. They will simply mark you as a D (doubtful) voter. But how many of you have birth certificates of your parents?” the CM said.

Banerjee then strummed the chords of Bengali sub-nationalism to take the wind out of BJP’s sail in the Matua belt comprising as many nine assembly constituencies — Bongaon Uttar, Bongaon Dakshin, Swarupnagar, Bagda, Gaighata, Kalyani , Ranaghat Uttar, Ranaghat Dakshin and Chakdaha — after the Modi government promulgated CAA to provide citizenship to Hindu refugees from Bangladesh.

The new law has traction among the Matuas here as they hail from Gopalganj in Bangladesh.

The CM also cited instances of violence against Bengali labourers in Delhi, Karnataka , Uttar Pradesh and Kashmir in support of her claim that the BJP government at the Centre is out to divide Bengal and Bengalis.

Banerjee donned a gamchha (towel) — the traditional attire of the Namasudras/Matuas — to renew her connect with the community after Matua matriarch Barama’s demise. “We have a living relationship with Matuas for the last 25 years. I will tell you not to fill up the citizenship application form. If you do that, you lose what you already have,” the CM said.

Congress MP Shashi Tharoor

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday said the government ’s account of its accomplishments, read out by the President, was an exercise in which “facts gave way to fiction” and whose “soaring rhetoric” was divorced from the “abject reality of our country’s worrying social and economic situation”.

Taking part in the debate on motion of thanks to the President’s address in Lok Sabha, Tharoor also made sarcastic references to the government’s flagship schemes like ‘Start-up India’ and ‘Make in India’ among others. The debate will conclude on Wednesday with PM Narendra Modi expected to reply around noon. He accused the Modi government of “partitioning” India's soul by launching a “fundamental assault” on democratic and secular structure of the country by dividing the country into “Hindus vs Muslims”, “us vs they” and “Ramzade vs ...I won’t say”.

“Of course, there was the usual lip service paid to Skill India, Digital India and Start-up India, but no mention of Standup India — since you are so busy banning stand-up comedians — and no admission that your government’s schemes should really be renamed Sit Down India, Shut Down India and Shut Up India,” Tharoor said.

In response, BJP MP S P Singh said Tharoor’s speech was devoid of facts.

MUMBAI: With its finances under pressure, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation ( BMC ) on Tuesday kept taxes unchanged, but sought to raise revenue by regularising illegal use of spaces inside buildings, hiking certain fees like trade licences and birth certificates, and ramping up its effort to recover pending property tax bills.The Rs 33,441-crore civic budget for 2020-21, an increase of around Rs 3,000 crore from last year, was tabled by municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi in the civic standing committee meeting on Tuesday. No new mega projects were announced, but existing ones like the coastal road and Goregaon-Mulund Link Road received generous funds.The BMC proposed to raise Rs 600 crore by regularising unauthorised use of flower beds, lofts and car decks by building occupants by charging a premium. It also hopes to collect Rs 6,768 crore as property tax, including at least 10% of the outstanding Rs 15,000 crore, in the next financial year. This is bound to be an uphill task because between April 2019 and January 2020, it managed to collect just Rs 2,878 crore as property tax.It will revise charges and fees for trade licences, birth certificates, and market licences by a flat 5% every year to keep up with inflation, said Pardeshi. The commissioner said establishment cost (salaries and wages) had touched 50%, which was very high in comparison to the 35% norm set by the state government. The BMC plans to reduce it to 44% in the budget estimates for the new financial year starting April 2020.Despite the revenue stress, the bigger budget size is due to increased allocation in capital expenditure (Rs 14,638 crore) from last year’s Rs 11,480 crore. Capital expenditure involves spending on development projects to improve infrastructure like roads, drains, bridges, solid waste management, etc.Further, revenue expenditure has been trimmed from Rs 19,205 crore to Rs 18,796 crore after cutting establishment costs like overtime allowances. The BMC proposes to invest surplus money in government bonds and debentures.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73947959,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-207072,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-to-regularise-illegal-use-of-building-spaces-earn-rs-600-crore/articleshow/73947962.cms

Work delay costs two firms Metro contracts

Continuing its crackdown on delays in Metro projects, the MMRDA on Tuesday ended the contracts of Simplex Infrastructures Ltd and the MBZ-RCC joint venture that were working on two stretches and a car depot on the Rs 11,000-crore D N Nagar - Mandale Metro 2B corridor. While Simplex was working on an elevated viaduct, MBZ -RCC had been appointed for construction of an elevated corridor and the depot. Simplex has completed only 5% of the work against the expected 65% in 30 months, while MBZ-RCC has finished even less. The action comes a day after Simplex was fired from the Andheri-Dahisar route.A day after annoucing the contract of Simplex Infrastructures Ltd was terminated for Metro Line 7, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority said it had terminated the contract of the infrastructure major and another firm, MBZ-RCC joint venture, which were appointed to construct two stretches and a depot on the Metro 2B corridor between DN Nagar and Mandale, for delay in executing works.The 23.5-km DN Nagar to Mankhurd Metro-2B corridor is slated to have 22 stations. MMRDA has set a deadline of November 2022 to commission this line. MMRDA will now appoint new contractors. Metropolitan commissioner RA Rajeev said, “We have served termination notices to Simplex and MBZ-RCC for line B. The process of encashing bank guarantee has also been initiated. MMRDA is serious about completing projects in time and will not spare any contracting agency that delays the project. We gave a long rope to these agencies and, after following all procedures, we have terminated their contracts.”MMRDA had appointed Simplex Infrastructure in January 2018 to design and construct a 12-km viaduct and 11 stations, but it has managed to complete only 5% of the work against the expected 65% in 30 months, said a source.

NEW DELHI: The number of road fatalities increased to 417 per day last year till September, the road transport ministry told Rajya Sabha on Monday. In 2018, road accidents claimed 415 lives a day.

In a written reply, road transport minister Nitin Gadkari said road fatalities were maximum at over 1.5 lakh in 2018 and stood at close to 1.13 lakh till September 30, 2019, as per provisional estimates shared by states.

This increase was registered despite several government efforts to put a check on road deaths, including passage of amendments to the Motor Vehicles Act with provisions for higher penalties for violators of traffic rules. “The impact of the change in law can be assessed when we get data of road accidents and fatalities between September and December. The new provisions came into effect on September 1. It will be interesting to see the trends in states that have notified the law and others who are yet to fall in line,” a government official said.

The marginal rise in fatalities also comes as bad news just two weeks before global leaders meet in Stockholm to assess the progress made by countries to check road deaths.
