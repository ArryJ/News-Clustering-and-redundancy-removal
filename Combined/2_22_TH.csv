1,2020/02/22,"Asian wrestling | Ravi Dahiya, India’s lone gold winner","On a day Bajrang Punia was expected to raise the Indian flag, the crowd at the KD Jadhav Indoor Stadium had to wait till late night, the last bout of the day to be precise, to listen to the Indian national anthem.

Ravi Dahiya was the lone bright spot for the host, expected to rule the medals table in the men’s freestyle category on the day but managing only a handful of silvers instead on day five of the Senior Asian Wrestling Championships here.

Dahiya, who won bronze at the 2019 World Championships in the 57kg to qualify for Tokyo Olympics, began in dominating fashion — a 14-5 win against former world champion Yuki Takahashi of Japan — and ended the same way, thrashing Hikmatullo Vohidov of Tajikistan 10-0 in 2 minutes 38 seconds for the title.

Bajrang, though, failed to find a way past the nippy and strong Takuto Otoguro of Japan, whom he last played in the 2018 World Championships final, with the same result. Having dominated his initial bouts, conceding just two points through three matches, Bajrang was expected to put up a tough fight. Instead, the Indian Olympic medal hope succumbed to 10-2 defeat.

Satyavrat Kadian, who overwhelmed his opponents in under one minute in both his morning bouts to reach his maiden final in the competition, was no match for two-time Under-23 world champion Mojtaba Mohammadshafie Goleij of Iran in the 97kg, losing 10-0.

Gaurav Baliyan was the only one to put up a decent fight in the final, going down 7-5 in the 79kg category to Arsalan Budazhapov of Kyrgyzstan with most of the points being scored in the last 30 seconds of the match.

Naveen was the only one to not make the final, losing 2-3 to Amirhossein Ali Hosseini of Iran in the semis before going down 12-1 to Meirzhan Ashirov of Kazakhstan in the bronze medal play-off.

The results:

57kg: 1. Ravi Dahiya (IND), 2. Hikmatullo Vohidov (TJK), 3. Yuki Takahashi (JPN), Bekbolot Myrzanazar Uulu (KGZ).

A deepfake video that shows Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk in a “Star Trek” episode has garnered a lot of interest online because it appears quite realistic.

The video posted by YouTube account The Fakening on Wednesday has been viewed by over 117,000 times so far on the Google-owned video-sharing platform.

“Deepfakes” are Artificial Intelligence-generated videos of real people doing and saying fictional things.

Also Read Deepfakes enter Indian election campaigns

In this deepfake video of the Amazon CEO and the Tesla CEO, the two are seen playing roles in the pilot episode of the original Star Trek, “The Cage”, The Verge reported.

While Bezos is seen playing a Talosian alien, Musk plays Captain Christopher Pike.

Pike is captured by the Talosian aliens in a bid to enslave him. The Talosian aliens want to use Pike to breed humans that will be used to rebuild a destroyed society.

As Pike tries to escape throughout the episode, the Talosians eventually come to the conclusion that that humans’ attempt to escape captivity would not make them a good fit for that plan.

The video makes it seem like the conversation is only between the Talosian alien and Captain Pike.

That makes it difficult for people to follow the conversation, as in the original episode, a number of other characters played a critical role in the conversations.

Even though the scene appears confusing, many social media users found the deepfake quite impressive.

They particularly appreciated the character shown to be played by Bezos.

“You don’t even need to apply the deepfake to the Talosian. Bezos looks identical,” said one Twitter user.

“Musk looked a little off but the Bezos was perfect,” wrote another.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/w7sojj/article30887032.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22THDEEPFAKE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/deepfake-video-shows-bezos-musk-in-star-trek-episode/article30887005.ece
3,2020/02/22,"Trapped at home, Hubei residents feel the strain","The virus-hit province has enforced a ‘sealed management’ policy

During weeks holed up in her grandmother’s apartment with 10 relatives and eating a restricted diet, Chinese teenager Li Yuxuan says tempers have frayed.

Ms. Li and her family are among the millions of people across China’s Hubei province, epicentre of the COVID-2019 outbreak, who are subject to official orders to stay at home.

Officials and volunteers have sealed off buildings, erected barricades and stepped up surveillance to ensure compliance with the ban on movement, measures that are taking a toll on many in the community.

“Every day there’s fighting. Every day we sigh. Every day I’m scolded,” Ms. Li, 19, said, using WeChat from the apartment in Ezhou, a city near the provincial capital of Wuhan. Ms. Li said the family had eaten the same combination of white rice, cabbage and peanuts for three weeks, stinting on portions due to limits on the numbers of people from each household allowed out to shop.

Cities and villages across China have taken measures to prevent the spread of the virs, but the protocols in Hubei are the most extreme.

The province, which is home to 60 million people, announced a “sealed management” policy a week ago that effectively prevents residents from leaving their homes, further isolating a population that has been living under a transport lockdown since late January.

Hubei’s sealed management policy depends heavily on residential committees, a network of volunteers who carry out government and Communist Party orders at the grassroots level in coordination with private employees of residential compounds.

Non-residents are also caught in the Hubei net, with many who were in the province to visit relatives over Lunar New Year now stuck far from their homes and livelihoods. “The rent, the water bill, the electricity bill, I still have to pay them,” said Cao Dezhao, 28, who owns a small IT business in Jinan, in eastern Shandong province, but is stuck in Wuhan after he came to visit his in-laws. “I could be bankrupt at the end of this epidemic.”

Experts say that essential needs, including monitoring of mental health, should be ensured for people under quarantine or containment measures.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hh3dv6/article30890998.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23-CHINA-WUHANOUTBREAK21,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trapped-at-home-hubei-residents-feel-the-strain/article30890999.ece
4,2020/02/22,Conservatives take lead after Iran election sees low turnout,"This is a blow to President Rouhani’s moderate faction

Conservatives took an early lead on Saturday as the first results of Iran’s parliamentary election came in, boosted by a predicted low turnout following the disqualification of nearly half the candidates.

Friday’s election followed months of steeply escalating tensions between Iran and the U.S. Voters had been widely expected to shun the polls, disillusioned by unfulfilled promises and struggling to cope in a country whose economy has buckled under harsh U.S. sanctions.

Mass disqualification

About half of the 16,000-odd candidates were disqualified. Among them were many reformist and moderate candidates — including dozens of sitting MPs — leaving conservatives with virtually no competition. By midday (0830 GMT) on Saturday, votes had been counted in 71 constituencies out of 208, according to National Elections Committee figures reported by semi-official news agency ISNA.

Tehran is the biggest catch in the election with 30 seats. The conservative and ultra-conservative alliance appeared to have a comfortable edge in the capital in early results, the committee’s spokesman Esmail Mousavi said on state television. Most votes went to the first three names on the alliance’s list, he said.

Final results for both the capital and other provinces would be announced by early Sunday at the latest, he added. If the results are confirmed, it will mean President Hassan Rouhani’s slender majority of reformists and moderates elected with fanfare four years ago is nearly purged.

An unofficial tally published by Fars news agency said 183 of Parliament’s 290 seats had already been decided, with conservative candidates winning 135 of them. Reformists were a distant second at 20, it said, adding independents had won 28 seats.

Turnout was estimated at around 40% nationwide and 30% in Tehran at the scheduled close of polls on Friday, according to Fars.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/3nnxsj/article30890839.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23-IRAN-ELECTION1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/conservatives-take-lead-after-iran-election-sees-low-turnout/article30890840.ece
5,2020/02/22,"More than 10,000 killed or wounded in 2019: UN","More than 10,000 civilians were killed or wounded in Afghanistan’s war last year, the UN announced on Saturday. According to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), 3,404 civilians were killed and 6,989 were injured in 2019.

While the number was down 5% from 2018, it was nonetheless the sixth year straight that the war caused more than 10,000 casualties, UNAMA said.

The 5% drop in casualties was attributed to the decrease in activity by the local Islamic State affiliate in eastern Afghanistan, which was largely wiped out last year.

The UNAMA report said there had been significant fluctuations in violence throughout 2019, coinciding with gains and setbacks made during U.S.-Taliban negotiations.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/more-than-10000-killed-or-wounded-in-2019-un/article30890755.ece
6,2020/02/22,Afghans celebrate as week-long truce with Taliban begins,"This could be followed by a peace deal on February 29

A week-long, partial truce appeared to be largely holding across Afghanistan on Saturday, with jubilant civilians celebrating in the streets to mark a potentially historic turning point in the war, even as isolated attacks threatened to undermine the process.

The Taliban, U.S. and Afghan forces have all agreed to a so-called “reduction in violence” marking only the second lull in fighting since 2001. “It is the first morning that I go out without the fear of being killed by a bomb or suicide bomber. I hope it continues forever,” Kabul taxi driver Habib Ullah said, while in other parts of the country people danced in the streets.

Attack in Balkh

However in Balkh province in the north, Taliban fighters attacked a district headquarters near the provincial capital of Mazar-i-Sharif, killing two Afghan soldiers, said an official. There were also reports of a separate incident in central Uruzgan province.

General Scott Miller, who leads U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, did not directly address those incidents, but stressed that Western forces would continually monitor the situation. In the event of any breaches of the truce, Gen. Miller said the U.S. would communicate with the Taliban through various channels set up in Doha, where the insurgents have a political office.

The partial truce is expected to set the conditions for Washington and the insurgents to sign a deal in Doha on February 29 that could, ultimately, pull U.S. troops out after more than 18 years and launch war-weary Afghanistan into an uncertain future. A successful week would show the Taliban can control their forces and demonstrate good faith ahead of any signing.

Details of how exactly the reduction in violence will work have remained scant.

The U.S. has said there is an “understanding” for a “significant and nationwide reduction in violence across Afghanistan”, while Afghan security forces will remain “on active defence status” during the week.

In Kandahar, one insurgent said he had received orders to stand down — but another said he had only been ordered to refrain from attacking major cities and highways.

The U.K. is ditching its European Union-style burgundy passports and returning to the traditional British blue - but the documents will be made in the European Union (EU).

The British government said on Saturday that passports in the “iconic” navy colour, used between 1921 and 1988, will be issued starting next month. People with the current burgundy passports can use them until they expire.

Some supporters of Britain’s exit from the EU welcomed the symbolic change. Home Secretary Priti Patel said that “by returning to the iconic blue and gold design, the British passport will once again be entwined with our national identity and I cannot wait to travel on one”.

Opponents of Brexit pointed out that the passports will be made by French-Dutch company Gemalto, which won the contract to produce them.

8,2020/02/22,COVID-19: South Korea reports 229 more virus cases,"The national toll of 433 is the highest outside China apart from the Diamond Princess cruise ship

South Korea reported 229 more coronavirus cases on Saturday, the sharpest spike in infections yet, with many new cases involving patients being treated in hospital for mental health issues.

The national toll of 433 is the highest outside China apart from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, with the jump in cases at the hospital in the southern city of Cheongdo following a similar spike among members of a religious sect in the nearby city of Daegu.

Among the new cases was a Samsung Electronics employee at a plant in Gumi, 200 kilometres (210 miles) southeast of Seoul, leading the tech giant to say it would suspend operations there until on Monday.

Meanwhile, 95 of the newly confirmed cases were “related” to patients or staff at Cheongdo Daenam Hospital in Cheongdo, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.

“Most of the hospital's patients who have been diagnosed are those who had been staying as inpatients for mental illnesses,” Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told reporters.

Some cases show “no confirmed epidemiological connections”, meaning they are not sure where or how they contracted the virus, he added.

Also Read South Korea, Iran report first virus deaths

Authorities reported another death on Saturday, taking the toll to two. Both victims had been inpatients at the hospital.

Separately, more than 200 members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus have now been infected, starting with a 61-year-old woman who attended at least four services at the church's Daegu branch before being diagnosed.

KCDC said some 9,300 Shincheonji members in Daegu have either been quarantined at facilities or been asked to stay at home. Among them, 1,261 said they had symptoms, health officials added.

9,2020/02/22,"Decolonisation must be guided by aspirations, needs of communities living in territories: UN chief","“The concerns of the peoples of the territories are varied, and it is our collective responsibility to amplify their voices,” Guterres said at the first meeting of the 2020 session of the Special Committee on Decolonisation

With 17 non-self-governing territories remaining worldwide, United Nations chief Antonio Guterres has said that decolonisation is a process that has to be guided by the aspirations and needs of the communities living in the territories.

At the opening of the latest session of the UN Special Committee dealing with decolonisation, Secretary-General Guterres on Friday said that since the UN was established in 1945 more than 80 former colonies have gained independence.

Today, 17 territories remain, mainly in the Americas and the Pacific. Many are even facing “very real and pressing challenges,” he told the committee.

“Decolonisation is a process that has to be guided by the aspirations and needs of the communities living in the territories. The concerns of the peoples of the territories are varied, and it is our collective responsibility to amplify their voices,” Guterres said at the session, which he called one of the defining mandates of the global Organisation.

“The vast majority of the territories are small islands on the frontlines of climate change. Many have faced devastating natural disasters. Others are struggling to build sustainable and self-sufficient economies, he said.

We must continue to serve as a forum for meaningful dialogue between Territories and administering Powers to enable the peoples of the territories to make informed decisions about their future.

The non-self-governing territories are Western Sahara in Africa, Anguilla, Bermuda, British Virgin islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands (Malvinas), Montserrat, Saint Helena, Turks and Caicos Islands and United States Virgin Islands in Atlantic & Caribbean, Gibraltar in Europe and American Samoa, French Polynesia, Guam, New Caledonia, Pitcairn and Tokelau in the Pacific.

The Secretary-General, who is from Portugal, also spoke about his deep connection to the issue.

“Indeed, I can never forget the fact that it was thanks to the liberation movements of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau, and their struggle for independence, that the Portuguese Army conducted the April (1974) revolution that led to democracy in my own country,” he said.

People living in the world’s remaining territories are still waiting for the promise of self-government to be fulfilled, he said. With the Timor-Leste being the last to achieve this milestone nearly 20 years ago, the UN chief described the decolonisation agenda as slow, but still moving forward.

He pointed to New Caledonia, a French territory in the Pacific, which will hold a second independence referendum in September. The first was in 2018.

Decolonisation is certainly one of the most significant chapters in the UN’s history, according to the Secretary-General, who commended the key role played by the Committee.

UN engagement derives from the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples , as stipulated in the UN Charter, the Organisation’s founding document.

The Special Committee on Decolonisation examines the application of a 1960 General Assembly declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.

Ambassador Keisha McGuire of Grenada is the chair, which she described as an uplifting responsibility .

The death toll in China from the new coronavirus outbreak rose by 109, the National Health Commission said on February 22, bringing the total number of fatalities to 2,345.

Another 397 new cases were reported nationwide, down from nearly 900 officially reported February 21, bringing the total number of cases to over 76,000.

The drop in new cases of the novel coronavirus came as officials in Hubei province – whose capital city Wuhan is the epicentre the outbreak – were ordered to revise figures to clear “doubt” around the data.

The number of new cases nationwide for February 19 was revised up to 820 up from 394 previously reported, the National Health Commission said on February 22.

It also adjusted upwards the total confirmed cases for February 20 by over 400 cases to 75,891.

The decision to amend Hubei's past data, which was announced on February 21 by local authorities, is the latest in a string of changes made to Hubei's counting method — further complicating efforts to track the spread of the illness.

Last week, Chinese health officials added patients from Hubei who had been diagnosed via clinical methods including lung imaging on top of those confirmed by lab tests.

But on February 20, Hubei officials backtracked the decision and deducted 279 cases — which they were ordered to re-add to the count on February 21.

11,2020/02/22,"Under pressure, Bloomberg says 3 women can be released from non-disclosure pacts","At the Las Vegas debate, Elizabeth Warren confronted Mr. Bloomberg about his company's record regarding claims of workplace discrimination and harassment.

Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg said on Friday that his company has identified three women bound by non-disclosure agreements regarding his past conduct and that they would be released from their accords if they choose.

In a statement, Mr. Bloomberg, who runs media conglomerate Bloomberg LP, said the agreements concern “comments they said I had made,” and that the women should contact his company for a release.

The agreements have been a source of fierce criticism from rival candidate U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who mentioned them at the presidential debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday and again at a televised town hall on Thursday.

Mr. Bloomberg also said that he was ending the company's long-standing practice of requiring such confidentiality agreements when settlements are reached with complaining employees.

“I've done a lot of reflecting on this issue over the past few days, and I've decided that for as long as I'm running the company, we won't offer confidentiality agreements to resolve claims of sexual harassment or misconduct going forward,” he said.

The agreements, Bloomberg said, “promote a culture of silence in the workplace and contribute to a culture of women not feeling safe or supported.”

At the Las Vegas debate, Ms. Warren confronted Mr. Bloomberg about his company's record regarding claims of workplace discrimination and harassment.

“The mayor has to stand on his record,” Ms. Warren said. “And what we need to know is exactly what's lurking out there.

12,2020/02/22,Bernie Sanders condemns any Russian influence in election,"The Vermont senator issued a statement immediately after The Washington Post reported U.S. officials have told Mr. Sanders that Russia was trying to help his campaign

Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Friday condemned Russian efforts to interfere in the 2020 election.

The Vermont senator issued a statement immediately after The Washington Post reported U.S. officials have told Mr. Sanders that Russia was trying to help his campaign. The statement did not confirm the report.

Mr. Sanders wrote: I don’t care, frankly, who Putin wants to be president. My message to Putin is clear: Stay out of American elections, and as president I will make sure that you do.

Mr. Sanders’s response was a sharp contrast from that of President Donald Trump, who has pushed back at the assessment of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia has interfered in elections on his behalf.

Federal investigators in 2018 charged 13 Russians in a covert social media campaign that prosecutors said was aimed at dividing public opinion on hot-button social issues as well as propping up Sanders and Republican candidate Trump while also denigrating Hillary Clinton, the eventual Democratic nominee.

Organizers of that Russian effort circulated an outline of themes for future social media content, with instructions to use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump—we support them), according to the indictment.

Shortly before news of the Russians’ interference in Mr. Sanders’ campaign was released on Friday, Mr. Trump told supporters in Las Vegas that he heard Democrats were trying to start a rumor ... that Putin wants to make sure I get elected.

“Listen to this, so doesn’t he want to see who the Democrat is going to be? Wouldn’t he rather have, let’s say Bernie?” Mr. Trump asked.

Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane, in 1988 spent their honeymoon in the Soviet Union, Mr. Trump noted.

‘Autocratic thug’

In a statement issued by the Sanders’ campaign, the leading Democratic presidential contender condemned Mr. Trump’s approach to continued reports of foreign interference in U.S. elections.

“Unlike Donald Trump, I do not consider Vladimir Putin a good friend. He is an autocratic thug who is attempting to destroy democracy and crush dissent in Russia,” Mr. Sanders said.

“Let’s be clear, the Russians want to undermine American democracy by dividing us up and, unlike the current president, I stand firmly against their efforts, and any other foreign power that wants to interfere in our election.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a3mqw8/article30785614.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11-SRIRAM-SANDERS1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bernie-sanders-condemns-any-russian-influence-in-election/article30886409.ece
13,2020/02/22,Harvey Weinstein jury keeps deliberating after suggesting hung on most serious counts,"The jury asked Justice James Burke if they could be unanimous on the other three counts, which include first degree rape and criminal sexual assault and could carry a prison term of up to 25 years.

Jurors weighing rape and sexual assault charges against Harvey Weinstein continued deliberating on Friday after asking the judge presiding over the case whether they could be hung on two counts of predatory sexual assault.

Conviction on those counts could put the former movie producer behind bars for life.

The jury asked Justice James Burke if they could be unanimous on the other three counts, which include first degree rape and criminal sexual assault and could carry a prison term of up to 25 years.

Mr. Burke told the jurors it is not uncommon for juries to have difficulty reaching a unanimous verdict, but that most are eventually able to do so.

“Please resume your deliberations,” he said.

The jury is expected to end their discussions at 3 p.m. ET (2000 GMT) and resume deliberating on Monday.

Weinstein, 67, had been charged with raping Jessica Mann, a one-time aspiring actress, and sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi.

Anna Sciorra, best known for her role in HBO's “The Sopranos,” testified that Weinstein came to her New York apartment one winter night in 1993 or 1994, raped her and then forced oral sex on her.

That accusation is too old to be charged as a separate crime, but serves as an aggravating factor for the most serious charge in the case, predatory sexual assault.

Jurors can convict Weinstein of predatory sexual assault if they find that he committed the assault against Sciorra and at least one of the alleged crimes against Haleyi or Mann.

Aniston spoke to talk show host Ellen DeGeneres about a possible new Friends project saying, “We would love for there to be something, but we don't know what that something is. So we're just trying. We're working on something.”

The unscripted cast reunion special, which will be directed by Ben Winston, along with all 10 seasons of the Emmy-winning series, will be available to subscribers at the launch of HBO Max in May.

Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal said the six stars would receive between $2.25 million and $2.5 million as part of the deal.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/3eeahv/article30886620.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Friends-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/friends-cast-to-reunite-for-an-hbo-max-special/article30886621.ece
15,2020/02/22,"I, as a voter, protest","A man from a minority community in a deeply racist Britain writes to the Prime Minister asking him to resign in no uncertain terms. And this, in 1956

On Facebook recently, a friend posted a letter written by her father. My friend’s father, M.V., had moved from India to Britain in the late 1930s, just before the start of World War II. After the war, M.V. stayed on in London working in the Indian High Commission. The image on Facebook is a copy of the actual letter sent via post. Typewritten and just a page long, the letter is a fine example of the courteous yet pithy English in use at the time. The addressee’s name is on the top left: ‘Sir Anthony Eden K.G, Prime Minister, 10 Downing Street, London SW 1’. The date on the top right says November 4, 1956.

Anyone with some knowledge of post-war history would recognise the date as being just after the start of what came to be known as the Suez Crisis. The ‘crisis’ was a polite word for a tripartite attack on Egypt by Britain, France and Israel. Egypt, ruled by military strongman Gamal Abdel Nasser, had nationalised the Suez Canal, and the three countries conspired to launch a military attack to take back control. In late October 1956, troops from the invading alliance seized control of the canal and surrounding areas.

However, the cabal of three hadn’t informed the U.S. of their plan and things rapidly came unstuck as both America and the Soviet Union openly berated the invaders. Britain and France were forced to withdraw by December and the last of the Israeli forces pulled out from the occupied areas in March 1957. The whole fiasco exposed Britain and France as still nurturing imperialist ambitions, while simultaneously demonstrating to the world that they were no longer genuine world powers.

The letter by M.V. was written well before most of these events, but we see how quickly he has grasped both what is happening and what is about to follow. ‘Sir,’ he begins by giving a small tithe of compliments and politeness, ‘Nobody admired your action more than I did when, for your principles, you resigned at the time of Munich.’ After the brief first paragraph though, the correspondent pulls no punches. ‘It is therefore with all the greater sorrow and shame that I, as a voter, protest against your criminal action in attacking Egypt — against the wishes of the United Nations — and without a shred of moral justification.’

Petty act

Very quickly the writer goes into all-out attack: ‘What have you accomplished? The canal is blocked; Britain’s oil supplies are endangered; except for France, the whole world detests Britain’s imperialist action. Could political ineptitude go further?’ This is followed by: ‘This is not the action of a brave Prime Minister defending his country’s honour. It is the action of a petty, petulant bully, trying to convince himself he is as great as his predecessor.’ The last passage is particularly cutting, the final swipe, of course, referring to Winston Churchill, whose large shadow hung over every Prime Minister who came after him for the next 20 years, especially the ones from Churchill’s own Tory party.

The letter ends with another deadly swipe, neatly tying it to the beginning, when M.V. quotes the exhortation in Parliament to Neville Chamberlain, the Prime Minister responsible for the Munich debacle. ‘The only honourable course left to you sir... is to resign immediately and let the rule of morality and law prevail again. In the words of Mr. Leopold Amery on the occasion of another great crisis in this country’s history, Go! In the name of God, go!’

Sharp language

Looking at this letter now, in the time of Messrs Trump, Johnson and Modi, the phrase ‘petty, petulant bully’ stands out, as do a few other things:

The man writing the letter is from a minority community; at the time of writing, Britain is a deeply racist society with many still suffering from the hangover of jingoistic empire; this is technically a time of war and also of a potentially huge international humiliation; and yet, this man, not powerful, not overly connected in terms of position or influence, this man who claims his authority by the simple phrase, ‘I, as a voter’, spells it out to the country’s Prime Minister, in clear, sharp language, telling him to eject himself from office with speed. The letter was written on November 4. We will never know if Eden or anyone close to him ever read it.

However, just over two months later, despite serious attempts to save his job, Anthony Eden was obliged to follow M.V.’s advice and resign.

16,2020/02/22,The Dolly Parton challenge and the performance of identities,"The challenge tells us that we are counted and we account for something, even if only as a type of potato

This new Dolly Parton challenge has me all aflutter. Because unlike Dolly Parton, who appears perfectly coiffured in all four quadrants of the aforementioned meme, I find it a chore to keep body, soul, and hair in place. I am far from the “woman who can do it all.” But I still love the meme.

For those not in the know, the Dolly Parton challenge involves posting profile pictures from four social media platforms — Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Tinder — in one collage. I find this hilarious in many ways.

For once, we have been freed to laugh at the absurdity of our curated lives and reminded that our “hypocrisies” are available for the world to see. (Some of us have, of course, used this as an opportunity to multiply our ridiculousness, posing perfectly for each handle, but that’s a column for another day). That all the hours we spent choosing photographs, considering consequences, counting views, must reckon with the laughter that is the only counter to narcissism.

Such contradiction in the hashtag universe, however, merely provides fodder for hating (double/ quadruple standards!) or loving (so good at this game!). Each of these calls — for seamlessness on the one hand, and savviness on the other — betrays something of the ways in which we consume others. And ourselves.

We like types. We want to pin down people. In order to figure out how to orient ourselves towards them. The social theorists call this structuralism — every element in a system is held in place vis-à-vis its tensions with and differences from another. The important thing to understand here is that neither is any element stable by itself nor does either possess intrinsic meaning.

Hall of mirrors

This is also how identity functions, as an endless hall of mirrors. We curate ourselves for each of our social media platforms based on how we would like our imagined audience to see us, and as a result we only perceive ourselves in relation to the ways that we think we are apprehended. See what I did there? Stay with me; it’ll make sense soon enough.

This is where the Dolly Parton challenge delights me. For, by presenting to us the continued hollowness of our identity choices, it tells us that there may be other ways to live outside these echo chambers.

Long years ago, my friends and I, on the job market after a marketing and communications degree, were willing participants in a cultural phenomenon called the Myers-Briggs test. Over many sets of questions seeking to understand what sort of people we were, the algorithm went on to classify us into combinations of Introverted Vs. Extraverted (sic), Sensing Vs. Intuitive, Thinking Vs. Feeling, and Judging Vs. Perceiving. We soon realised that we could be any combination of the above on any given day. We performed our chosen personality by answering questions accordingly, exposing to some of us the superficiality and limitedness of types, and the boring nature of the bureaucratic world that needs workers and not humans.

Seductive tests

The appetite for knowing the self through these boxes does not seem to have quelled, however. I continue to take great pleasure in taking tests of various kinds telling me exactly who I am. You’d think that by now, I would know better, or at the least have some idea of self as accumulated test knowledge.

Typology — what kind of a sun-sign/ waffle/ volcano/ rockstar/ colour are you? — is a seductive proposition. For it tells you that somewhere in the universe, someone has clocked you. You are counted and you account for something, even if only as a type of potato. That in an adult life, beset by invisibility, endless work, and the contradictions of a world too complex to be quelled, it’s nice to know that someone (not god), knows you. Even if the knower is only an algorithm. And by the fact of being known, life can now have meaning.

The danger, of course, is that in the thrall of such longing to be acknowledged, we forget to offer the same courtesy back. A hall of mirrors, therefore, with nobody on the other side.

Here then is a radical set of propositions and antidotes. Be many things and no one thing. Laugh long and loud at yourself. One day a week, ask someone else who they are that day, and really listen. Turn off social media. Meet a friend. Oh. And take the Dolly Parton challenge.

Norwegian star Geir Helgemo, one of the world’s best, was South, in today’s deal. The best route to 10 tricks would be to ruff a diamond in dummy, but the excellent opening trump lead prevented that.

Second choice was to set up a long spade in dummy, needing a 4-3 spade split. Helgemo went after this by winning East’s queen of hearts with the ace at trick one, cashing two top spades in dummy, and leading a third spade. When East discarded a club on the third spade, Helgemo ruffed and led the jack of hearts. East won and led a heart to dummy’s nine as West discarded the king of diamonds. This was the position:

Helgemo now made the elegant play of leading the two of diamonds from dummy! East won with his jack. A club from East would see Helgemo duck, end-playing West, so East led a diamond to dummy’s ace. West had to shed a spade. A spade ruff, establishing dummy’s 10, and a low club now finished West. He had to win and lead another club, giving dummy an entry for the established spade.

18,2020/02/22,Lakshmi Vilas Bank to focus on capital-efficient lending,"Lender eyes jewellery, MSME loans; targets ₹6,250 crore additional business

Cash-strapped private sector lender Lakshmi Vilas Bank Ltd. (LVB) has begun focussing on increasing its loan book through assets that require zero or lesser capital allocation, to improve its profitability, said a top official

“We are fine-tuning some of our business verticals and have given additional powers to branches, regional managers and centralised executives who were earlier not in the loop,” said S. Sundar, MD and CEO, LVB. “The focus areas are jewel and MSME loans and deposits.”

“We have brought down our exposure to the corporate sector to a third of what it was earlier. We are interested in lending to medium and small scale industries and other commercial, rural retail sectors. Slowly, this book should grow over a period of time and the percentage of corporates should come down further,” he said. LVB’s immediate task is to increase total business, arrest fresh slippages, be aggressive on the recovery front, post profit and improve the bank’s image and market share, he said.

He said LVB had identified 175 branches for the purpose of increasing the jewellery loan business. In 12 months, the bank plans to lend ₹1,200 crore in this segment. In the case of MSME loans, it has identified 101 branches that can garner business of another ₹2,400 crore, he said.

Asserting that the bank can attract fresh deposits as it did not have any unviable branches, he said LVB was in the process of identifying 250 out of a total of 570 branches that had the potential to garner more business. “It is a rough idea, where we thought each branch can bring in at least ₹25 crore [more] business each. This would fetch us another ₹6,250 crore,” he said.

“Till recently, at the branch level, the sales persons were handling jewel and MSME loans and they reported to the corporate office. To give a sense of feeling that they also belong to this bank, we have made the sales persons report to the centralised executives, branch and regional heads. This has started yielding results,” he said.

Stating that the bank was on its way to recovery, he pointed out that in the third quarter, recovery was more than slippages by ₹10 crore and this would increase in the coming quarters. LVB was also hopeful of raising fresh working capital worth ₹1,000 crore from potential investors by March end.

For the third quarter, total business of the bank stood at ₹41,100 crore against ₹54,910 crore for the corresponding year-ago period. Total deposits declined to ₹23,565 crore from ₹30,787 crore and gross advances to ₹17,535 crore from ₹24,123 crore. Net interest margin improved to 1.97% from 1.65%. Net loss for the quarter was ₹334 crore (₹373 crore).

For the year ended March 31, 2019, total business dropped to ₹51,235 crore from ₹60,314 crore. Total deposits slid to ₹29,279 crore from ₹33,309 crore. Net loss was ₹89,410 crore (₹58,487 crore).",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/j00xcc/article30890992.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23BULVB,https://www.thehindu.com/business/lvb-to-focus-on-capital-efficient-lending/article30890993.ece
19,2020/02/22,"Amalgamation sans hitch is our goal, says Indian Bank MD","‘There will be opportunity to rationalise products’

With barely six weeks left for the amalgamation of Allahabad Bank with Indian Bank, officials of both lenders are burning the midnight oil to ensure smooth transition of technology and human resources, says Indian Bank MD and CEO, Padmaja Chunduru. Edited excerpts from the interview:

What is your immediate focus as the deadline nears?

Our intention is to see that minimum services are made available to banking customers on the legal day one (April 1) without any hitch.

We don’t want to disturb people on day one when they walk into Indian Bank or erstwhile Allahabad Bank branches. We will try to keep the known faces at branch levels to deal with retail or MSME customers, as personal connectivity is important. So, there will not be any transfers on day one.

We will give a tool kit to branch managers and staff with a clear [message] of what is expected of them when customers walk in. The only rule is that no customer should be turned away.

Will transition be smooth?

Since both banks operate on the same core banking solution of TCS, we don’t see a problem. We have worked with TCS and are confident that operations from day one would be seamless.

We had carried out the amalgamation of our Pallavan Grama Bank with IOB-sponsored Pandyan Grama Bank into a single regional rural bank (RRB) in record time. When we can do it for an RRB, why not for Indian Bank?

What are the challenges in the amalgamation?

We are primarily strong in the south as is Allahabad Bank in the north. There is very little overlap of branches. We flew down zonal branch heads from Kolkata to Chennai and they had a healthy discussion. In fact, we held town hall meetings in three cities and one more will be held soon. Our staff is very receptive. Daily, we get hundreds of suggestions to improve the bank’s performance. Recently, we opened a portal for our staff. Soon, we will do it for our customers as well on the Net.

Is it not time to rationalise products?

Yes, it is a good opportunity to rationalise and remove products that have been going on for a long time. Sun-setting products is a good opportunity. The other one is to pick the best products from the two and tweak them into more market-friendly products. In our next steering meeting, we will realign retail assets.

We will centralise loan processing, Retail, MSME, Agriculture (RAM) allied activities so that branches are not bogged down in processes. That will help us have staff on the customer-facing side.

Do you think that the merger will lead to excess staff?

We don’t have excess staff, but some duplication of roles. There will be some merger of zonal offices, administrative offices, inspection departments and training offices.

How are you planning to address overlap of branches?

There is very little overlap. We have a third of our branches in the South or even more and they have a third of the branches in U.P. We have hardly 100 branches in U.P. against Allahabad Bank’s 1,100 branches. We will find ways to merge them. Branches in distinct places will continue. Both of us have a zonal office each in Lucknow and Kanpur. They will be merged. Wherever we can cut cost, we will do it.

Going forward, what will be the focus area... retail or the corporate sector?

Today, we have 60% focus on RAM and 40% on corporate while it is the reverse for Allahabad Bank. After the amalgamation, it will come down to 50:50. We need a good mix. It cannot be only retail or only corporate.

Recently, you had visited corporates. Any feedback from them?

I have been doing this since my SBI days. There are so many good companies in India in which Indian Bank is not there. In Chennai, there are corporates who have not been availing any working capital facility from us. We are trying to rope them in.

What is your message to your staff?

March 31 is the last day for both as distinct entities as the legacy is ending. Both will present financial result as standalone entities. Hence, I am asking them to work together and bring out the best results. Let’s start the new entity from a position of strength. June 2020 will be our first combined balance sheet with no loss or provision. Some legacy issues will be running for one or one-and-a-half years after the amalgamation.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/w2493v/article30890984.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22BUPADMAJACHUNDURU,https://www.thehindu.com/business/amalgamation-sans-hitch-is-our-goal-says-indian-bank-md/article30890985.ece
20,2020/02/22,"Greaves Cotton set to tap EV, BS-VI sectors","Auto engineering major moves to business-to-consumer segment

Greaves Cotton Ltd., a predominantly business-to-business (B2B) player supplying diesel engines to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as Piaggio, has, following a business transformation strategy, moved into the business-to-consumer (B2C) segment to take advantage of the fast moving electric vehicles (EV) industry and the BS-VI compliant engine business, top officials said.

Fuel-agnostic solution

Its fuel-agnostic engine solutions will add to its growth, they added.

“Three years ago, when disruptions were coming in, Greaves decided to shift focus from being a pure auto engine player to a fuel-agnostic solution provider and adopted a strategy to diversify into the non-automotive engine segment, clean mobility, including the fuel-efficient CNG engine, electric mobility and strengthen the after-market business,” said Nagesh Basavanhalli, MD and CEO, Greaves Cotton.

Having invested heavily in technology development, the firm has managed to develop a grounds-up BS-VI three-wheeler (3W) diesel single-cylinder engine in a record 24 months. This engine is best suited for city transportation as it delivers up to 30% lower emissions.This new engine will redefine all benchmarks and pave the way for the company to enter into new segment, the officials said.

Recently, the company acquired 100% stake in Ampere Vehicles in the electric mobility domain. Ampere is developing several new electric two-wheelers and eyeing a sizeable market share.

Non-auto diversification

While Ampere e-scooters can be used for last-mile personal transportation, numerous industrial applications can be powered by electric and e-rickshaw from Greaves officials said.

Greaves currently manufactures 7 HP to 700 HP engines. “Diversification into the non-automotive segment has paid off with exponential growth achieved in the last few years. The company has also expanded and strengthened the retail business (2W-3W) across the country in the form of Greaves Retail (380 stores) and Ampere Exclusive outlets (over 200) which have shown significant growth,” Mr. Basavanhalli said.

“Today, Greaves is well poised to grab upcoming opportunities in diverse (existing business) areas. This comes from our investment in multiple, newer business areas — non-automotive usage, multibrand spares Greaves Care, Greaves Retail in the last 3-4 years — which are now fetching good results and have strongly positioned the company to take it to the next level of growth,”he said.

Overall, the company has added ₹400 crore from the newer initiatives over the last three years and will continue to see impressive growth, he said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/1m967y/article30890978.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THBUGREAVES,https://www.thehindu.com/business/greaves-set-to-tap-ev-bs-vi-sectors/article30890979.ece
21,2020/02/22,Tardy pace of farm schemes irks Finance Ministry,"Ministry asks banks to hurry, wants 2.33 cr. more PM-Kisan beneficiaries under credit card scheme

The Finance Ministry has come down heavily on public sector banks for unsatisfactory progress of various schemes related to the farm sector. The Ministry has expressed its displeasure over the tardy progress made by banks, and asked them to double their efforts.

The communication to banks comes ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheduled visit to Chitrakoot in Uttar Pradesh on February 29, where he will launch the implementation of schemes announced in the Budget.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced in the Budget that all eligible beneficiaries of PM-KISAN will be covered under the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme. The Finance Ministry is not satisfied the progress made by banks so far in implementing the scheme.

The Ministry said while there were 9 crore PM-Kisan scheme beneficiaries, there are only 6.67 crore active KCC accounts. The campaign for saturation of all PM-Kisan beneficiaries with KCC started on February 10.

‘Not encouraging’

“As you are aware, at present there are about 6.67 crore active KCC accounts as against 9 crore beneficiaries under PM-Kisan, which leaves a gap of 2.33 crore PM Kisan beneficiaries who are outside the coverage of KCC schemes. However, mid-way [through] this campaign, the progress made so far is not encouraging,” the Finance Ministry said in a letter dated February 21.

The letter, addressed to all MD and CEOs of public sector banks and chairman of State Bank of India and Nabard, has been reviewed by The Hindu. The KCC scheme was launched in 1998 with the objective of providing short-term credit to farmers for cultivation of crops, post harvest expenses, working capital for maintenance of farm assets, among others.

“The on-going campaign for saturation of all PM Kisan beneficiaries with KCC which started with effect from February 10, 2020 will culminate at a function at Chitrakoot (U.P.) by the Hon’ble PM on 29.02.20,” the letter said. The Ministry also pulled up banks on slow implementation of Prime Minister Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) Scheme.

“As per data complied by DAC&FW [Department Of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare], from the PMFBY portal, the total number of applications received by all banks as on 21.02.20... is only 9.33 lakh, of which 4.13 lakh applications have been sanctioned,” the letter said.

“Given the tardy progress of the campaign, banks need to redouble efforts to ensure success of the campaign,” it added.

22,2020/02/22,"India needs pro-business, not pro-crony policies, says CEA","Pro-business policies are those that enable fair competition in the country, said CEA Krishnamurthy Subramanian

India has some distance to go in fully shifting from pro-crony to pro-business policies, Chief Economic Adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian said on Saturday.

It will be the pro-business policies that will enable the “invisible hands of the market” and also take the country to the goal of $5 trillion GDP, he added.

“Pro-business policies are those that enable fair competition in the country. We have some distance to go in terms of enabling that fully. Pro-crony policies on the other hand just help incumbents and that is something that we have to stay away from in enabling the invisible hands of the market,” he said at an alumni conference of his alma mater IIT-Kanpur here.

Indian policymaking has been criticised for favouring crony capitalists in the initial decades after Independence, till the country shifted gears by adopting liberalisation in 1991.

Mr. Subramanian said after the CAG’s report on telecom spectrum allocations came out in 2011, investor returns from “connected companies”, a euphemism for crony firms, have been very low as compared to the broader indices.

The problem with cronyism is that it is not better business models and processes which drive the growth, he said, adding that we should always aim for “creative destruction” where the incumbents are challenged.

In a critique of the dominant policy choices in the initial decades after Independence, Subramanian said “the tryst with socialism did not deliver the tryst with destiny”, referring to first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s famous speech when India attained freedom.

He also made a strong case for not depending only on recent work in economics to make policy choices and neglecting age-old texts like the Arthashastra.

“Scholarly work isn’t something that was written in the last 100 years but dates back millennia,” he said.

The Arthashastra stresses on ethical ways of creating wealth, he said, adding that we need to focus on creating trust in the markets as well.

If governance standards have to be increased in the country, there has to be a greater focus on disclosing related-party transactions, the CEA said. The comments come in the wake of frauds like the one at non-bank lender DHFL.

The Union Budget’s thrust on ‘Assemble in India’ should not be seen as substitute to the government’s flagship ‘Make in India’ programme, but as a complementary aspect which will act as a precursor to other goals, he said.

On the focus on ‘Assemble in India’, Mr. Subramanian cited the case of Suzuki’s entry into the country in 1980s and the developments in the auto sector since then to illustrate that simple assembly of parts to make a car is a precursor to manufacturing and also intellectual property creation.

Pointing out to the recently released Economic Survey, he said over four crore well-paying jobs can be created in the country by 2025 by focusing on assembling for the world, and the same can go up to eight crore by 2030.

Asked about the Budget’s thrust on imposing tariffs on certain sectors and how it has been criticised as being protectionist by some, Mr. Subramanian said we need to make a distinction between duties that are imposed on finished products against those on raw materials or intermediate goods which hurt exports.

“We need to move towards far more open trade policies on intermediate goods and raw materials to enable exports,” he told reporters.

To a question on external member of the Monetary Policy Committee Chetan Ghate’s pitch for more structural reforms, Mr. Subramanian said all measures like rate cuts and reforms work with a lag and we should allow time for their benefits to accrue.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/tr6cm5/article30887732.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KRISHNAMURTHYSUBRAMANIAN,https://www.thehindu.com/business/india-needs-pro-business-not-pro-crony-policies-says-cea/article30887733.ece
23,2020/02/22,Govt. eyes public-private fund to give R&D a shot in the arm,"Target of ₹40 cr. is currently on the anvil

In an effort to stimulate investment in research and development (R&D), the Department of Science and Technology is mooting a fund that will match the contributions made by private companies in R&D.

Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, Department of Science and Technology, told The Hindu that discussions were on with certain “large, private sector” companies and currently, a ₹40 crore target was on the anvil. “The idea is to pool funds from a group of companies willing to invest in fundamental research, such as quantum computers or artificial intelligence, and whatever is invested government will match that,” he added.

A major beneficiary of such private sector funds, Mr. Sharma noted, could be the Indian Institutes of Technology.

The scheme will be coordinated through the department’s Science and Engineering Research Board, which funds a variety of basic science projects in several universities.

Though India is among the top five countries in terms of its output of scientific publications, it doesn’t match up in investments.

The total expenditure on R&D has tripled in the last decade in nominal (revenue sans inflation) terms — from ₹24,117 crore in 2004-05 to an estimated ₹1,04,864 crore in 2016-17, however as a fraction of GDP, public expenditures on R&D has been stagnant — between 0.6-0.7% of GDP — over the past two decades. It is well below that in major nations such as the U.S. (2.8), China (2.1), Israel (4.3) and Korea (4.2), according to a 2019 report by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister.

Public sector institutions form the lion’s share of India’s investment in R&D. In 2004-2005, private sector accounted for 28% of India’s research spend and in 2016-17 this increased to 40%. In most advanced economies, private R&D accounts for the bulk of investment in R&D.

Moreover, while the government is the major source of funds for R&D, it’s also the major user — in terms of money consumed by public sector enterprises or Central institutions.

“As a lower middle-income country, it is not surprising that India’s spending on R&D lags upper-middle income and high-income countries such as China, Israel, and the U.S. However, it currently underspends even relative to its income level...

24,2020/02/22,Road near Shaheen Bagh opened by protesters: police,"The move follows a visit by court-appointed interlocutors

A stretch of a road near the Shaheen Bagh protest site here was opened on Saturday, following a visit by a Supreme Court-appointed interlocutor.

However, volunteers involved in the protests whom The Hindu spoke to differed on who opened the road — the police or the protesters themselves.

Shaheen Kauser, a social activist who has been protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act for the last two months, informed that Sadhana Ramchandran, one of the interlocutors, visited the site on Saturday morning to speak to the protesters here. “She listened to us without imposing her views and told us that all our concerns would be placed before the court,” she said. Protesters insisted that in order to open one side of the National Highway on which the protests have been taking place, they would need assurances from police officials, Ms. Kauser said. But no discussion on opening any other road took place, she said.

The police said a small stretch was opened by protesters, followed by a visit by the interlocutors in the morning. “A section of the protesters opened the stretch that joins Abu Fazal Enclave to Kalindi Kunj Junction but after a few minutes, it was closed again by another group. Subsequently, the stretch was opened again by the protesters and it remains open,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (South East) R.P. Meena said.

Meraj Khan, a volunteer, said Road No. 9, which connects Sarita Vihar to Kalindi Kunj, was opened by the protesters. While the road had been blocked by the police earlier, the protesters had also put up a blockade here but were allowing ambulances and school vans to pass through, he said. Mohamed Shabazz, another volunteer, said the blockade of the road to Jamia Millia Islamia was cleared by the police, and the protesters were not involved.

After talks on Friday, interlocutor Sanjay Hegde had said the protesters, in principle, were not against opening of the non-protest side of the road if their security could be guaranteed in writing by the police under suitable orders of the Supreme Court.

25,2020/02/22,‘Govt. wrote off ₹8 lakh crore bad loans’,"It should come clean on who benefited from the move: Cong.

The Congress on Saturday alleged that the Narendra Modi government had written off nearly ₹8 lakh crore bad loans and demanded that it should reveal the names of the corporates whose debts were waived off.

Citing a Credit Suisse report that purportedly said the Modi government had waived loans worth ₹7,77,800 crore, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged that “crony capitaist friends were given a bonanza in five years”.

“Modi government can waive loans of ₹7,77,800 crore in 5 years of crony friends, why no debt relief to India’s farmers? Who is responsible for safety of people’s money in banks?” asked Mr. Surjewala.

“Shocking state of bank loan waivers, NPAs & impaired banking assets exposed by Credit Suisse report! Since 2014, Modi government has given super-sized bank loan waivers worth ₹7,77,800 crore!”he said in another tweet.

Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate, at the party’s media briefing, said the government should come clean on who benefited from the waivers.

Three questions

“We, through you, have three big demands of this government. First, make public the names of borrowers whose credits have been written-off. I think as a country, we deserve to know. The second and more important demand also is to set-up a high powered committee to review the pace and method at which credit write-off has happened and the third, do a review of the financial viability of the banking sector,” Ms. Shrinate told reporters.

The Congress argued that unless the banking sector improved and credit off-take improved, economic recovery would be difficult.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4dnuqd/article30891000.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23SURJEWALA-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-wrote-off-8-lakh-crore-bad-loans/article30891001.ece

With the Bihar Assembly elections just months away, presidents of NDA allies — the BJP and the JD(U) — on Saturday addressed party leaders and workers in Patna, saying the NDA would win over 200 seats in a House of 243.

“Do not get swayed by concerns of individual benefits. Do remember that if the party thrives, the benefits will reach to all,” said BJP president J.P. Nadda while addressing party leaders and workers at the party headquarters in Patna, during his first visit since taking over as party chief.

He later met JD(U) president and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and discussed poll strategies for the assembly polls due in October-November.

Mr. Kumar, in his address to regional party leaders at his official residence, also said the NDA would win over 200 seats.

He exhorted party leaders and workers to put party flags on their house as “it will send a positive message not only to party workers but also to common people”.

27,2020/02/22,18 Rajya Sabha MPs from Congress to retire in 2020,"A section believes the old guard should make way for younger leaders

Beginning this month, 18 Congress MPs are going to retire in 2020, with 12 of them completing their term by April. But the party may manage to retain only half of these vacancies, given its strength in the State Assemblies.

So, amid the churn over leadership, the party’s choice of nominees to the Rajya Sabha could indicate the direction the party would take in the immediate future. It is already a matter of debate within the party who should replace such senior leaders as Moti Lal Vohra, Digvijaya Singh and Kumari Selja.

Traditionally, the Congress has sent its old guard to the Rajya Sabha, as much for their loyalty as for their experience in governance. But a section of the party believes the old guard should make way for younger and articulate leaders to make an impact in Parliament.

In April, the Congress-ruled Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan will have three vacancies each, while Chhattishgarh will have two vacancies. The names of younger leaders such as Jyotiraditya Scindia, Randeep Surjewala, Jitin Prasada and R.P.N. Singh are being floated as possible replacements by the section that is close to former party president Rahul Gandhi.

There is also speculation on Uttar Pradesh in-charge Priyanka Gandhi Vadra being sent to the Rajya Sabha from any of the Congress-ruled States.

Asked to comment on such reports at a press conference on Friday, Deputy Leader of the Congress in the Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma said such decisions would be taken by the party president.

The Congress did not want to engage in any public debate on its choice for the Rajya Sabha, but the senior leaders do not want to cede ground to leaders viewed as being close to Mr. Gandhi. That is why some of the younger leaders close to Mr. Gandhi believe questions about a leadership vacuum has been timed to target the former Congress chief.

“Finally, who makes it to the Rajya Sabha will give us an idea of which leader prevailed in the final decision-making,” said a Congress member.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mfe2o8/article30890971.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23PRIYANKA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/18-rs-mps-from-cong-to-retire-in-2020/article30890972.ece

The number of listed militants in Kashmir has come down to less than 250, while 25 terrorists were killed by security forces in nearly a dozen operations in the first two months of this year, Director General of Jammu and Kashmir Police Dilbag Singh said here on Saturday.

He also said there had been confirmation of only three militants infiltrating into the Valley through the international border so far this year.

“The number of listed militants has come down from what it was earlier. Around 240 to 250 listed militants are there in the valley,” the DGP told reporters here.

He said in the last two months, the number of reported and confirmed infiltrated militants is three.

“One of them — a JeM militant — was killed in an operation in Tral recently, he added. Nearly a dozen successful operations have taken place till now in 2020, which included 10 in the Kashmir valley and two in the Jammu region.

29,2020/02/22,"Monsoon in Sunderbans likely to get longer, warn climate experts","A fact sheet has called for long-term coastal planning to preserve intertidal habitats in the region

The monsoon in Sunderbans is likely to last longer and get more intense, according to a fact sheet titled The Sunderbans and Climate Change, which was made public during the ongoing Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.

“Climate specialists have predicted that as climate change progresses, monsoon seasons in the Sundarbans will become longer and more intense. Conversely, drought conditions will also become more pronounced, presenting further challenges for agricultural producers in particular and ecosystems in general,” said the document released during the Conference of Parties (COP) being held at Gujarat.

Natural habitats

The document highlights the need for ""long term coastal planning to ensure that these critically important intertidal habitats with their unique flora and fauna and local inhabitants have a space to retreat inland"". The paper also points out that the habitat of the Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) in the Sunderbans is also affected by the storm due to a decline in the availability of prey.

While the fact sheet puts the rise in the sea level at 3.2 mm per year currently, it states that an estimated rise of 28 cm above the sea levels registered in the year 2000 would result in a 96 % decline of the habitat of the Bengal tiger in Bangladesh.

Discussions were also held on the Transboundary Conservation of Threatened Freshwater Fauna, including species like Indian River Terrapin (Batagur baska), Hilsa (Tenualosa ilisha) and Ganges River Dolphin (Platanista gangetica),.

The forum comprised scientists from the Wildlife Institute of India, World Wildlife Fund for Nature, Wildlife Trust of India, Turtle Survival Alliance (TSA) and the member secretary of Central Zoo Authority.

Risk of flooding

“There is clear evidence of the habitat of all the three species extending to the Sunderbans in both India and Bangladesh. We are hopeful that the points that were raised are going to be well received by the CMS and there will be some concerted action for the conservation of the freshwater species that migrate across the Sunderbans,” said Shailendra Singh, director, TSA.

The fact sheet points out that the Sunderbans is also highly susceptible to flooding.

“Due to this, any swelling of ocean water is going to dramatically affect the area. Alhough mangroves are somewhat resistant to submersion in water, they can die when tidal inundation occurs too frequently or lasts too long,” the document stated.

Apart from the frequent storms and the rise of sea level, another concern is the rise of salinity both in water and soil.

“Excess levels of soil salinity can be incredibly damaging to ecosystems as salts can accumulate in the soil and hinder plant growth. It also threatens the health of freshwater aquatic life such as fish and giant prawns,” the document adds.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xtyp2j/article30890906.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22PTISUNDERBANS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/monsoon-in-sunderbans-likely-to-get-longer-warn-climate-experts/article30890907.ece
30,2020/02/22,Punjab DGP ‘remark’ over Kartarpur has hurt Sikh sentiment: Opposition,"Police official says he “only red-flagged the obvious ‘potential’ for misuse”

The Shiromani Akali Dal and the Aam Aadmi Party on Saturday accused DGP Dinkar Gupta of hurting the sentiments of the Sikh community by making irresponsible remarks in the context of pilgrims visiting the Kartarpur gurdwara in Pakistan through the newly built corridor.

The DGP, however, expressed shock and outrage over his remarks “being misunderstood or being wilfully misconstrued” and that he “only red-flagged the obvious ‘potential’ for misuse by elements notorious for their hostility towards India” through the corridor.

Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly and AAP MLA Harpal Singh Cheema and Kotkapura legislator Kultar Singh Sandhwan said Mr. Gupta’s remark was highly offending and uncalled for from an officer of his stature.

The AAP leaders demanded that a criminal case be filed against the DGP for his insensitive statement and that he be given the marching orders. “If the State government fails to do so, the AAP would be left to obstruct Vidhan Sabha proceedings till the time justice is done,” they said in a statement here.

Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader and former Minister Bikram Singh Majithia alleged that Mr. Gupta’s statement — that an ordinary Sikh devotee going to pay obeisance at Sri Kartarpur Sahib can be turned into a terrorist in the space of six hours — was an insult to the ardas (prayers) of the Sikhs and others.

Asking the DGP to clarify his statement within 24 hours, Mr. Majithia, said: “If the officer failed to do this the SAD would launch a protest movement and would not allow the Vidhan Sabha to run on February 24. We cannot tolerate this insult at any cost,” he said here.

In a statement, Mr. Gupta said, “I rejoiced at the opening of the Sri Kartarpur Sahib corridor which has fulfilled the decades-old aspirations of millions of devotees like myself all over the world who profess their faith in Guru Nanak Devji and his divine teachings. Their daily ardas for “khulle darshan-deedaar” of religious shrines that remain in the post-Partition Pakistan was finally answered. It was a matter of even greater happiness that it coincided with the 550th Prakash Purab of Sri Guru Nanak Devji.”

Mr. Gupta said as the DGP of the State, which is faced with a continuing battle against violent extremism that continues to be funded and supported from across the border, he cannot over emphasise the need to remain vigilant.

“I only red-flagged the obvious ‘potential’ for misuse by elements notorious for their hostility towards India and their effort to exploit every opportunity, even the most pious one, to disturb peace and communal harmony,” he said.

Mr. Gupta said his remarks were strictly pertaining to the security and safety of Punjab and India. “There was absolutely no reference to any religion or community in the remarks but simply that some anti-national elements based in hostile neighbourhood could misuse and exploit this opportunity and, therefore, we need to be vigilant to such potential dangers in the interest of peace and security of the people of the State.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/punjab-dgp-remark-over-kartarpur-has-hurt-sikh-sentiment-opposition/article30890605.ece
31,2020/02/22,Bharat Mata slogan misused to create a militant idea of India: Manmohan,"The former Prime Minister was addressing a gathering at the launch of a book on Jawaharlal Nehru’s works and speeches.

Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Saturday said ‘nationalism and Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ were being misused to construct a ‘militant and purely emotional idea’ of India.

Dr. Singh made these remarks while speaking at the launch of a book on Jawaharlal Nehru’s works and speeches.

“It is a book of particular relevance at a time when nationalism and the slogan of ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ are being misused to construct a militant and purely emotional idea of India that excludes millions of residents and citizens,” the former Prime Minister said.

The book Who is Bharat Mata by Purushottam Agrawal and Radha Krishna contains selections from Nehru’s classic works including Glimpses of World History and The Discovery of India, his speeches and letters among others.

Speaking at the event that formally launched the Kannada version of the book, Dr Singh said India’s recognition as a vibrant democracy along world powers was a lasting contribution by India's first Prime Minister.

“With an inimitable style, and a multi-linguist, Nehru laid the foundation of the universities, academies and cultural institutions of Modern India. But for Nehru's leadership, independent India would not have become what it is today,” Dr. Singh said.

“But unfortunately, a section of people who either do not have the patience to read history or would like to be deliberately guided by their prejudices, try their best to picture Nehru in a false light. But I am sure, history has a capacity to reject fake and false insinuations and put everything in proper perspective,”he added.

The former Prime Minister quoted Pandit Nehru to suggest how India's first Prime Minister had pointed to the danger of leadership getting removed from the common people whom they are supposed to serve.

“Conceit, like fat on the human body, grows imperceptibly, layer upon layer and the person whom it affects is unconscious of the daily accretion. Fortunately, the hard knocks of a mad world tone it down or even squash it completely, and there has been no lack of these hard knocks for us in India. The school of life has been difficult one, and suffering is a hard task master,” Dr Singh quoted Nehru as saying.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/b9ftma/article30890466.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MANMOHANSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nationalism-bharat-mata-ki-jai-being-misused-to-construct-militant-idea-says-manmohan/article30890467.ece

The All Naga Students’ Association Manipur (ANSAM), which had imposed an indefinite blockade along the NH 2 from Friday afternoon, called it off immediately. Official reports said normality was restored with all shops and business centres re-opened.

Trouble started on Friday afternoon when some personnel of the 34 Assam Rifles arrested ‘Captain’ Thangal in the Senapati district headquarters market. They were searching for the town commander of the NSCN (IM) in the district which borders Nagaland on Thursday.

In protest, some NSCN(IM) cadres snatched the AK 47 rifle from one Assam Rifles personnel. Angry men and women damaged a vehicle of the personnel. Attempts were made to burn down another vehicle.

Mr. Solanki said the committee members would visit the newly-built Sardar Patel Stadium in Motera, where the ’Namaste Trump’ event will be held.

Taking on the Congress over its scepticism about U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to India, the BJP on Saturday said this trip will be a landmark moment in Indo-U.S. relations and the opposition party should take pride in the “nation’s achievements”.

The BJP also said there are times when political parties should keep aside their identities and “think as one nation”.

This comes a day after the Congress said Mr. Trump’s visit should not become an extension of the U.S. presidential election campaign, but should yield concrete results for India.

The visit should not be reduced to a photo opportunity or a PR exercise that would devalue the importance of the Indo-U.S. partnership, the Congress had said.

Addressing a press conference at the BJP headquarters here, party spokesperson Sambit Patra asked the Congress why it was unhappy that the country’s stature was being raised. “This is a meeting of the world’s largest and oldest democracies and it should be celebrated,” he said.

“There are times when political parties should keep aside their identities and think as one nation,” he said.

Taking a dig at the Congress, Mr. Patra asked if 10, Janpath (residence of party president Sonia Gandhi) had allowed former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to develop a Prime Minister Narendra Modi-like rapport with international leaders.

Adding that Mr. Trump himself has said multiple times that India was a hard bargainer, the BJP spokesperson said the Congress should not be worried about India’s interests.

The plea had claimed that Sharma had sustained grievous head injury and fracture in his right arm, and was suffering from “insanity”, “mental illness” and “schizophrenia”.

Tihar jail authorities had termed his claims as a “bundle of distorted facts” and told the court that CCTV footage established that the convict had inflicted “superficial” injuries on himself and was not suffering from any psychological disorder.

40,2020/02/22,"Domicile law for J&K coming very soon, says Jitendra Singh","This will be immediately followed by the Land Act, the Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office said

In a bid to address the concerns of the local populace after the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution last year, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Saturday assured the people of the Union Territory that a domicile law would be coming “very soon”, following which the Land Act would also be implemented.

He also announced that more than the promised jobs would be provided to the youth after the notification of the rules is worked out.

“The Domicile Act is coming very soon, which will be immediately followed by the Land Act,” the Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office said.

Explained | State, Union Territory, and Union Territory with a Legislative Assembly

Multiple parties have been demanding the enactment of a domicile law for Jammu and Kashmir to protect the interests of the landowners and the unemployed youth, after the erstwhile State lost its special status following the nullification of Article 370 by the Centre, he said.

Mr. Singh was addressing a function here after the signing of a major scientific collaboration agreement between CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, and IndusScan, a Canadian pharmaceutical company.

Calling the signing of the MoU a “historic moment”, the Minister said Jammu and Kashmir’s journey to becoming a part of India’s $5 trillion global economy has started from within the four walls of the Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine.

“...Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been saying again and again that we should have the same kind of focus on Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh as we did for the northeast, which has seen major transformation over the last five years. Those who have doubts about it will see all this happening in a short while,” he said.

The Minister said this is possible because the “earlier embargoes have been removed” and the Union Territory is directly reporting to the Centre.

“Many of the politicians have become unemployed...I heard one of them raising the issue of jobs to the local youth yesterday. I want to tell that more than the promised jobs will be advertised, but as per the rules and in an impartial manner. We are waiting for a notification of the rules to come out,” he said.

Alleging brazen disregard for the concerns of the educated unemployed and under-employed youth by the incumbent government, National Panthers Party chairman and former Minister Harsh Dev Singh had said not a single post, out of the promised 50,000 jobs, had been advertised for the filling up of vacancies in the new Union Territory after the abrogation of Article 370 provisions.

“Everything will be done. It will not be like when your government was in power and ruined the future of the youths by backdoor appointments and corrupt practices. The youth who were provided jobs have turned 35 years, but are still waiting for their regularisation,” the Union Minister said.

He said jobs would be provided under rules, which would be in the best interest of the youth and those who have been deprived of it.

Asserting that India is going through “one of the best phases under the leadership of Modi”, he said a lot of development had taken place over the last five years and the country is looking forward to becoming a part of the global economy.

“On the one hand, India is eyeing $5 trillion economy. Don’t you want Jammu and Kashmir to also be a part of that. It is possible only if our youth can reach a stage that allows them to live up to the parameters that are followed globally. Therefore, even if some of us have doubts or are confused, skeptical or still unconvinced, ask yourselves, don’t you want your children to be part of the $5 trillion economy. If you understand this, I think all the murmuring and whispering that has been generated from thoughtless minds will vanish,” Mr. Singh said.

The Minister said Jammu and Kashmir is also under the process of a new industrial policy and a new scientific policy.

“The greatest disadvantage that has happened from Jammu and Kashmir remaining in isolation because of Article 370 is that we have become lazy and lethargic. We have learnt to live on easy freebies,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/r85pvo/article30777389.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10JITENDRASINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/domicile-law-for-jk-coming-very-soon-says-jitendra-singh/article30888639.ece

42,2020/02/22,"Rahul Gandhi remains ‘top leader’ in Congress, large section always felt he should return as chief: Khurshid","Congress leader Salman Khurshid also asserted that the Congress was going through a “transitional process”, but there was no leadership crisis plaguing the party as Sonia Gandhi was there at the helm

A large section within the Congress has always felt that Rahul Gandhi must come back as party chief and he remains the “top leader” in the party, senior leader Salman Khurshid said on Saturday, asserting that Mr. Gandhi should be allowed to make his decision at a time of his choice.

In an interview to PTI, Mr. Khurshid also asserted that the Congress was going through a “transitional process”, but there was no leadership crisis plaguing the party as Sonia Gandhi was there at the helm.

Also read: Salman Khurshid slams Rahul Gandhi for ‘walking away’

His remarks assume significance as they come after voices emerged from several quarters within the Congress on the leadership issue with many leaders, including Shashi Tharoor and Sandeep Dikshit, demanding that the matter be finally laid to rest.

Mr. Tharoor on Thursday had urged the Congress Working Committee (CWC) to hold leadership elections to “energise workers and inspire voters“.

Also read | Editorial | Raising the bar: on Rahul Gandhi's resignation

Asked about Mr. Dikshit and Mr. Tharoor’s views, Mr. Khurshid said, “We have had elections in the past. We have also had people say that elections are not necessarily the best thing. There are two points of view. When we get to that point, we will cross the bridge.”

He said talking about such issues in the media doesn’t help the Congress.

Asked if Rahul Gandhi was best suited to lead the Congress, Mr. Khurshid said, “We have all said this. It is now written in stone, it is clear. But if we accept him as our leader, let us give him the choice of decision making and the timing. Why do we want to impose (our views) on him.”

On whether there was a dominant view within the Congress that Mr. Gandhi must come back as party chief after resigning last year taking moral responsibility for the Lok Sabha polls defeat, he said there has always been such a feeling in a large section of the party.

“But it was embarrassing to continue repeating it because if you do believe that he is a leader, you need to leave some decisions to him, not impose the timing, not impose the nature of the decision, let him take a decision,” the former Union minister said.

“He (Gandhi) said he is not going away and he has not gone away. He is still here. If he does not have a label because he does not want to use that label today, lets respect him for it and we have done so,” Khurshid said, adding that it is the media that does not stop talking about it.

Mr. Khurshid asserted that Mr. Gandhi remains the “top leader” in the party.

“He (Gandhi) remains the top leader...nobody else is the top leader. But there are other leaders who have their own significance, who contribute to the entirety of the process that the Congress party is,” he said.

Mr. Khurshid said the fact that parties opposing the Congress continue to attack him more than anyone else, shows that he remains the top leader.

Asked if the Gandhi family remains the fulcrum of the Congress, he said that it is a fact which cannot be wished away.

“Nobody says, and least of all the Gandhi family says, that democratic processes should not be allowed to evolve in the party. Democratic processes are evolving in the party. But the position they hold historically, is the position that is acknowledged and accepted by huge numbers of Congress workers, that is a fact you cannot shut your eyes to,” he said.

This whole business against dynasties is repeated by those people who have benefited from dynasties. The BJP has benefited from dynasties, he said.

“Tell me one party that does not have dynasties. I am not saying dynasties are good, but dynasties are a fact, not just in politics, but in the media, in police, in judiciary, in Bollywood, in administration, in universities You can’t just single out one single area and say ‘there should be no dynasties here’,” he said.

As social mobility advances, this issue will resolve itself, he added.

Asked about the leadership conundrum, Mr. Khurshid said there was no lack of leadership in the party and asserted that there cannot be “cut and dried” or instant solutions to such matters as it takes time.

“There is no such thing as past leadership, present leadership and future leadership. There is a kind of a continuum, now in that continuum what kind of shape that the leadership structure takes from time to time will evolve. This is an evolution that is taking place. People are just uncomfortable about evolution,” he said.

Mr. Khurshid said much of the discussion and debate around the leadership issue was futile and it was the media that seems to be more interested in it than Congressmen.

More importantly, what the party needs to understand is that what is it that has happened to the country and the voter that “we need to address”, he said.

“We should just be left to ourselves to allow us to do what we need to do. Each one of us knows what we have to do. But no matter what we do, we would still require a change of mood in the country and some of it is now being noticed and is becoming manifest,” the 67-year-old leader said.

The Congress on Friday had said there was no leadership crisis in the party as Sonia Gandhi was appointed as its chief by the CWC, the highest decision-making body of the grand old party.

45,2020/02/22,Modi a versatile genius who thinks globally and acts locally: Justice Arun Mishra,"He was delivering the vote of thanks at the inauguration of the International Judicial Conference 2020

Supreme Court judge Arun Mishra described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as an “internationally acclaimed visionary” at a public forum on Saturday. He commended the “versatile genius” of Mr. Modi to “think globally and act locally”.

Justice Mishra, one of the first five senior-most judges of the Supreme Court, twice heaped praises on Mr. Modi while delivering his vote of thanks at the inaugural session of the International Judicial Conference 2020 ‘Judiciary and the Changing World’.

""India is a responsible and most friendly member of the international community under the stewardship of internationally acclaimed visionary Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi... We thank the versatile genius who thinks globally and acts locally, Shri Narendra Modi, for his inspiring speech, which will act as a catalayst in initiating the deliberations and setting the agenda for the conference,"" Justice Mishra said.

On the dais was Prime Minister Modi, Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde, Justice N.V. Ramana, Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Attorney-General K.K. Venugopal and Justice L. Nageswara Rao. The function had in attendance Supreme Court and high court judges, judges from across 24 nations, former judges and advocates. Mr. Prasad, in his address, had referred to the ""glorious identity of independent judiciary"".

In his inaugural address, Mr. Modi said how 1.3 billion Indians had “wholeheartedly” accepted “some critical judgments” recently. These judgments were the subject of global discussion. In an apparent reference to the Ayodhya land dispute verdict, Mr. Modi said several apprehensions were expressed about the consequences of these judgments.

“But look what happened! 1.3 billion Indian wholeheartedly accepted the judicial verdicts,” Mr. Modi said.

The Prime Minister said his government acted swiftly and with “complete sensitivity and responsiveness to the needs of modern society” by legislating the rights for transgenders and enacting a law against triple talaq.

Gender justice

Another achievement is how India has made big strides in gender justice. “Today, after 70 years of Independence, the participation of women in elections is at the highest level ever! For the first time in India, the enrolment of girls in educational institutions is more than the boys. This is on account of successful programmes such as Beti Bachao Beti Padhao,” Mr. Modi told the assembled judges and foreign delegates.

Both the Prime Minister and the Law Minister referred to women in the defence services. Mr. Prasad said how the Prime Minister was “bold enough to permit Indian Air Force women to also fly fighter planes”. He said the PM’s initiative was “complemented by the recent Supreme Court judgment which gave women Army officers the right to command.

Chief Justice Bobde said, “The zeitgeist of our time is technological development. A small change in one corner can impact other corners”. He said conferences like these helped the judiciary gain knowledge from each other. He said a well-structured judicial system had been part of this country for over 2000 years

Justice Ramana flagged several global issues such as terrorism, cyber crimes, environmental degradation and health in his speech. He said terrorism had affected every part of the world. He said there was a need for the judiciary to evolve “innovative principles and jurisprudence to keep terrorism at bay while upholding the rule of law”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4nbttw/article29786098.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Justice-ARUN-MISHRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/modi-a-versatile-genius-who-thinks-globally-and-acts-locally-justice-arun-mishra/article30887665.ece
46,2020/02/22,PM Modi hails judiciary for striking balance between development and environment protection,"“No country or society in the world can claim to achieve holistic development without gender justice,” said the Prime Minister

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday hailed the Indian judiciary for redefining environmental jurisprudence to strike a balance between development and ecological protection.

Speaking at the inaugural function of the International Judicial Conference 2020 — ‘judiciary and the changing world’ at the Supreme Court, the Prime Minister referred to gender justice and said no country or society in the world can claim to achieve holistic development without it.

He referred to laws on transgenders, ‘triple talaq’ and on the rights of ‘Divyang’ (persons with disabilities) and said the government has also taken steps to give rights to women in military services and in providing paid maternity leave for 26 weeks to women.

Referring to the use of technology, Modi said it can help in procedural management of courts and benefit the justice delivery system to a large extent.

“In addition, in the changing times, issues like data protection, cyber-crime pose new challenges for the judiciary,” he said.

Referring to recent judicial verdicts by Indian courts, the PM said 1.3 billion Indians have “wholeheartedly” accepted them despite there being several apprehensions expressed about the consequences.

Speaking at the occasion, Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde said India is a “melting pot of cultures” and has assimilated cultures of Mughals, Dutch, Portuguese and English.

47,2020/02/22,COVID-19: India accuses China of denying permission for relief flight,"“Indian nationals in Wuhan continue their long wait,” says official

China has allowed evacuation flights from other countries but has denied India the permission to fly an aircraft carrying medical supplies to Wuhan, sources said on Saturday. The statement comes two days after the Ministry of External Affairs said that a C-17 Globemaster military transport aircraft would carry medical supplies to COVID-19-hit Wuhan and evacuate Indians willing to return home.

“The Chinese side continues to maintain there is no delay, but inexplicably the clearance has not been given. Meanwhile, Indian nationals in Wuhan continue their long wait for the flight which will evacuate them to India, the delay is causing them and their family members in India tremendous mental anguish,” said an official source, confirming the brewing tension.

The Embassy of China said that Beijing attaches great importance to the health and safety of Indian nationals in China. Counselor Ji Rong, Spokesperson of the embassy here said, ""The current epidemic situation in Hubei province is complicated, and the prevention and control of Covid-19 has entered into a critical stage.""

However, an official source sharply questioned the Chinese diplomat's explanation and pointed that Beijing has allowed flights from France, Japan and Ukraine to take off from Wuhan since February 16 whereas Indian proposal for the relief flight was sent on February 13. ""If the work was not critical enough to stop or delay these flights, how did it suddenly become critical for the Indian flight?"" asked the official.

India had sent two long-range civilian aircraft for the earlier sorties that evacuated 647 citizens and seven Maldivians. For the latest relief and evacuation attempt, it decided to send a U.S.-manufactured heavy lift C-17, which is the largest military transport aircraft in India’s possession. The Official Spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs had informed that citizens of other countries would also be considered for evacuation depending on availability of space in the transport aircraft.

China has, meanwhile, allowed other countries to deliver relief and evacuation flights. “Why is the Chinese government delaying clearance for the relief flight? Are they not interested in Indian aid provided as our token of support? Why are they creating roadblock in evacuating our nationals from Wuhan and putting them under hardship and mental agony?,” asked the official.

Significantly, China too deployed its latest large Y-20 military transport aircraft earlier this month to bring medical supplies and personnel to the city of Wuhan. Apart from several Y-20 aircraft, Beijing also mobilised Il-76 and Y-9 aircraft for fighting the coronavirus crisis in Hubei province.

The Indian embassy in China had earlier asked citizens in Wuhan to be ready for evacuation on February 20 but sources in Wuhan informed that they have been asked to wait till further information.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fs4kg6/article30719854.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WUHANOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-india-accuses-china-of-denying-permission-for-relief-flight/article30887328.ece
48,2020/02/22,Sinister trend of populist campaigns to influence judgments: Ravi Shankar Prasad,"Ravi Shankar Prasad flags use of campaigns to sway verdicts

A “sinister and dangerous” trend is developing whereby “some people” launch populist campaigns about the kind of judgment they expect from the court, only to unleash criticism if the verdict fails to live up to their presumptions, Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Saturday.

He said populism is the resort of those who have lost the popular mandate.

“In a democracy, we welcome dissent. We welcome populism too. We have a problem when populism impinges on well-settled constitutional principles. And populism also becomes a problem when those who have been rejected in the popular mandate become the biggest flag-bearers of populism... In our constitutional scheme, it is very clear, the government must be left to those who were elected by the people of India to govern...” he said.

Mr. Prasad was speaking at the inaugural session of an international judicial conference attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday.

'Terrorists, corrupt, have no Right to Privacy'

In a separate segment of his speech, the Law Minister touched on the limits of right to privacy, saying courts have ""many a time"" clarified that privacy does not extend to terrorists and the corrupt.

“The Supreme Court has held that right to privacy is a fundamental right. The judgment has become a beacon globally. It is a wonderful judgment saying that right to privacy flows from Article 21, the right to life and live with dignity. But our courts have also stated that terrorists and the corrupt have no right to privacy because right to privacy has acquired critical proportion in the wake of digital landscape expanding globally. This is the age of information, information is power. This is the age of communication, communication is power,” Mr. Prasad said.

In his address, the Minister emphasised that judges must be left ""completely independent to give judgments in accordance to what they think is correct under the rule of law"".

“But there is a sinister trend developing globally and is also in our country… Some people start campaigning as to what kind of judgment they expect, and if the judgment is not in accord with that, they unleash all the forces of criticism against judiciary,” Mr. Prasad said.

Mr. Prasad said criticism of the judiciary for a judgment was welcome, but “some kind of norm has to be maintained if rule of law has to acquire continued resonance”. The Law Minister said though he was “a great supporter of social media” and its freedom to empower, using populism to impinge on well-settled constitutional principles was a dangerous trend.

Obviously, they are accountable to the Parliament and, in many ways, to judicial decisions and the people,” he said.

Senior Supreme Court judge, Justice N.V. Ramana, said the issue of populist trends affecting justice administration was of “fundamental importance”. “Populist decisions affect the constitutional rights, and more often than not, rights of one group are pitted against the rights or interest of other group(s). Courts will have to guard constitutional values as well as balance all constitutional considerations”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/n6mh7b/article30890923.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-prasad-pti,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/terrorists-corrupt-have-no-right-to-privacy-ravi-shankar-prasad/article30887298.ece
49,2020/02/22,Construction will begin in six months: Trust chief,"Gopal Das stresses on people’s help

President of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust, Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, on Friday said the Ram temple in Ayodhya would come up where the deity dwells and it would be on the lines of the model displayed earlier.

“The temple will be built where Lord Ram dwells in Ayodhya. It will be on the lines of the model shown earlier. It [temple] might see a slight change. Neither will the temple be built on chanda [offerings] nor with government finance. It will be constructed with people’s help,” he told reporters here.

He said the date of construction would be finalised in the next meeting of the trust, adding that it would start in the next six months.

He said heads of ‘akharas’ in Ayodhya would meet shortly in connection with the temple construction.

Meanwhile, Trust sources said the map prepared by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad around three decades ago could be altered to raise the height of the proposed structure from 125 to 160 feet, and an additional third floor added.

“The temple will be built on the basis of the VHP’s map. There can be changes to its proposed shape and scale,” said Swami Govind Dev Giri, a member of the Trust. Another member said, “We are brainstorming on... adding a pavilion and detailing to the 35-foot-high shikhar (tower).”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/buhl5k/article30885640.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22TH-MODEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/construction-will-begin-in-six-months-trust-chief/article30885641.ece
50,2020/02/22,"Trump expected to talk CAA, NRC and Kashmir in India: U.S. Officials","Mr. Trump will also encourage a reduction in tensions and bilateral dialogue between India and Pakistan while in India.

U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to raise U.S.'s concerns around the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, when he visits India next week, as per senior administration officials who had a briefing call with reporters on Friday.

Mr. Trump will also encourage a reduction in tensions and bilateral dialogue between India and Pakistan while in India.

The comments are significant at a time when there is growing concern in Washington over India’s adherence to democratic processes and traditions, namely, Parliament’s passage of the CAA and the establishment of the NRC in Assam.

In response to a question on whether Mr. Trump will raise the CAA and NRC with Mr. Modi, the official said the administration is ""concerned"" about these issues and that Mr. Trump will talk about these issues with Prime Minister Modi. Particularly, Mr Trump is expected to raise the ""religious freedom issue"" which is ""extremely important"" to the current U.S. administration as well as discuss shared traditions of democracy and religious freedom ""both in public remarks and certainly in private,"" the official said.

""Prime Minister Modi in his first speech after winning the election last year, talked about how he would prioritize being inclusive of Indian religious minorities. And certainly the world looks to India to maintain religious liberty and equal treatment for all under the rule of law,"" the official said.

Trump to encourage bilateral dialogue on Kashmir

Responding to a question from The Hindu on whether Mr. Trump will offer to mediate between India and Pakistan on the Kashmir issue, the official said Kashmir will be raised and Mr. Trump would very much encourage a ""reduction in tensions"" between India and Pakistan and encourage them to engage in bilateral dialogue to resolve differences.

""We continue to believe a core foundation of any successful dialogue between the two is based on continued momentum in Pakistan's efforts to crack down on terrorist extremists on its territory. We continue to look for that. I think the President will urge both countries to seek to maintain peace and stability along the line of control and refrain from actions or statements that could increase tensions in the region,"" the official said.

On whether Mr. Trump would ask India to send troops to Afghanistan, where the U.S. announced it has finalised an agreement with the Taliban to reduce violence, the official said if the Afghanistan issue were to come up during Mr. Trump’s India visit, the U.S. would look to India to support the peace process.

GSP likely to stay suspended for now

One official indicated that India’s benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), the U.S.’s preferential market access system for developing countries, was unlikely to be restored immediately. Restoring some degree of benefits has been on the negotiating table as the two countries try to hammer out a mini trade deal.

The concerns that led to the revocation of GSP access remain concerns for us, one of the administration officials said.

""We want to address a bunch…a lot of concerns and we're not quite there yet. We will likely have discussions with the Prime Minister about these concerns and continue the discussion beyond the visit,"" the official said.

The official said a number of announcements from India in the ""past several weeks"" have increased U.S. concerns around protectionism. Among the concerns of the U.S. on the trade front have been the 2019 draft e-commerce policy, the personal data privacy law, announcements in the Union Budget which included tariff increases on various agricultural commodities and a ‘health cess’ that would impact medical device imports.

""Whether or not there will be an announcement on a trade package is really wholly dependent upon what the Indians are prepared to do. That said, we have a number of significant commercial deals, which are of great significance that we're very pleased to announce in a number of key sectors,"" the official said.

Defence deals of up to $3.5 billion for MH-60R helicopters and apache attack helicopters have been approved by the Cabinet Committee on Security.

Indo-Pacific strategy

""The President is going to India as a demonstration of the strong and enduring ties between our two countries,"" the official said.

""These are ties based on shared democratic traditions, common strategic interests, and enduring bonds between our people.""

The official said the visit would focus on building the economic and energy ties between the U.S. and India. There would also be a focus on security and defence cooperation – against terrorism and to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific.

""The U.S. wants an India that is strong, with a capable military that supports peace, stability and a rules-based order in Indo-Pacific region. Indeed India is a pillar of our Indo-Pacific strategy and we continue to work together to promote this vision of a free and open international system based on market economics, good governance, freedom of the seas and skies and respect for sovereignty.""

51,2020/02/22,ED attaches 15 land parcels in bogus import case,"Funds said to be routed through 3,000 shell firms

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached 15 land parcels in Gujarat’s Surat, taking the value of total attachment in a case of bogus import to over ₹34 crore. The funds were allegedly routed using more than 3,000 companies.

The land measuring about 3,849 square metres belongs to one Madanlal Jain and is held in the name of Rivertouch Resorts Private Limited, a company allegedly controlled by him. Bank accounts with a total balance of ₹2.83 crore of Mr. Jain, who was allegedly involved in the racket, have also been attached.

Bank lodges complaint

The action has been taken under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, on the basis of a complaint received by the Surat Crime Branch from the ICICI Bank against R.A. Distributors Private Limited and others, alleging that the companies had furnished fake bills of entry for illegal outward remittances.

The ED probe revealed that nine companies having accounts with the ICICI Bank in Surat had remitted huge sums to three companies in the United Arab Emirates and 15 companies in Hong Kong, based on forged bills of entry.

“The main source of credits in these accounts are from eight entities, including Vandana & Co., Natural Trading Co. and Maruti Trading, having accounts in the Axis Bank, apart from around 469 other entities. Further, these said eight entities had received funds through various cheque discounters and a web of 2,700 companies,” said an official.

The agency alleges that Afroz Hasan Fatta, who is under investigation for his alleged role in a huge “hawala” racket, Mr. Jain, Bilal Haroon Gilani, Jayesh Desai and Rakesh Kothari were involved. “These accused persons created shell companies using dummy persons as directors/partners,” it said.

Mr. Jain had allegedly earned commissions for his role in the illegal transactions of foreign remittances made using fake bills of entry and was beneficiary of the proceeds of crime laundered and transferred from Indian companies to the accounts of Dubai-based Mabrook Trading FZE.

The agency had earlier arrested Mr. Fatta, Mr. Jain, Manish Shah, Mr. Kothari and Mr. Desai and attached their properties. Five chargesheets have been filed against them so far.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ed-attaches-15-land-parcels-in-bogus-import-case/article30885485.ece
52,2020/02/22,ED attaches assets of liquor Mafioso Sanjay Pratap Singh,"The money laundering probe is based on an FIR and a chargesheet filed by Bihar police

The Enforcement Directorate has attached the assets of a liquor Mafioso, Sanjay Pratap Singh, who sold spurious liquor resulting in the death of 21 persons in Bihar. He has been convicted to life imprisonment by the trial court.

The properties, worth about Rs.1.32 crore on paper, belongs to Singh and his wife, Kiran Devi.

Culpable homicide

The ED’s money laundering probe is based on an FIR and a chargesheet filed by the Bihar police against the liquor mafioso and others. They were accused of indulging in culpable homicide, cheating and criminal conspiracy in Bihar’s Ara.

The agency alleges that Singh had invested the ill-gotten money in immovable properties. In 2011, with the intention of legalising his tainted income, he formed an unregistered firm, Bhojpur Wine Traders. He also got into construction business, through a company named Maa Construction.

Action against ‘Naxals’

Immovable and movable properties worth ₹1.15 crore of Arvind Yadav and his family members have been attached by the agency. It is alleged that Yadav is an “active member” of the CPI (Maoist) and is an absconder. He was named in 61 FIRs registered in Bihar.

In some cases, the police have already filed chargesheets under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the Criminal Law Amendment Act, alleging extortion.

The ED has attached assets of two more alleged Naxal leaders, Abhijeet Yadav and Pintu Rana. While Yadav is linked to 55 FIRs registered in Jharkhand and Bihar, Rana has been named in 76 FIRs and chargesheets filed by the Jharkhand police. Cash rewards have been announced for his arrest.

The agency had earlier attached the properties of some alleged Naxal leaders of Bihar and Jharkhand, including Sandeep Yadav, Pradumn Sharma, Musafir Sahni, Vinay Yadav and Vinod Kumar Ganju.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ed-attaches-assets-of-liquor-mafioso-sanjay-pratap-singh/article30885046.ece
53,2020/02/22,Supreme Court dubs lawyers’ strikes a ‘joke’,"The top court was hearing an appeal against the verdict of the Uttarakhand High Court, which had held as “illegal” the strikes or boycotts of work on all Saturdays by lawyers in Dehradun and in several parts of Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar.

Strikes by advocates for “flimsy reasons”, like bomb blast in a Pakistan school and earthquake in Nepal, on all working Saturdays for more than the past 35 years in three districts of Uttarakhand have caught the attention of the Supreme Court, which rapped them for resorting to such a “joke”.

The top court was hearing an appeal against the verdict of the Uttarakhand High Court, which had held as “illegal” the strikes or boycotts of work on all Saturdays by lawyers in Dehradun and in several parts of Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar. In its September 25, 2019 verdict, the High Court had referred to the 266th report of the Law Commission, which had analysed data on loss of working days on account of strikes by lawyers and had opined that it affected the functioning of courts and contributed to the ever-mounting pendency of cases.

As per information sent by the High Court to the Law Commission with respect to Uttarakhand for 2012-2016, advocates were on strike for 455 days during this period in Dehradun district, followed by 515 days in Haridwar district.

The High Court had noted that such strikes were seldom for justifiable reasons. “To mention a few, blast in a Pakistan school, amendments to Sri Lanka’s Constitution, inter-State river water disputes, attack on/murder of an advocate, quake in Nepal... and even for kavi-sammelans,” it had said.

The appeal against the HC verdict came up for hearing before a Bench of Justices Arun Mishra and M.R. Shah on Thursday.

“This is happening everywhere in the country. This is a fit case to initiate suo motu contempt. How can bar association say that they will continue with the strike?” the Bench remarked. “Things have collapsed,” the Bench said, adding, “The HC order is fully justified. We cannot permit things like this... You are doing a joke. Family member of advocate dies and the entire bar will go on strike?” the Bench said while reserving its order on an appeal filed by a lawyers’ body of Dehradun.

The counsel appearing for the petitioner told the Bench that strikes had stopped in Dehradun district.

In its verdict, the High Court had noted that “genesis of this peculiar form” of protest of boycotting work on Saturdays for over 35 years was traceable to western Uttar Pradesh, of which the aforesaid districts formed part of, before the state of Uttarakhand was created on November 9, 2000.

It had noted that advocates from western Uttar Pradesh have been on strike on all Saturdays for the past three and half decades in pursuit of their demand that a high court bench be established in the region.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/co0nkt/article30636231.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24TH-SUPREME,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-dubs-lawyers-strikes-a-joke/article30884927.ece

The Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by the government will also inquire into the alleged insider trading in the purchase of lands in the Amaravati region, and those involved in it will be brought to book soon, Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao has said.

Addressing the media in Tirupati on Saturday after inaugurating the two-day Girijana Vidyarthi Samakhya Mela, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said that the government believed that insider trading indeed happened in Amaravati.

“Senior police officers of the rank of DIG are members of the SIT. The accused will soon be produced in the court of law,” the Minister said.

Earlier, addressing the samakhya delegates, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said it was the YSRCP government that was ensuring social justice to all sections of people and striving for the uplift of the SCs, STs, BCs and minorities.

Stating that Andhra Pradesh was a repository of rich culture and heritage of tribal population, he said, “The government has taken every step to preserve and protect the culture of tribal communities.”

Samakhya national president V. Sankar Naik said that STs were a deprived lot since long. “The YSRCP government has restored the self-respect and dignity of the STs by providing them berths in the Cabinet,” he added.

Interestingly, the Minister danced along with the tribal artistes before flagging off the rally.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ev4td0/article30891781.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23VJPG4-MUTTAMSETTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sit-will-probe-land-deals-in-amaravati-muttamsetti/article30891782.ece

Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development Botcha Satyanarayana on Saturday said the government constituted the Special Investigation Team (SIT) to inquire into the alleged irregularities in major policies, projects, programmes, and key administrative sanctions during the TDP term post bifurcation as highlighted by the Cabinet Sub Committee in its report.

“Leaders who were Ministers then and others involved in the alleged wrongdoings should face the inquiry instead of accusing the government of harassing them,” Mr. Satyanarayana said.

The Minister was addressing the media after reviewing the arrangements for the Chief Minister’s visit on February 24.

ESI row

Referring to the alleged irregularities committed in the purchase of medicines and equipment for the ESI hospitals when K. Atchannaidu was Minister for Labour and Employment during the TDP term, Mr. Satyanarayana said, “The TDP leaders are saying that Mr. Atchannaidu is being dragged into the issue as he belongs to the Backward Classes. This is a baseless argument. Every leader, irrespective of the caste he or she belongs to, is answerable as public money is involved. The SIT will take care of such issues in a free and fair manner.”

He further denied the allegations being levelled by the opposition parties that the government was forcibly acquiring land for distribution of house sites to the poor.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/face-probe-by-sit-botcha-tells-tdp-leaders/article30891764.ece

It is alleged that a few directors, doctors, pharmacists, administrative officers and clerical staff purchased medicines, lab and surgical equipment, and furniture illegally from a few companies in violation of norms.

“The Vigilance and Enforcement (V&E) Department, which conducted an inquiry into the alleged multi-crore scandal, has submitted a report to the government recommending criminal action against the officers, staff members and company managements for misusing public money,” said CPI (M) State Secretariat member Ch. Babu Rao.

Party’s West Krishna secretary D.Y. Krishna alleged that a few former Ministers and bureaucrats were involved in the scam.

57,2020/02/22,HRF cries halt to mining at Kalyanalova reservoir,"It seeks high-level inquiry into ‘brazen violation’ of norms

The Human Rights Forum (HRF) has sought a joint inquiry by the district Collector, the Chief Engineer (Irrigation, North Andhra) and the Chief Conservator of Forests into what it calls “multiple mining illegalities” and wanton destruction of the catchment area of the Kalyanalova reservoir in Cheemalapadu panchayat of Ravikamatam mandal in the district.

Speaking after inaugurating a photo exhibition at the reservoir site depicting the perilous state of environment after granite mining was undertaken in the area on Saturday, HRF functionary V.S. Krishna alleged that two granite firms were operating in the area, as a result of which inflows into the dam diminished.

The exhibition was organised by the Save Kalyana Lova Movement, which chose the day since thousands of people from across the district congregate at the site the day after Maha Sivratri every year.

The activists of the organisation interacted with the people and explained them the hazards that mining had brought to the area.

“The brazen manner in which Somalamma Konda, located in the Cheemalapadu Reserve Forest, is being dug up is disturbing. The quarrying activity is destroying the hill streams and various springs located in the area. An investigation will expose the officials and miners responsible for the devastation. They must be prosecuted as per law,” Mr. Krishna stated.

‘NOC not obtained’

“The government is constitutionally obliged to protect the area and ensure that the streams that feed the Varaha river, which flows into the reservoir, and the forest are not affected,” he said, and added that the Irrigation Department had in June last said it was neither consulted nor the requisite NOC obtained before taking up mining.

Farmers and adivasis had brought many irregularities, including falsifying of documents and suppressing of key facts, to the officials concerned but to no avail, he alleged.

‘Threat to dam safety’

Nalli Kalyanam of the A.P. Adivasi Hakkula Sadhana Sangham and P.S. Ajay Kumar of the Save Kalyana Lova Movement said that mining had already devastated a large reserve forest area. The unbridled activity, besides obstructing the natural flow of water into the reservoir, was also threatening the safety of the dam, they said.

The farmers and adivasis present at the event demanded that the mines be shut down and the area declared as a no-mining zone.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/x89hjo/article30891682.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23VJPG4-HRF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hrf-cries-halt-to-mining-at-kalyanalova-reservoir/article30891683.ece

63,2020/02/22,‘Treasure’ hunters on the prowl in Palamaner forests,"Special teams constituted to nab the gangs, says police official

Several batches of youth from the villages bordering the Chittoor district and Tamil Nadu, accompanied by self-styled swamijis involved in occult practices, have been on the prowl in the forests of Palamaner range since a couple of months, in search of ‘treasures’, resorting to digging at forested temples and on the banks of rivulets deep inside the forests.

It all came to light when two persons from Chennai suffered electric shock in the fields on their way to a forest location nearby at Kamsalonikunta hamlet under the Doddipalle beat of the Palamaner range, a fortnight ago.

During the police interrogation, it was revealed that the duo suffered electric shock from the clandestinely arranged cables meant for hunting wild boars. The victims informed the police that they were part of a treasure-hunters’ gang from Tamil Nadu, in collaboration with the local youth.

The gangs undertake digging at some select corners of the temples located inside the forests. There were rumours prevailing among the gangs hunting for treasures that vessels containing gold coins (lanke bindelu) dating back to centuries lay hidden in some of the temples in the forest areas. Some ‘tantriks’ from Chennai and surrounding areas have taken advantage of the weakness of treasure hunters, and joined them on the pretext of helping them to detect the treasures. The police said that these gangs were active in the forests of Palamaner, Baireddipalle, and Bangarupalem mandals.

Cause for concern

In addition to the menace of treasure hunters, the police are facing another major problem with the clandestine arrangement of live power cables across fields and forest fringes by some miscreants in search of wild boars. This activity is also causing a big concern to the forest personnel in view of the presence of over forty wild elephants in the Koundinya wildlife sanctuary, which take to crop raids frequently.

The risk of elephants facing electrocution in the sanctuary belt became more with death of six elephants in a span of one year.

Deputy SP (Palamaner) S. Arifulla told The Hindu that surveillance would be mounted in all the forested villages and border areas vulnerable to the activities of treasure hunters. “In the recent episode of two persons suffering electric shock near Palamaner, the condition of one of them is said to be critical, facing the risk of leg amputation. Some youth and gullible villagers of the inter-State region are falling prey to the lure of the fake swamijis, tempting them with treasures.

“By venturing into forests, they are risking their lives. Action will also be taken against the miscreants setting live cables in the fields and forest fringes. Our special teams are working to nab the treasure-hunter gangs in the border areas. One self-styled swamiji from Chennai is at large,” said the Deputy SP.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/d1bfpq/article30890876.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23ONGOLEFOREST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/treasure-hunters-on-the-prowl-in-palamaner-forests/article30890877.ece

The Andhra Pradesh government has formed a 10-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) to conduct a comprehensive inquiry into alleged irregularities, particularly land deals in the Amaravati capital region, during the previous Telugu Desam Party (TDP) regime.

The report of a Cabinet sub-committee on the “procedural, legal and financial irregularities and fraudulent transactions concerning various projects, including issues related to land in the CRDA region” will form the basis for the SIT probe, an order issued by Praveen Prakash, General Administration Department Principal Secretary (Political), said.

The SIT headed by a Deputy Inspector General of Police-rank IPS officer, will inquire, register, investigate and conclude the investigation according to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) on the subject matter, it said.

The SIT, which has two other IPS officers and other police officials, will also function as a nodal single point contact, including for sharing of information and coordinate with the State and Central investigating agencies,if required.

The Cabinet sub-committee was constituted by the Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy government in June 2019, to “review major policies, projects, programmes, institutions established [corporations, societies etc.] and key administrative actions since the bifurcation of A.P. on June 02, 2014” impacting the State’s development.

The sub-committee presented the first part of its report to the government in December last, highlighting the various procedural, legal and financial “irregularities and fraudulent transactions” concerned with various projects, including the issues related to land in the CRDA region.

The report was tabled and discussed in the State Assembly after the Cabinet accepted it.

Subsequently, the government decided to get the issue inquired by a specialised agency and thus constituted the SIT.

Intelligence DIG Kolli Raghuram Reddy will head the SIT, which also has SP-rank IPS officers Babujee Attada and V. Appala Naidu.

The SIT will later be notified as a “police station” as per provisions of the CrPC.

Among other things, the SIT will investigate “insider trading” of land committed by several individuals having prior knowledge of the location of the new capital and alleged manipulation of boundaries of the capital under Land Pooling Scheme for monetary gains through the appreciation of land value.

No time frame has been set for the SIT to complete the investigation and file a chargesheet.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/gtp3jr/article30867135.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20ONG4JAGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sit-to-probe-into-irregularities-in-amaravati-capital-region/article30888920.ece

67,2020/02/22,‘Tribals in cut-off area want development’,"They want roads, but Maoists are obstructing it, says Malkangiri Collector

Post the incident at Janturayi village in the cut-off area of Andhra Odisha Border, in which a senior Maoist leader was stoned to death and another seriously injured by tribal people, the locals, braving the threat of retaliation from the banned outfit, have come out openly demanding development in their area.

District Collector of Malkangiri, Manish Agarwal, who visited the area after the incident told The Hindu that the tribals, who had been facing hardship for over six decades, now want development at a faster pace.

The cut-off area, which comprise 151 habitations spread over nine panchayats, started witnessing development with the opening of the Gurupriya bridge in July 2018.

“Now we are building roads, which is enabling people to reach the mainland in two to three hours in case of medical emergencies. They want more roads and the Maoists are obstructing their construction,” he said.

The conflict, which led to the death of the Maoist cadre in the intervening night of January 25 and 26, was mainly due to the Maoists trying to threaten the tribal people for supporting the construction of the road from Jantapai to Jodomba via Vantalagudda.

“This area is an interior part of the cut-off area. As there has been no development since many years, the Maoists have established base there. Now, they feel threatened. But the tribals want development,” he said.

Braving the threat from the Maoists, the Collector and his team visited Jodomba and provided ₹30,000 as relief from CMRF and ₹3,000 as emergency fund to the tribals, as their houses were burnt by the Maoists in retaliation.

“Apart from the immediate relief, we will also provide fresh Aadhaar cards as they lost their belongings in fire. Apart from roads, we will be providing street lights and other facilities,” said Mr. Agarwal.

Earlier, tribals from Jantri used to take 24 hours, which included 12 hours of boat ride, to reach a PHC at Chitrakonda or Malkangiri. Now, with the bridge and roads, they can reach in three hours, so why will they not look for development,” he said.

In the intervening night of January 25 and 26, four hardcore Maoists, accompanied by 15 militia members, entered Janturayi and asked the residents to oppose development and hand over four youth for supporting the government agencies that were involved in road building. They also asked the tribals not to hoist the national flag on Republic Day. Opposing the threat, the tribals beat them up, in which one Maoist, Ganga Madhi alias Adma, was killed and another Jipra Hatrika was injured.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/k0hjxc/article30886744.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04VJPAGE5COLLECTOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tribals-in-cut-off-area-want-development/article30886745.ece

70,2020/02/22,Missing girls traced in Bengaluru,"The missing case of the three sisters, who reportedly left home on February 17, has been cracked with teams of Dwaraka Nagar police tracing them in Bengaluru. It was learnt that a police team will hand over the girls to their parents in Bengaluru.

It may be recalled that three sisters aged between 17 and 22 years have reportedly gone missing from Dwaraka Nagar area in Visakhapatnam city. Father of the girl, Yerram Naidu, who works as a watchman in an apartment at Dwaraka Nagar area, immediately lodged a complaint with the Dwaraka Nagar police on the same day. Tension prevailed, as the girls also sent a message to their parents that they were leaving home intentionally to end their lives.

Based on the complaint, the police formed three teams and started to check CCTV footages at various parts including bus stations, railway station and also inquired with passengers of various travels.

Financial issues

As per initial investigation it is learnt that the girls left home due to financial issues. It is also learnt that among the three, the elder one reportedly managed to get a job in Chennai.

“The three girls initially left to Chennai in a bus, to their relatives’ house. However, after reaching Chennai, they felt that their relatives would hand them over to their parents, so they left again to Bengaluru in a train,” said Inspector Murali Rao.

Investigation revealed that the girls felt that their parents would not search for them, if they inform them that they are committing suicide. The girls blocked their mobile phones and disposed of the SIM cards to make sure that they do not get traced.

“Acting on a tip-off, we traced them in Bengaluru within three days,” Mr. Murali Rao added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/missing-girls-traced-in-bengaluru/article30884387.ece

Principal Secretary, IT, Electronics and Communication Kona Sasidhar has said the State government would develop IT concept cities in Visakhapatnam, Tirupati and Anantapur to bring investments and create job opportunities.

He said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was keen on developing IT in a big way after inaugurating two-day annual conference of Computer Society of India here.

Ghosh and IBM India Geography Executive ((Europe, Middle East and Africa) Sobodh Sarangi spoke.

In his address, Mr. Sasidhar said IT concept cities – a new idea mooted by the State government – would envisage integrated development to focus exclusively on IT.

He said the Chief Minister would release the new IT policy soon. “At present, the draft policy is ready. We will unveil the final policy after consulting the industries and stakeholders,” he explained.

High-end skill varsity

Mr. Sasidhar said a high-end IT skill development university would come up in Visakhapatnam under the aegis of the industry, the State government and leading universities of the world.

To a question, later he told reporters that it would come up in a year. The university would produce the highly-skilled IT professionals required by the industries involved in new technologies like edge and cognitive technologies, robotics, artificial intelligence, predictive and data analysis.

73,2020/02/22,"AIMIM pursuing a divisive agenda, says BJYM leader","‘Owaisi claims to be a secularist in Parliament, but spreads hatred outside of it’

BJP Yuva Morcha State president N. Ramesh Naidu on Friday slammed All India Majlis Ittehadul Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi and his brother Akbaruddin Owaisi for ‘pursuing a divisive agenda’.

“The tone and tenor of the comments made by Asaduddin Owaisi and his brother Akbaruddin on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act are proof that the brothers are pursuing a divisive agenda, which poses a threat to national integrity,” Mr. Ramesh Naidu said.

In a press release, Mr. Naidu said that Mr. Asaduddin would claim to be a secularist while in Parliament but would spread communal hatred outside of it.

The participation of YSRCP, TDP and Congress leaders in the anti-CAA meetings and rallies involving the AIMIM would be construed as harbouring ill-will against the Hindus, Mr. Ramesh Naidu said.

“The YSRCP and TDP supported the CAA during a debate in Parliament but they have now taken a stand against it in public. This shows their double standards,” Mr. Naidu alleged. He questioned how people’s representatives who swore by the Constitution are now defying laws enacted by Parliament.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/aimim-pursuing-a-divisive-agenda-says-bjym-leader/article30884252.ece
74,2020/02/22,"Don’t give RTC routes to private buses, says union","Leaders threaten to stage a collective protest if their demand is not met

Leaders of the Employees Union (EU) of the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) and RTC Joint Action Committee (JAC) are up in arms against a proposal made by the public transport carrier’s Vice-Chairman and Managing Director D. Madireddy Pratap on allowing private bus operators to ply on APSRTC routes.

“On one hand, Transport Minister Perni Venkataramaiah has been assuring unions that the State government would not take any step that is detrimental to the interests of the organisation and its workers, while on the other hand, Mr. Pratap is taking a unilateral stand on key issues related to the future of the Corporation,” EU State president Y.V. Rao and JAC convener P. Damodar Rao said in a statement on Friday.

The union leaders said that the Minister had on several occasions denied that there were plans to privatise the APSRTC.

“But Mr. Pratap, when faced with opposition to his proposal by the union leaders, had been insisting that there was no harm in permitting private buses to operate on routes earmarked for RTC buses,” they claimed.

The leaders also found fault with Mr. Pratap’s ‘autocratic’ style of functioning and demanded that the proposal be withdrawn at the earliest. They said that if Mr. Pratap continues to stick to his stand, all unions in the APSRTC would come together and stage a collective protest against his decisions.

‘Issues not discussed’

Mr. Pratap, who had assumed charge as the Vice-Chairman and Managing Director of the Corporation on January 2, had kept the unions at arm’s length, the leaders alleged. There were important issues related to the workers that needed to be discussed with him but he has not given them an audience so far, they said.

Contrary to the expectations of the workers that the Corporation’s merger with the State Government would ease their problems, the union leaders said that the management seemed to be in no mood to address their issues.

They warned that if the existing circumstances were allowed to continue, the workers would be forced to take up agitations against the government.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/rakctv/article30884237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22-VJ-APSRTC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/dont-give-rtc-routes-to-private-buses-says-union/article30884238.ece
75,2020/02/22,Guntur district set for massive house site distribution drive,"2.50 lakh beneficiaries to get plots by Ugadi, says Joint Collector

The Guntur district administration is on course to provide house sites for over 2.50 lakh beneficiaries in Guntur district by Ugadi this year.

The government is acquiring 1,875 acres of land under the AP Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, to be given away in four revenue divisions by March 25 in the biggest house site distribution drive ever taken up by any State Government.

Joint Collector A.S Dinesh Kumar said that out of 2.50 lakh beneficiaries, 1.40 lakh are in urban areas and 1.10 lakh in rural areas. In Guntur Municipal Corporation limits, 66,000 beneficiaries would be provided house sites, followed by 17,000 in Tenali.

In city limits, where the cost of the land is prohibitively higher, the State Government is planning to build G+2 structures. In rural areas, each beneficiary would be given 1.50 cents of land.

In another novel initiative, the district administration plans to develop lay outs, have internal roads and peg marks to demarcate land. The beneficiaries would also have a Convince Deed with which he/she can either mortgage land or pledge his land to obtain bank loans.

‘Transparent acquisition’

“We are following a transparent land acquisition process where a team of officials headed by the District Collector will assess conditions, discuss with landowners and enter into a agreement with the landowner. After the agreement is signed based on mutual consent, the landowner is credited the money directly into his/her bank account. So far, we have ensured that an amount of ₹7 crore has been directly transferred out of the demand of ₹25 crore. We hope to complete the entire process within the next 15 days,” said Mr. Dinesh Kumar.

Ruling out any concerns of forcible acquisition, Mr. Dinesh Kumar said that in most areas, local landowners were convinced of the government’s moves to provide land to weaker sections.

“In rural areas, we are tapping funds under MGNREGS to develop the plots and in future, the house plots will act as a great leveler, pulling the underprivileged communities out of poverty,” Mr. Dinesh Kumar said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/guntur-district-set-for-massive-house-site-distribution-drive/article30884229.ece

Mr. Sravan is the son of Kidari Sarveswara Rao, an MLA from Araku, who along with another TDP leader Siveri Soma was shot dead by Maoists on September 23, 2018 near Livitiputtu village of Dumbriguda mandal in Visakhapatnam Agency.

After his father’s death, Mr. Sravan was inducted into N. Chandrababu Naidu’s Cabinet as Minister of Health and Tribal Welfare.

In his representation to Mr. Babujee, Mr. Sravan claimed that he was on the hit list of the Maoists, and that there was a continuing threat to him and his family members from the left-wing extremists.

“Despite facing life threats, the State Government has removed by security,” he said.

Immediately after the assassination of his father, the TDP government enhanced Mr. Sravan’s security and provided him Octopus cover, which is considered an elite anti-terrorist outfit. He was also provided a bullet-proof vehicle.

After the TDP lost the Assembly elections in 2019, Mr. Sravan said that the Octopus cover was withdrawn and his security gradually reduced from 17 personnel to just eight. Later, the security cover was brought down to four personnel and finally it was completely removed, he said, with the government reportedly citing that he faced no further threats to his life.

Left parties released a Telugu translation of the Communist Manifesto to mark the 172nd year of the publication of the political document, in the city on Friday.

Titled ‘Communist Manifesto: Communism Principles’, the translation is authored by A. Gandhi and was released by CPI national general secretary D. Raja here on Friday. Organisers chose a small park around statues of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who drafted the Communist Manifesto, to release the book.

“The country is going through a critical period due to fascist policies being pursued by the RSS and BJP. The Communist Manifesto is a great weapon to keep them in check. There is a need for all to work together and fight them,” Mr. Raja said.

“The manifesto continues to inspire people across the world, including in India, even after 172 years of its publication. It offers a solution to present-day issues being faced by people in the country,” Mr. Raja said. “It gives ideological guidance. The manifesto changed the course of political development in the world,” he added.

Mr. Raja said that though Marx and Engels lived in Europe and their experience was limited to Europe, they managed to write extensively on India. “It is the greatness of Marx and Engels. and we should be proud of them and read what they have written about our country. Now, everyone is speaking about the Asiatic mode of production. Marx and Engels discussed Asiatic development in their documents,” Mr. Raja said.

“We may not be in power in Andhra Pradesh or in Delhi. That does not mean that we have shrunk within the country or our ideological and political influence has shrunk. The Communist Manifesto is a ray of hope for people of the country,” he said.

Scientists of the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Aquaculture (RGCA), a research wing of Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), have shown that lands used for aquaculture can also be used to raise agriculture and horticulture crops.

RGCA officials, who were raising Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia (GIFT), a fish variety with Omega-3 fatty acid, at Manikonda village in Krishna district, were cultivating many horticulture and agriculture crops as inter-crops on the bunds in between the ponds.

MPEDA chairman K.S. Srinivas, who visited the Tilapia project at Manikonda, the only research wing of RGCA in the country, praised RGCA national project director S. Kandan and project officer in-charge B. Appala Naidu for using the pond water and fish excreta for raising agriculture and horticulture crops, which increase greenery and prevent pollution.

“There is a misconception that lands being used for aquaculture are unfit for agriculture and the water will pollute the neighbouring lands. But MPEDA and RGCA officials proved that aquaculture land is fit for horticulture, sericulture and agriculture,” Mr. Srinivas said.

Dr. Kandan said that the Assistant Project Managers of the RGCA project, P. Srinivas and Mathews, were raising tomatoes, chilli, brinjals, bottle gourd, black gram, beetroot, spinach and other leafy vegetables and flowers without using any pesticides.

“We supply water used in the fish ponds to the horticulture and agriculture crops being raised on the bunds, and are getting bumper yield,” said MPEDA Vijayawada Regional Centre Joint Director Y. Vijay Kumar.

Officials praised

Minister of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries Giriraj Singh, along with aqua farmers of different States, visited the RGCA project at Manikonda village and praised MPEDA officials for cultivating internal crops between the aqua ponds.

“We are utilising the vacant lands on the bunds and raising horticulture crops, pulses and leafy vegetables. Aqua farmers can use the similar practice at their ponds and avoid wastage of land and prevent pollution,” the MPEDA chairman told The Hindu.

Mr. Appala Naidu said that on knowing about cultivation of internal crops in aqua ponds, students from different universities across the country are visiting the project.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/5z2v9f/article30884182.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22-VJ-RGCA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/aquaculture-land-can-be-used-for-agriculture-crops/article30884183.ece

Minister for Labour and Employment G. Jayaram said on Friday that stringent action would be taken against the three directors of the Insurance Medical Services (IMS) and all others involved in the ESI scandal.

Addressing the media here, Mr. Jayaram said that former Ministers K. Atchannaidu and Pithani Satyanarayana, who were allegedly involved in the scam, would also not be spared if they were found to be guilty.

Mr. Jayaram stated that the pattern appeared to be similar between the companies in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, which looted people’s money.

‘Norms flouted’

Staff Reporter in Srikakulam writes:

Roads and Buildings Minister Dharmana Krishnadas said the government would order an investigation into the alleged irregularities in the purchase of medicines and medical equipment for the ESI hospitals.

In a release here, Mr. Krishnadas alleged that Mr. Atchannaidu was involved in the scam as he had allowed the purchases without calling for tenders.

“The process of calling for tenders is compulsory for works costing more than ₹5 lakh. But Mr. Atchannaidu had chosen the nomination process for purchases of ₹500 crore. It is nothing but misuse of power and funds.

81,2020/02/22,‘APERC striving to ensure consumer satisfaction’,"New tariff order benefits a majority of them, says its Chairman

“The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) will scrutinise power purchases regularly to bring down the costs to the exchequer. Its focus is on improving the overall efficiency of the power sector. It is making every effort to achieve the sole objective of ensuring affordable and quality power round the clock and high-quality services to the consumers, its Chairman Justice (Retd) C.V. Nagarjuna Reddy has said.

Addressing a review meeting on Friday, Mr. Nagarjuna Reddy said the commission was striving to develop a consumer-centric approach in the power sector.

As a step towards that, the APERC issued a consumer-friendly tariff order benefiting the poor, the middle and the upper middle-class consumers, he said, and observed that the decision to levy energy charges based on consumption in a billing month against the conventional method of taking consumption during the previous financial year would benefit almost 99% of the total 1.45 crore consumers.

Thrust areas

Mr. Nagarjuna Reddy said the commission attached priority to transparency and accountability, improving quality and efficiency, promoting new technologies, reducing transmission and distribution losses and supplying cost-effective power.

82,2020/02/22,Andhra Pradesh farmers’ battle against pests gets innovative,"Thanks to ingenuity of an engineering graduate, farmers deploy drones to spray pesticides

An engineering graduate’s ingenuity is helping farmers of the delta region save their crops from the virulent pest attacks.

V. Sudhir, a native of Tumuluru village near Tenali, has started assembling drones with parts imported from China and using them.

“I was thinking of doing jobs after completing B.Tech. But I hit upon the idea of assembling drones to spray pesticide. I assembled a drone and tried to spray pesticide and it yielded result. Spraying with the help of drones will ensure that the pesticide sticks to the leaves and the plant, which helps in building resistance against pests,” claims Mr. Sudhir.

The innovative practice is the latest in the series of revolutions sweeping the Krishna western delta region, billed as the rice bowl of the State.

It was in this fertile region that the farmers had experimented successfully with direct sowing of paddy, worked to produce the highest per-acre yield of maize in the country. And now, they are using drones to spray pesticide.

For many years, the dreaded cut worm has wreaked havoc on the vast swathes of maize. The Taiwanese sprayers have worked for some time. But in the long run, they have proved ineffective and, as a result, the farmers have not been getting remunerative price for the produce.

The use of drones for spraying pesticide has proved successful.

Many benefits

Farmers fill the tank below the drone with the chemical and map the area on Google. The drone is then allowed to fly and spray pesticide. It takes just two hours to complete spraying in over eight acres. In contrast, the traditional sprayer takes at least 90 minutes to complete the job in one acre.

“We have started using drones to spray pesticide in maize fields. We are able to save water too, as its needs just 10 litres. Earlier, we had to use 200 litres of water. Drones are also saving us the manpower. Besides, we run lesser risk of being affected by the harmful pesticides,” says Alla Gopireddy of Kollipara village.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/xnsx63/article30884030.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22VJPG4-DRONES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/andhra-pradesh-farmers-battle-against-pests-gets-innovative/article30884031.ece
83,2020/02/22,"CPI will support agitation for Amaravati, says Raja","‘No State in the country has three capitals’

Members of the Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi JAC on Friday submitted a memorandum to CPI national general secretary D. Raja, urging him to extend his support to their agitation against the State government’s decision to shift the capital from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam.

Responding to their request, Mr. Raja said, “Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has 30 advisers, apart from five Deputy Chief Ministers and other Cabinet colleagues. It is a big question as to who has given him such an advice. No State in the country has three capitals.”

Stating that the CPI had clarity on the issue, Mr. Raja said it would extend its support to the nationwide protest if required. “There is a need to take the protest to Delhi. Every person has a right to register his or her protest in a democracy. But it is not correct on the part of the government to slap false cases against the protesters,” he said, and added that the CPI would continue its fight for Special Category Status (SCS) too.

Farmers’ rally

Party State secretary K. Ramakrishna said the CPI was chalking out plans to launch an agitation at the national level on the capital issue. A farmers’ rally would be organised on February 26, he said.

84,2020/02/22,Belagavi division reports highest number of snakebites,"Highest number of deaths in Kalaburagi division

Though the number of deaths due to snakebites are on a decline, cases of bites remain high in the State and the Health and Family Welfare Department recorded the highest cases in Belagavi division in 2019. The highest number of deaths, 17, have been reported from Kalaburagi division.

While Belagavi division recorded 3,209 bites last year, Bengaluru division followed with 3,176 cases of snakebites. Mysuru division reported 2,648 snakebites and Kalaburagi division 2,060.

However, sources said the number of snakebites are actually higher than official figures. Most cases are not recorded as victims end up availing the services of local practitioners.

In the corresponding period in 2018, Bengaluru division recorded the highest number of snakebites at 2,962. This was followed by Belagavi division with 2,813 snakebites cases.

According to official figures, the number of snakebites increased from 10,244 in 2018 to 11,093 in 2019. While Shivamogga district continues to record the highest number of snakebites (930) in 2019 too, Kalaburagi district had the highest number of deaths. In 2018, 790 snakebites were reported from Shivamogga, the highest.

B.G. Prakash, State Joint Director (Communicable Diseases), said the State had adequate stock of anti-snake venom vials. “We have enough stock in all our health facilities,” he said, adding that all cases that come to government hospitals are recorded.

According to data provided by the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence to Parliament on November 29, 2019, 3,013 people died of snakebites between 2016 and 2018. While 1,068 deaths were recorded in 2016, 1,060 and 885 were recorded in 2017 and 2018 respectively.

Denny John, review member of the World Health Organisation’s Working Group on Snake Bite Envenoming, told The Hindu that lack of understanding among people and doctors on how to manage snakebites apart from accessibility, availability and quality of anti-snake venom (ASV) could be the contributing factors for high morbidity due to snakebites in some States.

“Also, there is lack of information on the availability of ASV in hospitals. A large number of deaths occur because the primary health centres do not have anti-venom and doctors are not trained sufficiently to deal with bites,” he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/5dte04/article30891663.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22bgsnakebitescol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/belagavi-division-reports-highest-number-of-snakebites/article30891664.ece
85,2020/02/22,Anti-CAA arrests: Home Minister calls meeting of senior police officers today,"‘It will take stock of the trend of disturbing peace by roping in youngsters for anti-national activity’

Close on the heels of two youngsters being arrested by the police for their alleged “anti-national” statements in the course of protests against the Citizen (Amendment) Act, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai has called a meeting of senior-level police officials in Bengaluru on Sunday to take stock of the situation and discuss preventive steps.

Speaking at Davangere, Mr. Bommai expressed concerns over the “growing anti-national activities” and said there seemed to be an organised network that needs a thorough probe. “There are efforts to disturb peace in the State by roping in youngsters for anti-national activity. The Sunday meeting will discuss measures to curb the trend,” he said.

Accommodation searched

Meanwhile, the SJ Park police, probing the background of Ardra Narayanan who was arrested on Friday for protesting with an allegedly controversial placard, conducted mahazar at the paying guest accommodation at C.V. Raman Nagar. Ardra is learnt to have told the police that there was no organisational backing for her act.

According to senior officers, Ardra said she attended the programme where Amulya Leona who was arrested for raising “Pakistan Zindabad” slogans took part at Freedom Park. After Amulya was arrested for sloganeering, Ardra returned to her paying guest accommodation and made the placard that read “Muslim, Dalit, Kashmiri, Bahujan, Adivasi, Trans Liberation Now” in English and Kannada.

Ardra had come to Town Hall where pro-Hindutva organisations were staging a protest demanding strict action against Amulya. The organisers had swooped down on Ardra and the police had at this point taken the lone protester into custody. Currently, both Amulya and Ardra are housed in the same cell at Parapana Agrahara central prison.

Special team formed

Meanwhile, a special team of police has been formed to probe Amulya’s case. The police have summoned Imran Pasha, Padarayanapura Councillor from JD(S), for questioning.

He was among the anti-CAA protest organisers at Freedom Park where Amulya was arrested.

The police have recorded Mr. Pasha’s statement to ascertain who invited and allowed Amulya to speak. The police are also probing the background of Amulya to ascertain her contacts.

City Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao said the city police were going to make the rule strict for protesters to monitor such activities in future. The police have informed college authorities across the city to inform them if they find any such activities, a senior police officer said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/uyf6bj/article30891655.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BGAMULYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/anti-caa-arrests-home-minister-calls-meeting-of-senior-police-officers-today/article30891656.ece
86,2020/02/22,KPSC turns down RTI request for copies of answer sheets,"While the commission cites a SC order, aspirants cite another to counter it

Amidst allegations by unsuccessful aspirants of widespread tampering of marks in the Gazetted Probationers’ selection examinations for the 2015 batch, the Karnataka Public Service Commission (KPSC) has refused to give copies of answer sheets to candidates under the Right to Information Act, 2005.

The refusal by KPSC comes even as the selection list has been challenged in the High Court over allegations of irregularities in the evaluation process. The aspirants have alleged “complete lack of transparency” by KPSC.

Citing apex court orders

Responding to an RTI request, KPSC said the request had been rejected as per the Supreme Court order dated February 20, 2018.

A copy of this is available with The Hindu.

The said Apex Court order set aside a High Court order directing Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to give copies of answer sheets of Civil Services (Prelims), 2010, exams. Since the papers are now digitally evaluated and marks for each question entered into a database directly and not on the physical paper, the RTI application had also sought marks allotted to each question. That has also been rejected quoting the same Apex Court order.

However, KPSC aspirants who have sought copies of answer sheets point to another Supreme Court order dated July 16, 2018, where the Apex Court ordered Uttar Pradesh PSC to allow aspirants to examine the answer sheets they submitted.

The order says the examiner does not hold fiduciary relationship with the answer script and disclosing it in no way hampers public interest. “In our opinion, permitting a candidate to inspect the answer sheet does not involve any public interest nor does it affect the efficient operation of the government,” the judgment said, adding that the issue of confidentiality had to be taken care of and the examiner’s names not revealed.

“If KPSC has nothing to hide, why is it not being transparent? They are quoting one Supreme Court order whereas there is yet another order later to the judgment that pertains to a State PSC, which clearly states the contrary. This only strengthens our suspicion,” contended Aysha Farzana, an aspirant now challenging the selection list.

A set of unsuccessful aspirants organised under “Welfare Forum of Aggrieved KAS Aspirants” have alleged that marks were tampered with after the digital evaluation process.

An RTI application has also been filed seeking CCTV footage of the evaluation room for the relevant period. This application has not got any reply even after the stipulated 30 days, applicant Sudhanva said.

No break-up of marks

What has also drawn the ire of aspirants is that KPSC is yet to publish the break-up of marks the candidates got in individual papers. The list announced on December 23, 2019, gives the total marks a candidate secured out of 1,950, but not the break-up of marks in seven papers of 250 marks each and interview for 200 marks.

“For the 2014 batch, this break-up of marks for all candidates was notified within three days of the list. But this time, even after 60 days, KPSC is yet to give us a break-up of the marks we have scored in each of these papers,” Ms. Farzana said. KPSC was not available for comment.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/m103m/article30891653.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BGKPSC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kpsc-turns-down-rti-request-for-copies-of-answer-sheets/article30891654.ece

89,2020/02/22,AIISH hearing camp evokes good response,"About one in three between the ages of 55 and 74 years have hearing loss

The free hearing check-up camp organised at the All India Institute of Speech and Hearing (AIISH) as part of World Hearing Day evoked a good response. Over 115 elderly persons made use of the opportunity to get their hearing screened. The two-day camp began on Saturday and concludes on Sunday.

Also, about 70 security and other personnel of the institute got an orientation on hearing healthcare.

Hearing loss is commonly seen in elderly individuals. People with hearing loss find it hard to hear and understand speech at normal conversational levels. It is important to note that individuals who have diabetes and hypertension are more prone to develop hearing loss compared to healthy persons, AIISH said.

Additionally, studies have shown that individuals with hearing loss have seven times greater risk of developing dementia (medical condition showing memory loss). About one in three people between the ages of 55 and 74 years are known to have hearing loss, and nearly half of those older than 75 years have reduced hearing which can impact their speaking and socialising abilities, a press release said here on Saturday.

The hearing loss is likely to worsen with age and the benefits with hearing aids would be poorer if attended to it later. Therefore, like in all medical conditions, the saying ‘earlier the better’ is true for hearing loss too and one should consult an authorised audiologist for hearing testing without any delay, the release stated.

In this connection, the All India Institute of Speech and Hearing, Mysuru, a premier institute in the country for communication disorders, conducted the free screening camp hearing loss. On Sunday, the camp will be held from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m.

World Hearing Day is observed on March 3 to spread awareness on the prevention of hearing loss and deafness. The AIISH has planned a series of activities until March 3 spreading public awareness on the issue.

The director and the staff of the institute have urged the public to make use of the opportunity and get their hearing checked for free. Individuals above 50 years of age can utilise the service on Sunday and breakfast will be served to the participants.

90,2020/02/22,Global rice milling centre to come up in Mysuru,"It will address shortage of trained manpower in the industry

The Global Centre for Rice Technology (GCRT), the first of its kind in the country, is coming up in Mysuru to facilitate the rice milling industry to keep pace with technological advancements in the field.

The GCRT will be a collaborative venture between the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), Mysuru, Buhler India Pvt. Ltd., Bengaluru, and Apit, Bengaluru.

While Buhler India, which helped set up the International School of Milling Technology at CFTRI, will provide machinery for the GCRT, the CFTRI will provide the knowledge input. Apit will provide the other infrastructure and help run the centre.

At a function organised to lay foundation stone for the GCRT at M.G. Halli on Kalidasa Road in the city, CFTRI director K.S.M.S. Raghavarao regretted the absence of technology training for rice milling industry and said there was a huge scope for value addition in the sector.

Rice mill operators have little knowledge about under milling and complete milling. He also regretted the absence of protocols and standard operating procedures for different varieties of rice. Hence, GCRT, which is a ₹25 crore project, will seek to address the shortage of trained manpower at different levels in the rice milling industry.

The GCRT seeks to establish the missing, but vital link between the rice milling sector and academia and bring about the much-needed synergy between them.

Pointing out that the countries surrounding peninsular India were major rice producing and rice consuming countries, the CFTRI director, in a statement, said rice milling industry has come a long way and the previous decade has witnessed large scale investments in the sector.

Trained manpower would not only ensure proper operation and maintenance, but also increase the yield of valuable head rice and proper utilisation of byproducts. In addition, safety of workers and making the products safe for consumption will also be addressed, he said.

GCRT’s goal includes setting up a world class institute to provide customised training for different category of personnel and for durations, focussing on entire gamut of rice milling including byproduct utilisation, setting up a rice analytical laboratory for the benefit of the industry, and linking up pre-harvest and post-harvest technological institutes to provide a complete and comprehensive solution to the rice industry.

92,2020/02/22,‘Parents should encourage children to participate in sports’,"Union Minister Pralhad Joshi inaugurates Karnataka Kusti Habba

The Karnataka Kusti Habba, the four-day State-level indigenous wrestling competition, began on a colourful note at Karnatak College Dharwad (KCD) grounds, here on Saturday.

The venue wore a festive look as it teemed with wrestlers, sports connoisseurs, and the public.

Over 1,270 wrestlers, including 200 women native wrestlers, will demonstrate their skills in different age categories for the next four days.

Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi inaugurated the event as Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who was supposed to declare the event open, gave the event a miss.

In his inaugural address, Mr. Joshi said that arrangements would be made to accommodate wrestling at the sports complex proposed to be built at Tarihal village near here at a cost of ₹150 crore.

He said a plan to develop sports facilities in taluks using CSR funds will be formalised.

Mr. Joshi said wrestling in India was an ancient sport, going all the way back to the Mahabharata period.

“However, it is not a good development that our track record in sports remained abysmally low. Apart from academics, parents should encourage the children to participate in sports activities, especially indigenous spots like kusti, which ensures physical and mental health,” he said.

Minister in charge of the district Jagadish Shettar such events should help bring sports talents to the fore. The government too will give special focus for promoting indigenous sports, he said.

“The BJP has always been against reservation, and it is trying to influence the judiciary to announced verdicts that support its narrative,” he said.

Saying that anti-Dalit verdicts are being passed because there are not enough Dalits in the judiciary, Mr. Algur demanded reservation in judiciary for the same.

“We have today reached a state where we should start demanding reservation in the judiciary also. If Dalits are in judiciary, then we can expect verdicts in favor of the community,” he said.

To a question, he said that in the coming days, they will launch a campaign demanding reservation in judiciary.

Mr. Algur said that Dalits are getting reservation not based on the socio-economic conditions but based on untouchability.

“Reservation will continue in the country so long untouchability and inequality prevails,” he said.

Later, he said that a mega ‘Samvidhan Bachao’ programme will be held in Vijayapura city on February 24.

He said that over 2 lakh people are expected to participate in the event which will be attended by leaders such as Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader, Sitaram Yechury, activist Swami Agnivesh, former Union Ministers Yeshwant Sinha, Shatrughan Sinha, former Chief Ministers, Siddaramaiah, H.D. Kumaraswamy, and others.

The event will start from 4 p.m. in an open area on Kolhar Road near Jumanal village.

96,2020/02/22,Father of Karnataka student facing sedition charge lives in fear in his village,"He opposes Amulya’s statements; files plaint against those who attacked house

The father of student-activist Amulya Leona, who has been booked under sedition charge for raising pro-Pakistan slogans at an anti-CAA event in Bengaluru, is living under intense pressure back in their isolated village near Koppa town in Chikkamagaluru district.

While a group of people allegedly threw stones on their house on Thursday night and also grilled Amulya’s father, Wazi Noronha, and forced him to raise “Bharat mata ki jai” slogans, a series of protests were held across the district against her on Friday. Members of BJP, Vishva Hindu Parishad, Bajrang Dal, Sri Rama Sene, and a few other groups staged protests in Koppa, Chikkamagaluru, and Jayapura demanding strict action.

Mr. Noronha told The Hindu that the group arrived around 8 p.m. near his house at Gubbagudde village. The windowpanes and doors of his house were damaged and he was worried about his safety. He was alone when the incident happened since his wife had left for Bengaluru by then. Three policemen were deployed at his place throughout the night. He alleged that it was an act by BJP supporters. “I have filed the complaint with the police with the names of a few in the group,” he said.

Mr. Noronha owns an areca plantation and a poultry farm. He has been actively involved in environment-related and political activities for several years. He has been a follower of H.G. Govinde Gowda, a Gandhian and former Education Minister. “Later, I joined the BJP and worked for D.N. Jeevaraj and Shobha Karandlaje during their elections. In the 2018 Assembly elections, when Govinde Gowda’s son Venkatesh contested from Sringeri Assembly constituency on the JD(S) ticket, I supported him,” he said.

Mr. Wazi is firm that he is opposed to the statements Amulya made. He said she might have made them without understanding the implications. “We have been telling her not to take part in any protests, but concentrate on studies. But she refused to listen to us. Now she has made a statement that nobody can accept. Let the law takes its course,” he said.

He believes that there should be a probe to find out who prompted her to make such a statement. Mr. Wazi said she had “done a blunder, but deserves a chance to correct herself.”

Amulya is studying B.A. in English Literature, Journalism and Psychology at NMKRV College in Bengaluru.

Superintendent of Police Harish Pandey told The Hindu that five miscreants threw stones at Mr. Wazi’s house. “He was in his estate house at that time.

Several party old-timers are peeved over missing out on ministerial opportunity in the B.S. Yediyurappa-led government. They recently met at the residence of Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar.

A former Minister, who is associated with the group of disgruntled legislators, said they may make the Delhi trip before the presentation of the State Budget on March 5. They want to formally bring their issue to the notice of the party central leadership. They have earlier met a few central leaders informally, he said.

This would mean that Mr. Yediyurappa, who is set to celebrate his 77th birthday on a grand scale by holding a public function in Bengaluru on February 27, would also have to get ready to deal with dissidence activities soon after. The disgruntled legislators have demanded a leadership change, but none has formally come out in the open so far to make such a demand.

Vijayendra factor

They are particularly upset over the reported efforts to elevate Chief Minister’s son B.Y. Vijayendra as the party’s State general secretary. They see this move as a first step towards projecting Mr. Vijayendra as successor to Mr. Yediyurappa. They feel that political elevation of Mr. Vijayendra would affect their political prospects.

A sizeable number of such disgruntled legislators are from the dominant Lingayat community, from which Mr. Yediyurappa hails.

There are reports that some of these disgruntled legislators having met party national organising general secretary B.L. Santhosh in Bengaluru on Monday night and narrated their woes. They are also learnt to have decided to ensure that their activities do not affect the government during the month-long Budget session beginning on March 2.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ejk0yr/article30886763.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGSANTHOSH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/disgruntled-bjp-leaders-considering-visiting-delhi/article30884897.ece
98,2020/02/22,24-year-old protester arrested in Bengaluru,"Was allegedly holding a placard with an ‘objectionable’ message

The S.J. Park police arrested a 24-year-old person for allegedly holding a placard which read “Muslim, Dalit, Kashmiri, Bahujan, Adivasi, Trans Liberation Now” in English and Kannada on Friday afternoon at Town Hall here.

The protester, identified as Ardra Narayanan, was confronted by organisations that were agitating for strict action to be taken against Amulya Leona, a 19-year-old student who had shouted “Pakistan zindabad” at a CAA protest rally on Thursday and has been slapped with sedition charges.

Chethan Singh Rathore, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central), said that Ardra Narayanan was a resident of Malleswaram and a freelance graphic designer. According to the police, Ardra Narayanan came to Town Hall to stage a protest against “injustice in the nation”. The person saw the agitation and decided to keep some distance from those there. According to the police, the protesters surrounded the person and accused Ardra Narayanan of shouting pro-Pakistan slogans. As the situation became tense, the S.J. Park police whisked Ardra Narayanan away, and later took up a suo motu case against the protester. Mr. Rathore clarified that pro-Pakistan slogans were not raised by the accused.

The protester has been booked under the provision of Section 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc.) and 153B (Imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) of the IPC. “The person was produced before a magistrate and was remanded in 14 days judicial custody,” the police said.

Mohan Gowda, spokesperson for Hindu Jagarana Vedike, which was part of the protest, however, said that Ardra Narayanan silently joined them around 12.15 p.m.

“There were around 200 persons from Hindu Jagaran Vedike, Hindu Mahasabha, and other organisations to protest against Ms. Amulya’s pro-Pakistan slogan. We were about to end our protest and had started folding our banners. A few people noticed a person holding placards behind us. They questioned the person,” Mr. Gowda said.

He later filed a complaint with the police.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/q04f4u/article30884837.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BGGIRLARREST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/24-year-old-protester-arrested-in-bengaluru/article30884838.ece
99,2020/02/22,Mahadayi: Still a long way to go,"‘Project needs approvals, clarifications at many levels’

The Supreme Court’s direction to the Union government to notify in the gazette the Mahadayi River Water Disputes Tribunal order about allocation of water between Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Goa has led to celebrations in some parts of the State.

Officers acquainted with irrigation issues, however, have cautioned that celebrations may be premature as work on the project can not start immediately. It needs approvals and clarifications at many levels. This is apart from a clear go-ahead by the Supreme Court that is hearing objections by the riparian States, said officers.

‘Only a formality’

“Gazette notification is only a formality and should not be seen either as a signal by the court to go ahead with the project or as a measure that will speed it up,” The real debate will start from July 15, when the apex court will hear objections to the project by Goa. “Once that is settled, we can start seeking approvals by various Ministries,” he said.

“We have to understand that Mahadayi dispute is different from other river water sharing disputes where the quantum of water is in question. In Mahadayi, we have to address different challenges. Goa is questioning the whole project, saying that it would be disastrous for the environment, and Maharashtra is linking the validity of the project to the border issue and wants a better share of the water. We need to address these issues at different platforms at different times, in the court and outside,” said a senior officer.

Karnataka also needs to get permissions from the Central Forest Ministry and the Central Water Commission, though the State has got an exemption from the Union Environment Ministry because it is a drinking water project. “But this has been questioned by NGOs in Goa who want the exemption reviewed citing environmental issues,” the officer said.

They are upset about issues such as construction of a reservoir in the Western Ghats, which could lead to erosion of a large extent of forest land, reduce inflow into the Mahadayi/Mandovi and decrease the quantum of sweet water entering the Arabian Sea. This, they say, would damage the environment and affect the marine life in the river and the sea as well. All these issues have to be tackled,” the officer said.

The State also faces the challenge of finding the resources to take up work at four places. “We have nearly completed canal work in Kalasa nala, but work on the Banduri nala is yet to start. Work on the reservoir that will impound the water to be released into the Malaprabha and generate hydroelectricity is yet to begin. The detailed project reports cleared by the State Cabinet are at least 12 years old. They will need to be reworked,” said another officer.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mahadayi-still-a-long-way-to-go/article30884754.ece
100,2020/02/22,Karnataka budget on a tight leash,"CM advised against announcing grand projects

With just about a fortnight to go for the State Budget, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is learnt to be under pressure not to announce any big-ticket schemes owing to the precarious situation of the State treasury.

Finance Department officials have advised the Chief Minister not to announce schemes that will burden the State finances, a senior Minister aware of the developments said. This advice has come multiple times from multiple revenue-generating departments within the Finance Department. “There is also an advice to reduce the Budget compared with that of the previous year’s, which, however, may not happen. We had a Budget size of about ₹2.34 lakh crore for this financial year, and the government may be able to increase it only marginally,” the Minister said.

Central fund shortfall

The Chief Minister acknowledged in Mysuru on Friday that the State was staring at a shortfall from the Central funding. “We are estimating a shortfall of ₹10,000 to ₹11,000 crore from the Central funds. I am also expecting that we will achieve our revenue targets. Everything will be known in the Budget,” he told reporters.

After taking a vote on account from the legislature soon after assuming power, Mr. Yediyurappa had little elbow room to present his own budget and was forced to settle for a modified budget that was based on the one presented by his predecessor H.D. Kumaraswamy.

While the funds from the Centre through the share of State in GST or devolution has affected the budget planning, sources in the government said that the State’s decision to deviate from the NDRF norms to provide relief to the flood victims affected the finances. The State has received about ₹2,800 crore on a demand of ₹30,000 crore for flood relief, and expecting the Centre’s help, relief work, including that of compensation for house damage, had been taken up, sources said.

Loan waiver

“Another big effect was owing to the loan waiver scheme implemented by the previous Janata Dal (Secular)–Congress regime,” sources said, and added that the revenue-earning departments such as Stamps and Registration, Excise, and Transport may not achieve the target completely, giving further trouble in planning the Budget.

On Thursday, Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah pointed out that State had received ₹8,851 crore as GST compensation as against the expected ₹17,249 crore, and the Centre’s devolution of funds to State was expected to come down from ₹39,591 crore in 2019–20 to ₹28,598 crore in 2020–21.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/wzu0az/article30886806.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15KRAYEDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-budget-on-a-tight-leash/article30884729.ece

102,2020/02/22,"Mahadayi water dispute: Goa will file application in apex court, says Sawant","Goa Chief Minister says Thursday’s order not a ‘defeat’

Goa will file an application in the Supreme Court on the Mahadayi river water dispute pleading that Karnataka not be allowed to go ahead with construction on the Kalasa-Banduri project, Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said on Friday.

The apex court on Thursday allowed Karnataka’s plea for implementation of the final award by a water dispute tribunal for sharing the river’s water. “We are filing application for stay order before the Supreme Court in next three or four days pleading that Karnataka should be asked to not conduct any activity at proposed dam site,” the Chief Minister told reporters here.

Mr. Sawant claimed that, going by the past, Karnataka had a habit of starting work despite the case being heard in the apex court.

“I have also made a statement on the floor of the House that Karnataka has already diverted the water (Kalasa-Banduri dam),” he said, and accused Opposition parties of politicising the issue.

He said Thursday’s order was not a “defeat” for Goa, adding that the next hearing in the apex court was in July.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mahadayi-water-dispute-goa-will-file-application-in-apex-court-says-sawant/article30884638.ece

104,2020/02/22,Activists claim Konkan Railway has done little for Karnataka,"It is mostly used as a thoroughfare for connectivity to other States, they allege

Twenty-two years after Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd., (KRCL), a joint venture of Railways, and the Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka and Kerala governments operated the first train on its network, the people of coastal Karnataka are wondering whether the corporation has served the interests of the State.

The corporation has not provided stabling or maintenance lines at any of its stations along 270 km odd network in Karnataka thereby denying starting of any train from the coast other than Southern Railway’s Mangaluru. Worse, KRCL has no plans to construct maintenance lines in Karnataka, the corporation had stated in a reply to an RTI query recently.

Not exclusively for others

Karwar-based Rajeev Gaonkar, vice-president, West Coast Rail Yatri Abhivrddhi Sangha, who is also a member of Konkan Railway Users’ Consultative Committee, said people in Karnataka did not part with lands just for exclusive operation of trains to other States.

Of the nearly 40 trains operating on KR network through Karnataka, only seven cater to the State while the rest connect the north of the country with Kerala, he noted. “It is unfortunate that we have to fight for every facility as KR has always been in denial mode.”

Why not in Karnataka

During the recent KRUCC meeting, Mr. Gaonkar raised several issues, including non-availability of maintenance lines in Karnataka. Besides being unable to operate special trains for lack of infrastructure, KRCL is not accommodating any new train, he said. When it has built maintenance facilities in Goa and Maharashtra, similar facilities were expected in Karnataka too.

He demanded that KRCL build maintenance facilities at Karwar and Ankola or Bhatkal not only to facilitate starting of new trains, but also to extend some trains terminating at Mangaluru.

Special trains

Ruing KRCL apathy towards Karnataka, rail activist Gautam Shetty, from Bengaluru, said that since the corporation refused to stable the Bengaluru-Karwar Deepavali special trains for a couple of days at Karwar — operated by the South Western Railway last year — SWR had to run the empty rake back to Bengaluru incurring huge losses. The people of the State would not have suffered if KRCL had maintenance and stabling facilities along its network in Karnataka, he said. The Railways has a 52% stake in KRCL, while Maharashtra holds 21%, Goa and Kerala 6% each, and Karnataka holds 15% stake.

Not a single train from KR

Rajeev Gaonkar, member, KRUCC, said KRCL has not introduced even a single train to and from Karnataka in the last 22 years.

While the Mangaluru-Madgaon-Mangaluru Passenger was the result of regularising track-testing train during the construction period, the Mumbai LTT-Mangaluru-Mumbai LTT Matsyagandha Express was the one flagged off by then Railway Minister Nitish Kumar during the inauguration of the line. The Mumbai CSMT-Mangaluru Junction-Mumbai CSMT was the one that got extended after much fight from Karwar, he said.

KRCL did not introduce trains connecting coastal Karnataka with other parts of the country and the State, Mr. Gaonkar noted. The Bengaluru-Karwar overnight express was the result of legal battle fought by West Coast Rail Yatri Abhivriddhi Sangha, of which he is the VP, he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/qh9n0c/article30884604.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21MNRAILWAYBRIDGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/activists-claim-konkan-railway-has-done-little-for-karnataka/article30884606.ece
105,2020/02/22,Mass marriage in Belagavi sends out message of harmony,"Ninety-nine Hindu, Muslim couples tie the knot at the ceremony

In a mega event that stood apart in times of religious polarisation, Madrasa-E-Arabia Anwar Ul Uloom in the small town of Bailhongal in Belagavi district saw both Hindu and Muslim couples tying the knot in one ceremony.

Of the 99 couples who got married, 10 were Hindu, following their respective religious rituals. The madrasa held the event on the 10-acre ground at Bailawad Cross outside the town.

Each couple got gifts worth about ₹70,000. The gifts included a refrigerator, a cot and bed, a sewing machine, and many other household items and clothes. Each pair had been asked to invite up to 100 people. A crowd of 25,000 that gathered to bless the newly-weds had lunch at the ground.

Shaikh Ul Hadis Mohammad Hanif Loharvi of Ahmedabad, who inaugurated the event, thanked the Bailhongal madrasa for organising the event. “This is a commendable act that should be replicated across the country. For centuries we have lived as brothers. We will continue to do so in future,” he said.

He congratulated members of the Issa Foundation, Jamia Faizanul Quran Ahmedabad, and Islamia Social Welfare and Educational Society of Bailhongal for organising the event and sponsoring the gifts. He urged the youth not to fall prey to vested interests who were dividing people of various religions for vote-bank politics.

Neelakanth Swami asked leaders not to make sensational speeches, but to focus on welfare of the poor. “All of us are born into different religions and follow them sincerely. But we should be tolerant of people of other faiths who live among us and live as neighbours peacefully,” he said. Shabbir Ahmed Kazi, vice-president of the education society, said the NGOs planned to conduct multi-faith mass marriages regularly.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ejfioh/article30884583.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BGMARRIAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mass-marriage-in-belagavi-sends-out-message-of-harmony/article30884584.ece
106,2020/02/22,Journalists’ entry to Legislators’ Home banned,"‘Invasion of privacy’ of legislators cited as the reason

The Legislative Assembly Secretariat has banned the entry of print and electronic media journalists and cameramen to the Legislators’ Home (LH) near the Vidhana Soudha, citing “invasion of privacy” of legislators as the reason.

A few months ago, the Legislative Assembly Secretariat banned the TV cameras in the House for coverage of proceedings, arguing that it was only following the model adopted by Parliament.

According to the notice by the Assembly Secretariat, MLAs who come to Bengaluru for various works spend time in the LH after their work hours. If mediapersons visit the MLAs at the LH, it would amount to invasion of their privacy. If MLAs seek to give an interview to journalists, the Speaker has ordered that an arrangement can be made only outside the gates of the LH.

During the early days of the Congress–JD(S) coalition government, in July 2018, then Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy had imposed restrictions on the entry of journalists to the Vidhana Soudha, which were lifted later after widespread criticism from media outlets and then Opposition BJP.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ls32zf/article30884527.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BGLEGISLATORSHOME,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/journalists-entry-to-legislators-home-banned/article30884528.ece
107,2020/02/22,Mahout killed by elephant,"Animal panicked when motorcyclist repeatedly blared horn

A 45-year-old mahout was killed by an elephant at Haripad on Friday night.

The deceased was identified as Kalesh of Poothakkulam in Kollam. Another mahout escaped without injuries after being trapped atop the elephant for more than four hours.

The incident occurred near Sree Subrahmanya Swamy temple around 10.15 p.m. Sources said the elephant had been returning from a temple in Pallipad when it turned restive.

“The elephant panicked after a motorcyclist repeatedly blared the horn. The animal then struck the mahout with its trunk,” said a source.

Although the injured person was taken to the hospital, his life could not be saved. In the meantime, the elephant with the second mahout on the top ran amok and destroyed an electricity pole and partially damaged a house in the area.

It was brought under control by 2.15 p.m. after the elephant squad reached the spot and tranquilised the pachyderm.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mahout-killed-by-elephant/article30891562.ece
108,2020/02/22,Wayanad alert to threat,"Fire lines, awareness drives part of preventive steps

The Forest and Wildlife Department has intensified measures in the three forest divisions in Wayanad, including the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary and the South and North Wayanad forest divisions, to tackle forest fire.

This includes construction of fire lines, engaging fire watchers, and campaigns to sensitise the public, especially those in villages on the forest fringes, expending ₹2.19 crore.

Fire alert system

Phone numbers of all forest staff in the district have been registered with the fire alert system of the Forest Survey of India.

Close to 400 temporary watchers have been appointed in the three forest divisions apart from permanent front-line forest staff to keep fires at bay.

“We have erected nearly 80 km of fire lines on the interstate boundary under the WWS and control burning was initiated in 40 ha,” warden C.K. Assif said.

Apart from the 25 permanent anti-poaching camps and five watchtowers at strategic points inside the sanctuary, 15 temporary watchtowers have started functioning this year, Mr. Assif said.

Rain to the rescue

He said there was no scarcity of water in most parts of the sanctuary till now, thanks to a good northeast monsoon. A wildlife ambulance with a 5,000-litre water tank and a camper jeep with a 1,000-litre water tank were ready to meet any emergency.

Mr. Assif said control rooms had been set up at the three forest range offices and wireless apparatus distributed to front-line staff to strengthen communication.

“We erected fire lines in 81 km this year and controlled burning was initiated in close to 60 ha on the fringes of grasslands, especially on the Chembra and Elembileri peaks,” South Wayanad forest divisional officer B. Ranjith Kumar said.

Staff insured

“We have insured all front-line forest staff in the division,” Mr.Ranjith said adding that 20 temporary watchtowers had been erected at various parts of the division apart from four permanent watchtowers. As many as 22 awareness camps and four rallies were also conducted to sensitise the public, he said.

North Wayanad forest divisional officer Ramesh Bishnoi said fire lines in 105 km apart from control burning in 30 ha had been undertaken in the division.

He said 37 fire gangs were ready with 10 vehicles to meet any emergency and monitoring cells were functioning at the range office level.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/f3manr/article30891523.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23tvwy-treetopmachan1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wayanad-alert-to-threat/article30891519.ece
109,2020/02/22,Most fires man-made,"3 foresters die in fire on Feb. 16

February 18, Chittanda. Somebody has carelessly set fire to a huge heap of dry leaves on the fringes of the forest, with dry bushes. Those who lit the fire have left it uncared. It was two days back that a forest fire claimed three lives, at Kottambathur, 10 km from Thrissur.

Forest officials say most of the forest fires in the State are man-made.

The three foresters, who went to douse the fire in an acacia forest, taken on lease by Hindustan Newsprint Ltd, at Kottambathur, under Poongode Forest Station, were killed on February 16. The dead were tribal watcher Divakaran, 43, of Vazhachal; temporary watcher Velayudhan, 54, of Kodumbu, and Sankaran, 55, of Chathanchira Colony, Kodumbu. Thick dry bushes at a man’s height were spread across the 475-hectare forest. The HNL had stopped operations in the forest area around four years ago.

“The HNL has not taken any safety measures, including setting up of fire control line, in the last few years in the forest, which is close to human inhabited area, despite two letters sent to them by the Thrissur DFO. Fire load was very high in the area,” said N. Rajesh, DFO, Peechi.

Fire in the forest area at Kottambathur has been frequent, since the HNL stopped its operation, says Asharaf Ali, who stays near the forest. But this is the first time, it claimed lives, he said.

“Firefighting should be seen as the last resort only when all preventives measures have failed, said Mr. Rajesh.

Fire plan in August

“The department makes a fire plan on divisional basis by August every year. Temporary workers will be recruited if needed and special training will be given. Fire-control lines will be set up. Controlled pre-burning in selected areas will be completed by December.” But the Kottambathur forest was left out from the pre-burning drive as it was under the control of the HNL, he added.

But the Kerala Forest Protective Staff Association alleges insufficient safety equipment for the foresters, who are deployed for quelling fires.

“Priority should be given for procuring safety equipment for the foresters. Insurance coverage should be given for temporary workers too,” said M.S. Binu Kumar, State president of the Association.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/jlhzsa/article30891495.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23tv-Forest-fire-002-rev,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/most-fires-man-made/article30891492.ece
110,2020/02/22,Code of conduct for Malankara Orthodox Church clergy,"Action plan to ensure financial discipline in Church

The episcopal synod of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, which drew to a close here on Friday, approved a code of conduct for its clergy and others.

The synod, presided over by Catholicos of the East and Malankara Metropolitan Baselius Mar Thoma Paulose II, decided to implement an action plan to ensure financial discipline within the Church.

The plan, Lalitham, Sundaram, to be implemented through the human resource wing of the Church, is being initiated in view of a financial crunch.

The synod also approved a salary package for the clergy and key service men for the next five years. Discussions were held to obtain PAN cards for various parishes, establishments and movements under the Church.

Activities reviewed

Activities of the two theological seminaries of the Church and the cancer centre at Parumala were reviewed.

Grants to the amendments brought in the bylaws of the St. George dayara at Othera, Malankara Sabha magazine and the Mumbai Gregorian Community approved. The environmental wing of the Church had been entrusted with formulating projects on sustainable development and ecological spirituality. Plans were also afoot to carry out various nature and energy conservation programmes at the parish level.

111,2020/02/22,Tinder-dry Forests in Kerala,"With the onset of summer, forest managers are under pressure to tackle raging forest fires.

When S.V. Vinod, Divisional Forest Officer, Vazhachal, and his men reached Pallikara at the foothills of the Kottambathur hills, night has fallen over the area.

Heavy smoke billowing from burnt wild grass hung heavily over the area. The death of three of their colleagues in a wildfire in the area a few hours ago had a chilling effect on the team of forest officials.

The morale was down. There was no time to mourn the death of their colleagues as the threat of the fire destroying the remaining areas remained live.

Foresters and guards sprung into action to create a 20-metre-wide fire belt, a band of land free of combustible materials, over a kilometre, to secure the remaining area. It took almost four hours for the team to complete the fire belt.

In difficult terrains

Foresters across the State are battling forest fires in difficult and inaccessible terrains similar to the Kottambathur hills. While it was the overgrown and dry wild grass at an acacia plantation leased out to a public sector company that caught fire last week, killing three forest guards, forest fires are blazing in different terrains in many parts of the State.

Till last week, as many as 113 fire incidents were reported across the State in 234.576 ha. The summer months from February to May are considered the most sensitive period in terms of fire risks in Kerala.

While there is a school of thought that forest fire is a part of the forest ecosystem processes, uncontrolled fires may destroy forest wealth, including wildlife, and put the lives of forest dwellers at peril.

In the past decade, 2010-2011 was the deadliest as 5,640 ha of forest was destroyed in 1,017 fire incidents. In 2018-19, it was 1,789 ha in 583 incidents.

“Fires in grasslands are the difficult ones to tackle as dry leaves easily catch fire. Often, wild grass grows in gaps in rocky structures which are generally inaccessible. We have to tread cautiously through steep and narrow terrains for hours to reach the fire spots. Carrying heavy fire-fighting equipment is not an ideal option in such situations. Locally developed fire beaters, a long cane with thin sheets of fire-resistant materials at one end, are the only handy equipment one can carry in such situations,” said Mr. Vinod.

Blowers are used at times to clear the land of dry leaves and other combustible materials to contain the fire. Then, there are fire responders, vehicles with water storage facility and a long hose. Though it cannot reach the fire spots, it is useful in spraying water over dry areas to prevent fire from advancing, he said.

Firefighting a risky affair

K.S. Jyothi, a forest official, said controlling forest fires was a risky affair as winds could divert the fire. Heavy winds could force the fire towards the firefighters and it would not be easy to run away from an advancing fire, he said.

“I had a close encounter with death in 2002 at Sthalamanam, under Konni forests, while trying to control a fire. Me and Sasankan, a forest guard, had to run for dear life and slide through a steep rocky terrain as the fire quickly engulfed the area where we were standing,” recounted Mr. Jyothi.

Better safety gear sought

Mr. Vinod said better protective dress for firefighters, as provided to Fire and Rescue Services personnel, was the need of the hour. More fire responders shall be deployed in fire-prone areas. The Fire and Rescue Services had bought around 4,000 fire-suits for its men, which will help them to work safely even when exposed to high temperatures.

The lightweight clothing protects the firefighters by preventing the transmission of heat to their body. Though expensive it has been found effective to a considerable extent, said a senior official of the Fire and Rescue Services Department.

President of the Wayanad Prakrithi Samrakshana Samiti N. Badusha criticised the Forest Department for what he termed its callous and irresponsible approach towards controlling forest fires.

“There have been no attempts to provide training for front-line staff in fighting fire. They need to be provided protective vests and oxygen cylinders. It is high time the department adopted modern fire-fighting devices and technology,” Mr. Badusha, one of the leading activists of the fire-free forest movement, a campaign to prevent forest fire, said.

Preventive steps sought

The department was yet to take a serious note of the fire incidents and adopt preventive measures. There should be an expert committee to estimate the loss caused by fires. The department should also declare forest fire as a disaster and involve the district disaster management authorities in combating fires, he demanded.

P.K. Kesavan, Head of Forest Force, Kerala, said the current year appeared to be better off when compared to recent years. This year, there had not been many major fire outbreaks. The accident that culminated in the loss of lives of three persons was a one-off incident.

The focus of the current season was on participatory fire management involving local eco-protection committees and such agencies.

The department was planning to undertake a comprehensive review of the situation to seek alternative measures for prevention of such situations, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/i4h9vt/article30891441.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23tv-Forest-fire-info1REVweb,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tinder-dry-forests-in-kerala/article30891432.ece
112,2020/02/22,Enhance farm productivity: SRP,"‘This is integral to addressing the crisis in agriculture sector’

Ensuring fair price and loan waivers are not enough, but enhancing productivity is integral while addressing the crisis in agriculture sector, CPI(M) Polit Bureau member S. Ramachandran Pillai has said.

He was inaugurating the delegates’ meet in connection with the 26th State conference of Kerala Karshaka Sangham at the Town Hall here on Saturday. Pointing out that crop productivity was below the national average in Kerala except for rubber, he said that agriculture was fast becoming a household hobby in the State.

“According to the economic survey, agriculture is the primary source of income for only 27% of the total population in Kerala, whereas it is above 60% in other States,"" he said.

Land as commodity

Mr. Pillai said the sector required more investments, manpower and latest technologies to make it profitable.

“From a means of livelihood, land has become a commodity in Kerala and the wide stretches of fallow land is proof of it. Apart from stray entrepreneurs, nobody is employing innovating farming methods and many farmers have no idea about the kind of latest equipment that can make their occupation hassle-free. We have been compensating for the shortage in manpower using guest labourers, but the possibilities of mechanisation are yet to be explored,” he said.

He said the way in which global warming is affecting the crops in ghat sectors and coastal belts should be studied. “In Kerala, the biggest issue lies in the volume of farmland. Here we have small patches of land, and size along with irrigation issues have been affecting the growth of the sector. During the last couple of years, we have seen back-to-back floods, cyclones, landslips and drought-like situation and we should learn to tackle all these adverse elements,"" he said.

Ramakrishnan spoke on the occasion.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/qoyaq1/article30891422.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23tvko-Flaghosting,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/enhance-farm-productivity-srp/article30891423.ece
113,2020/02/22,Discharge petition of bishop posted to Feb. 29,"Bishop Franco Mulakkal files petition in nun rape case

The Additional District and Sessions Court I, Kottayam, on Saturday posted the discharge petition filed by Bishop Franco Mulakkal in the nun rape case for further hearing to February 29.

As counsel appearing for the accused completed the argument, the court posted it to a later date for the prosecution to present its argument.

Contempt of court

Earlier in the day, the accused filed a petition seeking to initiate contempt of court proceedings against the prosecution agency and the media for publishing the records under the court’s consideration without permission.

The petition pertained to the reports on the allegations of sexual abuse raised by another nun against the bishop.

The prosecution is slated to file its objection on the petition on February 29.

Removal sought

Meanwhile, nuns at the St. Francis Mission Home, Kuravilangad, who have been arraigned as witnesses in the case, demanded immediate removal of the accused bishop to ensure a fair investigation into the fresh allegations of sexual abuse against him.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/discharge-petition-of-bishop-posted-to-feb-29/article30891384.ece
114,2020/02/22,Palode forest yields new amaranthus species,"Local people use the plant, found in the wild, for cooking

Mention amaranthus and the first thing that pops to mind is the leafy red veggie ideal for making ‘thoran.’ Now, a team of researchers from two government colleges in the State, the Regional Cancer Centre (RCC), Thiruvananthapuram, and the Sapienza University of Rome have reported a new edible plant species from Kerala which could be a cousin to the ubiquitous ‘chuvanna cheera.’

The team led by V. S. Anil Kumar, Government College, Kasaragod, included Arya S., University College, Thiruvananthapuram, Vishnu Walsan K. of the RCC and Duilio Iamonico of the Sapienza University of Rome. The new species Amaranthus rajasekharii was discovered on the forest fringes of Palode in Thiruvananthapuram around eight months ago. Mr. Iamonico is an internationally known expert on amaranthus.

Amaranthus rajasekharii, incidentally, is named after Ms. Arya’s father N. Rajasekhar, a traditional medicine practitioner who has an avid interest in local plants and their uses.

Dry wastelands

The researchers found patches of the plant in Palode, which lies in the foothills of the Western Ghats in Thiruvananthapuram district. “The local people use it to make ‘thoran.’ But it is found in the wild and not put under cultivation,” Ms. Arya, who is a PhD scholar at the Department of Botany, University College, said.

The species occurs in dry wastelands and the forest fringes of the Palode-Kulathupuzha-Thenkasi range. The team has come across patches of it in a number of other places in the State as well.

Their finding has made it to the latest volume of Phytotaxa, an international journal on plant taxonomy. The flora of Kerala includes 15 amaranthus species, mostly ‘aliens.’ A comparison prompted the team to conclude that Amaranthus rajasekharii cannot be ascribed to any known species.

Endemic to Kerala

Morphologically similar to Amaranthus dubius, it stands 100-130 cm tall with a reddish to purple stem and yellowish-green flowers. As regards the origin of this plant, the researchers feel that it could be endemic to Kerala.

Generally, amaranthus offers researchers a stiff challenge as it is extremely difficult to differentiate between species. “It is indeed known as a difficult taxa,” Ms. Arya said. Last year, the team had reported another new species which was christened Amaranthus saradhiana.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gnlh96/article30891615.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Habit-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/palode-forest-yields-new-amaranthus-species/article30891375.ece

116,2020/02/22,Women directors’ film shoot from next month,"₹3-cr. Budget allocation comes as boost

With the Supreme Court rejecting a plea against the selection of scripts and directors, work on two films to be directed by women using ₹3 crore allocated in the State Budget 2019-20 is likely to begin in March.

The apex court verdict against the selection by a government-appointed jury came on February 14. The court refused to intervene in the matter, paving the way for work on the two films to start, N. Maya, managing director, Kerala State Film Development Corporation, told a press conference on Thursday.

Time lost

Director and Kerala State Film Development Corporation chairman Shaji N. Karun says that filming is expected to begin in March and will be completed in about three to four months. Precious time has been lost due to the court case.

The reputation of the State and the film development corporation has been affected too, he says.

The film directors and scripts were chosen about seven months ago. The films should have been ready and going to the censors by now, he says. Ms. Maya said the KSFDC had plans to send these films to festivals and competitions this year.

Denies allegations

Kukkoo Parameswaran, actor and member of the panel which selected the directors and scripts, denies the allegations that the jury had not selected the best scripts and directors. In fact, the panel did its work considering the great step taken by the government to encourage women in cinema.

Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac allocated in the 2019-20 Budget ₹3 crore to encourage women film directors as part of an effort to boost their role in the Malayalam film industry.

Inspiration for the allocation came from the formation of the Women in Cinema Collective, an organisation of women film personnel, formed in response to allegations of sexual harassment in the film industry.

However, once the film scripts and directors were chosen by a panel headed by Raghunath Palery, a group approached the Kerala High Court and then the Supreme Court against the selections.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/women-directors-film-shoot-from-next-month/article30891362.ece

118,2020/02/22,Plant protection codes for large and small cardamom,"They define how the farmer interacts with the crop

Plant protection codes for large and small cardamom, farmers’ companion and guide to sustainable and optimum production with an eye on occupational health, proper storage and disposal of chemicals deployed in agriculture and their judicious use, were released here by Union Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Som Prakash on Saturday.

This is the first plant protection code being released under the aegis of the Union Commerce Ministry after the manual for tea. The guides underscore a nationwide effort to take care of the environment as well as to improve farmers’ health and income in the long term.

Protection code

The plant protection codes define how the farmer interacts with the crop. The two varieties of cardamom grow in entirely different climatic conditions and the farmers have been armed with separate plant protection codes, said A. B. Ramashree, director of research, Spices Board of India.

The Minister called on spice farmers to double production and on exporters to increase trade to reach the goal of a five trillion dollar economy.

The Union government would help the farmers and exporters reach the target.

The Minister gave away the awards and trophies for excellence in exports of spices to honour outstanding spice and spice products exporters.

Hibi Eden, MP, presided. T. J. Vinod, MLA, and senior officials of the Spices Board were among those who spoke at the occasion.

119,2020/02/22,Spirituality with a green touch for Sunday School students,"Church of South India brings out a collection of biblical stories, explained from nature’s perspective

The Department of Ecological Concerns of the Church of South India (CSI) has come out with a 102-page book, Green Stories for Sunday School Children, to inculcate in students the absolute necessity for nature conservation.

“At Sunday School, children should be trained in eco-spirituality, so that they can lead their lives from an ecological perspective,” says D. Ratnakara Sadananda, former general secretary of the CSI synod.

The book, authored by Mathew Koshy Punnackadu, director of the CSI Department of Ecological Concerns, and his wife, Anne Susan Koshy, former English professor at St. Thomas College, Kozhencherry, is a collection of biblical stories, scientifically explained from an ecological viewpoint. The many aspects covered include biodiversity, river pollution, and judicious use of natural resources.

“The aim is to inculcate a scientific outlook on nature in children and prompt them to ask questions,” says Dr. Punnackadu, the brain behind the greening programme of the Church of South India.

12-point list

The eco department of the Church reaches out to students, teachers, clergy and the laity, educating them on healthy life, sustainable agriculture, climate change mitigation, and energy conservation. All 16,000 parishes with 43 lakh members have accepted the 12-point Green Protocol for Green Discipleship (GPGD) policy document of the department aimed at developing green congregations.

Ecology as mission

According to Dr. Punnackadu, the CSI is the only Church in India that has mentioned ecology as a mission in its constitution.

The GPGD envisages adhering to the green protocol while developing church complexes and other buildings.

Minimal use of natural resources, use of solar energy at churches and associated buildings, and encouraging people to adopt energy conservation methods, are part of the GPGD, he says.

Educating the laity on various sustainable development goals, the department has brought out a few more books, Sustainable Living, Green Miracles, and Climate Emergency.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/rwizk6/article30891294.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv23ptsuns,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/spirituality-with-a-green-touch-for-sunday-school-students/article30891274.ece

Primary assumption was that it might have belonged to hunters who frequent the nearby forest or farmers who use it to guard their farms from wild animals.

Though there were reports that the bullets were Pakistan-made used in machine guns, the Kulathupuzha police said details would be known only after getting the ballistics report.

121,2020/02/22,Focus on exclusive lorry bays,"Fatigued lorry drivers need secure parking, resting places on highways

The long-pending demand for the setting up of exclusive lorry bays with basic facilities for resting and securing trucks on National Highways has come to sharp focus in the wake of the bus-truck collision that claimed 19 lives at Tiruppur on Thursday.

The relevance of fatigue management for drivers of long-distance trucks too has come to focus, especially as the accident was found to have been caused by the truck driver’s lack of alertness.

A report about the accident submitted by Palakkad Regional Transport Officer (Enforcement) P. Sivakumar on Saturday recommended that the government direct the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to set up lorry bays with proper facilities at regular intervals.

Psychologists suggest that lack of secure parking and resting places often prompt the truck drivers to challenge their fatigue by overstretching their alertness and mental agility.

“This last-leg driving, most often with the self-assurance that somehow they will make it in spite of their fatigue, has caused many an accident,” says P.M. Najeeb, former regional transport commissioner and an expert in road safety.

On toll roads

Dr. Najeeb says it is the responsibility of the NHAI to ensure parking bays for trucks with facilities for food and resting, especially on toll roads.

The number of road fatalities caused by trucks parked by the roadside is found to be increasing in the country.

According to Mr. Shivakumar lorry bays should be set up at every 50 km to help the truck drivers rest and freshen up as part of maintaining alertness.

“Had the truck driver been alert, the Tiruppur accident could have been avoided,” he said.

Except the one at Kalamassery, Kerala does not have a lorry bay with proper facilities in its National Highway road network.

While Tamil Nadu has set up one near Walayar, the highways in Kerala continue to remain without proper lorry bays.

Trucks in the State are currently found to be using abandoned roads and service roads for parking. Thefts and looting of truck drivers too have increased in the State.

Wheels stolen

Last year, the wheels of a truck chassis being brought to Kerala were stolen near Kasargod.

“Lack of a secure resting place often forces the drivers to carry forward their trucks in spite of them being tired,” says Dr. Najeeb.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/focus-on-exclusive-lorry-bays/article30891206.ece
122,2020/02/22,Rumblings of discord get louder in Congress,"Mullappally puts off PAC meet scheduled for March 8

The rumblings of discord among top Congress leaders in the State appeared to get louder on Saturday.

Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Mullappally Ramachandran has put off a meeting of the Public Affairs Committee (PAC) scheduled for March 8 after he felt that a set of leaders had used the previous meeting of the decision-making body to disparage his leadership. Mr. Ramachandran purportedly felt the leaders had undermined the agenda of the meeting by feeding ‘cherry-picked’ information about the ‘bitter dissension’ the KPCC president ‘faced’ in the PAC to the media shortly before his customary press conference.

The calculated ‘leaks’ generated television news headlines that cast the party in a bad light and diverted attention from the issues the KPCC had hoped to highlight against the Left Democratic Front government.

Mr. Ramachandran has approached the party high command for advice. By some accounts, Mr. Ramachandran felt that the newly reconstituted KPCC with 12 vice presidents and 34 general secretaries had rendered the PAC redundant.

Incommunicado

A party insider said at least three leaders in the 26-member PAC had accused Mr. Ramachandran of remaining incommunicado for extended periods without answering or returning telephone calls. They accused him, and Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala of a mutual lack of communication that had resulted in the leaders taking different positions on the same issue at least on two occasions recently. Some felt the ‘aloofness’ between leaders had sown confusion among the rank and file on whether the Congress should align itself with the LDF in its fight against the Centre on the CAA.

More recently, Mr. Ramachandran and Mr. Chennithala had expressed divergent views on the demand for an inquiry by the CBI into the corruption in the Police Department. Some felt the criticism against Mr. Ramachandran in the PAC stemmed from his insistence that MPs and MLAs voluntarily stay away from party posts. The move had upended traditional post-sharing arrangements in the KPCC, earning barbed comments against him in the PAC.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/rumblings-of-discord-get-louder-in-cong/article30890658.ece
123,2020/02/22,Huge turnout for KAS preliminary examinations,"Close to 3.8 lakh candidates appear for the exam at 1,535 centres across State

Close to 3.8 lakh candidates sat for the preliminary examinations of the newly introduced Kerala Administrative Service (KAS) held across 1,535 centres in the State on Saturday.

The answer key will be published on Monday, officials of the Kerala Public Service Commission (PSC) said.

Tough Paper 1

Paper 1, which carries 100 marks, proved tough for many candidates, largely due to the inclusion of mathematics in it.

“In the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) format, mathematics is part of Paper II. For the KAS, we have questions pertaining to Indian, world and Kerala history, geography and reasoning tests as well in Paper 1. With just 90 minutes to complete it, time management proved a challenge as you need time to work out math problems,” Lekshmi, a candidate who sat for the exams in Pathanamthitta district, said. Exams of the KAS Officer (Junior time scale) were conducted in the morning and the afternoon sessions. Paper 1 was held from 10 a.m. to 12 noon, with 90 minutes for the examination proper. The second paper was held from 1.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m., with 90 minutes earmarked for answering the questions.

Several candidates described the examinations as a curious mix of Kerala PSC and UPSC exam models. According to one candidate who sat for the exams in Thiruvananthapuram city, the KAS followed the UPSC in the exam format, in the manner in which options were laid out for the objective type questions. But their content evidently followed the PSC model, candidates said.

Questions related to economics, science and technology were part of Paper 2, which also tested language proficiency in English and a regional language (Malayalam, Kannada, Tamil).

With maths out of the way, many candidates found Paper 2 relatively easier.

Smooth conduct

“The examinations were conducted smoothly. Our attempt in preparing the KAS question paper was to maintain a balance as candidates are drawn from diverse fields,” PSC chairman K.A. Sakeer said. No incidents of malpractices were reported by any of the centres, a PSC spokesperson said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tznazf/article30891583.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23TVKAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kas-prelims-witness-huge-turnout/article30890412.ece
124,2020/02/22,Road Safety Authority to chalk out ways to curb accidents,"Meet convened in the wake of Tiruppur bus accident that claimed 19 lives

The Kerala Road Safety Authority (KRSA) will convene an emergency meeting here on Tuesday to chalk out strategies to prevent occurrences similar to the Tiruppur bus accident in the State.

Though the meeting is convened in the wake of the tragic incident that claimed 19 lives, official sources say the contributing factors that lead to such accidents would be discussed at the meeting, which would be attended by the Ministers for Transport and Public Works and senior officials of various departments and enforcement agencies.

The incident has brought heavy vehicles, particularly container lorries, under the scanner with their unregulated movement having led to several accidents in recent times. Lack of an effective mechanism to ensure that the freights are not loaded beyond prescribed limits has also been flagged.

According to Road Safety Commissioner N. Shankar Reddy, the meeting will seek to evolve steps to ensure that road safety rules are adhered to by heavy vehicle drivers. Besides, the possibility of imparting training for drivers would also be considered, he said.

The meeting will discuss the findings and recommendations of the parallel inquiries instituted by the Motor Vehicles Department and the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation into the incident.

With the truck driver was suspected to have dozed off at the wheel, the accident has also brought into focus the threats posed by driving for long periods, while being deprived of adequate rest. The meeting will study the feasibility of reintroducing an earlier provision for two drivers in container trucks and tankers.

The need to construct lorry bays and identify spaces at regular intervals for the purpose is also likely to figure at the meeting.

Having taken cognizance of media reports that have highlighted inadequacies in ensuring road safety in various parts of the State, the authority would delineate responsibilities to be taken up by the Police, Transport, Public Works and other departments and agencies such as the National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (NATPAC), an official says.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/c9xamq/article30891199.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv23acidbodys,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/krsa-to-chalk-out-ways-to-curb-accidents/article30890307.ece

India Skills Kerala 2020 got off to a colourful start at Swapna Nagari here on Saturday with Minister for Labour and Skills T.P. Ramakrishnan opening the three-day event aimed at showcasing the technical proficiency of the youth in the State.

The event, organised by the Industrial Training Department (ITD) and Kerala Academy for Skills Excellence (KASE), will see 253 participants who were winners from district and zonal rounds vying in 39 disciplines. The event offers a prize money of ₹78 lakh.

It also has at stake an opportunity for the competitors to participate in national events, where the victors get a chance to represent the country at World Skills 2021 at Shanghai in China.

Mr. Ramakrishnan said the government would come up with a career policy shortly considering a recent surge in the importance of technology in the new age. The State needs its youth in educational institutions to do part-time jobs, he said.

India Skills Kerala gives the top winner of each skill ₹1 lakh, while the runner-up will be given ₹50,000.

Those finishing in the subsequent four ranks get ₹10,000 each.

In his presidential address, A. Pradeepkumar, MLA, who is the chairman of the organising committee, said at a time when engineering education was witnessing travesty, events focussed on the skill development of the youth were a welcome sign.

India Skills Kerala comes as a result of its district-level competitions held last month, with 4,298 contestants. The 1,278 winners among them qualified for the zonal rounds held separately for the north, central and south regions.

39 skills

Of the 39 skills for which competitions are on at India Skills Kerala, 32 are at Swapna Nagari. Three (CNC Milling, CNC Turning, Plastic Die Engg) have the NTTF, Thalassery (Kannur district) as the venue. Further, in Kozhikode, Print Media Technology contest has Mathrubhumi as the venue, cooking is slated to be held at SIHM and Water Technology at the CWRDM.

126,2020/02/22,K. Surendran takes charge as Kerala BJP chief,"Kummanam Rajasekharan, Sobha Surendran keep off the function

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader K. Surendran on Saturday took charge as State president of the party.

Scores of BJP workers received Mr. Surendran at the railway station here and escorted him to the party office along with district president V.V. Rajesh. He was received by Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan, former presidents C.K. Padmanabhan, K. Raman Pillai, P.K. Krishnadas, and other leaders, including P.P. Mukundan.

Factionalism

Though the party leadership had said that all former presidents would attend the function, Kummanam Rajasekharan and yet another prominent leader Sobha Surendran were conspicuous by their absence.

The national leadership had warned leaders against factionalism and said that stringent action would be taken against those involving in group activities.

Ms. Surendran was one of the contenders for the president’s post and her absence at the function triggered rumours that the warnings of the national leadership had not helped to quell the differences of opinion in the party.

The party leadership explained that Mr. Rajasekharan and other leaders had to attend other programmes they had committed earlier and their absence should not be deemed as a protest against the national leadership’s decision to have Mr. Surendran as president.

Mr. Surendran, later, addressed the workers who gathered at the office.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/t1p53/article30891241.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TV23SURENDRANSS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/k-surendran-takes-charge-as-kerala-bjp-chief/article30889940.ece

The State Information Commission (SIC) has directed the Deputy Chief Electoral Officer, Thiruvananthapuram, to provide an applicant the information regarding the polling booths where the CCTV/web casting facilities were provided in the last Lok Sabha elections in the State.

The commission also directed the officer to give a copy of the footage of the polling booths where 90% polling was reported.

The commission passed the order on Friday on an appeal filed against the Deputy Electoral Office's refusal to provide the information.

The Deputy Electoral Officer dismissed the plea on the ground that permission from the Election Commission was awaited.

The Deputy Electoral Officer had said the videograph or CCTV footage would be kept in the safe custody of the district election office till the expiry of 45 days from the date of declaration of the results. If any one applied for copies of such recording during the period, a copy would be made available on payment of ₹50 on a CD.

The commission said the contention that permission from the Election Commission had been awaited was untenable under the RTI Act. The argument that the Chief Electoral Officer did not maintain details of the polling booths which recorded more than 90% polling did not hold good as the respondent office is a repository of all such information.

132,2020/02/22,Terror case convict held on charge of luxury car theft,"Intelligence input on Al-Ummah revival being probed

The Kottayam West police on Friday arrested Muhammed Rafiq, a convict in the 1998 Coimbatore bomb blast case, in connection with the theft of several premium cars from Kerala.

A police team from Kottayam took the accused into custody from his hideout near Ukkadam. His arrest follows the statements given by Illyas and K.A. Nishad, who used to hire luxury cars using fake identity documents and sold them to Rafiq. During interrogation, the duo had told the police that they had supplied at least 11 cars and a two-wheeler to Rafiq.

How it worked

The police suspect Rafiq of taking possession of over a hundred premium vehicles from different parts of the State using the modus operandi. “The accused would take the vehicles to a garage at Coimbatore, tamper the engine and chassis numbers and dispatch them to other parts of the country,” said an official.

The police are also probing whether the thefts are linked to the intelligence inputs on the revival of the Al-Ummah network. Rafiq was earlier arrested in April 2018 following his controversial telephonic conversation with a truck driver claiming he was planning to kill Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/terror-case-convict-held-on-charge-of-luxury-car-theft/article30883950.ece
133,2020/02/22,Another nun accuses Franco Mulakkal of sexual abuse,"Nun says he had groped and kissed her on April 30, 2017

Even as the Additional District and Sessions Court I, Kottayam, is set to consider the discharge petition filed by Franco Mulakkal, a bishop accused of raping a nun, allegations of sexual abuse by another nun against the bishop surfaced here on Friday.

The nun, arraigned as 14th witness in the case, gave a statement to the investigation team on September 9, 2018 that she had also encountered sexual misbehaviour from the bishop.

As per her statement, the bishop had groped and kissed her on April 30, 2017 at a convent in Kannur.

Sexual chat

This apart, the bishop also forced her into sexual chat during the 2015-2017 period.

“I had been in contact with the bishop over phone for official purposes since 2015. He used the opportunity for holding sex chats, which were disgusting for me,” she stated.

According to the nun, though she was not interested in the sex chat, she could not oppose the bishop for fear of expulsion from the Church.

New probe sought

The Save Our Sisters (SOS) forum, which has been in the forefront of a protest against the bishop, has demanded a fresh probe into the allegations.

“That the police did not initiate suo motu action following the nun’s deposition before the investigators appears strange. Besides launching a fresh probe, the police should also ensure that the victim, who belongs to the same diocese, is not intimidated or influenced by the accused,” read a statement issued by the SOS.

Police version

Police officers attributed the absence of an FIR to the obstinate position taken by the victim.

“Since the crime occurred in Kannur, we passed the information to the local police. Though the Kannur District Police Chief had approached her for registering a case, she was not interested in prosecution,” said a top police officer.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/t71nbl/article30883908.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22TVFRANCOs,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/new-allegation-surfaces-against-franco-mulakkal/article30883909.ece
134,2020/02/22,"Tiruppur accident | Seat belts could have saved at least 7 lives, say experts","‘Those on left side seats and last row would have died in the impact of being thrown off their seats’

At least seven passengers who died in Thursday’s accident at Tiruppur, when a container lorry rammed the side of a Volvo bus of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation, could have been saved if seat belts were made mandatory in long-distance buses, technical experts who inspected the bus on Friday said.

Furthermore, they sought specialised training for drivers of container lorries and those that ferry chemicals and fuel, since owning a heavy vehicle driving licence is inadequate.

Availability of seat belts in all seats and adherence to the safety precaution would have saved the life of at least seven passengers, including the bus conductor, who were seated on the left row of seats, if the seats were intact. One victim was sitting on the last row, where the impact of the accident was minimal. Just like the six others on left side seats, he too would have died in the impact of being thrown off the seat, said Sibi Mathai, managing director of Vista Driveline Motors, which maintains the fleet of Volvo buses in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

Also Read Tiruppur accident | Driver and conductor had a commendable track record

An avid roadie, who is currently pursuing PhD in road safety, Mr. Mathai spoke of how seat belt makes a passenger safer by up to 80% in the event of an accident. “Else, commuters can be thrown off their seats or injure themselves in even a minor collision. The Central Motor Vehicles Act must make such basic safety features mandatory,” he said.

He further cited the need to train drivers of container lorries, since the driver cabin is in most cases connected to the container trailer by a fifth-wheel coupling. Thus, the trailer portion presses forward (referred to as jack-knifing) even if brake is applied and the driver cabin slows down or stops. A heavy vehicle licence holder needs to know the dynamics of operating container trailers. Especially so when the vehicle takes a sharp turning (as was the case in Tiruppur) or when it has to be reversed.

Referring to the high probability of the driver having dozed off, Mr. Mathai said sensors can be fitted to gauge when a driver’s grip on the steering lessens – a symbol that he has begun to doze off, so that an audio signal is given. Moreover, cameras can be installed to warn drivers when the gap between their upper and lower eye lids shrinks beyond a limit, he said.

Exhaustion factor

Exhausted drivers at the wheel are responsible for about 40% of the road accidents, says a study by the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) on the 300-km Agra-Lucknow Expressway.

A senior KSRTC official said that not all seats in long-distance buses had seat belts. “It depends on the specification in the bus-body code for different type of buses,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bj9979/article30883884.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22tvtr,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/seat-belts-could-have-saved-at-least-7-lives-say-experts/article30883885.ece
135,2020/02/22,Tangedco gets nod to procure 440 MW of wind power via Centre’s arm,"Tangedco said it is procuring the wind energy to meet its non-solar renewable energy purchase obligation requirement for 2021-22

The Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (Tangedco) has obtained a nod from the State power regulator to procure 440.64 MW of wind power for ₹2.91 per unit for 25 years through a tender floated by the Centre’s Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI).

In its petition filed before the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC), Tangedco said it is procuring the wind energy to meet its non-solar renewable energy purchase obligation requirement (RPO) for the year 2021-22.

The State’s renewable energy purchase obligation is fixed at 21% for 2021-22, of which 10.5% should be met through solar. So the required wind capacity to be achieved towards non-solar RPO is 2177 MW before 2021-22, it said.

Tangedco also justified the procurement on the grounds that the rate of ₹2.91 per unit (₹2.84+ Trading margin of ₹0.07) offered by SECI is less than ₹3.42 per unit arrived through its own tender process during 2017.

It also pointed out that it had rolled out a tender to procure 500 MW of wind power at rate of ₹3.46 per unit as upper limit and only 450 MW were finalized at the rate of ₹3.42 per unit. The two companies with which it has signed power purchase agreements are M/s. RegenPowertechPvt. Ltd., (for 200 MW) on 19.10.2017 and M/s. Corolla Green Power Pvt. Ltd. (for 250 MW).

Regen has so far commissioned only 49.5 MW, while Corolla is yet to start the project, while the deadline for commissioning is before March 2019 and both companies have sought relief, which is pending before TNERC, Tangedco said.

Tangedco also said that another of its tenders to procure 500 MW of wind power with an upper limit of ₹2.65 per unit, did not receive any response from the bidders even after extension of the last date twice.

The present feed in tariff arrived by this Commission valid till 31.03.2020 is ₹2.86 per unit (without availing accelerated depreciation benefit) is very much comparable to ₹2.91 per unit offered by SECI, it said.

“In view of lack of response to the earlier tender by Tangedco from the wind generators, the chances of favourable response to any new tender to be floated (by Tangedco) may be less,” the State utility noted.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tangedco-gets-nod-to-procure-440-mw-of-wind-power-via-centres-arm/article30888907.ece

139,2020/02/22,Officials from Puducherry interact with SHGs in Vellore,"They learn about products women make for a living

A team of officials from the Puducherry government interacted with women self-help group members (SHGs) working at Ariyur near Vellore on Friday to get first-hand information about their products, manufacturing details and marketing strategies adopted by them to earn a livelihood.

The team, led by Oulgaret Municipality M. Kandasamy, were briefed by women workers on the handicraft toys manufacturing unit as well as about the handmade mementos manufacturing unit.

Products get a platform for display at various exhibitions in the government departments, the entrepreneurs told the officials.

The groups were aided by the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) by providing training in tailoring, making toys, pickles and sanitary napkins.

Each self-help group maintains around 10-12 members and one member from each group forms part of the area-level federation of SHGs. There are 55-60 federations working across the Vellore district.

Mr. Kandasamy said he was given to understand that SHG working women in Vellore were pioneers in helping other women and ensuring livelihood to rural population.

The NRLM support and the women’s dedicated efforts made them rich in their ideas of innovating products and skilful marketing techniques.

“There are about 490 groups in Puducherry and we take this message to them for implementation at their levels,” he said.

141,2020/02/22,‘Don’t take salary into account to determine OBC creamy layer’,"Ramadoss against amending rules

PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Friday said that the Centre should not amend rules relating to determination of creamy layer among OBCs. He said the ‘salary’ should not be taken into consideration to decide if a Backward Class candidate belongs in a ‘creamy layer’ as it was against principles of social justice.

In a statement, he said that the creamy layer, presently, was being determined by taking into account only income from other sources. “This is what the office memorandum that was released by the Government in 1993 states. The creamy layer calculation is not done by taking into account the salary of those working in Central and State Governments. However, OBCs working in public sector institutions had their salaries taken into consideration. So, a husband and wife belonging to OBC and earning ₹33,500 per month were denied reservations. While 12 OBC candidates in 2012, 11 in 2015, 29 in 2017 were denied IAS and IPS posts, hundreds of OBC candidates were denied other civil services positions. The Madras High Court and Delhi High Court said that Centre’s new method was biased,” he said.

He further said that the committee which was set up to look into this issue has actually come up with a new recommendation. “While 27% reservations have been implemented in the last three decades, there are not even 10 percent OBCs in Central government jobs. The Centre shouldn’t accept the recommendation that ‘salary’ be taken into account to determine creamy layer,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dont-take-salary-into-account-to-determine-obc-creamy-layer/article30884541.ece
142,2020/02/22,Elephant in mourning guards its dead calf in Gudalur forest,"Officials have been waiting for four days for it to move out

For the last four days, forest officials and staff have been witnessing a moving scene: a female elephant standing guard over the carcass of its 18-month-old calf that died after getting stuck in a swamp in Padanthorai beat in Gudalur forest range. It does not allow anyone to get near the carcass. Nor does it accept the food given by forest staff.

Stating that it is unusual for a mother to stay put near the carcass of its calf for more than two days, forest officials are worried that this could harm the health of the elephant. Workers of a tea estate noticed the carcass on Monday and informed the Forest Department.

When the forest staff tried to approach the carcass to perform a post-mortem, the mother elephant began charging at them. Forest officials decided to wait till the mother, as well as the rest of the herd, to move out of the area. However, the herd has stayed put for four consecutive days.

Forest Range Officer of Gudalur division G. Ramakrishnan said “I have seen many instances where the mother safeguards the carcass for a period of time. But, usually, they move away after a couple of days when the body starts decomposing.” But, this was the first time he had seen a female elephant refusing to leave even after four days.

District Forest Officer of Gudalur division Sumesh Soman said the department was concerned over the health of the mother. “We are unsure if she is taking food as she spends the day guarding the carcass. So we tried to leave some watermelons and fruits nearby so that she could keep her strength,” he said.

But, the elephant has refused to touch the food and water provided by the department.

Mr. Ramakrishnan said the mother and two other adult elephants of the herd were taking refuge in a nearby forest during some parts of the day. “However, if they hear people nearby, they rush out and stand guard over the calf and refuse to let us anywhere near it,” he said.

‘Emotional bond’

The incident highlights the deep emotional bond elephants have with each another, also showing how similar it is to the one among humans, said Mr. Soman.

“It shows that the death of a member of the herd has a very deep and profound impact on the other elephants in the herd, and also serves to reinforce the need to conserve and protect these amazing animals,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/isbzbh/article30884523.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OT22OOTYELEPHANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/elephant-in-mourning-guards-its-dead-calf-in-gudalur-forest/article30884524.ece

With an investment of ₹217 crore, the Tamil Nadu Polymer Park is expected to attract investments of ₹3,000 crore and generate over 7,000 new jobs.

The Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO) and the National Industrial Corridor Development and Implementation Trust (NICDIT) joined hands to develop the Ponneri Node of the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor.

An agreement was signed between them at a diplomatic outreach event inaugurated by the Chief Minister.

Along with the Union Ministry of External Affairs, the State government had organised the event that showcased economic and investment opportunities in the State to diplomats from other countries.

Mr. Palaniswami inaugurated various projects with an investment of ₹1,254 crore and that could generate over 10,330 jobs, and agreements for these investments were exchanged in his presence. Hanon Automotive from Korea is to invest ₹500 crore at Malrosapuram in Kancheepuram district. Jogo Health, U.S., which initially signed an MoU for ₹15 crore had increased its investment to ₹250 crore. It was expected to employ 10,000 people.

Mitsuba Sical would be investing ₹504 crore in SIPCOT Industrial Complex in Gummidipoondi.

Facilitation MoU

A facilitation MoU was signed between Guidance Tamil Nadu and Developers Park – Japan for an investment of ₹800 crore creating 2,500 jobs.

The Chief Minister released a handbook on “Doing Business in Tamil Nadu” for investors. Mr. Palaniswami listed the investment potential of Tamil Nadu in the manufacturing sector, IT & ITeS, R&D, food processing and infrastructure. He explained the State’s export potential across sectors, including agriculture, dairy and fisheries.

The event saw the participation of diplomats from 36 countries, including Denmark, France, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, Thailand, the U.K. and the U.S.

144,2020/02/22,State may get four major textile projects,"T. N. to also get a research centre under Centre’s plan

Tamil Nadu is likely to get three textile parks and a technology research centre under schemes that the Union Ministry of Textiles is formulating.

According to industry sources here, the Ministry is preparing a “Mega Textile Park Scheme” and plans sector-specific textile parks. The State is expected to get one mega textile park, a technology park for textile machinery, a technical textiles park and a technology research centre.

For the mega textile park, the State should provide a minimum of 1,000 acres. A couple of locations in Tamil Nadu have been suggested to the Centre for this.

In the case of textile machinery, the aim is to make textile machinery production indigenous by developing technology in-house or bring it from other countries. The infrastructure for this project is proposed to be developed in Surat and Coimbatore and these will be smaller parks.

For technical textiles park, Salem is likely to be the choice, the sources said. A technology research centre will most likely come up in Coimbatore.

The Confederation of Indian Textile Industry has welcomed the efforts of the Union Textile Ministry, which would help the Indian textile and clothing sector has to scale up its operation.

Scaling up operations

T. Rajkumar, chairman of the confederation, said the country was at a disadvantage vis-a-vis the scale of operation and countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam were able to seize the opportunities created by China’s withdrawal.

At a meeting held by Union Textile Minister Smriti Irani recently, representatives from global brands that had retail operation in India said they had to import from countries such as China, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka because of volume and cost advantage.

They said that India did not have large players to meet their demands.

Mr. Rajkumar said the Centre had been making efforts to attract Foreign Direct Investment, joint venture projects, and investments from vertically integrated textile players in the mega textile parks. The government was thinking of major support to attract investments and ensure hassle-free fast clearances for units to set up integrated facilities.

The minimum investment by each unit should be ₹500 crore in the mega parks.

The Dravidar Kazhagam will spearhead a State-wide demonstration with like-minded organisations in front of Central government offices on March 23, demanding that the State government assert its rights in framing educational policies, its president K. Veeramani said in Tiruchi on Friday.

Education being in concurrent list, the Centre could not exercise exclusive right and impose NEET (National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test) and NEXT (National Exit Test).

“The Central Government cannot dictate terms. Already, nine lives have been lost in Tamil Nadu due to NEET,” Mr. Veeramani told journalists on the sidelines of the general council meeting of the Dravidar Kazhagam. Hospitals, vital for medical education, come under the department of Health, a State subject, he said.

The State government must enact a law again since framing an educational policy was a matter of right and not a concession.

The move to extend age concession hitherto enjoyed by backward classes and Scheduled Castes to forward castes, implied weakening of reservation based on social justice that was brought about through struggles by the late leaders of the Justice Party and the Dravidian parties. Caste-wise census was a necessity to make sure that the benefits of reservation reached the target population, he said.

Welcoming the Bill passed by Tamil Nadu Assembly to declare parts of Cauvery Delta as a Protected Agricultural Zone, Mr. Veeramani, however, said there was no certainty that it would not face the same fate as the NEET exemption Bills that were rejected by the Centre. Rather than hurrying with the Bill, the State government ought to have made it comprehensive as emphasised by the DMK, Mr. Veeramani said.

In all, 14 resolutions relating to social justice and educational system under the purview of the Central and State governments were adopted at the general council meeting.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dk-to-protest-against-neet-on-march-23/article30884426.ece
146,2020/02/22,Accident site may be declared a danger zone,"Collector says decision will be based on inputs from police and highways dept.

Following the accident on the outskirts of Tiruppur that killed 19 persons on Thursday, Tiruppur District Collector K. Vijayakarthikeyan said on Friday that the district administration would soon take a call on declaring the spot as accident-prone.

“We will take a call on it in the next road safety meeting in a week or so,” Mr. Vijayakarthikeyan told The Hindu.

The decision would be taken based on inputs from the police and State Highways Department, he said.

Nineteen persons travelling by a Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) bus were killed on NH 544 when a truck hit the central median and the 30-tonne container it was carrying fell on the bus.

Body handed over

The body of Kiran Kumar, who was one of the 19 deceased, was handed over to the relatives at the Government Hospital in Tiruppur early on Friday.

Hospital Dean A. Nirmala saidthat relatives of Kumar from Tumakuru in Karnataka received the body at around 4 a.m. Autopsy procedures for all the 19 bodies were completed by 7 p.m. on Thursday and 18 bodies were handed over to the respective families on the same day, Dr. Nirmala said.

According to Tiruppur City Police, seven people, including a boy, survived the accident without any injury.

A senior police officer told The Hindu that the police were able to confirm names of five passengers of the bus who were not admitted in any hospitals. Among the five was six-year-old Alan Sunny.

The mobile numbers of the remaining two names were not reachable by the police and are assumed to be unhurt in the accident. “Had they been hurt, they would been admitted in hospitals and would have been accounted for,” the police officer said. There were 48 passengers and two KSRTC employees (driver and driver-cum-conductor) aboard the bus at the time of the accident. Out of 50, 19 were declared dead and seven survived without any injury and 24 persons were injured, the police.

Out of danger

Palakkad District Collector D. Balamurali told The Hindu that most of the injured victims of the accident have returned to Kerala. Only seven patients were under treatment, he said. Of these, two were admitted to hospital in Tiruppur district and five in Coimbatore district. “Everybody is out of danger,” Mr. Balamurali said. However, some of the patients admitted in hospitals in Coimbatore district had to undergo surgery due to severity of the injuries, following which they could return to their homes in Kerala.

A. Hemaraj, 38, driver of the container truck that caused the accident, was remanded in judicial custody on Friday.

He was produced before the third judicial magistrate in Tiruppur District Court on Friday afternoon and was sentenced to 15 days of judicial custody, the Thirumuruganpoondi police said.

The accused was remanded at Coimbatore Central Prison.

According to the police, Hemaraj fell asleep while driving the truck.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/accident-site-may-be-declared-a-danger-zone/article30884411.ece
147,2020/02/22,‘People will throw out AIADMK govt.’,"DMK president M.K. Stalin on Friday accused the ruling AIADMK of consistently misleading the people, particularly on CAA, NRC and NPR by making “false statements”.

In a letter to party cadres, a copy of which was released to the media, Mr. Stalin said that the time to answer questions was near for the current AIADMK government and that people will throw out those who are fooling them.

“When I got the chance to speak about the CAA in the Legislative Assembly, I said that the Act is against the Constitution and that this reason is enough to repeal it,” he said. The NPR is seeking proof of parents’ birth date and birth place. If they can’t prove it, they are being asked for festivals they celebrate. The Islamic festivals are not present in it. This proves the religious divides that the NPR seeks to create. Those who don’t give proper proof will be marked ‘D’ [Doubtful]. I said that the NPR forms the basis on which NRC will be created,” he said. However, “despite pointing out the issues with CAA, the ruling party is not ready to state that NPR will not be carried out.”

The DMK chief criticised the exclusion of Tiruchi, Karur and Ariyalur districts from the Tamil Nadu Protected Agriculture Zone.

148,2020/02/22,‘Delta Bill will stand legal scrutiny’,"High-level authority to take a call on projects in the Mannargudi lignite field

The emphasis of the Tamil Nadu Protected Agriculture Zone Development Bill is on promoting agriculture in the region than on acquiring any regulatory function, according to a senior official in the Agriculture Department.

Explaining salient features of the proposed law, the official said the Bill had been drafted in such a way that it would stand the test of legal scrutiny. As agriculture was a State subject, the government had chosen to give greater importance to “positive and promotional functions” than anything else. This is why 18 functions have been stipulated in Section 8 of the Bill.

At the same time, the proposed law had certain teeth in the form of penal powers to enforce implementation of its features.

Asked which agency would ensure that prohibited projects were not taken up in the delta, the official replied that those in charge of issuing planning permits and environmental clearances would scrutinise any development project from the angle of the proposed legislation too before giving their approval.

They would consult the Second Schedule of the proposed legislation which dealt with prohibited fields of industrial activity.

Lignite project

Asked whether the high-level authority, envisaged under the Bill, could act against any lignite project that might come up in future in the Mannargudi region, which was estimated to be having nearly 54% of the country’s lignite reserves, the official said that under Section 22 (2), the body could recommend to the government to include any project that might “adversely” affect agricultural developments in the protected zone and the latter could subsequently have the project included in the Second Schedule.

According to the Indian Mines Yearbook 2018, published by the Indian Bureau of Mines in the Union Ministry of Mines in November 2019, the country, as on April 1, 2018, had the total known lignite resources of around 45.66 billion tonnes, of which Tamil Nadu accounted for 80% with 36.135 billion tonnes. The Mannargudi lignite field, as is called officially, has about 24.69 billion tonnes. It covers different parts of Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, and Nagapattinam districts such as Orathanadu, Pattukottai, Alangudi, Pandanallur, Tirumangaicheri and Nachiyarkudi.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/b71owo/article30884234.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22THMANNARGUDI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/delta-bill-will-stand-legal-scrutiny/article30884235.ece
149,2020/02/22,Tamil Nadu urges Centre to drop ‘inconvenient’ NPR queries,"‘Avoid gathering details such as Aadhaar, parents’ birth date and mother tongue’

The ruling AIADMK, which is facing criticism for being a supporter of the Centre on the issue of Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), on Friday said the State government had written to the Centre to avoid gathering certain details from the residents during the NPR exercise.

The details pertained to the residents’ mother tongue and numbers of Aadhaar, mobile, voter identity card and driving licence besides the dates and places of birth of their parents and spouses, according to Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, who are co-coordinator and coordinator of the party respectively.

Their observation marked a subtle change in the government’s position as Revenue Minister told the Assembly on Thursday that clarifications had been sought from the Union government on the NPR questionnaire. The clarifications were in response to concerns expressed in certain quarters that such details might be used against minorities, especially Muslims.

In a statement, they said that it was only in 2010 when the DMK was part of the Congress-led coalition government at the Centre that the NPR was made a component of the Census under the rules of the Citizenship Act which were formulated in 2003. The rules had provided for each citizen getting a national identity card too. Under the NPR, those residing in the country for six months or more would have to furnish details of their families without documentary proof.

Seek cooperation

Giving an account of various ongoing welfare measures and plans of the AIADMK government for the benefit of Muslims, the two leaders sought cooperation of the community to demolish, what they called, attempts by certain forces to break “close relationship and understanding” between the party and the Muslims. They called upon the community to understand that anti-social elements and some Opposition parties, which were desperate to capture power, were indulging “brazenly” and “without conscience” in activities to disrupt law and order. They condemned bid by the DMK, which could not “stomach the growing popularity” of the State government, to cause confusion among the Muslims through “false propaganda.”

Emphasising that their party would “always remain a friend” of the Muslims, Mr. Palaniswami and Mr. Panneerselvam said “no injustice would be committed against members of any minority community. The Kazhagam (AIADMK) government will not allow any action against the minorities.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/8b0pph/article30884224.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22THTNEDAPPADIOPS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-urges-centre-to-drop-inconvenient-npr-queries/article30884225.ece
150,2020/02/22,Sharing or re-tweeting ‘hate’ messages can invite action in Tamil Nadu,"Tamil Nadu Police get social networking sites to remove hundreds of ‘provocative’ messages.

Amid escalating anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests across the State, the Tamil Nadu police have intensified vigil on social media platforms, particularly Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Hundreds of “hate” messages posted by known/unknown users that had “potentially violence provoking” content were deleted in recent weeks with the assistance of nodal officers appointed by the social media authorities, sources in the intelligence agency said on Friday.

While security agencies started registering cases against those who posted messages/photographs/videos that could affect peace by inciting violence between two groups of people, action was being planned against those who re-tweeted or shared such posts.

Police were maintaining a dossier of persons who posted or forwarded content that had the potential to disrupt communal harmony and maintenance of law and order, the sources said.

Cyber analytics

An analytical team formed to monitor the flow of content in the social media had identified a large number of users from Tamil Nadu, other States and abroad who posted provocative messages/photographs/videos in the social media.

After ensuring that the content was clearly provocative and prima facie violating the right to freedom of expression, the team would forward the user details and posts to the social media cell for appropriate action, a senior police officer told The Hindu.

“Where the user is an identified person, the team would keep a record of his/her profile, content, re-tweets/forwards for initiating criminal proceedings under the Information Technology Act and then write to the nodal officers (of social media) to remove the posts. In case, the person who posted such objectionable content is unknown, we directly make a request to remove the content and block the user,” the officer who preferred not to be quoted said.

‘Not a gag order’

The police were taking up the matter case-by-case with relevant documents and a brief on how the content was potentially dangerous. Social media administrators were cooperating well by taking prompt action.

“This is not a gag order or an attempt to control or deny the right to freedom of expression.

“We are making sure that hate content identified by the analytical team is verified by senior officers and the opinion of legal advisers is obtained if need be,” the officer said.

Police sources refused to part with details of cases registered in connection with posting/re-tweeting/forwarding or “hate” messages and parried questions of arrests made so far.

Glitches faced

“As of now, we are having some problems dealing with the spread of messages in WhatsApp. Steps have been taken to address the issue as early as possible,” another police officer said and added that the silent operation began soon after the judgment in Ayodhya case and intensified as anti-CAA protests gathered momentum.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/uywqae/article30884211.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22Social-media-monitoring,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-police-intensify-vigil-on-social-media-platforms-as-anti-caa-protests-escalate-across-state/article30884212.ece
151,2020/02/22,"The ‘Friends’ Reunion: Things on our wishlist for Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and Ross","Come May, several generations of fans will be tuning in check out one of the most anticipated television specials in history — so what should we expect from it?

The Friends reunion is happening, and we can’t keep still. Fans all over the world, across generations, woke up to the news, and social media is full of posts speculating what the special episode to be aired on HBO Max will be all about.

The reunion will be unscripted, and is set to feature the series’ creators, David Crane and Martha Kauffman, as well as all the actors Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer. So it seems unlikely that the actors will be ‘in character’ as Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and Ross, and we could just see them going on a trip down memory lane with the show-runners, discussing where the characters ended up, hint at unresolved plot points, and so on.

Still, just the very idea of seeing the six together after nearly 16 years (the series finale The Last One, Part 2 aired on May 6, 2004) is enough to send goosebumps for fans who still binge-watch the show, and with Friends set to move from Netflix to HBO Max (WarnerMedia’s streaming service) soon — the reunion is the mother of all promotions for the new streaming site — this is perfect timing.

Even better, the special episode will be taped at the original soundstage on the Warner Bros. lot, so there’s reason to expect we can see them huddle over a coffee at Central Perk or Monica’s apartment!

Everyone’s wishlist is sure to have some sort of connection with their favourite episode, but here are some of the things we definitely want to see. Could we BE any more excited?

1) Lisa Kudrow sings ‘Smelly Cat’ for us

‘Smelly Cat’... one more time

Let’s face it, this should, must and probably will happen. Though the theme song I’ll Be There for You by The Rembrandts is the more popular track, Phoebe Buffay’s iconic original composition is one that brings the fondest memories. Lisa Kudrow even joined Taylor Swift on stage for a rendition of Smelly Cat a few years ago... and if she can do it for her, well, we certainly then deserve it more. Give the woman a guitar already!

2) Aniston and Schwimmer settle the ‘We were on a break!’ debate once and for all

‘We Were On A Break!’

Well, they probably won’t, but wouldn’t it be epic if they even talked about it? Though Ross and Rachel did find their happily-ever-after towards the finale (atleast we think they are still together with daughter Emma Geller-Greene and a couple of other siblings to boot), their earlier break-up in the third season birthed one of the most famous lines — and arguments — to ever originate from the show, all thanks to Chloe from the Xerox store. Real-life couples have used it endlessly over decades in fights, and fans still debate over who was right: some closure finally would be nice... no?

3) Finding out who Joey ends up with

Joey doesn’t share... his life with ANYONE?

This is a big one. Though fans were upset when Joey was the only friend to remain single when the show ended, it did mean opening up a world of possibilities for Matt LeBlanc’s character in the subsequent (and only) spin-off to Friends so far, Joey. The show traced the journey of favourite Tribbiani after his move to Hollywood where he looks for more acting opportunities, and after an awkward two season-run, was cancelled. However, towards the end of the second season, Joey is shown to be in a committed relationship with his next-door neighbour Alex Garrett (played by Andrea Anders), but did the couple last?

4) The One Where They All Quiz Each Other, On Each Other

‘The One With The Embryos’ | Photo Credit: NBC

Considered one of the best episodes in the show’s history, The One with the Embryos (the twelfth in the fourth season) smashed ratings' records at the time. The episode follows two storylines. One in which Phoebe agrees to be the surrogate mother for her brother Frank Jr. and his wife Alice Knight. The other, is a hilarious trivia quiz hosted by Ross between the teams of Chandler and Joey against Monica and Rachel on how well they know each other: for bets that keep increasing in nature, finally resulting in the girls losing their coveted apartment to the boys.

Courteney Cox and Matt LeBlanc revealed later that this was their favorite episode of the series, and since the show ended, Friends quizzes have become a instant hit on television shows, interviews and parties too where fans replicate the format. Several celebrities, who are Friends superfans (such as singer Charlie Puth being quizzed by Courteney Cox on trivia from the show recently) set the Internet cheering constantly taking part in them. So it’s only fair that the original six are quizzed about the show, or even better — considering they are all buds off-screen too — about themselves.

Does Rachel finally know what Chandler’s job is?

5) What are the ‘Other’ F.R.I.E.N.D.S upto now?

Chandler’s ex-girlfriend Janice, played by Maggie Wheeler and James Michael Tyler as Gunther, appeared in every single season of the show

There have been several supporting characters to grace the show (we aren’t including Paul Rudd’s Mike Hannigan because he’s much more than just a supporting actor), but undoubtedly, the most important were Gunther (James Michael Tyler) and Janice (Maggie Wheeler). Gunther’s immortal crush on Rachel made for some of the most memorable moments in all the ten seasons, while Janice’s ‘Oh. My. God!’ is irreplacable. We’d like to believe that they have moved on from their respective obsessions to bigger and better things, and while at it, how about some closure for some of the other celebrity guest star characters like Bruce Willis, Reese Witherspoon or Hugh Laurie? Updates on The Chick, The Duck and Marcel the monkey would be appreciated too.

We saved the best for last: Imagine if now-single Brad Pitt (he guest-starred as Will Colbert from The One with the Rumor) were to gatecrash the reunion with a surprise cameo and sit next to Aniston... yep, the Internet’s having a meltdown.

6) Have the kids of the F.R.I.E.N.D.S become friends too?

Would Emma Geller-Green get along with Erica and Jack Bing?

So we have Ben (Ross and Carol), Emma (Ross and Rachel), Jack and Erica Bing (Erica / Monica and Chandler) and the triplets (Phoebe / Frank and Alice). But hey, there could be more too.

Would it be safe to assume that all the children (now-teenagers and young adults) would have all met at some point... and hit it off like their parents? David Crane and Martha Kauffman almost-fan fictioning a new spin-off with all the F.R.I.E.N.D.S’ kids navigating life in present-day New York with all their millennial woes and dating apps: there’s the Modern Love TV series that should have actually happened.

7) More stories from behind-the-scenes

Who doesn’t love a good old-fashioned trip down nostalgia lane and some on-set stories from when the gang were in their 20s? It’s well known by now that the six actors almost took conscious efforts to become friends in real-life (something that has lasted until today) in order to bring about more chemistry on screen. But even then, all of them were aghast at the idea of Joey and Rachel pairing up in the final season, to the extent where Matt LeBlanc recalled in an interview, “It was wrong and felt wildly inappropriate. It’s like I want to be with my sister. I was like, ‘That’s Rachel. She’s supposed to be with Ross!’”

Given their recent throwback stories and photos on social media, lots of vintage pictures, videos and funny/ sentimental anecdotes seem to be in the offing. Keep those tissues ready.

8) The hope of future reunions to come

The entire catalogue of Friends and the unscripted special will be available to stream on HBO Max when the service launches in May, and the reunion special, in reality, is just a glorified promotion for the series switching its home from Netflix to the WarnerMedia site. Yet, it will still be an iconic television moment: such has been the influence of the sitcom on defining the zeitgeist of binge-watching as we know it today, and the ethos of several similar shows (How I Met Your Mother, Big Bang Theory, New Girl.. to mention a few) that followed in its wake.

HBO Max has pulled off a major coup in getting all the six stars together after a decade-and-half, but might we hope for more glimpses of their off-screen friendship in the near future? Only time will tell, but then, they did tell us they’ll be there for us after all.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/nfpvc/article30889408.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/friends,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-friends-reunion-things-on-our-wishlist-for-rachel-monica-phoebe-joey-chandler-and-ross/article30889412.ece
152,2020/02/22,Priya Bhavani Shankar: ‘You don’t matter until you work in a big hero film’,"One of the most sought-after leading ladies in Tamil cinema at the moment, actor Priya Bhavani Shankar, last seen as a narcotics cop in Karthick Naren’s ‘Mafia: Chapter 1’, discusses breaking image stereotypes, demanding stronger roles and why she finds certain industry practices frustrating

The initials PBS in modern Tamil cinema parlance has little to do with an iconic playback singer of the bygone era.

That PBS — as in Priya Bhavani Shankar for those not clued into pop culture — has come to be her calling card, quite literally (on film sets, among her fans and elsewhere), is a marker of the actor’s rise to prominence over the last couple of years.

Priya is sought after in the film industry here, primarily for her ability to speak Tamil. Such is her demand that she is slated to appear in no less than half-a-dozen films over the course of this year and the next.

Since making her début in Meyaadha Maan in 2017, the actor appeared in a supporting role in Kadaikutty Singam, and as the female lead in Monster. All three were commercially successful, and so Priya now finds herself in the spotlight of an industry that is only too willing to bet on an individual’s luck factor.

The rule of luck

Luck, however, is known to chart its own course: for some, it has resulted in success beyond anyone’s wildest dreams, but for most people, it has resulted in a misstep leading to an uncontrollable slide downhill.

Does this proposition make luck feel like a burden? Priya insists that she would instead bet on her ability to choose a good script.

“Honestly, I don’t believe in luck too much. I’m the kind of person who believes in the thoughts you put into the universe... (smiles)... but I’m very cautious when I choose the script. I do not merely want to increase the count of my movies. The script, the production house and my character in the script is what matters,” she says.

Priya’s recent release, the Karthick Naren directorial starring Arun Vijay, Mafia: Chapter 1, has her play the role of Sathya, a narcotics control officer.

For someone whose screen time has been limited to playing “homely” characters (read: soft and timid), Mafia was a breath of fresh air. “I thanked Karthi (the director) for visualising me this way,” she says, adding, “I do think I’m being typecast in this industry. Fortunately though, things have started to change.”

The image trap

Part of the reason for the existence of this image about her, she attributes to her television stint, as the lead character Priya Arjun in the Star Vijay soap Kalyanam Mudhal Kadhal Varai.

“It had an impact on how people started to see me. Soaps have that effect. It makes people start connecting you with their family. A couple of years ago, when I posted a picture of myself in shorts while on vacation, people were like: ‘You cannot wear this dress’. That was quite alarming to me. I cannot be the same fictional character I played in a soap forever. To break that image is a huge deal,” she says.

That is where Sathya in Mafia comes in. But playing a cop role can be demanding. For Priya, it felt like “going to college or school and learning something new on the first day”.

A happy life Priya Bhavani Shankar has been in a long-term relationship stretching back over a decade. The duo met and fell in love during college. “The support I receive from him is incredible. I don’t think my growth puts him in an insecure place because he knows how much I love being here. I can only see happiness on his face when something good happens to me rather than being insecure with the fame and love I receive. And the kind of support I receive from my parents is because they know for sure that there is going to be this guy to take care of me even if things fall apart. When the time comes to leave, I won’t go, ‘Oh my God, I’m leaving. I’m ageing’ and all that. I know for sure I’m going to be beautiful for someone throughout my life,” she says.

What helped infuse confidence in her was the calm and collected nature of her director. “He is a very sorted guy. I ask him: ‘Where did you learn all this? What was your source of inspiration’, and he tells me that YouTube is his teacher. But I think he is naturally blessed with [knowledge of his] craft,” she says.

Equal treatment

Though she is happy with her choice of roles, Priya has one grievance with the industry. That it “isn’t very welcoming” when female actors demand that stronger roles be written for them.

“These demands are very basic. I do not want to just be a part of the movie. I do not want to sing a song and disappear. I wouldn’t like to see a character like that on screen if I was in the audience. But I guess sometimes it is intimidating to the [film]makers,” she says, before correcting herself slightly, “I think it might be intimidating.”

She adds: “It is the case in most big scale films, but being a part of one also counts. I’m not saying you need to give me a strong character in big hero projects, but give me a purpose and don’t just turn me into a property.”

However, when the opportunity to be a part of Kamal Haasan’s Indian 2 came up, she put these thoughts aside to sign on the project.

“I wanted to be part of it somehow. I have seen top paid heroines set aside their demands and play minor roles in big star films. So, I went in with the mindset of taking whatever is offered. Fortunately, that was not the case,” says Priya, who is one of the female leads in the film, which also stars Kamal Haasan, Siddharth, Rakul Preet Singh and Kajal Aggarwal.

Priya considers being a part of such projects essential for climbing the ladder in the film industry.

“It is something that frustrates me. Until you are part of a big scale film, you don’t matter [in the industry]. Your hit movies don’t count, the characters you play doesn’t matter until you have played a role alongside a big hero. Sometimes, I think if Indian 2 did not happen for me, would I have been placed this way in Tamil cinema? I don’t know. People like Andrea [Jeremiah] have spoken about this in the past. It is not only about being a part of big hero projects, the quality of work that you do also matters. That has to be respected.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/4ssboz/article30888485.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Priya-Bhavani-Shankar,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/priya-bhavani-shankar-you-dont-matter-until-you-work-in-a-big-hero-film/article30888486.ece
153,2020/02/22,‘Thappad’ team supports campaign against on-screen gender-based violence,"The movie, starring actor Taapsee Pannu and directed by Anubhav Sinha, is set to release on February 28

The team of Thappad, including lead actor Taapsee Pannu and director Anubhav Sinha, have extended their support to a petition asking for disclaimers to be added in films that showcase domestic violence.

The petition started by Mahika Banerji for women’s rights organisation Breakthrough on Change.org has so far gathered more than 1.27 lakh signatures.

Taapsee has shot a concept video to promote the campaign.

“Why don’t we have a disclaimer for ‘Thappad’ on-screen when we have one for alcohol consumption, smoking and animal cruelty?” the actor asks in the clip.

The petition seeks support from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) in identifying scenes of violence and calling them out with warnings and disclaimers.

“I’m happy that our petition on warnings and disclaimers for on-screen gender-based violence has received an overwhelmingly positive response. We strongly believe that our efforts at bringing about lasting behavioural change through means of popular culture and community-based actions will play a crucial role in ending gender-based violence. I am happy film Thappad has taken the lead. We hope many more films to follow this practice,” Sohini Bhattacharya, President & CEO, Breakthrough, said in a statement.

The 32-year-old actor also took to social media to offer her support to the petition asking the CBFC to make it mandatory for movies depicting violence against women to carry disclaimers.

154,2020/02/22,The ‘Indian 2’ tragedy: How safe is it to work on the sets of Kollywood films?,"The recent accident on the sets of the Kamal Haasan-Shankar film is not a one-off case in Kollywood. If you are a part of the Tamil film industry, chances are that your life expectancy has already gone down a few points, and an insurance policy only comes with a high premium

If you thought that being around heavy filming equipment was the number one source of risk on a film set, think again. The traumatic turn of events on the set of Kamal Haasan’s upcoming film Indian 2 at EVP Film City in Poonamallee last week — which resulted in three lost lives — is only an indicator of the general lack of safe working conditions in Tamil cinema.

The reason is cavalier attitudes, industry sources allege. Talk to any stuntmen associated with Tamil cinema, and you are likely to hear words like veeram (courage) and thunichal (bravado) thrown at you. What such attitudes have led to is a working environment where people, for fear of being looked down upon or not being offered an opportunity for not being “manly enough”, endanger their lives to an extent that can be deemed foolish.

Dancing with death

An up-and-coming actor in Tamil films tells this writer that he was “extremely fortunate” to not have suffered concussion, after being hit in the head due to a human error that could have been avoided entirely.

“I’m playing the antagonist in this film, and so in a fight sequence, the hero picks up a stool nearby and hits me on the head. Upon impact, the stool is supposed to break into pieces but the art director screwed it up. He left an actual stool instead and I was stuck in the back of my head hard. I felt numb and I just sat down clutching my head. Luckily, I did not suffer concussion or other injuries but the back of my head was swollen for a few days,” says the actor, bemoaning the fact that filmmakers seldom offer stunt doubles for newcomers and actors struggling to make a mark in films.

Mainstream Tamil actors and character artistes have remarked that the culture in Tamil films is that production units seldom prioritise life and limbs over work and the product. Actor Vishal, who suffered an injury filming a stunt sequence for his last film, Action, thinks it is “necessary to take risks” for whistle-worthy moments on screen. In fact, he marketed the film by stating in a few interviews that he suffered over “100 injuries” making it. Actor Vishnu Vishal, who suffered a career-threatening injury while shooting the upcoming film Kaadan, has previously gone on record to document his “miraculous recovery”. Even actor Ajith was in the news recently for suffering a bike accident on the sets of his upcoming Valimai.

In the West, actors like Tom Cruise and Jackie Chan, famed for executing their own stunts and injuring themselves many times over in the process, are considered outliers. Here, outliers are all we have.

Such practices are alienating to foreign film crews, when they collaborate with Tamil filmmakers. Says Jaguar Thangam, stunt master and current president of Film and Television Producer’s Guild of South India, that while working actor Rajinikanth’s English language film, Bloodstone (1988), American stuntmen refused to dive off the cliff in Hogenakkal waterfalls. “They flat out refused. They said they would not jump because it was life-threateningly risky. But our fighters jumped. Rajini sir knows this story.” Why do the stuntmen feel compelled to take risks? “It is to show our veeram,” he says, and adds: “besides, our boys won’t say no.”

Passing the buck

Another issue brought to the fore by the Indian 2 tragedy is the lack of interest among film producers to insure their films. The few who do, only agree to do so if the premiums they pay leave a minimal impact on the production budget. The compensation packages doled out by such insurance policies, in the case of fatality, and after being subjected to a long drawn-out process, offer little value to the families of the victim. Compensation packages offered by film producers post tragic incidents also paper over the fact that it takes away the option of a legal recourse away from the victims’ families.

Producer T Siva of Amma Creations, who is a member of the ad hoc committee which manages affairs at the Tamil Film Producers Council, says that it is the responsibility of the respective craft unions to insure members and ensure their workplace safety. “As a producer, our responsibility ends with the provision of equipment. It is the technician who should ask for safety equipment if he needs it,” he says.

Thangam adds that Film Employees Federation of South India (FEFSI), the umbrella body that represents all film technicians in the South film industry neither offers to take life insurance policies in its members’ names, as a standard union or co-operative society practice, nor does it lobby with the Producers Council or the Producer’s Guild to mandate inserting workers’ compensation packages into the contracts technicians sign with a production company.

With more industry stakeholders committed to passing the buck by opting to blame the inefficiency on the part of Indian 2 production unit for operating an industrial crane with an “under-qualified operator”, as a causative factor in the tragedy, than opening up avenues to discuss constructively the ways and means to improve the safety of film technicians and contractual staff, it would appear that safe working environment in Tamil cinema is a target that is miles away.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/j7ksyk/article30887790.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VEERU,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-indian-2-tragedy-how-safe-is-it-to-work-on-the-sets-of-kollywood-films/article30887791.ece
155,2020/02/22,"A.R. Rahman: ‘Even I would wear a burqa if possible, it would be so easy to go shop, find steady life’","The composer praised his daughter Khatija’s temperament in responding to the criticism that came for her choice of clothing, and that he was awestruck with her simplicity

Last week, A.R. Rahman’s daughter Khatija responded to Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin’s comments on the former’s choice of clothing on social media, asking why only when it comes to women belonging to a certain faith, do double standards and sudden concerns exist.

Khatija’s post went viral and the youngster received a lot of praise for the manner in which she handled the criticism.

Now, her father, composer A.R. Rahman has commented on the issue, talking to The Quint.

In an interview, Rahman said what mattered while raising children was that they were made aware of the good and bad of their parents and that they would inherit both from them. He added that the children must know about the troubles and problems of the parents.

“And then, they are given free will and she did it and then I asked her, What about the next question? Did you answer that?’ (She said) that’s it daddy, I am done.”

He added that Khatija did not consult the family before putting out a reply. He added that he amplified her statement through his social media, and stated that wearing a burqa was her choice.

He said that wearing a burqa may also be to shun fame. “It may be because she sang a song (titled Ahimsa) and around 10 million people were having it as their ringtone. If you take a little kid who is an introvert and suddenly people are spamming them with good and bad, anybody would shut off,” he said.

Rahman concluded by adding that even he would wear a burqa if he had the chance to: “A male is not supposed to wear a burqa, otherwise I will wear one. It would be so easy to go and shop, find steady life. You know, I think, she finds her freedom. Because she is somebody who will go for a funeral of a maid's mother or maid's relative. And I get awestruck with her simplicity and what she does socially.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/oqheez/article30887591.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/rahman,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ar-rahman-even-i-would-wear-a-burqa-if-possible-it-would-be-so-easy-to-go-shop-find-steady-life/article30887592.ece

157,2020/02/22,All present at 'Indian 2' shoot to be questioned,"Crane operator held; CoP orders transfer of case to CCB

The Nazarathpet police on Friday arrested crane operator Rajan in connection with the accident on the sets of Kamal Haasan’s Indian 2, even as a senior police officer said that everyone present at the shoot site would be questioned.

A senior police officer said, “We have decided to question all those who were present at the scene of the tragedy. We have to probe the causes and the circumstances that led to the accident. They will be given witness summons and questioned.”

Three film crew members were killed and 10 others were injured in the mishap on Wednesday night.

The police registered an FIR based on a complaint from associate director V. Kumar alias Bharathkumar. He said that the shooting of the film, produced by Lyca Productions and directed by Shankar, was on for the last 10 days at EVP Film City, and five huge cranes, fitted with heavy lights, were used at the spot. The crane, operated by Rajan, on the night of the accident, suddenly toppled and fell on people working beneath it. Assistant director Krishna, art assistant Chandran and production assistant Madhu were crushed to death and 10 people were injured.

The complainant sought criminal action against Rajan, accusing him of operating the crane in a negligent manner. He also alleged that the production manager, Sundararajan of Lyca, conducted the shoot without adequate safety measures.

The police booked a case against Rajan, Sundararajan and others under various sections of IPC.

On Friday, the police arrested Rajan and remanded him in judicial custody.

District Collector Prashant Jeevan Patil on Saturday issued show-cause notices to four panchayat secretaries for neglect in maintenance of village nurseries as part of the Palle Pragathi programme.

Officials of Gurrampode, Buddareddygudem, Venkatapuram and Kudabhakshpalli were served notices after their work was assessed as ‘not reaching the target’ by the Collector when he visited the villages. Reviewing arrangements for Pattana Pragathi and Palle Pragathi, Mr. Patil was in Devarakonda division speaking to panchayat officials, and explained the various compulsory works and punishments that would follow for non-compliance, under the flagship programme.

“Survival rate of seedlings planted under Telanganaku Haritha Haram must be above 85%, and the full responsibility is on the individual panchayat official,” he told them.

In case a few plants die, officials should immediately re-plant a five-foot plant, arrange tree guard and ensure timely watering. All the nurseries should also bear a name board, he said. Mr. Patil further instructed divisional supervisors for maintenance of registers, placing of plants indent as required in gram panchayats and a follow-up of the same.

Later visiting the Devarakonda municipal office, he inspected sanitation, water and greenery works by regular and contract staff. He reminded the special officers, appointed ward-wise, to visit respective wards to list progress of works, and directed staff in the sanitation department to drive the garbage-collecting vehicles till shortage of drivers is addressed in the division.

162,2020/02/22,"SUV falls into irrigation tank, three dead","Bodies of Sarnenigudem sarpanch’s husband, son and driver retrieved

Three persons, including the husband and son of Sarnenigudem village sarpanch, were found dead in the SUV that had fallen into an irrigation tank, which was retrieved here on Saturday.

Ramannapet police identified the three victims as Sarnenigudem sarpanch Rani’s husband Dharne Madhu, their nine-year-old son Manikanta and vehicle driver N. Sridhar Reddy.

The three had reportedly left home on Friday evening to attend a function in the next village and did not return. Ms. Rani, who spoke to them last was told that they were nearing home, but minutes later all the phones went unreachable. Panicked by the unusual delay and not being able to reach them she approached the Ramannapet police station and lodged a petition.

The police swung into action early on Saturday and gathered CCTV footage from nearby sites to find any last seen locations of the SUV.

Fast-moving vehicle

According to the police, they found an indication that the fast-moving SUV left towards Vellanki road, which lay along an irrigation tank, but did not exit from the main road. At around 10.45 a.m., after firming up their suspicion that the vehicle might have plunged into the tank, police began search operations and found the SUV.

Soon police officials and villagers employed an earth mover and pulled the vehicle out of the tank. All the three were found dead and the bodies were shifted to the Ramannapet Area Hospital for post-mortem.

Support promised

Nakrekal MLA Chirumarthi Lingaiah supervised the rescue operations with villagers and police. Expressing grief at the loss, he assured that the family would be supported and compensated.

A pall of gloom descended on Sarnenigudem village with the arrival of the bodies, later in the evening.

Ramannapet police suspect that the SUV plunged into the tank due to its speed, poor lighting in the area, road condition and absence of caution signboards.

164,2020/02/22,Adequate water to quench thirst of wild animals in Kawal Tiger Reserve,"No man-animal conflict foreseen on account of water, say officials

The worrisome man-animal conflict in Kawal Tiger Reserve (KTR) on account of water seems to be a thing of the past. There was no incident of wild animals straying into human habitations for water last year and it will hold good for the current season too as there is enough water for them to tide over the harsh summer in the Reserve, which is spread over 893 sq km of core area and 1,122 sq km of buffer. The Tiger Reserve covers areas in Adilabad, Kumram Bheem Asifabad, Mancherial and Nirmal districts, which had once formed undivided Adilabad.

Water will be available for a comparatively longer period in natural water bodies thanks to a prolonged monsoon and also due to the intensified efforts of the Reserve management in making it available through artificially created water holes.

There is water still flowing in the Kadem canal which cuts through the KTR core area and the recent release of water in Saraswati canal from Sri Ram Sagar Project also resulted in water being available from Khanapur in Nirmal district to to Luxettipet in Mancherial.

Water holes

“The high point of construction of artificial water holes in the Reserve this season is the huge saucer pits, 5 m in diameter, meant for the large herds of bisons. As many as 22 of these, each with a capacity to hold a tanker full of water, have been constructed at strategic locations in Mancherial, Jannaram and Kadem in addition to the existing ones which are half the size,” disclosed KTR Field Director C.P. Vinod Kumar as he discussed the water situation in the Reserve.

“Bisons are large animals and move in herds of 15 to 18 requiring enormous quantum of water to quench their thirst. The larger saucer pits will meet that requirement,” the Field Director added as he pointed out at the saturation level of works undertaken to provide water to the wild animals.

165,2020/02/22,Model police station to ensure staff stay fit,"Gym inaugurated in Chopadandi model police stations; all police stations to get fitness equipment

The eighth best police station in the country, according to the ranking by Union Home Ministry, the Chopadandi Model Police Station has added another feature.

A gym well equipped with physical fitness training equipment was inaugurated by Karimnagar Commissioner of Police V. B. Kamalasan Reddy at the model police station in the district on Saturday.

The gym was set up at a cost of ₹2.5 lakh in the police station as part of the infrastructure required for the maintenance of the police personnel fitness programme. Though the police station has a badminton court the police personnel and officers were unable to utilise it when the weather was inclement.

To overcome the problems of weather, the police department built a room for the gym on the police station premises and provided necessary equipment like treadmill, cross-trainer, weights, dumb-bells, fitness ball, yoga mats and skipping ropes, among others.

The focus on fitness with some equipment being made available had motivated the police personnel posted at the rural police station to include physical fitness into their lifestyle. This has also helped them improve their performance of duty, an official said.

Talking to The Hindu on Saturday, Commissioner of Police VB Kamalasan Reddy said that the ultimate requirement of any police personnel for policing is to remain fit and healthy. If there is no fitness of the cop, it would definitely affect his performance and interaction with the people visiting the police station. If a cop is allowed to spend some time in the gym at his workplace it would definitely bring a lot of change among the attitude of the cops and also his performance of duties, he stated.

The Commissionerate of Police had made it mandatory for all the police personnel to keep fit and started imparting training in Krav Maga, the Israeli self-defence training, martial arts and yoga. Now, the Police Commissionerate decided to set up gyms in all police stations in a phased manner to help the cops spend some time in the gym and remain fit and healthy.

Accordingly, in the first phase, they would set up gyms in the model police stations such as LMD, Jammikunta, Ramadugu, Gangadhara, Karimnagar Three town and Karimnagar Two town police stations as and when the funds are available. Later, they would take up setting such facilities in traffic police station also, the CP added.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/kr9sb5/article30889335.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY23CHOPADANDI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/model-police-station-to-ensure-staff-stay-fit/article30889336.ece
166,2020/02/22,"Smart, innovative solutions to real-world problems","120 students from State take part in ‘Innovation Yatra’

Tom Cruise-starrer Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol has inspired a third year computer science student of SR Engineering College, Warangal, to develop a device for assisting the visually-impaired in operating a cellphone.

An innovation by Md. Shairose Ahmed, the ring-like gadget was sampled by Sangareddy Collector M. Hanumantha Rao, who put it on the index finger of his right hand, to check its functioning. He was asked to speak into it and voila, it soon connected to his phone. The young student showed how one can answer calls and send text messages easily by giving instructions to the gadget.

Mr. Ahmed was one of the 30 students who visited the district headquarters on Friday as part of ‘Innovation Yatra’ where budding innovators discussed their creations.

The four-day yatra, organised by TS Innovation Cell, Grama Bazaar and KULT, a student-run organisation based in Warangal, is aimed at creating awareness among innovators on real-time issues that need to be addressed. Four teams travelled on four routes — Warangal, Khammam, Adilabad and Gadwal — from February 19 to conclude on February 22. As many as 120 students from different colleges are participating. They met innovators in rural areas to know how they turned their ideas into products.

“In second year, we had to work on a project based on problems of the visually-impaired and address them. My team and I found that handling cellphone is a problem for them. When we watched Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, we saw a character using a gadget like this and thought of creating something on those lines. That gave birth to MH-FICTIO or Make Happen Fiction). Our product will be in the market, hopefully, in next six months,” said Mr. Ahmed, the founder-CEO of MH-FICTIO Creations.

Wildlife officials investigated the blood smears from the carcasses and the samples have been sent to a laboratory in Kolkata.

""The rhinos were found dead between February 18 and 21. We have found no signs of foul play. The veterinarians think anthrax could be the killer but our department is not saying anything as of now,"" said Ujjwal Ghosh, North Bengal's Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife).

Anthrax is a rare but serious bacterial illness that mainly attacks animals. The eastern and north-eastern parts of India have registered odd cases of anthrax, said officials.

The 216.51 sq. km national park in Alipurduar district has around 250 one-horned rhinos. Another 50 rhinos are in Gorumara National Park in Jalpaiguri district.

""Apart from proper disposal of carcasses and sanitising the areas where the rhinos were found dead, it is important to find out the source of anthrax, if confirmed. We advise vaccination of cattle and elephants used by the forest department,"" said Bibhav Talukdar, chief of Assam-based NGO Aaranyak that handles a few wildlife projects in West Bengal.

The Enforcement Directorate on Wednesday conducted searches at 12 locations in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh in connection with the “Bike Bot” scheme scam, in which about 2.25 lakh investors were allegedly cheated on the pretext of huge returns.

The searches were carried out at different places in Delhi, Noida and Lucknow, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The case pertains to a motorcycle taxi service scheme launched by a Greater Noida-based company, Garvit Innovative Promoters Limited.

The company directors and other office-bearers face allegations of cheating people of over ₹3,000 crore in several States, including Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, an official said. The ED is probing the alleged diversion of funds by them.

In 2018, the accused persons had offered a scheme under which people were asked to invest ₹62,100 per motorcycle taxi for an assured monthly return, apart from doubling the amount of investment in a year.

Following complaints from investors, the Uttar Pradesh Police registered more than 60 cases and arrested those involved in the alleged scam. Among those arrested was the company's owner, Sanjay Bhati.

The Delhi Police’s Economic Offences Wing has also registered a case.

The investigating agencies found that over 150 luxury cars were bought in the company's name and gifted. They seized more than 100 motorcycles and eight luxury cars.

A ‘Trump platter’, comprising signature dishes from ITC Maurya’s restaurant Bukhara with a little customisation, is likely to be laid out for U.S. President Donald Trump during his maiden visit to India, sources said.

The Bukhara restaurant, which has hosted several heads of states, including former U.S. presidents, and has not altered its menu for the last 41 years.

Like his predecessors, Mr. Trump is likely to dine at the iconic restaurant where a ‘Trump platter’ is likely to be laid out for him. It will be customised according to his taste, the sources said.

The hotel, however, has not revealed anything about the arrangements made for Mr. Trump, including the food.

Barack Obama had visited India twice in 2010 and 2015 as the president and he was served the ‘Obama platter’ Since then, the dish has become a part of the menu and is also very popular among the guests.

The Obama platter consists of tandoori jhinga, machhli tikka, murg boti Bukhara and kebabs.

When Bill Clinton had visited Bukhara as the president, the hotel had introduced “Clinton platter” and “Chelsea platter”.

Bukhara’s dishes are mainly tandoor based and has an assortment of kebabs, the signature ‘Dal Bukhara’ and breads like ‘Khasta Roti’, ‘Bharwan Kulcha’

Mr. Trump is also likely to be gifted an apron with a painting of M F Husain.

Legend has it that Mr. Husain was so impressed with Bukhara that he painted his trademark horse on his canvas while having food at the restaurant.

This trademark horse has been replicated on the aprons that are given as mementos to the guests. These aprons will also be presented to the Trumps, the sources said.

When Mr. Obama had stayed at the ITC Maurya in 2015, he was served food from the hotel’s roof top European restaurant WestView where he dined with top CEOs from India and U.S. on January 26. The dinner was hosted at the Grand Presidential Floor.

Hitting out at AIMIM leader Waris Pathan over his ‘15 crore Muslims can be heavy on 100 crore’ remark, Maharashtra BJP legislator Girish Vyas has said he should remember what happened in Gujarat.

Mr. Vyas, who is an MLC and a BJP spokesperson, also urged the Muslim community to boycott people like Mr. Pathan and “teach them a lesson“.

“The youths and patriots of this country and each worker of the BJP are ready to give a befitting reply to Waris Pathan in the same language he has used,” Mr. Vyas said on Friday.

“We are tolerant and patient, but this not does mean that we cannot deal with them. Remember Gujarat, the incidents happened in Kalupur. If they take that into account...I feel the Muslims there today do not dare to rise again,” he said.

Mr. Vyas was apparently referring to the 2002 post-Godhra riots in Gujarat, in which over 1,000 people, mostly of the minority community, were killed.

“Maharashtra Chief Minister (Uddhav Thackeray) should take action against Pathan for sedition and the Indian government should send him to Pakistan,” he added.

Mr. Vyas, who is from Nagpur, dared Mr. Pathan to come to his city.

“We will make proper arrangement for you. Do you think we are wearing bangles? We are ready to deal with you. But we feel that there should not be any disharmony in the society,” he said.

“We request the Muslim community to boycott such people. The community should teach a proper lesson to those who are trying to create disharmony in the society,” Mr. Vyas added.

While addressing an anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) rally at Kalaburagi in North Karnataka on February 16, Pathan had allegedly said, “We have to move together. We have to take Azadi (freedom), things that we don’t get by asking, we have to take it by force, remember it...(We may be) 15 crore, but are heavy on 100 (crore), remember it.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mvn2kh/article30889186.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI11122014000293A,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/remember-what-happened-in-gujarat-bjp-mlc-to-aimim-leader/article30889187.ece

The Geological Survey of India (GSI) on Saturday said there has been no discovery of gold deposits estimated to be around 3,000 tonnes in Sonbhadra district of Uttar Pradesh, as claimed by a district mining official.

“Such data was not given by anybody from GSI.... GSI has not estimated such kind of vast resource of gold deposits in Sonbhadra district,” GSI Director General (DG) M Sridhar told PTI in Kolkata this evening.

“We share our findings regarding any resources of ore after conducting survey with the state units.... We (GSI, Northern Region) had carried out work in that region in 1998-99 and 1999-2000. The report was shared with UP DGM for information and further necessary action,” he said.

The exploration works of the GSI for gold was not satisfactory and the results were not encouraging to come up with major resources for gold in Sonbhadra district, he added.

Sonbhadra district mining officer K K Rai had said on Friday that the gold deposits were found in Son Pahadi and Hardi areas of the district.

The deposits in Son Pahadi are estimated to be around 2,943.26 tonnes, while that at Hardi block are around 646.16 kilogram, the official said.

Rejecting the claim, Mr. Sridhar said that in its report after exploration in the district “the GSI has estimated a probable category resource of 52,806.25 tonnes of ore with 3.03 grams per tonne gold (average grade) for a strike length of 170m in Sub- Block-H, Son Pahadi of Sonbhadra district of Uttar Pradesh"".

“The mineralised zone having an average grade of 3.03 grams per tonne of gold is tentative in nature and the total gold which can be extracted from the total resource of 52,806.25 tonnes of ore is approximately 160 kg and not 3,350 tonnes as mentioned in the media,” the DG clarified.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/no-discovery-of-around-3000-tonne-gold-deposits-in-ups-sonbhadra-says-gsi/article30888796.ece

The Bhadohi MLA was booked with six others — his sons and other male relatives — on February 19.

The names were included in the FIR on the basis of the victim's complaint, in which she alleged that the MLA's nephew, Sandeep Tiwari, sexually exploited her on the pretext of marriage and threatened to kill her if she tried to pressurise him to marry her. She also alleged that the MLA and other male members of his family had raped her repeatedly in a hotel for a month during the 2017 Assembly elections.

Ram Badan Singh, SP, Bhadohi, said the probe revealed that only two people were involved in the case — Sandeep, who is accused of raping the woman and threatening her, and another relative Nitesh, who is charged with criminal intimidation.

Sandeep was arrested from a hotel on Friday, police said.

However, the names of the MLA and his sons were removed from the case as the evidence provided by the victim did not point at their involvement ""from any angle"", Mr. Singh said.

""Based on the investigation so far, it is clear that the charges against MLA Ravindra Nath Tripathi and his sons could not be established,"" the officer said.

The SP also told reporters that the woman could have named the MLA in the FIR to pressurise Sandeep into marrying her.

Bandra East MLA Zeeshan Siddique said here on Saturday that the Congress will convince Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to pass a resolution against implementation of Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the Maharashtra legislature session that starts from February 24.

“It is our responsibility to convince him and we are confident of doing it,” he told reporters here.

Mr. Siddique was reacting to the statement of Mr. Thackeray in support of the CAA following his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. While stating that the CAA will not take away citizenship in Maharashtra, Mr. Thackeray said he was opposed to the National Register of Citizenship. The government will scrutinise new columns proposed in the National Population Register and not go ahead with it as it was problematic, Mr. Thackeray had said.

Mr. Siddique said the Congress was opposed to the CAA and the proposed NRC and NPR. “Mere airing of the views by Mr. Thackeray in favour of CAA does not show there are differences among coalition partners of Maha Vikas Aghadi (comprising of Congress, Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party),” he said and added that a meeting of coalition partners will be held shortly before the budget session that begins from Monday.

“We will make sure that the allies are with us,” he said, while expressing confidence in getting a resolution passed against the CAA, NRC and NPR in the forthcoming legislature session. Mr. Siddique said he promised residents of Mumbai Bagh few days ago of raising issues related to CAA, NPR and NRC in the legislature session.

175,2020/02/22,"My mother’s views won’t make govt. rethink move on Sanskrit tols, says Assam Minister","Himanta Biswa Sarma says the government takes decisions based on facts

Assam Education Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has said his mother’s unhappiness would not make the government reconsider its decision to shut down Sanskrit tols, along with madrasas.

Mr. Sarma on February 12 announced that government-aided madrasas, Islamic theological schools and tols or ashrams teaching Sanskrit and religious scriptures would be shut. He had said these centres would be converted into proper schools as it was “not the duty of the government to teach religion”.

The decision received criticism, the sharpest being from his author-mother Mrinalini Devi who was in January elected vice-president of Assam Sahitya Sabha, the State’s apex literary body. She will take charge in April.

“I studied Sanskrit in school. I love the language that is the root of the Assamese tongue. The government should continue to teach Sanskrit even if the tols cease to exist,” she said three days ago.

“But the government must find something bad in the tols before deciding to turn them into high schools,” she added.

Mr. Sarma reacted late on Friday.

“The government has its own way of functioning and not on the basis of what parents think or feel. It takes decisions based on facts and necessities of the people in general. Almost 80% of the Sanskrit tols have become meaningless today,” he said.

The Education Minister, who also holds the Finance and Health portfolios, asserted that the tols had become “meaningless” and were essentially “factories for mere matriculation (high school-leaving class 10 exam)”.

He added: “Fact is, most tols this year had no candidates for the Class X exams. The government cannot waste its limited resources. The closure and transformation (of tols and madrasas) will happen.”

The closure of the madrasas and tols is expected in the next academic session from April.

Assam has 614 government-run and recognised madrasas. There are more than 900 tols but only 97 are government-aided, officials said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/1eyl0f/article30674816.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BJPHIMANTABISWASARMAMEETECI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/my-mothers-views-wont-make-me-rethink-move-on-tols-says-assam-minister/article30887599.ece

“I lost someone respected, loved & admired by me. Saddened & shocked to hear about the demise of Krishna Bose, ex-TMC MP & wife of freedom fighter Dr. Sisir Bose. Being a part of Netaji’s family, she was a revered social reformer, renowned poet & a courageous educationalist.” Ms. Banerjee had earlier said on social media.

“Krishnadi was a mother to her sons Sumantra & Sugata, daughter Sarmila as well as the whole Trinamool family.

Patrud village in Beed district of Maharashtra has passed a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The gram panchayat of Patrud in Majalgaon tehsil passed the resolution at its meeting held on February 2.

The copy of the resolution has gone viral on social media.

“There is confusion in the society over the CAA and NRC. All the people residing here are Indians, but don’t have any documents to prove their nationality. Hence CAA and NRC should not be implemented in the village,” the resolution says.

A resident of Patrud, Eknath Maske, said, “The population of the village is around 18,000. The villagers were against the new citizenship law and NRC. Hence we decided not to implement these things in the village and passed a resolution.”

Gram sevak Sudhakar Gaikwad said, “The government’s move on CAA and NRC affected the social fabric of the village.

178,2020/02/22,"Two LeT militants killed in Anantnag, ‘hot pursuit’ to continue: J&K DGP","Joint operation held by police, CRPF and Army

Two Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) militants were killed in an operation by the security forces in south Kashmir’s Anantnag on Saturday, taking the number of militants killed this year to 25.

Commending the security agencies for the Anantnag operation, Director General of Police (DGP) Dilbagh Singh said the current “hot pursuit” strategy against militants in Jammu and Kashmir would continue. The DGP’s stress on stepping up operations comes just two days ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to India. Multiple security agencies have stepped up the vigil in J&K on active militants and ‘sleeper cells’ to thwart any attempt by militants to carry out a ‘spectacle attack’ during Mr. Trump’s visit.

Terming the killing of the two LeT militants as “another success” Mr. Singh said the slain militants were wanted in several militancy-related incidents. “One slain militant was wanted in seven incidents,” said the DGP.

The militants were identified as Naveed Ahmad Bhat and Aqib Ahmad Bhat, both residents of Kulgam. The duo was killed in a midnight operation in Gund Baba Khali area of Sangam, Anantnag, and the militants were trapped in an open field. The police said two AK 56 rifles, four magazines, two grenades and one pistol were recovered from the encounter site.

Meanwhile, hundreds of locals participated in the funeral of the slain militants in Kulgam and offered multiple funeral prayers. Spontaneous shutdowns were also observed in Bijbehara and Kulgam.

Hizb militant held

Separately, the DGP said a Hizbul Mujahideen militant, identified as Junaid Farooq Pandit, had been arrested in Baramulla. “Pandit was involved in targeted killings, like the one recently in Laway Pora, Srinagar, in which one police personnel and two militants were killed,” said Mr. Singh. Pandit alias Abu Talha from Pattan’s Hamri area was arrested during a search operation at a checkpoint. “One pistol and more than 40 rounds were recovered from his possession,” the police said. According to the police, about 18 local militants and 45 foreign militants are active in Baramulla district.

The DGP asserted that the number of listed militants had declined in Kashmir. “The number of militants active in J&K is between 240-250,” he said.

Valley Sikhs apprehensive

Meanwhile, Sikhs living in the Kashmir valley on Saturday said the upcoming visit of Mr. Trump had “led to fear psychosis and panic among the community”.

“The whole of India seems to be busy in making preparations for Trump’s visit, but for Sikhs of Kashmir the visit has brought with it fears that the members of community are yet again on the radar,” said Jagmohan Singh Raina, chairman of the All Parties Sikh Coordination Committee (APSCC). “The Sikhs are feeling insecure and they fear that something untoward might happen on the eve of U.S. president’s visit,” he added. In 2000, 36 Sikhs were killed in Chattisinghpora area in south Kashmir by gunmen on the eve of then U.S. president Bill Clinton’s visit to India.

“Sikhs living in north and south of Kashmir need to be vigilant,” Mr. Raina added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/w8ot6x/article30890926.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-anantnag-,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/two-let-militants-killed-in-kashmirs-anantnag-police/article30886752.ece
179,2020/02/22,‘Adopt pragmatic approach on cigarette tax’,"It is directly linked to livelihoods of millions, says tobacco farmers’ body

The Federation of All India Farmer Associations (FAIFA), a tobacco farmers body, has urged the Centre government to adopt a pragmatic approach on cigarette taxation as it is directly linked to the livelihoods of millions of tobacco farmers and farm workers.

FAIFA president Javare Gowda said that the increase in National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) on cigarettes, proposed in the Union Budget 2020-21, will have an adverse impact on the livelihood of Indian Flue Cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco farmers as the tax increase will provide a further boost to the smuggled cigarette trade.

“The hike in tax is a major setback to the FCV tobacco farmers who have been fighting torrential and unseasonal rains this year in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Indiscriminate increase in excise duty on cigarettes will result in reduction in legal cigarette production and this will reduce the tobacco purchases of domestic manufacturers, impacting market prices for farmers and putting more pressure on farmer’s earnings and causing further stress,” said Mr. Gowda in a statement, after a recent meeting with Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sithraman.

‘Encourage exports’

FAIFA has also appealed to the government to include Tobacco in Remission of Duties or Taxes on Export Product (RoDTEP) scheme and encourage exports through aggressive promotion schemes. The government removed tobacco export incentives, making India a less competitor in the global market, whereas other countries like Zimbabwe, Malawi, etc are encouraging tobacco farmers by providing incentives and subsidies, it said.

FAIFA vice-president G. Seshagiri Rao said that the body has also urged the government to take strict action against illegal market and totally curb the illicit trade in the country. “We also appeal that the proposed increase in NCCD is withdrawn and tax stability is maintained on legal cigarettes in order to contain the flourishing illegal cigarettes and safeguard the livelihood of tobacco farmers in the country,” he added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/adopt-pragmatic-approach-on-cigarette-tax/article30884871.ece
180,2020/02/22,AMU teachers take umbrage at Adityanath’s statement,"CM had said that AMU students wanted to burn Aligarh city

The AMU Teachers Association has taken a serious umbrage at Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s allegation that over 15,000 varsity students protesting against CAA on December 15 last year had wanted to burn the Aligarh city.

While speaking on the Motion of Thanks to the Governor’s address in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly on Wednesday, the Chief Minister had said, “I had alerted the Aligarh administration after the violence at Jamia Millia Islamia university. There were 15,000 students of AMU, who took to streets, wanted to burn Aligarh city but their game plan was averted by an alert police.”

The AMU teachers described the Chief Minister’s statement as “highly irresponsible” and “travesty of truth”.

In a letter to President of India Ram Nath Kovind, AMUTA secretary Prof Najmul Islam on Thursday demanded that the Chief Minister’s statement should be expunged as he has tarnished the image of a leading institution of higher education without verifying facts.

181,2020/02/22,J&K land encroachers become owners of large tracts of land,"High Court expresses shock over misuse of now-defunct Roshni Scheme

The Jammu and Kashmir High Court has expressed shock over the manner in which land encroachers in the Union Territory have become owners of large tracts of public land under the now defunct Roshni Scheme.

A Bench of Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice Tashi Rabstan directed the Union Territory administration to calculate the value of the public land which has been illegally encroached under the scheme.

The Jammu and Kashmir State Lands (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants) Act, 2001, known as the “Roshni Scheme” was enacted in 2001 by the then State government.

The objective of the Act was “to provide vesting of ownership rights to the occupants of the State land for the purposes of generating funds to finance power projects in the State”.

CAG report

A 2014 CAG report had stated that the “principle objective of the Act viz. raising of resources for investment in the power sector was not achieved though the State has lost sizeable land”.

The CAG report said that the government had set a target of around ₹25,000 crore for the power project by selling 20,64,972 kanals State land. However, by 2013 it had collected only about ₹76 crore in the actual transfer of 3,48,160 kanals of land.

“Further, after transfer of 3,48,160 kanals under the Act, new encroachments are continuing unabated as the area of public land under encroachment was 20,46,972 kanals in March, 2013 as against 20,64,972 kanals in November, 2006,” the CAG report said.

Subsequently, the scheme was repealed in November 2018 by the State Administrative Council (SAC) led by the Governor after concluding that it had not served “its purpose” and was “no longer relevant in the present context”.

List of beneficiaries

The High Court, which was hearing a petition filed in public interest by a law student seeking recovery of the illegally encroached land, has also indicated that it will order publication of the names of all the beneficiaries under the Roshni Scheme, which now runs at 29,500.

The complete list of beneficiaries were furnished before the High Court only after it had warned that the Secretary, Revenue Department, shall remain personally present in court.

“This status report reveals shocking state of affairs which had prevailed and the manner in which the land encroachers in Jammu and Kashmir have become owners of large tracts of public land by the operation of the Roshni Scheme,” the High Court remarked.

It also noted that the plea for a CBI inquiry into the case “cannot be ignored under any circumstances and shall be examined on the next date of hearing” on March 12.

The petitioner Mr. Ankur Sharma has citing CAG report claimed that implementation of the Roshni Scheme has resulted in a loss over ₹25,000 crore to the public exchequer.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jk-land-encroachers-become-owners-of-large-tracts-of-land/article30884847.ece
182,2020/02/22,"AIMIM is ‘B team’ of BJP, says NCP","Parties unite to criticise ‘divisive’ remarks by former Byculla MLA Waris Pathan

A day after All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader and former MLA Waris Pathan made a controversial statement pitching two communities against each other, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) slammed the party calling it Bharatiya Janata Party’s ‘B team’ which is trying to disturb communal harmony in the country.

The AIMIM’s State unit has distanced itself from the statement and has sought explanation from Mr Pathan.

“Due to ongoing and fearless democratic protests against the CAA and NRC, the BJP is losing the battle for our unity and has helplessly activated their B-Team. We urge people to be aware and avoid such inflammatory separatist ideology,” said NCP’s Maharashtra unit chief and State Irrigation minister Jayant Patil.

The Congress said AIMIM and BJP are two sides of the same coin. “It has been proven time and again that the AIMIM works on its agenda of communal polarisation on the orders of the BJP. Extremism of any religion is harmful to the country and therefore both the BJP and the AIMIM should be opposed strongly,” said Maharashtra Congress committee spokesperson Sachin Sawant.

Mr. Sawant said Mr. Pathan’s statement is similar to those by BJP leaders such as Amit Shah, Anurag Thakur, Yogi Adityanath and others. “The intention behind all these statements is to ensure communal polarisation and to break the country’s unity,” he said.

At a rally in Karnataka on Thursday, Mr. Pathan had said, “We have to take azadi (freedom), things that we don’t get by asking, we have to take it by force, remember it...(We may be) 15 crore, but are heavy on 100 (crore), remember this.”

The Shiv Sena also criticised Mr. Pathan for his remarks. “What is your stature in Maharashtra? The state’s Muslims are with the MVA government. AIMIM is repeatedly misleading Indian Muslims and trying to poison their minds. If such comments are repeated, Shiv Sena will respond in the same language,” the party’s Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut told reporters in Delhi.

Earlier, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) leader Bala Nandgaonkar issued a video message warning Mr. Pathan against making similar statements in future. “You will face the consequences. Forget Byculla, we will ensure that you are thrown out of the State,” Mr. Nandgaonkar said.

Workers of the BJP also held a protest against Mr. Pathan at Byculla, the constituency he represented from 2014 to 2019.

Speaking to reporters in Nagpur, former chief minister and senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis said, “Mr. Pathan should apologise to the nation and the Hindu community. If he doesn’t apologise, the government must take action against him.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/9orwrr/article30884802.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BMPUNEPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/aimim-is-b-team-of-bjp-says-ncp/article30884803.ece
183,2020/02/22,"Programme, not opportunism, is alternative to BJP, says AAP MP","Home Minister is dangerous for country’s law and order, says Sanjay Singh

Senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh on Friday said Union Home Minister Amit Shah is dangerous for the country’s peace as incidents of violence have increased manifold since he assumed office. The AAP leader also said an alternative to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has to be based on a programme, not political opportunism.

“There have been instances of firing at lawyers, students have been beaten up, professors manhandled. The government, which was sympathetic towards Muslim women during the triple talaq debate, is not even talking to women at Shaheen Bagh. Crime in Delhi has peaked since the time he became India’s Home Minister,” Mr. Singh said, during an interaction with the media at the Mumbai Press Club.

“Look at the issues he has brought to the fore. The entire country’s attention is diverted to a non-issue like CAA instead of unemployment, lack of education, inflation, slowing economy. I wonder what his understanding is. He is a dangerous person for the country’s peace and for its law and order,” he said.

Asked about the party’s thumping victory in Delhi against the BJP despite the latter’s campaign with religious overtones and controversial statements, Mr. Singh said his party did not fall a prey to the BJP’s agenda. “The BJP is not good for India. The party does not want to work on anything except communal politics,” he said.

On whether the AAP can provide an alternative to the BJP across the country, Mr. Singh said the alternative can be raised based on programme, not political opportunism. “The Maha Vikas Aghadi government is formed on the basis of a common minimum programme, which is good. A similar thing has happened in Jharkhand. There should not be a repeat of what happened in Karnataka. Cases like Karnataka paint anti-BJP parties as political opportunists and it will only help the BJP,” he said.

Reiterating that AAP will be contesting the civic polls in Maharashtra, starting with the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation, Mr. Singh said it will only concentrate on areas where there is a strong organisational build-up. “In 2014, we fought over 450 Lok Sabha seats but lost deposits in most. We have learnt our lesson. We will contest only where an organisational structure is being created,” he added.

184,2020/02/22,Brus vs non-tribal Bengalis: It’s a clash among the displaced in Tripura,"Following the agreement allowing some 35,000 displaced Bru tribal people to settle permanently in Tripura, tension is brewing between the Brus and the non-tribal Bengali residents who worry that they will become refugees in the State. Rahul Karmakar reports on the challenges to secure suitable land for both

Anandabazar, a commercial centre in northern Tripura’s Reang tribal domain, means Market of Happiness. Given by Bengali refugees from present-day Bangladesh during the Partition of India, the name perhaps reflected their state of mind on receiving a piece of land to rebuild their lives.

But Anandabazar is far from the picture of happiness it was once, since December 10, 2019, when some 150 “miscreants” ransacked and looted the shops and houses of 93 Bengali families. These families have since been living in the barracks, official quarters, and the second floor of the Anandabazar police station.

“This is not the first time we have had to vacate our houses. We became refugees following a series of violent incidents from 2000 to 2003. Some of us left Anandabazar for good. Aren’t we humans enough to deserve a fear-free life and a rehabilitation package similar to that of the Brus,” asked Rathindra Kumar Roy, general secretary of Anandabazar Displaced People’s Committee.

Also Read 34,000 Bru refugees to be settled in Tripura

On February 19, Kanchanpur’s Sub-Divisional Magistrate Chandni Chandran visited the displaced Bengalis to break the news that the Tripura government has decided to stop their free rations and close down the camp in the police station. “Peace has prevailed since the incident that made them leave their homes. The compensation issues can be worked out after they leave the camp,” she said.

Anandabazar is 23 km from Kanchanpur, the headquarters of one of three divisions of North Tripura district. These families, now numbering 117 with more from nearby villages taking refuge, have refused to budge until the State government compensates their losses and ensures safety for them back home.

The homes of the displaced Bengalis are within a 300-metre radius of the Anandabazar police station that has been virtually under siege for more than 70 days. Apart from the barracks, the quarters of some 20 police personnel accommodate some displaced families. “The government has asked them to leave but we cannot use force. We hope these families heed the government. We are trained to take the pressure of policing, but it is difficult when you hardly have a place to take rest,” the police station’s in-charge Keshab Ranjan Jamatia said.

But Sudhir Roy and Ashutosh Das are scared of becoming “soft targets” again. Roy’s house, partly damaged with almost everything from his wife’s jewellery to poultry and goats gone, is barely 50 metres from the police station. “What is the guarantee that the refugees, emboldened by the government’s largesse, will not attack us again,” Roy asked. By refugees, he meant the Bru community displaced from Mizoram and living across seven relief camps in north Tripura for more than two decades now, which places them in close contact with the Bengalis. Although the December attack on the non-tribal people was the fallout of the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, Bengali organisations believe the “outsider” Brus, not their local tribespeople, have been targeting them to occupy their homes.

‘New refugees seen as villains’

The Brus, referred to as Tuikuks by other tribes in Mizoram, are called Reangs in Tripura. They number about 2 lakh across Tripura and form the majority of the 1,09,648 Scheduled Tribes (2011 Census) in North Tripura district, followed by the Chakma and Tripuri communities. The district has 3,34,931 non-tribal people but they are fewer in number across the Kanchanpur subdivision, where Anandabazar is located, and in Damcherra block of the Panisagar subdivision that are under the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC).

Four of the seven Bru refugee camps are in Kanchanpur subdivision and three in Damcherra block. The largest of these, housing about 3,000 families, is Naisingpara and the smallest is Nabajoipara with some 300 families. Both are in Kanchanpur subdivision. Nabajoipara derived its name from the “newcomers”, Brus who fled a second round of ethnic tension in Mizoram in 2009. Their arrival added to some 32,000 refugees who had come after the first wave of violence in 1997.

“Every problem needs a villain. The internally displaced people, removed from their roots and with nowhere else to go, are easy to blame for every ill,” said A. Sawibunga, president of the Mizoram Bru Displaced People’s Forum. He stays at the Naisingpara camp. “We were blamed in Mizoram; we are being blamed now. If extremist groups in Tripura were behind the attacks on Bengalis in 2000, the December incidents were the fallout of the anti-CAA protests where some of our youth may have been involved without our knowledge.”

The Mizoram Bru Displaced People’s Forum was one of the five Bru organisations that signed the resettlement plan involving the Centre and the State governments of Mizoram and Tripura. The others were the Mizoram Bru Displaced People’s Coordination Committee, the Mizoram Bru Indigenous Democratic Movement, the Bru Tribal Development Society and the Bru Displaced Welfare Organisation.

On December 14, the Kanchanpur police registered a case against “26 and others” for the violence during the anti-CAA protests. Among the 26 named were 14 Reangs and 12 Bengalis. There is no clarity on how many of the Reangs are refugees. But locals said all the Bengalis named are members of the opposition Communist Party of India (Marxist), which rules the 30-member TTAADC that the Bharatiya Janata Party is keen on winning with or without the Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT). The BJP and IPFT rule Tripura together. That same day, the State Election Commission notified the elections to the TTAADC. The dates have not been declared as the process to increase the number of seats in the tribal council to 50 is on.

“Given the sensitivity of the issue, we are investigating the cases carefully to identify the troublemakers,” said Kanchanpur’s Sub-Divisional Police Officer Bikramjit Suklabaidya.

Also Read Repatriated Brus in Mizoram demand package parity

The Nagarik Suraksha Mancha, a front formed after the December 10 violence for the protection of Bengalis, believes the Brus are being used in a conspiracy to gradually drive the non-tribal people out of the TTAADC areas where land rights of tribal people are protected under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. “In a bid to be seen as humanitarian, the BJP government at the Centre and Tripura fell into the trap of cleansing the tribal-dominated areas of Bengalis and other non-tribal people such as the Buddhist Baruas. The rehabilitation of Brus from Mizoram is making more and more Bengalis internally displaced but very few, including the administration, are sympathetic to our plight because we do not fit into the narrative of victimised people,” the Mancha’s president Ranjit K. Nath said. He added that the CAA gave the “xenophobic elements” a weapon to create a rift between the tribal and non-tribal people who have been coexisting peacefully for decades barring some incidents in which some Bru refugees were responsible.

Land for Bengalis

The Mancha has blamed TIPRA (The Indigenous Progressive Regional Alliance), a newly formed “apolitical party”, for the plight of the Bengalis. TIPRA is headed by Pradyot Manikya Debbarma, former State Congress president and scion of the Tripura royal family as well as a signatory to the agreement for resettling the Brus in the State. According to the Mancha, Debbarma’s political ambition was making him undo what his grandmother, Queen Kanchan Prava Devi, had done for the Bengali Hindu victims of Partition. On February 9, the Mancha lodged an FIR against Debbarma for allegedly whipping up sentiments against the Bengalis.

“Much of the Tripura kingdom was lost to East Pakistan but the royalty had a soft corner for the Bengali refugees of 1947-49, most of whom were its subjects. The Queen took the initiative to form the Swasti Samabay Samiti (cooperative society), one of India’s oldest cooperative societies, and let the Partition-affected Bengalis settle on 1,000 drune of land in the hills of northern Tripura,” said Agartala-based Pannalal Roy, a researcher and author.

The Samiti allows its 3,500 members to settle on specified plots within the 1,000 drune, equivalent to 4,026.06 acres, without ownership. Members are also allowed to transfer land by paying the Samiti a fee. The arrangement, members said, somewhat insulates the non-tribal people from Sixth Schedule restrictions on land. In a letter to Governor Ramesh Bais on January 21, the Samiti’s chairman Kamal Krishna Nath outlined how the Bengalis have been bearing the brunt of the Bru refugee pressure since 1997. He sought delimitation of the land for non-tribal people besides restoration of land vacated by the Bengalis because of years of violence and intimidation.

“Not only did the government not act on a series of attacks on Bengali people since 2000-2001, it has also not handed over the 1,000 drune of land to the Samiti. A survey done in 1954 revealed that 803 drune had been handed over, which was later recorded in the local administration’s report in 2008. And of the allotted land, our members effectively have 650 drune because of spaces provided for roads, government offices and schools,” Nath said. The Samiti also claimed to have provided about 30 drune for helping the government set up some camps for the Bru refugees.

At Dasda, midway between Kanchanpur and Anandabazar, about 290 Bengali families have been living in a makeshift colony since being displaced by the violence in 2000. “We helped the Brus in many ways when they came but they made us flee our homes. We have somehow managed to survive despite the government stopping relief after six years. Whether the Left Front earlier or the BJP now, the government has shown it does not care for us,” said Arun Chandra Nath of the Udbastu (displaced) Unnayan Samiti on the outskirts of Dasda.

The pressure of the refugees, locals of Dasda said, was felt by the tribal Lushais of the area too. About 60 families of the Lushais — Mizos of Tripura — relocated to North Tripura district’s Jampui Hills during the violence in 2000 fearing a backlash from the Brus who had fled retaliatory violence in Mizoram after a Bru extremist group killed a Mizo forest department employee in 1997.

Who are the outsiders?

“We have no conflict with the local Reangs and other tribes but the government must scrap the agreement and make the Brus return to Mizoram so that we can live in peace again. We have endured the outsiders for too long and can understand why the Mizoram government was happy to let Tripura rehabilitate them,” the Mancha’s general secretary, Diptanu Nath, said.

“Who said they are outsiders? The Brus are our very own people displaced by the Dumboor dam (in Gomati district) that submerged 70 sq miles of prime agricultural land for a power project in 1974 that gave us only 2 MW of electricity. Fate was cruel to them and they were displaced again two decades later from Mizoram,” Debbarma said.

He trashed the Mancha’s allegation that he was fomenting communal tension by consolidating the 19 Scheduled Tribes of Tripura and pitting them against the Bengalis on the pretext of opposing the CAA. The royal family belongs to one of these tribes. “The SC, ST and general caste people have been staying together and there is no reason why they cannot continue to do so despite the Bru resettlement issue. I am not trying to create communal riots, but at the same time, I don’t think it is wrong to fight for your own people. The past 70 years have given the indigenous people nothing. What we need to do is create unity so that we can demand our economic and land rights first and then strive for political rights,” Debbarma said. “Unlike all leaders who have made speeches against me, I have donated ₹1.5 lakh to the affected Bengali people. I am not into divide-and-rule like them.”

The IPFT believes the Bru resettlement would not have been much of an issue had the CAA not come at this juncture. “The tribal groups think exempting the tribal areas from the CAA would not help as a sudden increase in the population of the non-scheduled areas (beyond TTAADC) may eventually impact the resources of the State, including the areas under TTAADC,” said the president of the IPFT, N.C. Debbarma.

The fear is because of the demographic shift over the years in Tripura. In 1941, the tribes made up 50.09% of the population in present-day Tripura while the non-tribal people, mainly Bengalis, were 49.91%. By 1951, the tribal population fell to 37.23%. The 2011 Census showed a dip in their population to 31.8% compared to 68.2% of the non-tribal people.

The Bengalis see a design in the resettlement of Brus to bridge the population gap at least in some tribal areas. “But our people are relocating to non-tribal areas. This is evident from the voters list of the Kanchanpur Assembly constituency that had 5,000 Bengali voters more than tribal voters in 1993. Today, there are 5,000 more tribal voters and we suspect the increase is because of the inclusion of Brus in the electoral roll,” said Shailendra Nath, a Bengali leader of Satnala area near Kanchanpur.

Officials in Tripura denied having included the refugees as voters. Besides, Mizoram is yet to delete the names of some 12,000 Brus who would be resettled in Tripura.

The way forward

What matters most, tribal leaders said, is the determination of the Central and State governments to adhere to the schedule of resettlement of Brus by ensuring the local tribes and the Bengalis do not feel threatened.

But social wounds are taking some time to heal, and the local Reangs seem to be feeling the heat too despite belonging to the same ethnic group as the refugees. There are reports of the local tribes, outnumbered where the Bru relief camps are located, taking bank loans to erect boundary walls around their lands. The police recorded some minor clashes between the refugees and the local Reangs. “The locals were not consulted about the resettlement plan, but we can share our resources with our less fortunate brothers and sisters from Mizoram. We cannot say what will happen in the future, but the original inhabitants must not be affected,” said Jogendra Reang, former president of the Anandabazar Committee. He admitted some cultural differences with the Brus “who have some Mizo traits”.

A big concern is the lack of adequate space in some parts of TTAADC, specifically in North Tripura district where the population density is higher than the State’s average. The Tripura government has assured local tribes and Bengali settlers that their lands would not be touched while honouring the Bru demand of being settled in clusters of not less than 500 families across the State.

“We are looking at slightly degraded forest land and places where they can practice agriculture as well,” said Chandran, the Kanchanpur SDM. On February 18, she issued an order identifying four locations with a combined area of 2,302.6 hectares for tentatively settling 1,950 of the 4,744 families in the relief camps of Kanchanpur subdivision. “During the physical verification, the teams have been told to avoid patta land and ensure the land has road connectivity besides being free from encumbrances,” she said.

A similar exercise has been undertaken in the adjoining Panisagar subdivision where another 1,000 families have taken refuge. The authorities in the two subdivisions have already conducted the physical verification of the Brus living in the camps to find out their actual number. Officials have not recognised families who do not have any document establishing their stay in Mizoram. The population of the refugees is believed to be “much more than the estimated 35,000” but the data is expected to be made public at the time of allotting the land to beneficiaries within 150 days of signing the agreement.

For the likes of Laldinpuia, a 57-year-old inmate of the Naisingpara camp, the final resettlement would be the end of his dream of returning to Darla, his village in Mizoram about 100 km away. He wished the 40,000 Brus of Mizoram, including the 328 families who took the rehabilitation package to return till November 2019, well. “This place has been our home for more than 20 years. We picked up the pieces with refugees from different parts of Mizoram, many of whom were strangers. We are happy with how things have panned out but the sad part is many of us would have to live far apart,” he said.

“It is a pity the Mizoram government could not change its attitude and make us feel wanted and safe unlike in Tripura. We are grateful to the BJP government at the Centre and the State and Bubagra (king in Kokborok language, meaning Pradyot Manikya) for finding a solution to our problem. We have at times been accused of biting the hands that fed us, but we want to move forward, co-existing with the local tribal people and the Bengalis. Having suffered as displaced people, it is unthinkable for us to make others refugees,” said Bruno Msha, general secretary of the Mizoram Bru Displaced People’s Forum. The Brus, he added, were yearning to shed the ‘Mizoram’ and ‘displaced’ tags. “The faster it is the better,” he said, hoping for a Tripura where no community could be held responsible for displacing another.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/6jue70/article30883077.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRUSINTRIPURA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/brus-vs-non-tribal-bengalis-its-a-clash-among-the-displaced-in-tripura/article30883079.ece
185,2020/02/22,‘At Home in the World’: A new book on the artist Gulammohammed Sheikh,"‘At Home in the World: the Art and Life of Gulammohammed Sheikh’, edited by Chaitanya Sambrani, draws on both the artist’s life story and the manifold contexts of his thinking and curatorial work as pedagogue and artist

For over 50 years, no other artist has possibly been as influential as thinker and pedagogue, and as complex in his practice, as Gulammohammed Sheikh. In all areas that have preoccupied him, as curator, writer and painter, Sheikh’s engagement has been essentially dialogic: the interrogatory, even challenging, tone of his letters to modernists of the 70s is matched by his conversational engagement with art that has spanned centuries.

The Lorenzetti brothers of the Sienese school; the Mughal painters Basawan and Mir Sayyid Ali; Kabir and the poet patron Abdul Rahim Khan-i-Khana; the maker of the Mughal muraqqa or accordion book; the craftsman-narrator of the itinerant Rajasthani kavad: these are a few names from the fraternity of thinkers, artists and poets that Sheikh’s encyclopaedic world teems with. On his canvas, they have all found a place which is neither synthesis or pastiche, but a respectful hospitality, where they become part of a larger enactment. Into this mix, add a painterly attitude, of recapturing the delicate translucency of a 16th century Persian atelier’s brush, the poetics of a central Asian landscape that bears witness to poet travellers and Sufi saints, Christian saints and temple cities drawn in the finest detail, and the strands of Sheikh’s painterly inspirations become visible.

A new book, At Home in the World: the Art and Life of Gulammohammed Sheikh, edited by Chaitanya Sambrani, draws on both the artist’s life story and the manifold contexts of his thinking and curatorial work as pedagogue and artist. Sheikh’s humble beginnings in the small Saurashtrian town of Surendranagar hardly anticipate his appetite for a synoptic view of art. As a young student, he assisted Ravishankar Rawal, a doyen in the annals of art in Gujarat, with the painting of a history of world civilisation on the outer walls of a public library. Later at Baroda, and then at the Royal College of Art, his facility to bridge art impulses across centuries was honed further.

Sambrani writes that for over four decades, Sheikh’s work has sought “novel ways of making the world manifest through translation.” In itself, this may seem like an extraordinary claim, yet Sheikh’s central obsession has been with cartographic poetics, transcontinental journeys, with empires, and the voice of poetic resistance.

In retrospect, two broad impulses seem to have guided the artist, who worked with an extreme self-consciousness of his own place in Indian art history, as well as that of the pan-Asianists led by the Tagores, the internationalism of the Progressives, and the looping return to the indigeneity of his peers. His more recent vision of a medieval tapestry of saints, Sufis, imperialists and wanderers seems to stand at odds with the great flourish that Sheikh affected from about 1970 to the early 80s, where he appears as a painter of the city, its lusts and transgressions and the rising pitch of communal violence.

Interplay of time

Just as he worked with multiple perspectives in his paintings, he introduced different emotional registers of everyday life in Vadodara. What he achieves, however, is also an interplay of time, from reverie, a space for remembrance or dream, to the urgent gestures of the momentary, in the same painting. In the more recent ‘Mappa Mundi’ series, the space for temporal reality stretches across millennia: positing Majnun, Kabir, a whirling dervish, or a Christian saint as outside the periphery of the globe, he invokes the journey and the narrative as interchangeable.

India’s entire medieval period, for instance, with its conquests and social reform, may crystallise in the singularity of poet-saint Kabir. Cóilín Parsons’ essay ‘Mapping the Globe’ describes a moment of epiphany when Sheikh discovered the most famous of the mappae mundi, the Ebstorf Karte, reproduced on a postcard — a map that documents “the social, cultural and political landscape, not the topographic landscape.” Maria Kupfer’s essay ‘Worlds Enmeshed’ provides further details of the finding and later destruction of this unique document. As such, the mappa mundi was to provide Sheikh with a cornucopia of possibilities. The space of the globe became hospitable to a transhistorical narrative of his own making.

Seen in this light, the ‘Mappa Mundi’ images mount the terrifying contradiction that the history of the world has moved through the collision of religious dogmas; equally, it is these violently competitive faiths that produce the most exalted art. Sheikh re-energises symbols of classical art: Ram stepping forth with a raised bow and arrow, or St. Francis preaching during a deep personal crisis with markings of blood instead of a cluster of birds. They become redolent with meaning in troubled times.

186,2020/02/22,Fluid art and fine strokes,"Last weekend, art lovers got busy with Fluid art and Mandala art workshop with gusto

Coffee, snacks and something creative. That was the scene at The Roastery Coffee house on Friday late afternoon. Art lovers wielded coloured pens, paints and brushes with élan. Interestingly, the crowd consisted mostly children and their parents, and their friends. With groups of friends huddled in one corner paying attention to fine short strokes, it was more than beautiful to see them patiently sit and complete their Mandala art on black paper bags. Divdrisht Kaur Suri, a Mandala artist from Kolkata along with Ridhima Mundra of Artroom Kolkata, conducted a session to guide them through their art works at the coffee shop.

Ridhima who was overseeing a group doing Fluid art says, “This is our first art workshop in Hyderabad and we are very happy with the response.” The Fluid art session required participants to pour paint on choice of canvas (it was wooden trays during that session), and left to merge with each other giving it a naturally coloured marbled look. “To make acrylic colours merge and create drama, we use a ‘pouring medium’. The pouring medium when mixed with acrylic colours makes it thin, hence allowing the colours to merge into each other (without getting mixed to become a different shade).

Ridhima informs that the colours are non-toxic, in the sense that mixing them do not give out any fumes. “But we still suggest participants to wear gloves in case they have sensitive skin,” adds Ridhima

Mothers and children were seen having a blast while the children tried to outdo their mothers’ creativity. “It is a good competition. I hope they learn to pick up everything after they are done as I do at home,” laughs one of the participant who came with her daughter.

For the Mandala workshop, Divdrisht chose to make the participants design black paper bags with gold ink pen. “It is very therapeutic and beautiful at the same time. I usually make the participants design something that they can carry with them and feel proud about it. Fluid art or Mandala art doesn’t require one to be an artist. Anyone can do it and discover the artist in them,” says Divdrisht.

Both the artists conducted art sessions at various hobby centres in the city throughout the weekend.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/31jgun/article30887758.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym24mandala,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/art-fluid-art-artroom-kolkata-ridhima-mundra-divdrisht-kaur-suri-the-roastery-coffee-shop-acrylic-paint/article30887760.ece
187,2020/02/22,Jegatha Muralidharan of DanceJockey: People want to be more fit but with added doses of entertainment,"The 35-year-old has been in the dance game for more than a decade but her formula for dance keeps changing

The air at HyLife Brewing Company, Jubilee Hills, is thick -- with excitement, not tension. There is an interesting kind of liberty in the movement of the air and the people in the space. A synced-up crowd moves with the rhythm and flow of a beaming woman, mimicking her air-kicks and arm punches. The lights overhead add dazzle to the dance.

The woman leading this organised happiness is Jegatha Muralidharan, the creative director of DanceJockey and one of the primary purveyors of Zumba and other dance forms in the city on a public level. “We kicked off a lot of Zumba here because there was not much happening in that area,” she recalls, “As a student in Goa, I used to do Zumba and then I got a license and when I came to Hyderabad, only one person was doing it and it was just a drop-in class. The demand for more Zumba classes grew over a period of six to seven months in 2011, and it was a natural growth and I found myself doing four classes a day everyday, and some high-intensity events, too. Then I brought on more instructors and that’s how DanceJockey was born. I did not want my name on the branding because it’s a team of people working together.”

‘Something special’

The cultural shift from a more open-minded Goa to a then closed-off Hyderabad was difficult to adapt to for Jegatha. But she stuck by her guns and waited out the rough period. When men started showing interest too, that is when she knew she had started something special.

DanceJockey does not just do Zumba, they have opened their arms to Bachata, Salsa, Merengue, Cha Cha and more. “So funny thing; Zumba came later for me. I’m actually a Latin dancer first! Zumba is based on Latin-style dance and it’s interesting to see how Zumba as a format works because it is obviously a licensed thing, and people are learning more about the industry. In 2009, I started Latin dancing but the following year my then-partner won a major country championship. In Hyderabad, DanceJockey has a lot of events at HyLife Brewing Company, such as the regular Noches Sensuales which always see big crowds. “At the end of the day, everyone should be happy with themselves after a good dance session, and everyone should try different dance forms at least once in their life,” she concludes, hinting at the endorphin and seratonin rushes one is bound to get.

At 35, Jegatha says her intense schedule is what keeps her feeling and looking fresh. It is also the added pressure of a competitive market now -- definitely not what it used to be ten years ago. “You have to be on top of the newer dances coming into the industry,” she explains. Indeed, with the advent of social media, dance has been received differently, and people want to be more fit but with added doses of entertainment. So the demand for dance has not only grown but also diversified.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/2jemf1/article30888102.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy21-jegatha2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/jegatha-muralidharan-dancejockey-hyderabad/article30888106.ece
188,2020/02/22,City to get second animal birth control centre,"The new facility at Ondipudur to have more than 10 rooms

In an effort aimed at controlling the stray dog population in the city, the Coimbatore Corporation will soon throw open its second animal birth control (ABC) centre in Ondipudur.

A Corporation official overseeing the development said that having almost completed the centre’s construction, the civic body had applied to the Tangedco for power connection. Meanwhile, it was also working to supply water.

The Corporation was forced to construct the new centre in Ondipudur after it had to close down the centre in Ukkadam in March 2017, following opposition from the residents there. The residents had complained that the dogs housed there were troubling the residents. And, a few dogs also ventured out of the centre to trouble motorists at night.

After closing down the centre, the Corporation began scouting for a land and finally settled for 50 cents near the Ondipudur sewage treatment plant and the construction began in 2019.

The official said the centre had more than 10 rooms to house the dogs, accommodate workers, an operation theatre and for storing medical equipment.

Kalpana Vasudevan of People for Animals Unit II, who was earlier using the Ukkadam ABC centre, said she had sought a few additional details which the Corporation had promised to look in to.

She had asked the Corporation to shift some of the materials lying idle at the Ukkadam centre to Ondipudur to start using the centre at the earliest.

She was looking at operating 20 to 25 stray dogs a month in a few months after starting ABC work.

Initially she would start with half the targeted number and gradually increase the number. But for her to increase the number of dogs to be operated, the Corporation should give her at least ₹ 700 a dog.

The Corporation had thus far given her only ₹ 445 a dog, which was insufficient, she pointed out.

The Corporation official said only after the Ondipudur ABC centre’s inauguration, the Corporation would think about dividing the five zones in the city between the two NGOs working on ABC.

Earlier, PFA Unit II had four zones and the Humane Animal Society, which operates from the Seeranaickenpalayam Centre, a zone – West.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/tjfxg8/article30891792.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB23-BIRTHCONTROLCENTRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/city-to-get-second-animal-birth-control-centre/article30891793.ece
189,2020/02/22,"Sustainability, the new tagline for Tiruppur t-shirts","Tiruppur as a cluster has invested in 1,600 MW of wind and solar energy, recycles waste water in processing units, and has zero liquid discharge systems

Use of recycled fibres and fabrics and green initiatives are now being discussed to a great extent among garment exporters in Tiruppur, as overseas brands talk about sustainable product ranges.

Sulochana Cotton Spinning Mills in Tiruppur got into PET bottle recycling almost a decade ago. Used and thrown away PET bottles were collected and processed for fibre and this was spun into yarn. The company, which has knitting and garmenting facilities too, is now in the process of adopting a technology that will enable its overseas buyers and customers to trace the raw materials and processes involved in bringing out the product and an assurance that the synthetic yarn is from recycled fibre.

Sulochana is getting ready to launch on a commercial scale ‘Polycycle’, a branded process to trace the entire supply chain, from picking the bottles to making of garments from the recycled fibre yarn, through block chain.

Kaushik Krishnakumar, joint managing director of Sulochana, says that garment brands in the United States and the European Union are showing increasing interest in sustainable products, especially for the last two years. The traceability feature that the company will offer its buyers is a value addition to the sustainable garments that they will source. “We have been in touch with buyers and there are all for it. What they want to know is when we will go commercial with the product,” he says.

And, on the sustainability part, the company speaks of use of zero water for processing, complete use of renewable energy, etc.

Syndicate Impex, another garment manufacturing firm in Tiruppur, has launched Ecohike, a range of knitwear collections made entirely of fibre from recycled PET bottles and recycled textile fabrics.

A. Kathiresan, one of the directors at Syndicate, says the company launched sustainable garments six months ago and plans to take it to the Scandinavian countries by the end of this year. “There are several factors in the process of making a garment and in the materials used that make it sustainable. We plan to buy back the used garments of our brand so that we can recycle it. This will ensure that the t-shirts do not go to the land fills,” he says. The uniqueness of Ecohike t-shirts is that each one is made from 12 recycled PET bottles, saves water, emits 70 % less carbon dioxide during the manufacture process, and 250 grams of landfill is saved, according to the company.

Sulochana and Syndicate are not the only companies in Tiruppur that are investing in sustainability. As apparel brands in the European Union and the US announce plans for sustainable product ranges, suppliers are looking at ways to make their products meet the buyer demand.

The world market is talking of sustainable manufacturing process and products. “Knowingly or unknowingly, Tiruppur has scaled high on this front,” says Raja Shanmugham, president of Tiruppur Exporters’ Association.

Tiruppur as a cluster has invested in 1,600 MW of wind and solar energy, recycles waste water in processing units, and has zero liquid discharge systems. Hence, the cluster itself has sustainability advantage and individual companies are taking it forward through separate initiatives. The Association is trying to bring sustainability brand to the entire cluster. This will also ensure continuous flow of orders to the cluster, he says.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/b0iuzj/article30888202.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22FEBTH-TIRUPUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/sustainability-the-new-tagline-for-tiruppur-t-shirts/article30888204.ece

The construction sector will see tremendous growth in the coming years because of various reasons, A.V. Dharmakrishnan, Chief Executive Officer of Ramco Industries, said here on Friday.

Inaugurating Build Intec 2020 and Water Intec 2020, organised by Coimbatore District Small Industries Association, he said that urbanisation, higher disposable income, investment in infrastructure development, and industrial constructions would bring opportunities to the construction sector. The large construction firms tend to outsource some of their works and micro, small, and medium-scale enterprises that can excel and deliver will get orders from these firms.

M. Jagadeesan, Deputy Inspector General of Registration, Coimbatore, explained how the online registration of documents facility in the State enabled the public to prepare their document, upload it from home, make digital payment, and take appointment online for registration of any document.

Chairman of the event G. Rammohan said the exhibition had 227 participants displaying a wide variety of construction materials, new technologies, and furniture. A concurrent event, Water Intec 2020, organised for the first time this year has participants who are into water treatment, waste water recycling, reverse osmosis, etc. Spread over an exhibition area of one lakh sq.ft, the event is expected to generate ₹200 crore business this year.

Some of the participants have lined up product launches too.

President of CODISSIA R. Ramamurthy said the exhibition would help in creating awareness on the new products and technologies, bring in investments, and technology transfer.

196,2020/02/22,Ranji Trophy | It’s Gaja’s day out against Goa,"His five-for gives Gujarat the upper hand

Chintan Gaja (5/19) recorded his second five-wicket haul in Ranji Trophy knockouts as Gujarat literally rolled over Goa on the third day of the Ranji Trophy quarterfinal here on Saturday.

Gaja wreaked havoc in Goa’s inferior line-up as it took Gujarat less than 42 overs in an extended morning session to claim the remaining eight wickets and wind up Goa’s first innings for a paltry 173.

Despite a gigantic 429-run lead and instead of going for an early finish by making Goa follow on, Gujarat preferred to rub salt into Goa’s wounds by letting its out-of-form players to get some runs.

Useful partnership

While Priyank Panchal (37, 58b, 6x4) wasted yet another start when he shouldered one from military medium pacer Suyash Prabhudesai to see his off-stump being uprooted, Samit Gohel (70 n.o., 143b, 9x4) and Bhargav Merai (49 not out, 89b, 5x4) added 86 for the second wicket to help Gujarat end the day at 158 for one, an unassailable lead of 587 runs.

Earlier, Gaja, who had marked his First Class debut with a six-wicket haul to star in Gujarat’s maiden Ranji final win in 2016-17, and Roosh Kalaria tied overnight unbeaten batsmen Amit Verma and Smit Patel, bowling 23 dot balls on the trot.

Once Verma fetched a boundary off a tentative punch off the last ball of the fourth over, runs started flowing for the next few overs.

However, Gaja broke the 72-run association by trapping Smit and soon after the drinks break, Verma’s casual whip off Kalaria was well-judged by Axar Patel on the long-leg boundary.

Incredible collapse

That was followed by an incredible collapse in the last half hour before scheduled lunch, with Gujarat taking five wickets for eight runs in 32 balls to leave Goa reeling at 145 for nine — from 137 for four — prompting an extension.

Fittingly, in the last over before the break, Gaja enticed last-man Vijesh Prabhudesai to an edge to Parthiv, who minutes earlier became only the fifth wicketkeeper to record 300 dismissals in Ranji Trophy.

The scores:

197,2020/02/22,Women’s T20 World Cup | Devine turns it on for New Zealand,"Taylor excels in West Indies’ victory

Sophie Devine led from the front, smashing an unbeaten 75 for her sixth straight T20 half-century, to guide New Zealand to a seven-wicket victory over another Sri Lanka in a Group A match of the ICC Women’s World Twenty20 World Cup on Saturday.

In Group B, West Indies captain Stafanie Taylor, with an allround display, helped her side to a similar win over debutant Thailand.

In the second match, openers Chamari Athapaththu (41) and Hasini Madushika played unorthodox shots to give Sri Lanka a brisk start with a stand of 60 before Hayley Jensen’s spell of three of 16 slowed down the momentum. Devine hit six fours and two sixes in her 55-ball knock to help the Kiwis get through.

The scores: Group A: Sri Lanka 127/7 in 20 overs (Hasini Perera 20, Chamari Atapattu 41, Hayley 3/16) lost to New Zealand 131/3 in 17.4 overs (Sophie Devine 75 n.o.). Group B: Thailand 78/9 in 20 overs (Nannapat Koncharoenkai 33, Stafanie Taylor 3/13) lost to West Indies 80/3 in 16.4 overs (Stafanie Taylor 26 n.o., Shemaine Campbelle 25 n.o.).",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/nkf1tl/article30891193.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23SOPH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/womens-t20-world-cup-devine-turns-it-on-for-new-zealand/article30891194.ece
198,2020/02/22,India vs. New Zealand | Ishant can deliver even in his sleep!,"Jet-lagged and sleep-deprived, pacer still leads the attack

All he needs now is a night’s sleep. “A good sleep is the best way to recover,” he said amidst laughter!

Ishant hasn’t slept since he landed in New Zealand, apart from a couple of hours here and there.

He’s jet-lagged and sleep-deprived, had not played for weeks, had battled a grade III tear in his ankle, and arrived in New Zealand only a couple of days before the Test.

Ishant admitted, “Physically I wasn’t feeling really good because of lack of sleep. But I was rather happy with my bowling, and how I had recovered from the injury.”

Demanding phase

Ishant had gone through a mentally demanding phase, getting injured in a Ranji Trophy game and then travelling to NCA, Bengaluru for recovery.

“I just worked on my rehab. I did not have any goals of making this tour in mind. If I got fit, it was all right. If I did not, what could I do? Eventually, I had to bowl 21 overs in two days at the NCA before being cleared.”

Ishant turned in a creditable performance on the second day of the Test here, scalping three.

The senior bowler, he was protective of his pack.

“We have been getting 20 wickets on most occasions, in different conditions. A day without wickets doesn’t change anything,” Ishant said defending Jasprit Bumrah.

He was proud of the manner in which India fought back. “This team keeps fighting till the match is over. At no stage do we give up.”

Being tall, Ishant said, had its advantages. “Tall bowlers can get lift and you have seen how important bounce is.”

Right now Ishant is desperate for some sleep! The thunderbolts will come later.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/7ofogg/article30890917.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23ISHANT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-vs-new-zealand-ishant-can-deliver-even-in-his-sleep/article30890918.ece
199,2020/02/22,India vs. New Zealand | Southee — man for all seasons,"Old-school swing bowler has adapted to the modern game

Tim Southee is a man for all seasons. He never complains, never grumbles, just does his job.

Just as he did at the Basin Reserve here on the first two days, scalping four.

An old-school swing bowler he has adapted to the modern game.

And he can turn adversity — the physically draining task of bowling against the wind — into his strength.

No guesses

Both Prithvi Shaw and R. Ashwin were opened up and castled by this 31-year-old senior professional, with 274 Test scalps. Yet, Southee was wary against making predictions or naming the target his team could face.

He said, “I don’t think there ever is a safe number and so I think it’s just about us putting partnerships together and batting as long as we can. Then going out and doing our job with the ball. It’s obviously going to be tougher in the second innings for us bowlers.”

He acknowledged there had been some turn. “There is a little bit of spin. You don’t usually see that on Day 2 at the Basin. That’s why the first innings becomes important.”

Southee said the run-out of Rishabh Pant was a big breakthrough, “because he can be such a dangerous player.”

The Kiwi added, “We knew, though, if we could open one end up then Jinks [Ajinkya Rahane] was looking to play a little bit more aggressively, which brings us into play a little more.

“Yeah I think the way we bowled this morning was pretty good. To finish the Indian batting line-up like that with two dangerous players in the morning.”

Talking about his swing, Southee said, “I probably gave up worrying about speed a while ago, so I’ve got to rely on other skills. And, I guess, swing.""

World-class bowlers

About Jasprit Bumrah having an off-day, Southee said, “I don’t think there’s anything wrong with him. He’s a world-class bowler.""

On Ishant, Southee said, “He’s been a world-class bowler for a long time. He’s got experience.”

About himself, the Kiwi is modest but is often in the swing of things.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/g0qmoq/article30890904.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23TIM,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-vs-new-zealand-southee-man-for-all-seasons/article30890905.ece
200,2020/02/22,India vs. New Zealand | Classy Williamson propels New Zealand,"Ishant’s strikes keep India in the game; Taylor digs in with his skipper to raise 93 for the third wicket

Kane Williamson picked the length early and played the ball late like great batsmen do. He had the time to essay his shots and the timing to ease the ball between fielders.

Men such as Williamson play with the field, they open up gaps, disrupt bowlers’ rhythm, create opportunities. Yet, his innings on Saturday, the second day of the first Test at the Basin Reserve, ended in anticlimactic fashion.

Quality innings

His strength, the cover-drive, proving his undoing. Williamson could not keep his shot off seamer Mohammed Shami down and was held by substitute Ravindra Jadeja, diving forward. Nevertheless his 89 was an innings of quality and substance.

Yet credit to the Indians — dismissed for 165 — for fighting back. They hung in there, continued to keep attacking fields and hit back in the last session. New Zealand was 216 for five when play reached an early conclusion because of insufficient light.

Earlier, the host was coasting at 166 for two — a potentially huge lead in sight — when Ishant Sharma got a delivery to climb into Taylor (44), who, unable to keep the sphere down, was picked up by short-leg.

The dismissal ended the 93-run third-wicket partnership between Taylor and Williamson. Kohli did well to keep the short-leg.

Then, late in the day, the left-handed Henry Nicholls was held in the slips off an Ashwin delivery that spun away.

The Indians kept the belief. Even after the Kiwis had surpassed the Indian score, Kohli had a slip and two short-legs when Ashwin operated at Williamson, well into his 80s.

There was some turn and bite for Ashwin and, if the Indians can set a reasonable target in the fourth innings, he could be a handful. He bowled against the wind and there was some drift for him.

Off-colour Bumrah

Apart from Ishant, who tested batsmen with his line and bounce to scalp three, the Indian pacemen largely disappointed. Jasprit Bumrah was off-colour.

The seamers should have bowled a fuller length that the Kiwi pacemen had employed with success to test footwork and find edges.

They needed to force the Kiwi batsmen to come forward to well pitched up deliveries and cover for the swing. If they didn’t do so, they would be caught at the crease.

Ishant struck for India when the Kiwis replied; he had Tom Latham taken down the leg-side and castled Tom Blundell (30), who played some fluent pulls and cover drives, with a nip-backer.

And the 100-Test man, Ross Taylor, walking in to a memorable ovation, joined his skipper.

Williamson was already into his groove, stroked off either foot — the cover-drives, the on-drives and the cuts. The skipper was in control.

Taylor had his own methods of coping with the pressures of a personal milestone. He slog-swept Ashwin for a six, and then leaned into a cover-drive off Bumrah.

The mercurial Taylor’s cuts scorched the turf; on view was his bat-speed.

Quick end

Earlier, the Kiwis made short work of the Indians — the host needed just 13.1 overs on the second morning to remove the last five wickets.

Rishabh Pant began with a rousing six, smoking left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel over long-on. However, a poor judgment call from Ajinkya Rahane — he ran without caution after playing Tim Southee to point — resulted in Pant being run-out; Ajaz scoring a direct hit from point.

Then, Southee removed Ashwin off his next delivery, a mean ball that pitched on middle and hit off.

Bowling against the wind, Southee was able to get his out-swingers going.

Rahane (46) did not last long either, unable to take his bat away in time to a Southee ball, delivered wide of the crease.

Comical drop

Despite some brave blows by Shami and a comical drop by Williamson when the wind took the skier away from him, the Indian innings concluded soon.

There were four wickets each for Kyle Jamieson and Southee, a combination of the new and old.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/trrq7t/article30890889.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23KANE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-vs-new-zealand-classy-williamson-propels-new-zealand/article30890890.ece
201,2020/02/22,A wonderful shrine to ‘The Don’,"The Bradman Museum showcases the legend’s memorabilia

The inspiring story of the ‘Boy from Bowral’ is exquisitely captured at the Bradman Museum and International Cricket Hall of Fame here.

With a unique and wide range of memorabilia and photographs, the museum provides insight into the life and times of Sir Donald Bradman.

Visitors are greeted by a life-size statue of ‘The Don’ - a popular photo spot. Among the prized memorabilia is Bradman’s first cricket bat, which he received at the age of 12. Bradman used the bat for nearly five seasons, and needless to say, he scored a ton of runs with it (including a triple century in senior-level cricket).

The collection of photographs, which ranges from popular portraits of his ‘Invincibles’ Australian team of 1948 to more obscure ones of his amateur wrestling days, is impressive.

Bradman Museum curator Andrew Summerell explained that there is a strong Indian interest in the venue. “We get around 30,000 visitors per year, a large number of whom are of Indian origin. Indians know cricket history and statistics inside out; their knowledge is amazing.

“Indians are quite proud of the fact that Sir Don once compared Sachin Tendulkar’s batting style to his own. That was a viral statement of the time (1996),” Summerell said.

Summerell fondly recalled Tendulkar's visit to the museum in 2014, when he was greeted by students from Bowral Public School, Bradman's alma mater.

Apart from Bradman memorabilia, the museum also contains other items of interest like jerseys and caps worn by former and current international cricketers. A dedicated and bigger section on women’s cricket will be opened soon, Summerell said.

The adjacent Bradman Oval cricket ground is where Bradman honed his batting skills. On Saturday, the quaint heritage-listed ground hosted a women’s exhibition match between Bradman XI and FairBreak Global XI.

Former Australian batter Alex Blackwell and Pakistan international Sana Mir were a couple of the popular names seen in action.

202,2020/02/22,Pakistan to honour Darren Sammy honorary citizenship,"The Pakistan government would confer honorary citizenship on former West Indian captain Darren Sammy for his role in bringing international cricket back to the country, the PCB announced on Saturday.

Sammy, who is presently leading Peshawar Zalmi in the fifth Pakistan Super League season, will be given the honorary citizenship and Pakistan’s highest civilian award, on March 23 by President Arif Alvi.

Sammy, who has appeared in the PSL since its inception, played an important role in helping the PCB bring back international cricket to the country when in 2017 he agreed to come to Lahore and play in the PSL final after majority of the foreign players declined to play in the country due to security concerns.

He eventually captained Peshawar to the title in the second final in Lahore.

203,2020/02/22,"India vs. New Zealand | Ishant sizzles, Williamson dazzles on an intriguing second day","New Zealand now lead by 51 runs

Ishant Sharma’s lion-hearted bowling effort met its match in Kane Williamson’s elegance as New Zealand ended an attritional second day of the opening Test against India with a slight upper-hand, here on Saturday.

After another lower-order collapse that saw India get bundled out for 165, Ishant, coming straight back from an ankle injury, took three for 31 in 15 overs despite Williamson’s effortless 89 in New Zealand’s day-end score of 216 for 5.

New Zealand now lead by 51 runs.

New Zealand’s Kane Williamson looks back as the Indian team celebrates after Mohammed Shami dismissed him for 89. | Photo Credit: AP

Mohammed Shami (1/61 in 17 overs), during his final spell of the day, removed Williamson, who couldn’t check an uppish drive. Henry Nicholls’ (17 off 62 balls) struggle seemed to have hampered Williamson’s rhythm.

During the final hour, Ravichandran Ashwin (1/60 in 21 overs), who also bowled beautifully throughout the day, relieved Nicholls’ of his agony with a delivery that had drift and a hint of turn as India skipper Virat Kohli snapped the low catch at second slip.

Williamson looked good as he hit some delightful strokes square off the wicket. The square drive on the rise off Jasprit Bumrah (0/62 in 18.1 overs), followed by a cover drive, showed his class.

In all, the New Zealand skipper hit 11 boundaries off 153 balls.

Bumrah, in particular, was punished by Williamson, who also back-cut him for a boundary and Taylor then punished another half volley through the covers.

There were quite a few loose deliveries on offer from the Indian pacers and in between a few did beat the bat. With the ‘Basin’ baked in sunshine, batting became lot more easier and Black Caps seized the initiative.

Bumrah, in particular, failed to find his length consistently. Either he bowled too full and drivable length deliveries or too short that even Rishabh Pant failed to gather with the ball going a couple feet over his head.

This is where Ishant came into the picture. While he was lucky to get opener Tom Latham out with a delivery drifting on leg-stump, the other opener Tom Blundell (30) had a typical Ishant dismissal written all over it.

The ball was full on the off-stump channel and jagged back enough to find the gap between his bat and pad.

Williamson and Taylor then had a partnership of 93 runs during which New Zealand also got the lead before Ishant, coming back for his third spell, bowled one that reared up from good length and proved to be an easy catch for Cheteshwar Pujara at short-leg.

Once Nicholls came in, Williamson, who was batting fluently, suddenly had a player at the opposite end who scored only 4 off 34 balls.

Looking good for his 22nd Test hundred, Williamson, in his bid to get another boundary, couldn’t check a cover drive and the low catch was taken by substitute fielder Ravindra Jadeja.

Earlier, New Zealand’s debutant Kyle Jamieson and veteran Tim Southee took four wickets apiece as Indian innings folded in 68.1 overs.

Jamieson (4/49 in 16 overs) and Southee (4/49 in 20.1 overs) took four of the five wickets that fell on the second morning with India adding only 43 runs to their overnight score of 122 for 5.

Rishabh Pant (19) started with a six but then a horrible mix-up with senior partner Ajinkya Rahane (46) resulted in a run-out and the little chance of recovery was gone for good.

It was a poor call from the senior player and Pant had to sacrifice his wicket in the process.

Ashwin then received a beauty from Southee, pretty similar to what Prithvi Shaw got, while Rahane inside edged one while trying to leave it alone.

With India at 132 for 7, Rahane knew that time was running out as he played a square drive off Trent Boult to get him a boundary.

Southee then got rid of Rahane when he tried to shoulder arm a delivery that made a late inward movement. Mohammed Shami’s entertaining 21 then enabled the visitors to cross the 150-run mark.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/109hj2/article30887497.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ISHANTSHARMA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ishant-sizzles-williamson-dazzles-on-an-intriguing-second-day/article30887499.ece
204,2020/02/22,Basant Mohanty - 100 and going strong,"Playing his 100th First Class match and closing in on his 400th wicket, 33-year-old Basant Mohanty looks back at his 13-year-old journey as a disciplined servant of Odisha cricket.

Basant has played with two generations of players and has been the most consistent performer for Odisha over a decade.

Helping hand

“It has been a fun-filled journey. My debut was against Bengal (in Siliguri) and my 100th match is against the same side.

“I started with Debu bhai (Debasis) and learnt a lot from him. Now there are youngsters like Rajesh Mohanty, Debabrata Pradhan and Preet Chohan. I can’t be like Debu bhai. If I can be 10 per cent like him it will be great,” Basant told The Hindu here on Friday.

“My debut was memorable - Odisha beat Bengal. For 11 years I played in Group A and B. We were relegated to Group C for two seasons. So helping the team get back to Group B was special.”

In his 100th outing, Basant - who tallied 384 wickets before this match - picked up four wickets.

Basant reflected on his eventful career. “I was a quicker bowler to start with. I became a swing bowler after watching Debu bhai. But, a hand injury in an accident, slowed me down.

“Debu bhai always backed me. He used to give 15-17 runs and take two wickets in 20 overs and I used to take five wickets for 70 in 15 overs. He used to keep it tight and I used to reap the benefits. Now, I am trying to dry up the runs and let others take wickets,” he said.

Regret

Basant, who once made it into the India-A limited-overs squad, has one regret, though. “If I had got a chance in the four-day matches, I could have expressed myself better. Having said that, when you mature, you realise your mistakes. I should have worked more on my fitness.”

Basant is not finished yet. “I still enjoy the game. Let’s see how long I can continue,” he signed off.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/article19966740.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MOHANTYjpga,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/basant-mohanty-100-and-going-strong/article30884918.ece
205,2020/02/22,Ranji Trophy | Relentless Gujarat tightens the screws,"With the lower order too chipping in, it has virtually batted Goa out of the match

The Goliaths from Gujarat had Goa’s Davids firmly on the mat even before the halfway stage of their Ranji Trophy quarterfinal at the Sardar Vallabhai Patel stadium here on Friday.

Despite losing set overnight batsmen early on, Gujarat’s lower order joined the run feast before it declared halfway into the last session of Day Two at a gargantuan 602 for eight. Smit Patel and captain Amit Verma — who survived a close lbw shout off Roosh Kalaria — then avoided a collapse for Goa, which was in dire straits at two down without scoring. If Goa has to even think of making a match of it, the duo will have to dig deeper than the 46-run association they stitched together to see the day off.

Tired legs

Kalaria and Chintan Gaja struck in their first overs, thanks to the Goa openers’ tired legs — they were made to field for a whopping 162 overs. While Sumiran Amonkar lobbed the second ball of the innings back to left-arm pacer Kalaria, Vaibhav Govekar edged Gaja to Priyank Panchal in the cordon.

More than their bright effort with the ball, it was Kalaria and Gaja’s sterling batting effort against a largely hapless Goa bowling attack that may have sealed the deal for Gujarat. Thanks to Felix Alemao’s impressive spell with the second new ball, Gujarat lost both overnight batsmen in the first half hour. While Chirag Gandhi (49, 86b, 8x4) was plumb in front to Alemao after cracking two fours off Lakshay Garg in the opening over of the day, captain Parthiv Patel (124, 172b, 16x4) holed out to long-leg off Alemao’s perfect bouncer.

Hardly troubled

Kalaria then joined Axar Patel at the crease with the duo stitching together a 130-run partnership before the latter perished after lunch to give Alemao a deserved third wicket. In came Gaja and the pair batted without any trouble against the softer ball. So effortless did they appear at the crease that their 116-run partnership came without a single chance being offered. By the time Gaja holed out in the deep, Kalaria had notched up his third First Class ton, his personal best, and Gujarat had crossed the 600-run mark.

The scores: Gujarat — 1st innings: Samit Gohel c Kauthankar b Misal 52, Priyank Panchal c Amonkar b Vijesh 28, Bhargav Merai c Misal b Verma 84, Parthiv Patel c Garg b Alemao 124, Manprit Juneja lbw b Verma 1, Chirag Gandhi lbw b Alemao 49, Axar Patel c Kauthankar b Alemao 80, Roosh Kalaria (not out) 118, Chintan Gaja c Suyash b Amonkar 56; Extras (lb-2, nb-6, w-2): 10; Total (for 8 wkts. decl., in 161.3 overs): 602.

206,2020/02/22,Ranji Trophy | Bengal bowlers restrain Odisha,"Shantanu and Debasish combine well; Basant makes his 100th memorable

Bengal bowlers’ persistence checked Odisha’s progress on the second day of the Ranji Trophy quarterfinal at the DRIEMS ground here on Friday.

Bengal, resuming at 308 for six, scored 332 in its first innings.

Good stand

Odisha benefited from a commendable 125-run partnership between Shantanu Mishra (62, 214b, 7x4) and Debasish Samantray (68, 145b, 10x4, 1x6) before Bengal picked up three wickets in the last hour to reduce the host to 151 for four.

The Odisha seamers restricted Bengal — Suryakant Pradhan castled Shahbaz Ahmed on his overnight 82. Basant Mohanty took three wickets, including that of Anustup Majumder (157), to claim four wickets in his 100th match.

After losing Anurag Sarangi to Nilkantha Das in the sixth over, Shantanu and Debasish showed good temperament and applied themselves for nearly five hours.

The left-right combination, following a period of circumspection, unleashed some classy shots on both sides.

Shantanu kept blocking, while Debasish, Odisha’s highest run-getter, mixed his solid defence with some spectacular shots.

The southpaw drove the pacers fluently and hoisted off-spinner Arnab Nandi for a six.

Nilkantha strikes

They reached their half-centuries in the final session before the disciplined Nilkantha broke the century stand. Debasish lost patience and his wicket.

Bengal roared back when Shahbaz bowled Shantanu and Ishan Porel had Govinda Poddar caught at slip off a rising delivery.

The scores:

Bengal — 1st innings: Koushik Ghosh c Poddar b Basant 9, Abhimanyu Easwaran c Dhuper b Suryakant 7, Abhishek Raman lbw b Suryakant 1, Arnab Nandi c Shantanu b Chohan 24, Manoj Tiwary lbw b Debabrata 4, Anustup Majumder c Dhuper b Basant 157, Shreevats Goswami c Dhuper b Chohan 34, Shahbaz Ahmed b Suryakant 82, Mukesh Kumar c Chohan b Basant 1, Ishan Porel c Dhuper b Basant 0, Nilkantha Das (not out) 2; Extras (lb-7, nb-2, w-2): 11.

207,2020/02/22,SA vs Aus | Agar hat-trick helps Australia thrash South Africa by 107 runs in 1st T20,"After being sent in to bat, Australia amassed 196 for six in their 20 overs, but the hosts folded for 89

Australia left-arm spinner Ashton Agar took a career-best 5-24, including a hat-trick, as they thrashed hosts South Africa by a massive 107 runs in the first Twenty20 International at The Wanderers on Friday.

After being sent in to bat, Australia amassed 196 for six in their 20 overs as South Africa struggled with their line and length and missed a number of catches in the field in what was a sloppy display.

The home side were in early trouble in their reply when they lost mainstay Quinton de Kock in the first over and it became a precession after that as Agar helped bowl the hosts out for 89, a record low for South Africa.

The second fixture in the three-game series will be played in Port Elizabeth on Sunday, before the finale in Cape Town on Wednesday.

“We set the tone in the field, took a couple of sharp chances and Ashton bowled really well. It was an all-round good performance,” Australia captain Aaron Finch said at the post-match presentation.

“The way we attacked the crease and bowled a good aggressive length was really impressive.”

It was a record loss for South Africa in the shortest format and comes eight months before the World Cup being be staged in Australia starting in October.

Steve Smith top scored for the tourists with 45 from 32 balls on his return to South Africa for the first time since the Sandpapergate scandal of March 2018, after which he was banned for a year by Cricket Australia along with David Warner.

Opener Warner’s return was not as triumphant as he was out second ball for four, but Smith and Finch (42 from 27 balls) put on 80 for the second wicket in only eight overs to lay the platform for the impressive score.

South Africa were in early trouble when an excellent swinging delivery from Mitchell Starc uprooted the middle stump of De Kock, before Agar ripped through the home batting.

He had top-scorer Faf du Plessis (24 from 22) caught on the boundary, before trapping Andile Phehlukwayo leg before wicket with the next delivery.

The hat-trick was complete when Dale Steyn edged his first ball to Aaron Finch at slip.

It is the 12th hat-trick in Twenty20 internationals and the second by an Australian after Brett Lee against Bangladesh in 2007.

“I'm not too sure what happened there. The energy was there but the skills weren't good enough tonight,” De Kock said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/jryd2s/article30884667.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AGAR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/sa-vs-aus-agar-hat-trick-helps-australia-thrash-south-africa-by-107-runs/article30884668.ece
208,2020/02/22,Kejriwal dropped from Melania Trump’s school visit,"Deputy CM Manish Sisodia also missing from the list

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia will most likely not be a part of U.S. First Lady Melania Trump’s visit to a Delhi government school here next week, according to officials in the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).

According to the AAP officials, the U.S. Embassy had, earlier this week, reached out to the Delhi government in regard to the First Lady’s wish to see the AAP government’s flagship ‘Happiness Curriculum’ in practice and was to convey the schedule on Saturday. When contacted, the Embassy declined to comment on the issue.

“We were reached out to on Thursday and were in the process of screening not just one but two to three schools which could be a part of the visit,” an AAP official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. “Mr. Kejriwal and Mr. Sisodia, in his capacity as Deputy CM as well as the Education Minister, were to be a part of the programme,” the official added.

“However, on Saturday when we were supposed to get the final word from the U.S. Embassy regarding the visit, it was conveyed that neither the Chief Minister nor the Deputy Chief Minister can be a part of it due to some issues related to protocol,” said another AAP official, who declined to be identified.

Sources familiar with the matter asserted that the Delhi government had been contacted by the U.S. Embassy as per procedural norms relating to preparation of the First Lady’s proposed itinerary when visiting a foreign nation.

“The Chief Minister and Mr. Sisodia were originally asked to brief the First Lady about the Happiness Curriculum, which is the AAP Delhi government’s flagship programme; who will do that now is unclear,” the AAP official said.

Inaugurated by the Dalai Lama in July 2018, the Happiness Curriculum focuses on meditation, moral teachings, and mental exercises, with the aim of turning students into “good human beings“ and is taught to all students of Delhi government schools from nursery to class VIII.

Though there was no official reaction from the Delhi government on the issue, a series of tweets by Mr. Sisodia indicated the AAP’s unhappiness over it.

He said “happiness class” is “the solution to all hate and narrow-mindedness”. “I am happy that Delhi govt. schools are showing a path to the world. And the world is curious to know what we are doing in happiness class,” he said.

Meanwhile, Expressing anguish over the exclusion of the names of the two leaders from the event, Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said it has been the “protocol” and the “convention” that State leaders are present when a foreign dignitary attends an event in their States.

He also said the names of Mr. Kejriwal and Mr. Sisodia had been dropped from the guest list at the behest of the BJP-led Central government.

209,2020/02/22,16 lakh people joined AAP from across country since Delhi polls: Gopal Rai,"The party will launch a mega campaign in 20 states from Sunday

A total of 16 lakh people have joined the Aam Aadmi Party since Delhi polls through its “nation-building” initiative launched to expand the party’s reach across the country, senior AAP leader Gopal Rai said on Saturday.

Right after the election, the AAP launched a campaign on February 11 under which it set up a phone number — 9871010101. By giving a missed call on this number people can join AAP’s campaign.

Mr. Rai said 16 lakh people, including 1,72,269 in Delhi and 1,81,212 in U.P., have joined the AAP using the phone number. The party will launch a mega campaign in 20 states from Sunday.

“The Aam Aadmi Party will pursue the ‘politics of work’ across the country. For this, from February 23, the party will start a campaign to join nation-building campaign in 20 states. As part of this campaign, posters will be put up in 20 states and the missed call number 9871010101 will be displayed on the poster,” Mr. Rai told reporters.

“Posters are being prepared in different languages for different states, so that people can be easily reached through local languages, he said.

Mr. Rai said in addition, volunteers’ meet will also be organised in all states.

“All our office bearers will hold press conferences in their respective states to spread the model of positive nationalism and development which has come up in Delhi, as the politics of work got a place in Delhi,” he said.

He also said coordinators have been appointed for different states for this campaign.

State coordinators include Lok Sabha MP Bhagwant Mann from Punjab and AAP member Elvis Gomes from Goa.

The AAP registered a landslide victory in the high-stakes Delhi Assembly polls, leaving the main rival BJP way behind and decimating the Congress in a bitterly-fought contest. Since then the party has again started building a national ambition.

The AAP is, at present, recognised by the Election Commission as a state party.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/d1riw1/article30889666.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI2172020000090B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/16-lakh-people-joined-aap-from-across-country-since-delhi-polls-gopal-rai/article30889667.ece

216,2020/02/22,Vinay moves ECI against mercy plea rejection,"‘Model code of conduct was in force when Delhi govt. made its recommendation’

One of the four death row convicts in the December 16, 2012 gang-rape and murder case, Vinay Sharma, has moved the Election Commission of India questioning the timing of the rejection of his mercy plea.

In a representation made before the poll panel, advocate A.P. Singh, representing Vinay, contended that the model code of conduct for the Delhi elections was in force when the Delhi government made its recommendation to the President to reject Vinay’s mercy plea.

“A very important question arise that during the imposition of the code of conduct whether an MLA candidate Satendra Kumar Jain, who is not even a legislator, can use the power of the post of Home Minister of the State to recommend the rejection of mercy petition of death row convict Vinay Sharma,” the representation to the ECI stated.

The plea also cited that Vinay was suffering from “insanity, mental illness, schizophrenia, head injury and fracture in right arm”.

Vinay had applied for mercy from President Ram Nath Kovind on January 29, which was recommended to be rejected by the Home Ministry and the Lieutenant-Governor of Delhi on the next day, the counsel said. The President then rejected the mercy petition on February 1.

A Delhi court on Monday had issued fresh death warrants for March 3 at 6 a.m. against all the four convicts. All convicts “to be hanged by the neck until they are dead on March 3, at 6 a.m.,” the court had said.

The order was passed by Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana pursuant to pleas by Tihar jail and the victim’s parents, seeking issuance of a fresh date to hang the convicts.

This is the third time the court is issuing death warrants against Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31). The trial court had issued the first death warrants for January 22, which was later postponed to February 1.

Except Pawan, all others had exhausted the legal remedies available to file a curative petition before the Supreme Court. The President has also rejected the mercy pleas of Singh, Kumar and Vinay.

The four were sentenced to death by a local court in 2013. The order has since been upheld by the High Court and the Supreme Court.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/vinay-moves-eci-against-mercy-plea-rejection/article30884917.ece
217,2020/02/22,6 of a family held in ‘honour killing’ case,"Victim got married against her family’s wish; accused dumped body in canal

In a suspected case of honour killing, six members of a woman’s family were arrested on Friday for allegedly killing her in east Delhi’s New Ashok Nagar, the police said. They disposed the body in Aligarh, around 80 km from Delhi, they said.

The victim has been identified as Sheetal Chaudhary, a resident of New Ashok Nagar, they said.

The police said Sheetal was in love with one Ankit Bhati, who lives in the same neighbourhood. They were in a relationship for the past three years and had got married at Arya Samaj temple in October 2019.

When the family got to know about the marriage, they tried to convince Sheetal to leave her husband, but she refused, the police said.

“On January 30, the parents and other relatives of Sheetal strangled her. They put her body in a car and drove to Aligarh. They later disposed it into a canal there and returned to Delhi,” a senior police officer said.

Later, when Mr. Bhati called her, her phone was found switched off. He got suspicious and lodged a kidnapping case at New Ashok Nagar police station on Monday, they said.

During preliminary investigation, when the police went to Sheetal’s house, they were told by the family that she had gone to her uncle’s house. The police then went to the uncle’s house but failed to find her, the officer said.

The police got a lead in the case after the call details record of her family members were analysed. They were interrogated separately and discrepancies were found in their statements. During sustained interrogation, they confessed to have killed Sheetal, the police said.

A police team went to Aligarh to find Sheetal’s body and recovered it from the canal with the help of the local police.

Her last rites were performed on February 2, they said.

A case was registered and the accused — mother Suman, father Ravindra, uncles Sanjay, Om Prakash, cousin Parvesh and brother-in-law Ankit — were subsequently arrested .",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/m73s1m/article30884914.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL22-MURDER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/6-of-a-family-held-in-honour-killing-case/article30884916.ece
218,2020/02/22,Brief respite as police open road near Shaheen Bagh,"Whoever closed it again has to answer SC, says interlocutor

A road near the Shaheen Bagh protest site that connects Noida to Faridabad via Delhi was reopened briefly on Friday afternoon to ease traffic congestion but closed after around 40 minutes.

A senior police officer said it was nothing out of the ordinary, rather a standard practice of the Uttar Pradesh and Delhi Police to overcome traffic congestion. Only two-wheelers and light motor vehicles were allowed to pass through during the time the barricades were removed.

“U.P. police had opened the barricades to allow entry of light motor vehicles travelling from Noida to Faridabad via a road adjoining a canal. They had asked the Delhi police to open the barricades for a few minutes as they witnessed major congestion due to high traffic volumes during the afternoon,” said the officer.

The officer added that Madanpur Khadar road, the one adjoining the canal, is narrow and cannot handle a heavy traffic load, which is why the police only allowed a certain number of light motor vehicles to use the path. Only motorists travelling to Faridabad were allowed to cross the barricades.

“If we allow all vehicles to pass through, then there will be confusion and chaos as many motorists travelling to different parts of south Delhi from Noida may also enter the road adjoining the canal,” the officer said.

‘Got orders from above’

A Delhi traffic policeman who closed the barricades said he got the orders from his seniors and refused to comment beyond that.

Supreme Court-appointed interlocutors Sanjay Hegde and Sadhana Ramachandran had personally gone to inspect all the roads connecting Delhi to Noida late on Thursday along with some protesters and policemen.

“We went to see all the roads from Noida with police and volunteers. We found that a lot of what you said is true. We asked the police to open the Noida-Faridabad road. They agreed and opened the road this morning. I am very upset to say that the road was again closed. Whoever did it will have to explain it to the Supreme Court,” said Ms. Ramachandran.

224,2020/02/22,Study on real-time sources of air pollution can be done across Delhi: Gopal Rai,"Washington varsity model to be functional by June: Rai

Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Friday visited a Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station near India Gate and said that a study being done by the Washington University in St. Louis to find out real-time sources of air pollution in the city could be replicated across different locations in the Capital.

The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has been collaborating since March 2019 with the university to undertake real-time source apportionment study of air pollution in the city. “Once we establish that the model is a success, the study can be replicated across various locations in the city,” said Mr. Rai.

“We [Delhi government] have 26 pollution monitoring centres across various locations in Delhi. The mechanism in these centres monitor AQI [Air quality index] at a particular point of time in a span of one hour. But the mechanism cannot detect sources of pollution,” he added.

Mr. Rai said that an interim report will be submitted by the university by March 2020 and the model will be functional by the month of June 2020.

Targeted campaign

“We will launch a targeted campaign based on the findings of the report which will help us in identifying the real sources of pollution and to work on reducing the existing pollution levels in the city. Once we are able to identify the real sources, we will be able to take immediate action and balance our efforts in reducing the pollution generated daily by two crore people of Delhi,” the Environment Minister said.

On Thursday, the Minister after conducting a review meeting of the situation in Delhi had said that the government will work to make the fight against air pollution a mass movement, which he reiterated on Friday.

An aim to reduce air pollution to one third in the course of next five years was part of the 10-point ‘Kejriwal Ka Guarantee Card’ released by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the run-up to the 2020 Delhi Assembly elections.

225,2020/02/22,Govt. to deploy ‘mohalla marshals’ across Capital,"Plans are afoot to form SC/ST Women Welfare Cell: Minister

Women and Child Development Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam on Friday said that the Delhi government will deploy ‘mohalla marshals’ and set up ‘SC/ST Women Welfare Cell in the city to ensure safety of women.

Appointment of ‘mohalla marshals’ was a promise in the 10-point ‘guarantee card’ released by the Aam Aadmi party in the run-up to the Assembly elections. ‘Mohalla marshals’ will be a security layer between the police and citizens to help women and senior citizens feel safer.

The Minister met the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief Swati Maliwal and asked her to set up a special SC/ST Women Welfare Cell that will work towards the welfare of women and girls from the community.

“We welcome the idea of WCD Minister and will add a special cell which will work towards the welfare and protection of women from the community,” said the DCW chief.

“We have conducted a pilot project on ‘mohalla marshals’ in Burari wherein Civil Defense officers conducted regular checks in those locations which were the most vulnerable and from where we received the maximum complaints. The results were outstanding and should be implemented across all 70 Vidhan Sabhas,” added Ms. Maliwal.

Commenting on the DCW’s performance, the Minister said: “The women’s panel has done exemplary work in the last three years. In our guarantee card, women’s safety is the topmost priority. The plan is to deploy ‘mohalla marshals’ and strengthen mahila panchayats in the coming months.”

Protection of children

Mr. Gautam also met members of Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) and said that curbing drug abuse and protection of children will be the priority areas. “Women and children are the most vulnerable groups in our society. Special attention should be given to child protection as they are more prone to child labour and drug abuse,” he said.

Mr. Gautam also said that they have decided to focus on early identification and prevention of disabilities. “Priorities will be given for screening, evaluation and vocational training programmes for persons with disabilities in the State,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/528vhw/article30884872.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL22-RAJENDRAPALGAUTAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/govt-to-deploy-mohalla-marshals-across-capital/article30884873.ece

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to furnish a report on a plea seeking directions to restrict the use of chemical pesticides.

A Bench headed by NGT chief Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel directed authorities to submit the report on the strategies to be adopted, within two months.

The directions came when the green panel was hearing a plea moved by Shailesh Singh who sought directions to restrict the use of chemical pesticides citing adverse effects on public health due to contamination of soil.

Referring to a study carried out by King George Medical College, Lucknow, the plea contended that the use of pesticides had harmful effects on the soil and subsequently people’s health.

‘No identified violators’

“Though the issue raised here is significant, there are no identified violators against whom the proceedings may be initiated. In view of the above, without expressing any opinion on the merits at this stage, we require the MoEF&CC and the CPCB to furnish a report,” the Bench said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ngt-tells-govt-cpcb-to-file-report-on-chemical-pesticides-petition/article30884772.ece
227,2020/02/22,"AgustaWestland case: ED, CBI oppose Christian Michel’s bail pleas","He has a nexus with powerful people and can influence witnesses, investigating agencies tell HC

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) have told the Delhi High Court that Christian Michel, an alleged middleman arrested in connection with the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam cases, should not be granted bail as “he has a nexus with influential people and can influence witnesses”.

The investigating agencies, in their written submissions opposing the bail pleas of Mr. Michel, have contended that he was extradited to India with unprecedented difficulty and there is all likelihood of him fleeing from justice, if enlarged on bail as he had no roots here.

Justice Anu Malhotra listed the matter for further hearing on February 26.

Michel, who was arrested in 2018 and is in judicial custody since January 5, 2019, has been denied bail in both the matters by a trial court. He has approached the High Court against the lower court’s decision.

The agencies, in their submissions, said Mr. Michel has “deep nexus with influential and powerful persons and has made inroads in the bureaucracy or executive”.

“There are Letters Rogatory pending in the United Kingdom which have not been executed in light of the deliberate delay. The same shall further be stalled if the applicant is released on bail. It is a matter of record that the applicant has influence in the British High Commission,” they said.

‘Evaded probe earlier’

They added that Mr. Michel had successfully evaded the entire investigation and trial in Italy, which despite being a member of the European Union, could not successfully bring him to face the judicial process.

“There are ample circumstances which go on to show that if enlarged on bail, the applicant would influence the witnesses and tamper with the evidence, thereby hampering the investigation herein, which is at the last stages and which does not solely rest on documentary evidence,” the agencies said. They also claimed that Mr. Michel cannot claim parity with other co-accused.

“The primary purpose of bail is to secure the presence of the accused and to preserve the sanctity of investigation, apart from considering the nature and gravity of the offence and the role played by the accused persons. The release of the applicant on bail, in such a scenario, is liable to be rejected,” they said.

In his plea for regular bail in the corruption case lodged by the CBI, Mr. Michel contended that the entire case depends on documentary evidence which has already been collected by the investigating agency and produced before the trial court.

He has also contended that no economic loss has been caused to the exchequer as €8.35 million was received as compensation by India which also confiscated three helicopters worth €150 million.

The plea said that all the accused named in the FIR are on bail and no other public servant has been arrested or interrogated in relation to any transaction with him.

It also stated that in the supplementary chargesheet filed by the ED, after interrogating him, no role has been attributed to him with regard to change in specifications of the VVIP helicopters.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/by3tqj/article30886687.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE22MICHEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/agustawestland-case-ed-cbi-oppose-christian-michels-bail-pleas/article30884768.ece
228,2020/02/22,Yemeni man with disfigured face undergoes successful surgery in city,"A mobile phone had exploded in his mouth in Nov. 2018

A 26-year-old Yemeni man, whose face was disfigured after a mobile phone exploded in his mouth, regained normal facial features one-and-a-half years after he underwent a reconstruction surgery at a city hospital here.

The phone had exploded when the man, Saad, was holding it between his teeth while doing some work in November 2018, a senior doctor said.

Mr. Saad received some first aid in Yemen but the accident severely disfigured his face and he lost the ability to eat and speak normally.

He wanted to go for a reconstruction surgery to recover but due to the severity of the damage, a complex surgery was required and doctors in Yemen refused to do it, Ajaya Kashyap, Medical Director, KAS Medical Centre, said.

Mr. Saad came to India for treatment due to of “lack of facilities” in his own country, he added.

“The blast was so intense that it burnt the inside of his mouth, tore up the muscles and the tongue leaving all the soft tissues damaged,” Dr. Kashyap said.

“After much assessment, the team decided to use flaps of tissue from inside the mouth as well as fat tissues from his body and use it as a flap. Ensuring facial sensations was another challenge. We are happy that the procedure went well and patient regained his normal features,” he said.

During the reconstruction surgery on February 6, the oral cavity was reconstructed using flaps from inside of the cheeks. The lip muscles which had been split apart were repaired and flaps were used to close it, Preeti Pandya, a consultant at the hospital, said.

Mr. Saad said he was happy after the successful surgery got him his normal facial features back.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/yemeni-man-with-disfigured-face-undergoes-successful-surgery-in-city/article30884761.ece

Students of the Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC), who were on an indefinite hunger strike demanding that the institute make course fees for PG Diploma courses “affordable”, called off their protest after four days as the administration agreed to meet their demands.

Students said that the administration had agreed to extend the last date for submission of second semester fees till March 31 or till the finalisation/notification of the new fee structure, whichever is later. “This means the new deadline for submission of second semester fees is the arrival/notification of new fees structure in IIMC.

A meeting between the students of DU’s Gargi College and the Delhi Commission of Women (DCW) chief Swati Maliwal concluded on Friday.

A further course of action regarding the probe in the alleged incident of molestation on the third day of the college annual cultural fest on February 6 was discussed at the meeting, a student said.

A number of students of Gargi College located in south Delhi had alleged manhandling, molestation and sexual harassment on the third day of the college fest.

A third-year student of the college said over the phone that the students were willing to file an RTI and are looking for a “relevant person” in this regard.

A fact-finding committee (FFC) which is conducting an independent enquiry in the incident recorded and examined testimonies of more than 600 of the students, sources in the university said.

During the general body meeting held on Monday, the FFC had presented its preliminary findings before the students and other members.

The committee, during its preliminary probe, found out that there was a “gross lapse in the overall security” at the fest and that the college had “underestimated” the number of individuals who would attend the campus. Following this, it recommended immediate sensitisation of the staff of the college to gender issues.

“The committee has also found out that the Internal Complaints Committee [ICC] is grossly biased and compromised and a new ICC should be formed as per the UGC requirements by the end of February,” the student body of Gargi College said in a statement.

Two more persons were arrested by the Delhi Police on Tuesday in connection with the alleged molestation. They were arrested under Sections 452, 354 and 509 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, the police said on Tuesday.

233,2020/02/22,Dwarka sub-city: interdisciplinary body sends recommendations,"Sub-group formed on L-G’s orders focuses on regional connectivity, women’s safety

The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on Friday said that an interdisciplinary sub-group constituted on the directions of Delhi Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal, to prepare a “strategic plan” for the Dwarka sub-city has made several recommendations pertaining to regional connectivity of Dwarka, parking issues and women safety.

‘Main issues’

“Main issues being faced by the Dwarka sub-city are that Dwarka is not seen as an investment destination, projects are fragmented, women safety is a big concern and the entry and exit points to Dwarka are congested,” DDA officials said.

Stating that inefficient public transport is another major concern in the area, the committee recommended an increase in the frequency of trains on metro Airport Express Line and decrease in the fares.

“New metro link [is] required to minimise interchange [Sector 21-Palam-Delhi Cant-Sarai Rohilla railway station]. Travel time can be decreased to 45 minutes through rail connectivity by running high-quality Electric Multiple Unit on the existing railway line which will connect Dwarka to Bijwasan and to Old Delhi and Ghaziabad,” the urban body said in a statement.

In a bid to tackle the issue pertaining to Dwarka not being considered as a “desired destination for investors,” the DDA said, “It was suggested that all metro stations in the Dwarka sub-city along the Blue Line be developed as a metro boulevard. Reduction of the dependency of the users on private vehicles by making the areas within 500 metres of metro stations approachable to pedestrians with easy six-minute walk was also suggested.”

The land-owning agency added, “Design of an ‘integrated scheme’ shall ensure ease of amalgamation of plots, freedom to mix uses and flexibility to build edge-to-edge and to create active frontage and finally to provide direct access to metro through pedestrian friendly passages or walkways.”

Officials said that recommendations on developing co-working spaces under the Transit Oriented Development schemes, service apartments, rental housing, entertainment facilities and so on were also suggested.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/y9dkv3/article30886653.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Recommendationscol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dwarka-sub-city-interdisciplinary-body-sends-recommendations/article30884740.ece

Shaheen Bagh protesters told the Supreme Court-appointed interlocutors on Friday that if the road parallel to the protest site was opened, the apex court should pass an order ensuring their security.

“When several adjoining roads are open, why are they insisting that we move from this road? This is not the only road connecting Delhi to Noida,” a woman protester told senior lawyers Sanjay Hegde and Sadhana Ramachandran on the third day of discussions. “We keep hearing about the inconvenience to people but no one asks about our inconvenience here,” said another protester.

The interlocutors called the police to the spot to discuss the matter with the protesters. The police admitted that the protesters hadn’t blocked the parallel road. An officer told the interlocutors and protesters that they had barricaded the parallel road as well as certain other roads adjoining the area as a security measure for the Shaheen Bagh protest site. “If the road is opened for commuters, we will ensure double security to protesters,” the police officer said.

A woman protester told the mediators, “If the police could not stop the men who fired at us, how are they claiming that they will protect us if the parallel road is opened?”

Another woman protester said, “We want in writing that if there is a single incident of attack or firing, the police officers, from the SHO to the Police Commissioner, should be shunted out.”

No Shaheen Bagh-like protest will be permitted in the city, Hyderabad City Police Commissioner Anjani Kumar said on Saturday.

Mr Kumar, who was addressing a press meet, said that in response to a question on anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests which have been breaking out sporadically in the city. He said that in a democracy, while protests are important, more important is the upholding of law and order. Protesters should not put others to inconvenience, he said. Mr Kumar also said that action would be taken against those indulging in flash protests, while also pointing out that 200 peaceful protests have been staged.

Mr Kumar also cleared the air over permission rumours for the proposed pro-CAA rally which is likely to be attended by Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and stated that no application has been received in this regard so far.

In the recent past, police have consistently foiled anti-CAA protesters’ attempts to have a Shaheen Bagh-like space in Hyderabad. At least three such attempts were made since January with the first under Toli Chowki flyover in mid-January. Another attempt was made later in the same month near Khwaja ka Chilla in Moghalpura in Old City where scores of women converged. On both occasions, protests were foiled and several were detained.

237,2020/02/22,March 10 deadline to ready fire stations at govt. hospitals,"To come up at five city hospitals with ample space — OGH, Gandhi, NIMS, Niloufer and Maternity Hospital at Koti

After several delays in establishing sheds for temporary fire stations at government hospitals, a 15-day deadline has now been set to complete the works.

At the beginning of the year, officials from the Health department as well as Telangana State Disaster Response and Fire Services department had exuded confidence that the fire stations would start functioning in two to three weeks, but the process has been delayed.

Recent fires

Most government hospitals in the city have no fire safety measures in place such as hose reels and fire extinguishers. The number of patients and their attendants at tertiary care hospitals runs into several thousands. Disasters are not a distant possibility as minor fire accidents have been reported at hospitals in the past which prodded officials to swing into action.

Having crossed the expected date of inauguration, Special Chief Secretary of Health department A Santhi Kumari held a meeting with superintendents of government hospitals on Saturday where the topic was discussed. The new deadline for completion of the works is March 10.

Over two months ago, a proposal was put forth to establish the fire stations at Government Maternity Hospital, Koti, Niloufer Hospital, Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS), Gandhi Hospital and Osmania General Hospital (OGH). It is expected to be a win-win situation for the Fire Services and Health departments.

Earlier, officials from the Fire Services department had said that they were keen to have more fire stations in Hyderabad as it would reduce the time taken to respond to distress calls. Health department officials, who eagerly approved the proposal, instructed superintendents of the hospitals to identify land for the purpose.

As per plan, a temporary structure will be built to park fire engines at each hospital. Fire-fighters will be allotted rooms in the hospital. Currently, either works are under way or paper work related to it is being processed at the hospitals.

Land-related delay

Though a piece of land at NIMS was identified initially, the Fire Services department requested for land in another location which led to the delay. “It is now approved. Construction works will start soon”, said an official from NIMS. It is learnt that land at the Maternity Hospital at Koti has also been identified.

“It does not take more than a week to establish the temporary structure as it needs iron pillars. The works will be completed by March 10,” said a senior official from the department.

Finance Minister T. Harish Rao told the elected representatives in municipalities that the proposed 10-day Pattana Pragathi programme from February 24 to March 4 was aimed at changing the face of municipalities. He said that faces villages have changed with Palle Pragathi programme.

Participating in the preparatory meeting of erstwhile Medak district held at Patancheru on Saturday, Mr. Harish Rao said that councillors should look beyond politics and only then they will become successful. He said that funds would be released every month for municipalities and 10 per cent of the revenue must be allotted for nurturing saplings.

“This will be a five-year programme and do not expect results in 10 days. You have to do it continuously. Getting unity among the public in towns is not easy like in villages. Identify places for dump yards and grave yards. See that drains are cleared and waste removed. Call tenders for drainage cleaning. Waterharvesting pits must be there for every building,” said Mr Harish Rao while addressing the newly elected councillors and municipal chairmen/ chairpersons.

Stating that committees with women, retired employees and youth should be formed to take up programmes forward, the Minister suggested developing nurseries in towns to have required number of saplings for planting. Informing that suggestion on banning plastic was received well in as many as 26 function halls at Siddipet, he called upon the municipal authorities to implement the same.

Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu has asked the scientists, researchers and farmers to join hands to make agriculture not only remunerative, but profitable in country. He expressed concern over farming increasingly becoming a loss-making enterprise.

Speaking after inaugurating the three-day Agritech and Agrivision 2020 jointly organised by Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU) and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) here on Saturday, he said there was need to create value addition by bringing together farm producers and agro-industry to make the activity both sustainable and profitable. “We have a situation today where farmers are unable to get adequate returns despite phenomenal increase in food production, keeping agriculture as one of the most unattractive vocations,” he pointed out.

Stating that empowering farmers was essential to strengthen the rural economy, reduce poverty and achieve inclusive growth, he said the agriculture sector needed a great deal of attention as it was the primary source of livelihood for about 58% of the country’s population contributing nearly 16% to the gross domestic product (GDP). The major challenges confronting agriculture in the country were high input costs, instability in yields, low returns, debt, diminishing natural resources, growing demand for food, fragmented land holdings and the vagaries of nature, he noted.

The Vice-President stated that one of the major challenges for food security in the 21st Century was to not only improve productivity but to ensure yield stability as well. “To achieve these objectives, we need to develop crops that are disease and pest-resistant and are adaptable to climate change,” he suggested. It was necessary to adopt the latest technologies from seeds to post-harvest management to marketing, which would help improve productivity on a par with the leading nations and help in enhancing farmers’ income, he said.

Turning to climate change, he said there was a need to promote climate-smart agriculture as the climate change was posing a major challenge. He stated that organic farming was growing rapidly in the country with it being practised in about 7 lakh hectares, although taking it to merely 0.4% of the total agricultural land.

Organic farming was the need of the hour for mitigating farm crisis and address the climate change issues, he said and complimented PJTSAU for developing rice (paddy) varieties which would help control diabetes.

242,2020/02/22,"Genco, BHEL run against time to restore 800 MW KTPS unit","It’s out of order since November 28 last with technical snags

With the energy consumption constantly recording about 250 million units a day and the peak power demand hovering around 13,000 MW in the State, the Telangana State Power Generation Corporation (TS-Genco) is running against time to put back the 800 MW super critical generation unit in Kothagudem Thermal Power Station by the end of March first week.

Availability of the high-capacity generation unit has become necessary in the wake of increasing energy demand and the March-end deadline for decommissioning of five old unit of KTPS with a generating capacity of 420 MW put together approaching fast. The 800 MW unit of KTPS has gone out of order on November 28 last after developing some major technical snags.

The equipment supplier BHEL Haridwar has shifted the turbine to its facility there rectify the damage caused to thermo-well, strainer and its inner casing as it was not possible to carry out the repairs at KTPS. “It is expected to reach KTPS in the next three-four days and the installation will be completed soon so that the unit become operational by the end of March first week”, sources in the Genco stated.

When contacted, how the power utilities are managing the surging energy demand, Chairman and Managing Director of TS-Genco D. Prabhakar Rao told The Hindu that they have tied up to meet the peak demand up to 13,500 MW. “We have been prudently managing the demand by going for hydel generation in the pump mode during the night and early morning hours as it’s most economical power and getting solar supplementation in the afternoon”, he explained.

The peak power demand recorded in Telangana so far is 12,976 MW at 7.46 am on February 19 and the energy consumption was also highest at 254.34 million units. The peak demand has been over 12,000 MW for the last six days with the agricultural and irrigation (lift) consumption pushing the demand.

“Another 540 MW generation capacity would be added by Genco soon as we have plans to go for commercial operation of the first two units of 4×270 MW Bhadradri Thermal Power Station during March to meet the demand during the peak summer”, Mr. Prabhakar Rao stated. On the progress of 5×800 MW Yadadri Thermal Power Station in Nalgonda district, the Genco CMD said BoP contractors were finalised by the executing agency BHEL after the completion of foundation works.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/44lxad/article30891314.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY23KOTHAGUDEM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/genco-bhel-run-against-time-to-restore-800-mw-ktps-unit/article30891316.ece
243,2020/02/22,SCCL board fixes production target of 67.5 million tonnes for 2020-21,"The board has also cleared ₹3,000 cr. investment proposal

The Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) has fixed its coal production target for 2020-21 at 67.5 million tonnes.

According to the company officials, the decision was taken at the 552nd meeting of its board of directors held here on Saturday.

The board has also approved investment proposals of an estimated ₹3,000 crore, mainly for the procurement of machinery, as also taking up new mines.

The SCCL board has approved the company’s proposal to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the State government on extracting 67.5 million tonnes from its mines during the next financial year. Besides, the meeting has also approved work, including removal of overburden from the opencast mines, purchase of sprinkler tankers to reduce dust in the opencast mines, and cranes for lifting huge weights.

Further, the board has also approved plans for opening new mines during the next financial year. Chaired by Chairman and Managing Director N. Sridhar, the meeting was attended by Special Chief Secretary (Energy) Ajay Misra from the State government, Deputy Secretary in the Coal Ministry P.S.L. Swamy, CMD of Western Coal Fields Rajeev Ranjan Mishra, Directors of Singareni S. Shankar, S. Chandrasekhar, B. Bhaskar Rao, N. Balaram and others.

Meanwhile, when enquired about the production target and achievement during the current financial year, the company officials said till January-end the coal production achieved was 52.47 million tonnes against the target of 54.24 million tonnes. For 2019-20, the production target is 66 million tonnes.

The production achieved during the first 10 months of 2019-20 is however higher than that in the previous year (2018-19) when it was 51.87 million tonnes out of the total financial year production of 64.4 million tonnes.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/cmvn5f/article30891208.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy23singareni,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/sccl-board-fixes-production-target-of-675-million-tonnes-for-2020-21/article30891209.ece
244,2020/02/22,State gets Central nod to cultivate oil palm in big way,"State plans to raise oil palm on 18,000 hectares in two years

Telangana government has decided to focus on oil palm cultivation and got approval form the Centre to raise oil palms on an extent of 18,100 hectares in the next two years, said Agriculture Minister S. Niranjan Reddy here on Saturday.

Addressing a media conference, Mr. Reddy said that attention was not paid to oil palm cultivation due to lack of awareness in Telangana, and after the formation of the TRS government, the prospects and benefits of oil palm cultivation was studied.

The study committee from the Centre visited the State twice and gave permission for the extension of oil palm cultivation on 45,000 acres, he said, and thanked the Centre for granting permission.

The Minister said that oil palm cultivators could earn an income of ₹1.2 lakh to ₹1.5 lakh per acre and it would not be affected by the vagaries of weather. The government would formulate plans for extending oil palm cultivation across the State. Government would give guarantee to buy oil palm yield, he said.

While the country requires 21 million tonnes of edible oils, it produced only seven million tonnes and the remaining is being imported at a cost of ₹75,000 crore. Of the oil imports, palm oil accounts for 60%, he said. Thus India is importing eight to nine million tonnes of palm oil at a cost of ₹40,000 crore and this could be set off against cultivation of oil palm in 28 lakh hectares. India ranked second after Indonesia in oil palm consumption, he said.

In Telangana too, there is a shortfall of 3 lakh tonnes of oil and of this share of palm oil is about 1.8 lakh tonnes. By expanding oil palm cultivation, imports could be brought down and valuable foreign exchange could be saved, he explained.

The State government is giving incentives under oil palm cultivation on 50,000 acres so far in Khammam, Nalgonda and Kothagudem districts and the State is giving ₹12,000 per tonne of palm oil, highest in the country.

Mr. Reddy said he himself is cultivating oil palm on eight acres. The government is extending 100% subsidy to SC and ST farmers, 90% subsidy to small and marginal BC farmers and 80% subsidy to others, he said.

Oil palm cultivation would also do good to the environment and according to an estimate, an hectare of oil palm trees would consume 20 tonnes of carbondioxide and release 22 tonnes of oxygen, he said.

Answering questions, Mr. Reddy denied any thinking to fix a ceiling on Rythu Bandhu pay out. He also said the amounts were being credited to farmers accounts but the money was not transferred due to technical problems in some cases. A separate cell was constituted to monitor implementation of the scheme, the Minister said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/l4s3n2/article30891189.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY23PALM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/state-gets-central-nod-to-cultivate-oil-palm-in-big-way/article30891190.ece
245,2020/02/22,Uttam for immediate PRC announcement,"Congress leader pens an open letter to Chief Minister

“Neither the employees nor teachers benefited in any way during the last six years although Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao claims that his government is employee-friendly,” said TPCC chief N. Uttam Kumar Reddy.

In an open letter to Chief Minister, Mr. Reddy demanded immediate announcement of the Pay Revision Commission (PRC) as nearly 4 lakh teachers and employees and about 3 lakh pensioners have been desperately waiting for it.

He reminded that teachers and employees had played a major role during the statehood movement and risked their jobs and careers by participating in the 42-day long Sakala Janula Samme. They expected a better future and financial growth after formation of Telangana, he said.

The TPCC chief said that the new PRC should have been applied from July 1, 2018 but has been delayed by almost 20 months causing huge financial loss to employees and teachers. He wanted the government to place the reasons for extension of PRC’s term in public domain.

He said the PRC’s term is limited to five years, but no fitment has been announced for the last three years. Thousands of employees have retired in the last six years and the total number of employees has come down.

Mr. Reddy reminded that the previous Congress regime had declared 39% fitment and other benefits in the 9th PRC. Again in 2013, the Congress regime announced 10th PRC, five months in advance, and when the report was delayed, 27% interim relief was announced in order to reduce the burden on the employees. He said steps were also taken to announce 43% fitment under 10th PRC.

The TPCC chief complained that the employees are not extended promotions, transfers or inter-district transfers. For inter-district transfers, the then Congress government had issued GO MS No. 182 in 2012. However, it is not being implemented for the last six years.

Stating that the employees were not getting treatment in corporate hospitals under EHS, he said the State government has not cleared their dues of ₹ 1,200 crore. He demanded that immediate steps be taken to ensure that all corporate hospitals provided treatment to employees.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ox2wvq/article30891180.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY23UTTAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/uttam-for-immediate-prc-announcement/article30891181.ece

Mr. Rao also questioned the silence of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on the MIM leaders’ speeches. “Can KCR claim to be ‘secular’, while being associated with MIM which is making hateful, insinuating statements against Hindus with a communal agenda,” he asked.

248,2020/02/22,"Gadwal police to train women in car, tractor driving","Good response to women empowerment initiative of Telangana police

Buoyed by the overwhelming response to their women empowerment initiative in Wanaparthy, Telangana police are now taking their efforts to Jogulamba-Gadwal district.

About 100 women, including home-makers and students, will be trained in driving cars and tractors so that they are ready for employment or help their family members in the agriculture field.

Speaking to The Hindu, Wanaparthy Superintendent of Police Apoorva Rao, who is also in-charge of Gadwal district, said this can go a long way in empowering women as it is a good opportunity for safe employment, besides enhancing their skills.

The idea is also to break stereotypes and challenge the mistaken notion that tractors can be driven by men alone.

Those who got qualified for learners’ licence were trained for car driving for three months and thereafter those interested in the tractor driving were trained for an additional 45 days in Wanaparthy district, Ms Rao said.

“They are professional drivers now, and I’m happy to see them plough fields with tractors,” she said.

The response for the drive was so overwhelming that policemen struggled and were forced to cut off the number of applications to 100.

According to Ms. Rao, similar training will be provided at Gadwal and registration is already in progress. “Interested women can enrol themselves at Gadwal and Alampur police stations. The training, which is free of cost, will start next week,” the officer said.

Nirmala Nayak, a home-maker from Wanaparthy said that she never dreamt of taking the wheels, but now she drives both car and tractor. “Thanks to Ms. Rao, she encouraged and boosted our confidence level when we were a bit scared and hesitant to drive,” she said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ahspjo/article30884226.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy22Gadwal-story1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/gadwal-police-to-train-women-in-car-tractor-driving/article30884227.ece

252,2020/02/22,Yemeni arrest exposes flaws in passport verification,"Tuesday’s arrest of a Yemeni raises several questions on the ‘credibility’ of police verification by the Special Branch of Hyderabad commissionerate, to issue passports.

Mubarak Bin Awad (30), a native of Sanaa city, had come to India a few years ago on a visiting visa, and was overstaying here. He managed to obtain an Indian passport and two Aadhaar cards and voter IDs fraudulently. He took up a job of a welder and was supporting his mother, an Indian married to a Yemeni.

“We will initiate a departmental inquiry on how our men cleared the physical verification for a foreigner. There were several instances in the past where Myanmar and Bangladesh nationals were booked for obtaining Indian passport and other Indian documents, but this case came as a surprise,” a senior police officer told The Hindu, seeking anonymity.

When a person applies for a passport, a field officer from the SB visits the applicant’s house in a week, examines documents (citizenship), verify about him in the neighbourhood and check if the applicant has criminal antecedents, before sending the file to the RPO. Regional Passport Officer. Only after this, the passport is issued or denied.

The top brass in the department constantly warn field officers not to take ‘tips’ from applicants and clear files if they find fault in the verification. “A stringent action will follow against the concerned officer who has cleared Awad’s file,” he said.

The officer said that this particular case had alerted them to be vigilant to such ‘negligence’ by their lower-level staff, which is ‘unacceptable’.

Apart from the field officer, police are also making efforts to track down the people who helped Awad in obtaining the passport and other documents.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/yemeni-arrest-exposes-flaws-in-passport-verification/article30883843.ece

254,2020/02/22,The vihara’s minaret,"A Sanskrit inscription dedicated to Allah as protector of a vihara sheds light on the pluralistic past of Bengal

Allahabhattarakasvamijansitavihara. It’s a single word, a Sanskrit compound, that gives us a glimpse into medieval life that resonates with relevance in contemporary India. It refers to a vihara, obviously a religious complex, protected by the divinity Allahabhattarakasvami. The term Allaha is clearly the Sanskritisation of Allah. The two Sanskrit honorifics bhattaraka and svami are suffixed to Allaha, implying veneration.

This word comes in a seven-line inscription found in Bangladesh that dates back to the reign of Bhojavarman (c. AD 1137-1145), a king of the Varman dynasty, who ruled in Vanga (the present Dhaka-Bikrampur-Faridpur tract) with Vikramapura as the capital. And this is the earliest known evidence of a shrine associated with Islam in Bengal, showing the advent of Muslims in the region much before the Turkish conquest in AD 1205.

The Sujanagar inscription from 12th century Bengal. Photo: Special arrangement

Discovered in 1964 in Sujanagar in what was then East Pakistan (now in Munshiganj Upazilla of Bangladesh), this particular inscription is in the collection of the Bangladesh National Museum at Dhaka. The inscription was first translated in 2010 by the late Shariful Islam, but it was in 2019 that Ryosuke Furui, a University of Tokyo expert on ancient Bengal and its epigraphic wealth, rendered a fresh reading and an improved translation (in the journal Pratna Samiksha, vol. X).

During his seventh regnal year (AD 1145), Bhojavarman endorsed a monetary donation in the form of cowries to this religious institution.

The word vihara usually stands for a Buddhist monastery, which often contained shrines, educational facilities and residences for monks and others.

Applied to Allah or Allahabhattarakasvami, it probably connotes a mosque and its associated structures, including — according to Furui — a madrasa-like institution.

High-ranking contributor

The inscription says the initiative for this patronage came from Bhojavarman’s subordinate and intermediary ruler (mahasamanta) Avudeva, son (suta) of Hasi. The name Avu is a Sanskritisation of the Arabic name Abu. A high-ranking functionary, his name is suffixed with deva, literally god, but actually a regular honorific for important personages.

The name Hasi, father of Avu, could have been based on the Arabic word Hashim or Asif. Hasi figures as a panchakulika. This designation is rarely encountered in inscriptions from Bengal but is found in Gujarat for a body of merchants and artisans, usually located in a city or commercial centre. This prompted Furui to consider Hasi to be a merchant connected with the local administration in Vikramapura. His son Avudeva rose to a higher administrative position.

As a tool for explaining the past, empirical study is crucial. The dependence on Brahmanical normative texts in Sanskrit leaves an impression, mostly inaccurate, that early India can be perceived through the prism of the Vedas, Dharmasastras and Puranas: that is, the sruti-smriti tradition. Yet, there is an impressive corpus of inscribed documentation (mostly on stone and copper plates, sometimes on pottery shards) from this period. Nearly four decades ago, D.C. Sircar, the doyen of Indian epigraphy, counted more than 84,000 such inscribed documents. These include royal and administrative records, documents of donation by individuals and groups, and label inscriptions accompanying divine images. Since these inscriptions mostly record events, they are descriptive evidence, while the Dharmasastra texts are essentially prescriptive.

Capturing the times

Inscriptions present voices from a past otherwise not audible in didactic texts. These inscriptions, more accurate by dating and provenance than texts, are also of infinite value in capturing the social, economic and cultural situations of remote times. Like other branches of history, epigraphy too is a specialist’s job and open to multiple readings of the same texts by different experts.

Bhojavarman is also known from his other inscription, a land grant record in copper plate dated in his fifth regnal year, showing that like his two predecessors Harivarman and Samalavarman, he too was a devout Vaishnava ruler. He was a local monarch, ruling merely over a sub-region of ancient Bengal. Yet, he looms large in cultural history by accommodating diversity of faiths in his realm. In fact, two Buddhist manuscripts were prepared during the reign of the Vaishnava Varman rulers.

Cultural plurality was thus a lived experience in Vanga under the Varmans. The Varman patronage of Buddhism implies their familiarity with viharas. That is why an Islamic institution was called a vihara in the 12th-century inscription.

Arabic and Persian script

Avudeva’s monetary donation to the vihara of Allahabhattarakasvami had the assent (anumatya) of all the kinsmen (jnatinam) of the non-local people (paradesikas) in the area; as worshippers of Allahabhattarakasvami, they were Muslims, probably from overseas. A large number of Arabic and Persian texts speak of the port of Samandar, identified with Chittagong in Bangladesh.

The patronage given to the earliest known Islamic shrine in Bengal thus illuminates the presence of a Muslim diaspora in ancient Vanga. This diaspora was accommodated by a host society that was steeped in Brahmanical bhakti cults and familiar with Buddhist practices. The advent of the worshippers of Allah in 12th-century coastal Bengal was evidently not through conquest but by commerce. Thanks to Furui’s insightful reading and translation of this fascinating document, the heritage of cultural plurality in the subcontinent is further established.

This grant is not unique. A mid-ninth century inscription from Kerala records similar grants of land by the Chera king Kulasekhara to a Syrian Christian church. A Jewish settlement similarly received patronage in Kerala around AD 1000. The coastal town of Somanatha in Kathiawad perhaps offers the most emblematic illustration of cultural plurality. In 1264, an elaborate Sanskrit inscription (with an accompanying, but synoptic, text in Arabic), says that a mosque (Mijigiti, Sanskritised form of Masjid) was built at Somanatha by a devout Muslim shipowner (nakhuda), Nur-uddin Firuz (Sanskritised as Noradina Piroja), hailing from Hormuz.

The procurement of land for the mosque was upheld by Saiva Pasupata acharya presiding over the local town council, endorsed by the provincial authority, and finally approved by the Chaulukya ruler Vaghela Arjunadeva. The inscription opens with a salutation (Om namostute) to Allah. Allah is described by four stunning attributes: Visvarupa (Universal), Visvanatha (Lord of the Universe), Sunyarupa (Formless or Aniconic) and Lakshya yet Alakshya (Visible but Formless).

These inscriptions clearly show that there were few attempts at ‘othering’ any diasporic groups, including Muslims, by local host societies in the subcontinent. Neither was there any compulsion to reduce cultural diversities into a ‘melting pot’. It underlines the long-drawn Indic practice of promoting cultural plurality. Which is why one cannot but be alarmed by the attempts to erase this heritage by the current proponents of religious nationalism, hate ideology and majoritarian politics. What Bhojavarman practised in 12th-century Bengal needs to be embraced and multiplied for the very sustenance of the idea of India.

259,2020/02/22,School takes students for a ride,"Hall tickets yet to be issued to 34 Class X students for exams beginning on Monday

As many as 34 Class X students of a private school in the city have not received hall tickets for their CBSE board exams set to begin on Monday, leaving parents, students, and teachers irate and confused.

“We were asked to assemble near the school and collect the hall tickets on Wednesday. But on arriving, the management told us that the school had not registered the students for the exams,” said Francis Xavier, whose son, a student of Arooja Little Star School at Moolamkuzhy near Fort Kochi, was all set to write his Malayalam board exam on Monday.

Parents and students are worried that the negligence of the school might mean that the students will have to wait for two years to write the exams, Mr. Xavier said.

“Since the registration is done in Standard 9, they will have to repeat 9th and 10th classes if they do not write the exam this year. But we are hoping that an intervention or a special order could help them write the exam next year at least,” said Shruthi Pradeep, a Standard 10 class teacher.

Meanwhile, students and parents protested outside the school on Friday and met V. Muraleedharan, Union Minister of State for External Affairs, who offered support. Why the school had not registered its students for the exams a year in advance as required is not clear even to teachers, Ms. Pradeep said. “We had submitted students’ details for registration and were told that it was done. Since the school does not have CBSE affiliation, for the past seven years the management has been making arrangements for students to write exams in different affiliated schools each year,” she added.

Parents and teachers had presumed that a similar system would be followed this year, but they recently learnt that the other schools the management had approached for a tie-up had rejected the request to allow students to write the exams on their premises.

Though parents and teachers had been enquiring about hall tickets for the past few weeks, they were not informed about the problems in registering students, Ms. Pradeep said.

“The management would have known by October last year that the students were not registered, and that their request to the CBSE Board to conduct exams directly were rejected. But no action was taken, and we were not warned in advance,” she added.

The school management was not available for comment.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/6l8gqv/article30884366.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22-KI-SCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/school-takes-students-for-a-ride/article30884367.ece
260,2020/02/22,Safety pins will now keep chain snatchers away at Manappuram,"Devotees told to pin chain and dress together to foil snatching bids

The proverb that even a blade of grass can be turned into a weapon is something that the Ernakulam Rural Police seem to have taken quite seriously.

Only, they have replaced grass with a safety pin in an attempt to keep at bay chain snatchers targeting devotees assembling in large numbers at the Aluva Manappuram in connection with the Shivaratri festival.

The police plan to distribute safety pins to people with the instruction to pin the chain and dress together so that any attempt to snatch the chain will alert the person, provoking a swift response to foil the bid.

“We had successfully implemented it during the Thiruvairanikulam temple festival recently where it was a hit,” said K. Karthik, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural). The police chose to attribute the absence of chain snatching attempts at Thiruvairanikulam to the novel ploy.

The Safety Pin Project, however, at best evoked mixed response on the Facebook page of the rural police. There were people wondering why the police were taking so much pain when they could have simply asked people not to wear ornaments while visiting crowded places. Meanwhile, the police opened a round-the-clock control room at the Aluva Manappuram on Friday to coordinate the various security activities. Mr. Karthik urged people to report any child missing case to the control room at the earliest for immediate action. Footage from around 45 CCTVs at the Manappuram will also be monitored at the control room.

Over 1,500 police personnel have been deployed to ensure smooth conduct of the festival. Led by Mr. Karthik and Aluva Deputy Superintendent of Police G. Venu, 10 DySPs, 30 inspectors, 164 sub inspectors and assistant sub inspectors, 1,500 civil police officers, and 200 women civil police officers have been deployed on the Manappuram and nearby areas.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/2zkdml/article30884339.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22-KI-SIVARATHRI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/safety-pins-will-now-keep-chain-snatchers-away-at-manappuram/article30884340.ece
261,2020/02/22,GH gearing up for superspecialty tag,"Advanced trauma care centre and digital X-ray facility to be ready by June

The District General Hospital (GH) will offer a slew of new facilities as it prepares to become a superspecialty hospital by mid-2020.

A superspecialty block is expected to be ready by June, according to hospital superintendent Dr. A. Anitha. She said Inkel Ltd., which is constructing the block, had indicated that tenders for purchase of equipment had been floated.

Once the block is ready, the hospital will offer services on par with private hospitals. Among the crucial projects in the offing are an advanced trauma care centre and a digital X-ray facility.

In the absence of proper infrastructure for trauma care, a good number of cases are now being referred to medical colleges in Alappuzha or Thrissur as well as private hospitals. Incidentally, the hospital has only one neurosurgeon.

The orthopaedic section attends to around 50 cases a day on an average, but there are no facilities to handle grievous injuries.

A full-fledged trauma care centre is expected to address this issue. Interestingly, the trauma centre is being set up using the corporate social responsibility funds of Air India Express.

The proposed digital X-ray facility, being set up at a cost of ₹1.75 crore, will give the hospital a competitive edge thanks to its capacity to provide immediate results, not to mention the ease of taking X-rays with low dose of radiation, according to a statement issued by T.J. Vinod, MLA. The facility is being built using Mr. Vinod’s asset development funds.

The digital X-ray facility will also be the first in the State, the statement said, adding that the long wait by patients for results would be a thing of the past once the new facility was ready. At present, around 400 X-rays are taken a day at the hospital using machines that are over 15 years old, it added.

Arts and Medicine

Meanwhile, Arts and Medicine, a popular musical programme, has been revived at the General Hospital after a hiatus of five months.

The weekly musical interlude had been much appreciated by patients and bystanders. The weekly programme had become a huge hit, with several singers and bands coming forward to join hands with Mehboob Orchestra that facilitated the programme.

This time around, Cochin Shipyard Limited will be promoting the programme instead of the Kochi Biennale Foundation, which had to bow out reportedly owing to fund crunch.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/gh-gearing-up-for-superspecialty-tag/article30884314.ece
262,2020/02/22,"Narrow escape for passengers as ro-ro ferry, tourist boat collide","Threat posed by vessels to safe transit of ferries to be taken up: KSINC

Passengers had a narrow escape when a roll-on roll-off (ro-ro) ferry operating in the Fort Kochi-Vypeen corridor and a double-decker tourist boat collided, off the Fort Kochi jetty on Friday afternoon.

The incident occurred a few metres away from the spot where a recklessly-driven fishing trawler rammed into a ferry six years ago, resulting in the death of 10 passengers.

On Friday, there were 29 people on board the tourist boat, including 23 tourists from Maharashtra who were seated on the upper deck. The ferry had its regular share of passengers and vehicles as per its capacity, being ferried to Vypeen.

Videos of the incident show the boat coming in the way of the ferry, following which the vessels were locked together in the impact for about a minute. The ferry is subsequently reversed and steered away from the tourist boat. The footage from a CCTV installed in the ferry shows the tourist boat crossing its way, following which the two vessels collide.

Sources in Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC), which operates a pair of ro-ro ferries in the corridor, said they had taken up with the Coastal Police and other stakeholders the threat posed by tourist and fishing vessels to the safe transit of regular ferries.

“The boat involved in Friday’s collision was apparently berthed near the Chinese fishing nets. It took off towards Marine Drive, despite our ferry moving towards Vypeen. Our ferries have the ‘right of way’ in the corridor, since they are much bigger and hence tough to negotiate or bring to a halt. The boat was being driven in a reckless manner. Both the local and coastal police must handle the issue seriously, to prevent such accidents. After all, the lives of passengers and crew of both vessels are at stake,” they said.

Meanwhile, the Fort Kochi police said a case had been registered against the driver of the ro-ro ferry for rash and negligent driving, based on a complaint by the tourist boat operator. Both the vessels suffered damage in the impact of the collision. KSINC officials too will file a complaint, it is learnt.

A senior Coastal Police officer said ferries had the right of way on the stretch. Moreover, small tourist boats were not permitted to go beyond the backwaters.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/yxl319/article30884163.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22-KI-RORO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/narrow-escape-for-passengers-as-ro-ro-ferry-tourist-boat-collide/article30884164.ece
263,2020/02/22,Start-up develops ‘all-in-one’ app for social empowerment,"Beta version of Bitdle launched in city

How about an app that helps identify an unidentified body through biometrics and facial identification technology? Bitdle, an application developed by a Kerala-based IT start-up, promises to offer this and much more.

Claimed to be a revolutionary all-in-one application, the developers regard it as a social digital assistance platform bringing together the features of hybrid social networking, search engine, social shopping, sharing economy, online reputation building, customer relationship management, data analytics, social service and entertainment with the lofty objective of social empowerment.

After seven years of research and development in IT labs across south India, Europe and East Asia, the beta version of Bitdle was launched here on Thursday with the full version being readied for simultaneous launch in India, Europe and East Asia in a few days.

“Its core competency will be its social commitment as it will not end up making its users just consumers killing time and other resources. We insist on environment sustainability and will earmark more than what is stipulated by law for our corporate social responsibility initiatives,” said Abimanyu S., managing director of Bitdle Integrated Technologies.

The company targets a sales revenue of ₹129 crore in the first financial year of operation with an employment generation of 5,700, with 275 jobs at its main office in Kochi alone. The company is also aiming to generate ₹1.03 crore through the sale of 13,000 devices powered by the Internet of Things by 2021.

Bitdle targets people in the age group of 18 to 35 while it claims to be ideal for businesses of any size from start-ups to big corporates. Mr. Abimanyu said the company was General Data Protection Regulation-compliant as per the EU standards and would process data accumulated only in the parent country.

Shaji A.V., director, said Bitdle would come in handy for everyday transactions which were increasingly turning digital. “For instance, a person’s medical history can be stored and accessed by doctors and partially by labs while biometric data can be used to find missing persons. Emergency support services such as repairs of automobiles and applications can also be accessed using this application,” he said.

Mr. Abimanyu, however, said that access to personal data or biometrics, or exposure to targeted marketing by companies would be solely based on user permission.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/start-up-develops-all-in-one-app-for-social-empowerment/article30884160.ece
264,2020/02/22,"Back to the turf, bowled over by memories","Six former State players, now in their 60s, come together for a game of cricket

Fond memories and warm friendships are all they have to show for all the cricket they played at a time when the sport was far from a popular choice for women.

It is the yearning to relive those memories in each other’s company that brought six former State players, now in their 60s, for another game of cricket, decades after they gave up their cricket whites.

The exhibition match between the former State players who played during the 1970s through the 1980s and prominent women personalities from various walks of life organised by the Veteran Women’s Cricket Association in Kerala (VWCAK) on an artificial turf at Kalamassery offered the perfect setting for that reunion.

Among them were siblings Binu Varghese and Latha Varghese who played together for the State. “We did not even get grace marks for playing the game at the university-level, and that is the reason why I do not encourage my children to play the game,” said Ms. Binu, an all-rounder.

Elizabeth Thomas, another all-rounder, backed her former teammate, citing how not a single player from that era got a job on account of the game. “But we enjoyed the game and gained a lot of memories to cherish and friendships across,” said Ms. Thomas, a retired professor. Interestingly, all six of them did their graduation at CMS College, Kottayam, at different points between 1976 and 1980, and were all part of the cricket team which won the inter-collegiate and inter-district championships multiple times.

Manju Raveendran, the only one in the group to associate with cricket administration after her playing days, recollected how she and Ms. Thomas switched from hockey to cricket when the cricket team was formed in college. “A lot of credit should go to our parents for having given us the freedom to play the game and to move around across the country for various competitions,” said Bincy Zachariah, former wicketkeeper.

The former cricketers spoke of how Sunil Gavaskar was the rage back then, as Ms. Thomas added former English cricketer Alan Knott to the list.

Icy Mereena Abraham recollected how they struggled to get proper cricket kits and how they travelled on trains across the country without reservations while sleeping on the floor more than once. During one of those arduous journeys, they ended up spending a night with the Begum of Oudh in a waiting room at the Lucknow railway station while waiting for a connecting train to Bareilly. “And she was not impressed one bit,” chuckled Ms. Thomas.

Sreekala S.R., VWCAK president and former State player, said the exhibition match was a prelude to the two-day tournament for the Shabina Jacob Memorial Trophy that is set to get under way at the Government Polytechnic College ground at Kalamassery. “The association formed last December is the first of its kind anywhere in the country. The State government made three postings for women cricketers for the first time just three days ago,” said Ms. Sreekala.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kfhota/article30884148.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG20200221165155,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/back-to-the-turf-bowled-over-by-memories/article30884149.ece

266,2020/02/22,Kolkata pays tributes to Ghalib,"The celebrations include a tour of places where he lived and visited

Almost 190 years after Mirza Ghalib visited Kolkata to find out about his pension, the city is offering rich tributes to the poet in a week-long celebrations from Friday, titled Bayaad-e-Ghalib (Remembering Ghalib), on the International Mother Language Day.

Urdu Academy

The events organised by the West Bengal Urdu Academy include a tour of places where Ghalib lived and visited, including Shimla Bazar and Kathal Bagan in central Kolkata; and release of a commemorative stamp to mark the poet’s visit. The celebrations include five plays with Ghalib as the central theme.

“I do not remember if Kolkata has ever given tributes to Mirza Ghalib. From the land of Tagore, we are offering rich tributes to one of greatest Urdu poets of all time,” said Md. Nadimul Haque, chairperson of West Bengal Urdu Academy.

Mr. Haque, also a Rajya Sabha MP from the ruling Trinamool Congress, said that an international seminar on Mirza Ghalib will be held.

The five plays also includes Ghalib Aur Kolkata Mushaira, recreating the poetic congregation that was held at Calcutta Madrasah in 1828.

Dabir Ahmed, professor of Urdu at Kolkata’s Maulana Azad College, said that Mirza Ghalib’s visit to Kolkata remains a little known aspect of his life. “Ghalib arrived in Kolkata on February 20, 1828, and left the city on October 1, 1829. During his stay, he visited a number of places and even read at three poetic symposiums (mushiaras) where the Calcutta Madarsah is located,” Prof. Ahmed said. He said that the poet wrote a prose, known as Qate Burhan which is on the literary differences he had with other poets.

Experts like Prof. Ahmed said that Ghalib visited important landmarks ,including the Governor’s House, the Writer’s Building, and also National Library that used to be the residence of senior British officials.

Bengali translation

Other events include a recitation of Bengali translation of Charagh-e Dair written by Ghalib in Benaras and eight short story writers of Urdu and Bengali presenting their fictionalised version of Ghalib life in form of short stories.

Syed Md. Shahabuddin Haider, vice-chairman of the West Bengal’s Urdu Academy, said that a grand tribute to Ghalib by the people of city was due for a long time. “The celebrations will involve people from all walks of life, from academicians to students and common people. This is the least we can offer him,” he said.

Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib was born in Agra on December 27, 1797, and died in Delhi on February 15, 1869.

Reflecting on the Ghalib’s love for the city, Mr. Haider quoted the famous lines of the poet about the city. “Kalkatte ka jo zikr kiya tu ne hum nasheen, Ik teer mere seenay mein mara kay haye haye (Ah me, my friend!

268,2020/02/22,Car of Bodoland council chief’s wife attacked by miscreants,"Stone-pelting believed to be linked to the BTC polls scheduled for April

Unidentified miscreants on Thursday pelted stones at the vehicle of Seuli Brahma Mohilary, the wife of Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) chairperson Hagrama Mohilary, also the chief of Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), the Bharatiya Janata Party’s ally in Assam.

The police said they were investigating the case to find out who attacked the BTC chief’s wife and why. But the stone-pelting is believed to be linked to the BTC polls scheduled for April.

The incident happened around 6 p.m. when Ms. Mohilary was returning from a Shiva temple at Ultapani on the India-Bhutan border in western Assam’s Kokrajhar district.

The occupants of the SUV escaped unhurt but the vehicle was damaged.

Ms. Mohilary said the miscreants had attacked the car from both sides in a forested area immediately after the escort vehicle passed by.

“The incident took place in a dark jungle area. We have examined some suspects but have not been able to establish their involvement,” said Anurag Agarwal, Inspector General of Police for the Bodoland areas.

The BPF has been wielding power in the BTC since its creation in 2003 and is expected to face a stiff challenge in the upcoming polls.

Leaders of all factions of the disbanded extremist group, National Democratic Front of Bodoland, which signed the third Bodo Peace Accord with the Centre in January, are likely to float a political party or join BPF’s rival United People’s Party Liberal soon.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/5hh27g/article30884786.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE22MOHILARY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/car-of-bodoland-council-chiefs-wife-attacked-by-miscreants/article30884788.ece

Replying to a written question by Independent MLA Andrew H. Thangliana, the Home Minister said the committees have been formed in three districts of the State — Lunglei, Mamit and Lawngtlai — along the India-Bangladesh border, in accordance with a directive by the Centre.

He said that the Union Ministry of Home Affairs had in November 2009 directed the State government to deport immigrants who have illegally entered India from the neighbouring country.

Mizoram shares 318-km-long border with Bangladesh.

No report filed yet

Mr. Lalchamliana said that the committees were yet to submit any report on their findings.

He further claimed that the State government had no intention of setting up any foreigners’ tribunal for now.

Apart from the task force committees, State police officers have also been asked to be on the lookout for illegal immigrants, the Minister added.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/hab8o7/article30884782.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE22CM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/special-panels-to-detect-deport-illegal-immigrants/article30884783.ece

The Odisha government has decided to provide space in Bharat Nirman Gandhi Sewa Kendras (BNRGSK) free of cost to both banks and post offices to open their branches which would help extend banking services and disburse wages under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act.

The State government, however, made it clear that the facility will be made available to banks only in gram panchayats where there is no brick and mortar branch.

Cost of interiors

As per the condition put forward by the Panchayati Raj and Drinking Water department, about 200 sq ft area in BNRGSKs would be provided to banking institutions.

Banks and postal departments will bear the cost of interiors and electricity charges. Agreements will be executed between banks and concerned gram panchayats.

273,2020/02/22,Fishermen keep off sea; protest ‘firing’ by Sri Lankan Navy,"They demand compensation for the fisherman who was injured

Expressing anguish over the ‘firing’ by the Sri Lankan Navy three days ago in which a fisherman was injured, the fishermen association here stayed off the sea on Saturday.

On Wednesday, a fisherman identified as Jesu, 55, had set off to sea for fishing along with six others in a mechanised boat from Thangachimadam.

In the wee hours of Thursday, the occupants in the boat were in for shock when bullets pierced the boat and in the process one of the bullet hit Jesu.

After reaching the shore, the fisherman, who was taken to the local hospital, was subsequently referred to the Aravind Eye Hospital in Madurai, where the surgeons have been performing multiple surgeries since admission.

To show their protest, the fishermen kept off the sea and urged the Central and State governments to take up the issue with the Sri Lankan government.

“If we are targeted even when we are fishing in our waters, the fishermen community may have to look for other jobs. Everyday, we cannot be going out into sea with apprehension. The governments should help us...,” the fishermen told. At least 1,500 fishermen did not go for fishing and 500 mechanised boats were anchored off the shore.

The fishermen association also demanded compensation to the fisherman who was shot at and also urged the government to give relief to the mechanised boat owner, whose boat had been damaged in the incident.

High tide

While the fishermen’s association maintained that they abstained from work to show their protest, officials from the fisheries department said that they had advised the fishermen to stay off sea due to high tide forecast furnished by the IMD. “For the next 48 hours...the sea is expected to be rough. High tidal waves with a speed of 40 to 50 kms/hour may turn to be high to very high.” Hence, they had appealed to the fishermen to stay off sea till Sunday, officials from the fisheries department said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/6444v2/article30890784.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA23BOATSRMD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/fishermen-keep-off-sea-protest-firing-by-sri-lankan-navy/article30890785.ece
274,2020/02/22,Palanganatham-TVS Nagar junction needs a longtime solution,"Chock-a-block traffic at the TVS Nagar-Palanganatham junction on Tirupparankundram Main Road is a common sight during peak hours. Every day, hundreds of vehicles pass through this crucial junction, which has a relatively narrow road.

Residents and road users say that the barricades, which were erected around a month back, for a certain distance at the junction, have helped in easing the situation to an extent. But, they feel that there is a need for a long time solution to address the traffic congestion.

The congestion at the junction happens mainly when vehicles coming from TVS Nagar and those bound towards Tirupparankundram, take a right turn at the junction towards Palanganatham.

Similarly, the vehicles from Palanganatham and those coming from the Tirupparankundram side take a right turn at the junction to reach TVS Nagar rather than taking a ‘U’ turn at the Palanganatham roundabout to reach TVS Nagar.

“The barricades were erected to make sure that vehicle users take a ‘U’ turn at Palanganatham roundabout to reach TVS Nagar and move towards Tirupparankundram. However, when police personnel are not present, the vehicle users tend to make all kinds of violations. They clash with the vehicles coming from the opposite direction and lead to congestion at the junction,” says P. Nagendran, an autorickshaw driver.

To avoid this havoc, vehicle users can make use of the road overbridge connecting Madakulam and TVS Nagar. But, Mr. Nagendran complains that not many need to go Madakulam from TVS Nagar. “They want to join the Tirupparankundram Main Road. Also, it is very difficult to get down the bridge at Madakulam side due to lack of space,”he says.

R. Venkatasamy, a resident of Alagappan Nagar and former Superintending Engineer of Agricultural Engineering department, says that with the presence of the railway gate at the nearby Alagappan Nagar, vehicles get queued up for a long time when the railway gate closes.

“The frequent closing of railway gates also adds to the congestion at the junction,” he says.

Adding to these problems, share autos pick up and drop passengers at the junction, says V.P. Manikandan, a motorist who uses this stretch regularly.

“During rush hours, it takes around 10 minutes to cross this junction. With the presence of schools on both sides of the junction, students who commute through bicycles are the worst affected,” he says.

A police official present at the junction says that there is a proposal to build concrete dividers from the Palangantham roundabout to Alagappan Nagar railway gate, with an opening at the junction to allow movement of vehicles from TVS Nagar towards Palangantham. “This will help in regulating the movement of vehicles and reducing congestion,” said the official.

Mr. Venkatasamy also suggests that the existing overbridge connecting Madakulam and TVS Nagar can have two wings to ensure easy movement of vehicles. “On one side, the overbridge can have a landing after the railway gate at Alagusundaram Nagar and on other side it can have a landing at Palanganatham roundabout. This will ease the situation,” he adds.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/du8xsx/article30890645.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA23CITY-TRAFFIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/palanganatham-tvs-nagar-junction-needs-a-long-time-solution/article30890646.ece

He was speaking after inaugurating a workshop on fisheries and distributing various facilities to the beneficiaries, organised by the Department of Fisheries and the Udupi Zilla Panchayat, here.

Mr. Poojary said that the workshop was being held by the Department so that the fishermen could know about its programmes and schemes.

There were two types of fisheries – sea fisheries and inland fisheries. The fishermen were facing several problems.

His Ministry was committed to giving a fillip to fisheries. But no new schemes or projects would be implemented without bringing them to the attention of the fishermen. All problems of the fishermen would be solved in phases, he said.

A list of guidelines needed to be prepared for the problems faced by the fishermen. Fishermen should involve themselves whole-heartedly in fishing, he said.

The government had acquired 34 acres of land for the construction of a fisheries harbour at Hejmady in Udupi district. The process of land acquisition for another 12 acres was under way, he said.

The harbour at Karwar would also be developed The Matsyagandhi scheme would be implemented in 11 places in the State, Mr. Poojary said.

Speaking to presspersons after the inauguration of the silver jubilee celebrations of the Karnataka Konkani Academy at Karkala in Udupi district, Mr. Ravi said that shouting slogans in favour of Pakistan was an act of provocation.

“Who do these people shouting slogans in favour of Pakistan want to provoke? Who has given birth to such people? They eat the rice grown here but sing praises of the enemy country. This is a serious issue. This mindset itself is dangerous,” he said.

“There can be punishment and pardon for other activities. But there can be no pardon for those indulging in anti-national activities. No one should seek pardon for persons indulging in anti-national activities,” he said.

Mr. Ravi said that the anti-CAA activist, Amulya, had a couple of days back stated that she was merely a mouthpiece and there was a team behind her.

“If that team is developing such persons, we have to take such matters seriously. We should investigate it and see who is behind this,” he said.

Mr. Ravi said that people who were giving such statements favouring Pakistan should realise that the soldiers of the country were protecting its borders in freezing temperatures of minus 20 degrees Celsius.

The soldiers were making immense sacrifices for the sake of the country.

279,2020/02/22,‘Coastal development authority will explore setting up marine industrial zone’,"Chairman says it can be created either in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, or in Uttara Kannada

The Karnataka Coastal Development Authority will explore the possibilities of creating a marine industrial zone in any of the three coastal districts in the State, chairman Mattar Ratnakar Hegde said here on Saturday.

Addressing presspersons, he said that the zone should have ice plants, freezing units, fish mills, and other units required to promote the fisheries industry. The zone can be created either in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, or in Uttara Kannada.

The authority will also try to organise an investors’ meet in the coastal belt by consulting the government, he said.

Mr. Hegde said that the authority has sought ₹100-crore grant from the State government. Currently of ₹20-crore worth projects planned, various projects worth between ₹8 crore and ₹12 crore are under progress.

The chairman said that the authority is planning to promote Bangra Kuluru areas in the city as a tourist spot by creating water recreation facilities.

It has been proposed to build clean fish markets at Hiriyadkka, Belman, and Inna in Udupi district.

Mr. Hegde said that the lighthouse area in Kaup will be further illuminated as a tourist attraction.

He said that he would take it up with the government a move to upgrade the coastal development authority as a Board or a Corporation.

280,2020/02/22,"Languages have coexisted, prospered in country: Ravi","Indian languages had always lived together and helped enrich one another, Minister for Kannada and Culture C.T. Ravi has said.

Inaugurating the silver jubilee celebrations of the Karnataka Konkani Sahitya Academy here today, he said India was a country known for its diversity of culture and languages. There were nearly 1,200 spoken languages in the country. These languages were coexisting with one another. “Language and culture are two faces of the same coin; and one cannot live without the other.”

With the advent of British rule in the country, English language was given importance. This had led to the decline of some languages in the country. “Kannada medium schools are getting closed in the State not because there are lesser number of children, but because the number of children going to these schools has gone down,” he said.

The Minister said that he was not against people learning English language for advancement in their career. But it was essential that they did not forget to give primacy to Kannada in the State. Karnataka was a shining example where Kannada, the major language of the State, and languages such as Tulu, Konkani, Kodava, Are Bhashe, and Beary were coexisting with one another peacefully.

Mr. Ravi said that Indian culture had laid importance on the essence of an event than on outward celebrations. While solar and lunar new years were being celebrated in a dignified manner in the country, the New Year’s eve celebrations saw men dancing and getting drunk. With the result, there were many road accidents due to drunk driving on that night.

The Minister said that casteism and untouchability were social evils which should be removed. But some forces were using caste for their political purposes under the label of secularism. Though the Union government wanted unity while protecting the diversities in the country, some forces were against it and hence were opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, he added.

K. Jagadish Pai, President of the Academy, welcomed the gathering.

The Congress will convince Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to pass a resolution against implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the legislature session that starts from February 24, Bandra East MLA Zeeshan Siddique has said.

“It is our responsibility to convince him and we are confident on doing it,” he told reporters here on Saturday.

Mr. Siddique was reacting to the statement of Mr. Thackeray in support of CAA following his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday. While stating that the CAA will not take away citizenship rights in Maharashtra, Mr. Thackeray said he was opposed to the National Register of Citizenship. The government will scrutinise new columns proposed in the National Population Register and not go ahead with it if found problematic, Mr. Thackeray had said.

Mr. Siddique said the Congress was opposed to the CAA and the proposed NRC and NPR. “Mere airing of the views by Mr. Thackeray in favour of CAA does not show there are differences among coalition partners of Maha Vikas Aghadi (comprising Congress, Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party),” he said and added that a meeting of coalition partners will be held shortly before the budget session that begins from Monday.

282,2020/02/22,Government city bus stand to be opened in a month in Udupi,"The facility, constructed on 34 cents, will provide better facilities to passengers

The government city bus stand, which has been constructed at a cost of ₹4 crore near the private city bus stand, is expected to be inaugurated within a month.

While low-floor government city buses were introduced here about three-and-a-half years ago, there was no bus stand for them to wait. People had to wait either under the sun during the summer or stand under their umbrellas during the monsoon.

The new bus stand, constructed on 34 cents, will provide a proper place for the passengers. This bus stand will be a two-storey building.

16 shops

The platform for the passengers to wait is on the ground floor. The entire building will have 16 shops, including a cafeteria and a hall on the top floor. A 1,000 sqft. area has been marked for the parking of two-wheelers, while 800 sqft. has been set aside for four-wheelers.

Sources in the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) said that tenders had already been floated for the occupancy of the shops in the building. The shops will start functioning after the inauguration of the bus stand, sources said.

Aruna S.N., Divisional Controller, KSRTC, Mangaluru Division, said that the new stand will be inaugurated within three to four weeks. “Presently, there are 28 low-floor city buses operating in Udupi city,” he said.

The operation of the city buses was a monopoly of the private sector, when the State decided to introduce low-floor city buses under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) scheme, about three-and-a-half years ago.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/hi0wvm/article30887097.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22MNBUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/government-city-bus-stand-to-be-opened-in-a-month-in-udupi/article30887098.ece
283,2020/02/22,Kundapura’s ‘Pumpwell flyover’ likely to open before monsoon,"Shobha Karandlaje reviews work progress

Udupi-Chikkamagaluru MP Shobha Karandlaje on Friday said work on the four-lane NH 66, including the flyover at Shastri Circle, in Kundapura will be completed before the onset of monsoon.

Speaking after reviewing the progress of the work on the four-lane highway, a vehicular underpass at Basrur Moorkai and the flyover at Shastri Circle undertaken by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), Ms. Karandlaje said she has asked concessionaire, M/s. Navayuga Udupi Tollway Pvt. Ltd., to expedite the work.

A representative of Navayuga informed the MP that the Shastri Circle flyover would be completed by April and Basrur Moorkai by June. Ms. Karandlaje, however, did not give any date for the formal opening of the two structures.

Later, she told The Hindu that the works are expected to be completed in a couple of months.

Work on four-laning NH 66 in Kundapura town between Vinayaka Theatre and Shastri Circle (about 2 km) is moving at a snail’s pace thereby affecting life in the coastal town. Vehicles have been diverted on service roads on either side of the main carriageway, while the work is being undertaken bit by bit.

NHAI, which did not plan a vehicular underpass at the busy Basrur Moorkai in the initial stage, bowed to public pressure and introduced the underpass.

Shastri Circle flyover is as old as the Pumpwell Circle flyover of Mangaluru and is likely to witness decennial celebrations of the construction soon.

Dedicated train

Ms. Karandlaje was also asked about the introduction of the recently announced Yeshwantpur-Vasco-da-Gama train via Udupi and Karwar that was expected to drastically cut short the journey timing. She said Minister of State for Railways Suresh C. Angadi, who had announced the service, would announce its introduction too.

284,2020/02/22,‘Project cost of Ram temple yet to be estimated’,"Pejawar seer says construction of temple will not begin on Ramotsava Day as projected

The seer of Pejawar Mutt Vishwaprasanna Tirtha, who is a trustee of the 15-member Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirtha Kshetra Trust, said on Friday that the project cost of the Ram temple to be built at Ayodhya is yet to be estimated.

Speaking to presspersons, he said the construction of the temple would not begin on the Ramotsava Day as projected. Many people will gather in Ayodhya on Ramotsava Day and hence it would not be possible to begin the construction work on that day. The date of beginning the construction has not been decided yet.

He said that members of the committee to look after the construction work were yet to be nominated. Nripendra Mishra had been nominated as chairman of the construction committee, which will have to finalise the designs and the date of laying the foundation stone.

The seer said that the trust would announce the details of the bank account to be opened in State Bank of India for the construction. People can contribute their donations to the account, he said.

The seer said that the construction of the temple required “satwik” strength. Hence, people should resume evening ‘bhajans’ at their homes, which was once common across the country.

286,2020/02/22,"One Indian weighing 70 kg, uses 1500-kg car to travel: Pawan Goenka","‘Need personal transport designed to move one person’

Indians use cars too big by size for moving a single person and the fate met by Tata Nano was unfortunate, Mahindra & Mahindra MD Pawan Goenka said.

He also conceded the automobile industry did add to pollution and pitched for adopting means to reduce it.

The Tatas had discontinued Nano after a poor response to the 600-cc ₹1-lakh car. Many experts had blamed its utilitarian product pitch in a country where owning a car was seen as a lifestyle necessity as the reason for the failure.

“It is very unfortunate that the Nano didn’t do very well,” Mr. Goenka said, speaking at an alumni event organised by his alma mater IIT-Kanpur here.

He said Indians, weighing 65-70 kg, use an entire 1,500 kg car to travel individually, hinting at the wastage of resources that go into making the big car move.

“We need to have personal transport that is more tuned to moving a single person,” he said.

Keeping the same requirement in mind, Mr. Goenka said his company had launched a smaller car, which should be hitting the market soon.

He also acknowledged that automobiles at present contributed 7% of the carbon dioxide and a fifth of particulate matter, PM 2.5, and every effort should be made to reduce the impact.

Connected cars

He also said India can lead the race in connected cars due to its prowess on the information technology front.

There is ‘a lot of work’ happening in electric vehicles as well with start-ups dedicated to niche areas such as batteries, charging infrastructure, two-wheelers and three-wheelers mushrooming, he said.

287,2020/02/22,"Warren Buffett defends investments in stocks, which fuelled record Berkshire profit","Berkshire ‘fully prepared’ for his death

Warren Buffett on Saturday defended Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s decision to invest heavily in the stocks of companies such as Apple Inc, while giving new details about how Berkshire Hathaway is prepared for his death, in an annual letter to shareholders.

The letter, widely read on Wall Street, came as Berkshire Hathaway posted record full-year earnings of $81.42 billion that nearly doubled its previous record from 2017, largely as a result of accounting rule changes that require the company to report paper gains and losses from its stock holdings with net income.

Despite those gains, Berkshire Hathaway’s stock has underperformed the broad U.S. stock market by gaining 11.7% over the last 12 months, compared with a 20.3% gain in the S&P 500 over the same time.

In his letter, Mr. Buffett focused on his company’s investments in the stock of companies such as Apple at a time when the conglomerate has struggled to find whole companies to buy, while also highlighting the growth of its core insurance businesses. Mr. Buffett noted that the returns in the insurance businesses were especially strong compared with the low yields on long-term U.S. Treasuries.

“If something close to current rates should prevail over the coming decades and if corporate tax rates also remain near the low level businesses now enjoy, it is almost certain that equities will over time perform far better than long-term, fixed-rate debt instruments.”

The 89-year-old assured that Berkshire is prepared for the eventual departures of himself and vice-chairman Charlie Munger, 96.

“Charlie and I long ago entered the urgent zone,” he wrote. “But shareholders need not worry: Your company is 100% prepared for our departure.” He gave new details about what will happen to his shares in the company after his death, noting he expects it will take 12 to 15 years for his estate to fully liquidate his position in the company.

He wrote, “I myself feel comfortable that Berkshire shares will provide a safe and rewarding investment during the disposal period.”",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/pmplgv/article30891265.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23BUBERKSHIRE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/warren-buffett-defends-investments-in-stocks-which-fuelled-record-berkshire-profit/article30891266.ece
288,2020/02/22,Litmus test for a judicial clean-up order,"The next Assembly polls will prove whether the Supreme Court stand on criminal candidates has the desired effect

Last week’s Supreme Court judgment, on February 13, 2020, by Justices R.F. Nariman and S. Ravindra Bhat, marks an important and possibly far-reaching step towards reining in the political establishment as far as fielding candidates with criminal antecedents is concerned. This judgment goes well beyond the Court’s earlier orders of 2002 and 2003 that made it obligatory for all candidates to provide self-sworn affidavits of criminal cases pending against them in any court of law.

By virtue of this order, the Court has also shifted part of the onus on political parties, ruling that they must do much more to publicise the criminal antecedents of candidates that they have selected to contest both parliamentary and State Assembly elections. It would no longer be sufficient to cite “winnability” as the criterion. Citing figures of the alarming increase in the number of such persons selected as candidates across the political spectrum, the order asks parties contesting elections to henceforth explain why persons without criminal blemish could not have been chosen instead. While the judgments of 2002 and 2003 were important, and emanated after a prolonged struggle by the Association for Democratic Reforms, they did not have the desired impact on either the political establishment or indeed on voter choices: the present Lok Sabha has an all-time high of 43% of its members having one or more criminal cases against them.

As Election Commissioner and subsequently Chief Election Commissioner, and in the years thereafter, I have frequently expressed myself against “muscle” and “money” power, which have became the bane of our political system. Indeed “money” power has moved us in the direction of a plutocracy.

Both these two ills need urgent course correction, preferably from within the Executive itself. It surely cannot augur well for us that criminality within Parliament grew from 24% in 2004 to 30% in 2009, to 34% in 2014 and 43%in 2019. Almost half these cases were/are for alleged heinous offences such as murder, attempt to murder, rape and kidnapping.

Extent of offence

In turn, political parties and candidates have often voiced their concern that cases tend to be foisted on them by political opponents. When the Election Commission of India (ECI) recommended to the government that legislation was warranted to exclude those candidates against whom charges had been framed by a court of law for heinous offences punishable by imprisonment of five years and more, the Parliamentary Committee that had been set up to examine the proposal unanimously ruled against the ECI recommendation; perhaps the most vociferous voice was that of the late legal luminary, Ram Jethmalani, who was a member of the committee. He pointed out that he had dealt with many such cases arising out of political vendetta. Even when we met after I had retired from the ECI, I was unable to convince him of my point of view.

Of course, not all first information reports lodged against political players are criminal in intent. The violation of Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as a result of civil protest is one such example. The case of a Medha Patkar or other social activists can hardly be considered criminal. Which is why the ECI, for over two long decades, has addressed various Prime Ministers to pass legislation on the ground that charges framed by a court of law for only heinous offences, and cases registered (not on the anvil of elections, but up to one year prior) would amount to a “ reasonable restriction” and that such a person be barred from contest. But so far to no avail.

Voter behaviour

Although the recent judgment has decreed that political parties will give much wider publicity to the criminal antecedents of their candidates, it is possible that this alone may not suffice. Voter behaviour is most often conditioned by their own immediate needs. The distribution of “freebies”, for instance, was often a one-way street, of candidates “offering” money and goodies. Voter behaviour has since begun to change. Voters now often enough tend to demand money and freebies. With our criminal justice system clogged with cases and lawyers fees often far beyond what many can afford, the local “don” standing for elections, who promises delivery of rough and ready justice, is often seen as the messiah on hand. All too often these cases involve bread and butter issues, from land and irrigation dispute resolution, to matters involving family honour. In such cases this “Robin Hood’ contestant is actually a preferred choice, which helps to explain that where muscle and money get combined in the rural landscape, they often win by large margins. This was not always the case. In the 1970s and 1980s, the “don” was content to support the local political bigwig with his muscle, crowd-pulling capacity and money, hoping that once elections were over, the elected leader would help the “don” in turn, not least to help wipe out his string of cases. By the 1990s the muscle man decided that this was not good enough. He decided to instead help himself to the fruits of political power by entering the electoral fray. Not all such players were men: witness the life and death of Phoolan Devi who came into political power on the power of a gun, and faded out too in the same manner.

Wait and watch

So far whatever significant electoral reforms have taken place have emanated from the Supreme Court. For critics of this present order, I would remind them of None of the Above (NOTA) and the July 10, 2013 Order in the Lily Thomas vs Union of India case, wherein a parliamentarian or legislator convicted of an offence that leads to a sentence of two years and more will be debarred from contesting an election for six years after his or her prison term ends.

It is therefore prudent to await the next important Assembly elections on the anvil — in Bihar and West Bengal. No doubt the political parties will once again bat for the “winnability” factor in their selections. It remains to be seen how the recent judgment will affect the choices of the political establishment and whether it will have the desired effect in eliminating or significantly purging criminality from future legislatures.

289,2020/02/22,Terror in Germany: On far-right extremist rampage near Frankfurt,"The rise of far-right groups poses a serious threat to peace and security in Europe

Wednesday’s bloody rampage in Hanau town near Frankfurt by a suspected far-right extremist has heightened concerns over recurrent hate crimes in Germany, home to the largest number of immigrants from the recent refugee crisis. The incident, coming just days after 12 men were arrested for plotting attacks on mosques, is a chilling reminder of the threats to peace and stability in a European powerhouse. In separate attacks, the perpetrator gunned down nine people, including a pregnant woman and youngsters, in two local shisha bars, before killing himself and his mother. Authorities have established the gunman’s extreme xenophobic beliefs using online evidence, where the 43-year-old attacker had advocated the elimination of people across continents. Crucial to investigators is the similarity of the lethal weapon wielded on Wednesday to that used in the 2016 Munich mall shootings. The comparison has brought into focus the role of Germany’s intelligence agencies. While the latter have often stressed the growing number of actual and potential incidents they deal with, rights groups have called into question their level of efficiency.

The latest violence must awaken those who take the complacent view that the threat from the far-right is concentrated in Germany’s eastern regions. The State of Hesse, where Wednesday’s attack took place, was witness last year to the brutal murder of a Christian Democratic Union (CDU) official by a neo-Nazi; Walter Lübcke was targeted for his courageous defence of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s liberal refugee policy. In 2017, the mayor of Altena, in North Rhine-Westphalia province, known for admitting a larger share of asylum-seekers, narrowly escaped a knife attack. These are evidently not isolated crimes, as the Alternative for Germany (AfD), the country’s largest opposition in the Bundestag, has stepped up its anti-Islam and anti-immigration campaign. But the recent political developments in Thuringia State have exposed divisions within the CDU on the approach to ward off the threat from the far-right. The local unit’s move to side with the AfD to keep the left-wing Die Linke party out of power forced the resignation of the party chief and the country’s Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. A party that is otherwise a staunch champion of liberal democratic values in the EU can ill-afford to dither on a question of key importance to unity within Germany and across the EU. Moreover, as a principal constituent of the European People’s Party in the EU Parliament, the German CDU must wean the group away from hardline forces, especially in Hungary and Poland. These are lessons to be learnt from the Hanau massacre.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/terror-in-germany-the-hindu-editorial-on-far-right-extremist-rampage-near-frankfurt/article30883640.ece
290,2020/02/22,Asleep at the wheel: On Tiruppur road accident,"The Tiruppur accident shows that the Centre and States are yet to take road safety seriously

Even in a country inured to death and mayhem on its roads everyday, Thursday’s crash that killed 19 bus passengers on a national highway, at Tiruppur, Tamil Nadu, comes as a shock. Every day, thousands board government-run and private buses for inter-city travel, placing their lives in the hands of transport operators and the authorities whose duty it is to guarantee road safety. Unfortunately, Central and State officials feel little compulsion to do their duty when it comes to road safety. Those whose lives were snuffed out on the journey from Bengaluru to Ernakulam in a Kerala government bus should not become faceless additions to the list of fatalities on Indian roads. In 2018, that toll was a staggering 1,51,417 lives. A preliminary inquiry points to human error involving the container lorry driver who is suspected to have fallen asleep at the wheel. The probe is also looking at whether the container was overloaded, and lacked an assistant. It is reasonable to assume that a helper would alert a driver to danger. Whatever the proximate factors, the Tiruppur crash highlights the gap that India must bridge before it can hope to bring down road fatalities by at least half during the current decade. In fact, India is committed to achieving such a reduction under the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, and the promise was reiterated by Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari recently, at the Third Global Ministerial Conference on Road Safety, at Stockholm.

In spite of amendments made to the Motor Vehicles Act, and new engineering standards enforced for vehicle safety, the risk on the roads is on the rise. State governments responsible for enforcement remain apathetic and their derelict bureaucracies ignore safety laws in cities and highways. The cost of such indifference is borne by families of victims in the form of bereavement, loss of income and enduring trauma. Moreover, the economy is deprived of productivity and output. The latest World Bank assessment of India’s loss from road accidents, which was released at the Stockholm meet, points out that road users between 18-45 years constitute 69% of fatalities. Also, 54% of deaths and serious injuries occur mainly among vulnerable groups: pedestrians, cyclists and two-wheeler riders. In the Bank’s estimate, it will take an additional $109-billion of investment in 10 years to achieve a 50% reduction in road deaths. Mr. Gadkari has focused on removing dangerous ‘black spots’ on highways, making consultants and contractors liable for road conditions, and imposing stiffer penalties for traffic offences. The amended MV Act makes all this possible, but many State governments have baulked at enforcing it. It is imperative that the Centre forms an empowered Road Safety Board at the national level to advise States on all related concerns as envisaged under the MV Act, and makes State enforcement agencies accountable for safety.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/asleep-at-the-wheel-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-tiruppur-accident-and-road-safety/article30883634.ece
291,2020/02/22,Examination fever: Special classes prove a burden for students,"Many are calling helplines complaining about schools and coaching classes

With the onset of the examination season, helplines in the city are flooded with calls from students complaining about their schools and coaching classes “going overboard” with extra tutorial sessions. According to students — most of whom are preparing for Class 10 and second year pre-university board exams — the heavy and unrelenting schedule is leaving them fatigued.

According to Nagasimha G. Rao, director, Child Rights Trust, they have started receiving at least three such calls every day. “Students tell us that they are getting no rest at all and that their school managements are conducting several hours of special classes daily,” he said.

In a few extreme cases, students in many government and private schools are regularly being made to spend the night in school so that they can prepare for the SSLC examination, which will start in March. Other helplines, manned by psychologists and teachers, have also observed a spike in calls from worried students.

Bharathi Singh, founder of Samudra Foundation which counsels youth, said that the number of calls increase between January and April. “Now, we get at least 10 calls a day. More than the academic pressure, students are finding it difficult to deal with parental pressure and juggling classes,” she said. Ms. Singh has observed that in an attempt to de-stress, many students were ‘finding solace’ in their smartphones, tablets and other gadgets, and are at risk of becoming addicted to them.

Fr. Antony Sebastian, chairperson of the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said they would issue an advisory to schools to minimise the pressure on students and restrict special classes.

Some managements too have identified this “unhealthy” trend and are planning to send an advisory to their over 3,000 member-schools to stop this practice.

D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said that schools can conduct one hour of extra class in the morning and another in the evening. “But some schools conduct classes late into the night and others insist that their students remain in the school at night. This only promotes rote learning...,” he said.

Ms. Singh pointed out that many schools and colleges were segregating students in batches based on performance, which in turn can affect their morale. She cited the example of a student who topped his class regularly, but did not perform well for a brief period as he was ill. “The boy was made to sit in a class with students who scored around 50%. This affected him so much he decided to drop a year.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/xf5im3/article30886964.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21bgExam-helplinecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/examination-fever-special-classes-prove-a-burden-for-students/article30886965.ece

293,2020/02/22,Bengaluru police set to launch women hangout zones,"This is an initiative to enable women to reclaim public spaces that they are as much entitled to as men

When you drive by Silk Board between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. next week, don’t be surprised if you see an unusually large number of women simply hanging out in the area. The South East division police are set to launch an initiative that will see women reclaim public spaces that they are as much entitled to as men.

The police have identified eight spots – the Silk Board area being one of them – which will be converted into zones for women to “hang out”. This is part of the South East division police’s campaign to make Bengaluru more inclusive.

For two weeks from February 24, women have been invited to occupy public spaces at night.

“...Places have been identified where women feel uncomfortable at night. The goal is to make them feel safe. Come join us for a fortnight from 24/02 to 8/3 every evening from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.,” said Isha Pant, DCP (South East) on Twitter.

Areas identified

Other areas that have been identified include Dairy Circle, Koramangala BDA Complex and Madiwala Market street. Most of these areas are usually dominated by men.

The police hope that their campaign will encourage more working women to step out of the house after a day in office.

DCP Pant pointed out that when men return from work, they have more options to go out unlike women who always have to worry about their safety. “Women in the city fear stepping out, especially after dark. This is an effort to empower women and help them to claim their space. The places that we have identified will have the necessary amenities that have been provided with the help of civic agencies, and working women will be able to hang out from 7-10 p.m.,” she added.

Citizens have responded positively to the initiative, though many pointed out that well-lit streets will go a long way in making the city safer for women.

“Fantastic initiative. If BBMP ensures 100% street lights are working, we will have a more sustainable solution too,” said the Mahadevapura Task Force-Roads and Traffic.

Another person requested the DCP to include Hebbal bus stop, which is under a flyover, in her list ‘as waiting for a bus towards Yelahanka is a scary experience owing to the lack of bright lights’.

Many women felt that it was sad that zones had to be marked out for them, but welcomed the initiative.

“It is a sad admission of how unsafe the rest of the city is,"" says Meenakshi Maiyamma, a resident of CKA Layout in south Bengaluru.

The police have invited citizens to come up with suggestions to make their campaign more successful.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/75ov08/article30886886.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21Bgwomen-safetynewcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bengaluru-police-set-to-launch-women-hangout-zones/article30886890.ece
294,2020/02/22,"Metro ridership can go from 4 lakh to 15 lakh by 2030, says IISc. report","‘For this, BMRCL needs to build Inner Ring Metro Corridor’

A study by the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) has revealed that if Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) builds an Inner Ring Metro Corridor, the ridership for Namma Metro will increase significantly. If implemented, the number of people using the metro will increase from 3.9 lakh per day to 15.22 lakh a day by 2030. On the other hand, without an inner ring metro corridor, by 2030, Namma Metro (Phases 1, 2, 2A and 2B) will see a ridership of a little over 8 lakh.

IISc. had earlier proposed to the State government to consider building an inner ring metro corridor that connects core areas of the city such as Mehkri Circle, Ulsoor, Domlur, Ejipura, Dairy Circle, NIMHANS, Lalbagh, K.R. Market, Vijayanagar, and Rajajinagar. To achieve its potential, the proposed inner ring metro (IRM) has to be connected to existing, under-construction and sanctioned Namma Metro lines. IISc. had also suggested that it should be a tunnel network.

The proposed IRM constitutes 23 new stations and has six interchanges, with a total length of 34 km. Ashish Verma, Associate Professor, Transportation Systems Engineering, Department of Civil Engineering, IISc., said, “Any circular city in the world, which has good public transport, has both radial and ring lines. Bengaluru, too, needs such inner ring metro corridors. At present, the whole inner part of the city is left out. Considering this, we had proposed the plan to the government, and BMRCL had asked us to come out with an evaluation.”

The study indicates that in addition to increased metro ridership to 15 lakh, the proposed network will help reduce fuel consumption. Emission rate will come down as people will shift to public transport.

If the IRM becomes a reality, it will increase the metro network to 207 km with 148 stations and 13 interchanges spread across the city. The study states that by 2030, the maximum ridership across the network – 48,425 passengers per hour per direction (pphpd) – will be between Whitefield and Ujjwal stations.

The maximum ridership on the IRM line is estimated to be 33,016 pphpd between Hosahalli and Padarayanapura stations. The ridership between Sandal Soap Factory station and IISc. station is projected at 24,477 pphpd in 2030.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/z89zya/article30884514.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21bgMetro-ridershipcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/metro-ridership-can-go-from-4-lakh-to-15-lakh-by-2030-says-iisc-report/article30884515.ece
295,2020/02/22,Proposal for toy train track around Bengaluru lakes draws ire,"Plans for a third lake include an artificial island with a food court

A proposal to lay tracks, run toy trains and build vintage train stations around two lakes – Mallathahalli and the one in J.P. Park in Rajarajeshwari Nagar – has drawn the ire of conservation activists.

The proposals by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) for rejuvenation of the lakes show train tracks passing through Mallathahalli lake at two points, a glass house on an artificial island and hanging bridges connecting the island to the bund.

A third lake in the area, Halagevaderahalli lake, will have an artificial island, which will be home to a food court.

Senior civic officials said they had little to do with the plans.

“We have not made these proposals. It is part of the government's directions,” a senior civic official claimed.

The BBMP has submitted them to the Karnataka Tank Development and Conservation Authority (KTDCA) for clearance, which is unlikely to come, said sources in the civic body.

While the proposals are yet to be ratified by the Technical Advisory Committee in the civic body and the KTDCA, the government has already allocated ₹50.5 crore for rejuvenation of the three lakes. The allocation was part of the new action plan approved by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa in September 2019 as part of the ‘Nava Nagarothana’ scheme.

Citizens’ groups that have been at the forefront of ensuring that Bengaluru’s lakes are rejuvenated in a sustainable manner are baffled by the proposal.

“These developments will effectively kill the natural lake ecosystem and will turn them into amusement parks,” said V. Ramprasad, convenor, Friends of Lakes.

“Such developments clearly violate multiple High Court and National Green Tribunal orders, and will face legal challenges,” said Leo Saldanha, Environment Support Group (ESG).

The Karnataka High Court had recently stayed a proposal to install a 20-feet Shiva statue in the middle of Begur lake. The two-part N.K. Patil report on lakes, part of a 2012 High Court order, stipulates that even a walkway should not be built on the bund of a lake as concretisation affects the flow of water into and out of the lake, said Mr. Saldanha.

The proposals for the two lakes in R.R. Nagar mention construction of a retention wall.

Both Mallathahalli and J.P. Park lakes are part of R.R. Nagar Assembly constituency, earlier represented by Munirathna, now disqualified for defecting to the BJP. A bypoll is yet to be held owing to an election petition challenging Mr. Munirathna's election pending in the Karnataka High Court.

Sources in both the BJP and the BBMP claimed that the lake rejuvenation proposals are championed by the former MLA.

Despite repeated attempts, Mr. Munirathna was not available for comment.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/kobw9i/article30884485.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BGLAKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/proposal-for-toy-train-track-around-bengaluru-lakes-draws-ire/article30884486.ece

297,2020/02/22,Parking charges on East Tambaram side increased,"Train commuters say they don’t want to shell out ₹200 more every month

The increase in parking fees for two-wheelers at Tambaram (East) railway station parking lot has not gone down well with a section of commuters.

They complain the sudden increase in parking charges was unexpected. The increased fares, introduced by the Southern Railway, came into effect from February 1.

“Earlier we were paying ₹ 400 a month. From this month, the charges have been increased by ₹ 200 more. Even, the daily parking charges amount has been increased from ₹ 20 to 30, which is a steep increase,” said a commuter.

B. Krishnan, a resident of Camp Road, “The monthly charges for two-wheelers at Chetpet railway station is only ₹ 300.”

P. Dayanand, an EMU commuter and a social activist, says, “Though the increase in daily parking charge is nominal, the monthly parking charge to ₹ 600 is too much. A commuter travelling by first class in an EMU pays ₹ 545 for the monthly pass and those travelling by second class pay ₹ 250. The parking charges should be brought down to ₹ 350 a month. There is no clear picture on how this amount was arrived at nor according to fare rental value.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/parking-charges-on-east-tambaram-side-increased/article30890003.ece
298,2020/02/22,Fresh ideas for a clean neighbourhood,"Medavakkam residents want the local body to initiate a system of promoting source segregation of waste, and also construct an underground drainage system

Source segregation is key to maintaining a clean neighbourhood. Residents of Medavakkam seem to know this quite well and to have realised how other neighbourhoods have been faring since they started segregation of biodegredable and non-bio-degredable waste. Apparently, some residents have made a request to the Chengalpattu District Collectorate to implement source segregation in their neighbourhood.

If implemented well, residents say, the water-bodies in the area will get better, as dumping of garbage there will end.

They also want an underground drainage system to be introduced in areas coming under the jurisdiction of the Medavakkam Village Panchayat. Currently, in the absence of these facilities, the three waterbodies — Medavakkam Chinna Eri, Periya Eri and Sitheri — are in a sorry state.

It is a common sight to see residents discharging sewage through stormwater drains in Medavakkam Chinna Eri, which should carry rainwater. Water tankers draw water through long pipes attached to a well.

The residents say a portion of the waterbody has been levelled for the tankers to enter the lake area and collect water.

A cricket practice net facility has come up on the lake area. The water-holding area in the waterbody is submerged under a profusion of water hyacinth.

The once-sprawling waterbodies are used as a dumping yard and an open toilet. The excess water from Medavakkam Chinna Eri flows to Periya Eri and to Sitheri from Periya Eri.

Steps should be taken to arrest discharge of sewage through stormwater drains into the southern side of Chinna Eri. The sluice gate at Periya Eri through which excess water is let out to Sitheri, is broken.

Earlier, drivers of water tankers supplying water in and around the IT Corridor used to draw water from Sithalapakkam - Ponmar Road lake. Due to copious rains during the north-east monsoon, the waterbodies got filled up.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fresh-ideas-for-a-clean-neighbourhood/article30889599.ece
299,2020/02/22,Another waterbody comes back to life,"EFI revives Alleri lake at Sanatorium

Here’s another milestone that has been added to EFI’s list. The environmental group that has been restoring many bone-dry lakes in the city recently revived Alleri lake at Sanatorium.

Located on the premises of Madras Export Processing Zone (MEPZ) at Tambaram Sanatorium, Alleri lake is an important waterbody. It is located between the larger Kadaperi lake and the Thiruneermalai lake. Over the years, due to urbanisation and industrialisation, the lake witnessed massive pollution leading to loss of habitat characteristics and freshwater quality.

“Through a collaborative conservation effort with MEPZ, DXC Technologies and EFI, the lake has now been scientifically revived,” says Arun Krishnamurthy, founder of EFI.

The restoration process at the waterbody involved removal of garbage and other debris from the water-holding area. A wetland to purify the inflowing water into the lake was constructed and the recharge well was connected with sedimentation tanks. Plantation of native fruit-bearing and nectar-bearing saplings and protective fencing are a few other features.

There would be a lot of information about the lake to take in if one were to take a walk around the lake. There are boards with information on the lake and its ecology. Peripheral wall painting and birds’ nests within the bamboo garden at the lake are among the other highlights. “The restoration works would increase the storage capacity by 40% and improve groundwater recharge,” said Arun.

Following restoration, the lake was inaugurated by Banwarilal Purohit, Governor of Tamil Nadu.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/another-waterbody-comes-back-to-life/article30889530.ece
300,2020/02/22,Afforestation exercise at Mahabalipuram,"Uttarakhand-based NGO has planted more than 1,900 saplings on an area of seven acres of land

Sankalptaru, a non-governmental organisation based in Uttarakhand, is raising a forest in Mahabalipuram on East Coast Road, in memory of former President of India Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.

According to C. Vajiravelu, a member of the organisation, more than 1,900 tree saplings have been planted under phase one of the project. The saplings will be watered through a drip irrigation system. In the next phase, another 2,000 saplings will be planted.

Saplings of jamun, amla, chikoo, pungan, illupai, neermaruthu, malai vembu, mango, coconut, cashew, fig, and custard apple have been planted.

The organisation is active in more than 20 States across the country. It has planted trees in hilly and coastal areas and in plateaus. In Tamil Nadu, the organisation aims to plant more than one lakh tree saplings by the end of 2020.

The organisation has another initiative called “plant trees online” where people can call and ask the organisation to plant a tree sapling on special occasions like birthdays and anniversaries. The helpline number is 74099 99111. For details about this initiative, call C.

301,2020/02/22,Open danger at Madipakkam,"Residents want a stormwater drain network to be linked to Keezhkattalai Eri

An open drain network on Medavakkam Main Road in Madipakkam is posing threat to the safety of motorists.

The whole of the stormwater drain network has stagnant sewage and the stormwater drains in residential localities in Madipakkam — Vigneshwara Nagar, Balaji Nagar, Perumal Nagar, and Lakshmi Nagar — are dumped with trash and construction debris.

P. Sekar, a motorist and a resident of Madipakkam, says, “The entire network has been lying open for more than six months and poses a risk to the safety of motorists and the pedestrians.” He says a few accidents have taken place. “Recently, a youngster working in a supermarket fell into the drain. The area also lacks proper lights,” he says.

The arterial stormwater drain network should carry rainwater from stormwater drains from neighbourhoods in Madipakkam to Keezhkattalai Eri, says G. P. Babu, secretary, Federation of Moovarasampet Welfare Associations (FMWA).

But no steps have been taken to link the drain to the waterbody. “The depth of the canal is around five feet. The open canal poses a health hazard and is a breeding ground for mosquitoes,” adds Sekar.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/open-danger-at-madipakkam/article30889433.ece

In the absence of a zebra-crossing and pedestrian-signal at the intersection of 100-Feet Velachery Bypass Road and Velachery Main Road at Vijayanagar in Velachery, pedestrians find it unsafe to cross the intersection.

“Motorists do not slow down to allow pedestrians cross the signal; they jump signals and drive in a rash manner. We have to run and cross the intersection,” says B.

303,2020/02/22,Construction work under way at Saligramam library,"The full-time library will have an exclusive section for those preparing for competitive examinations

An additional floor is being constructed at the full-time branch library in Saligramam. The facility has a dedicated section for those preparing for various competitive examinations.

According to the District Library Officer, S. Elango Chandrashekhar, the 1,200 sqft facility is being constructed at cost of ₹.25,15,000 which was allocated under MLA Local Area Development Scheme.

The Virugambakkam MLA, V.N. Viugai Ravi laid the foundation stone for the construction last week. “Saligramam library has a large collection of books meant for competitive examinations such as Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC), Raliway Recruitment Board (RRB), University Grants Commission (UGC) and Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS). They are utilised well by a good number of its members. As the existing facility is cramped, we wanted to have a facility exclusively for the benefit of aspirants. There are similar plans for the Anna Nagar library as well,” says the District Library Officer.

The library which was opened as a part-time library on February 7, 1998, got upgraded as a full-time branch library on May 23, 2016. As of today, the library has 10,106 members.

“The library has members from faraway places like Koyambedu, Maduravoyal and Nerkundram. Therefore, we have requested the Virugambakkam MLA to set up a part-time library either at Chinmaya Nagar or at Elango Nagar,” says the official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ymxfab/article30889147.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23DCTNGRSALIGRAMAMLIBRARY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/construction-work-under-way-at-saligramam-library/article30889159.ece

305,2020/02/22,Seized vehicles eat into road space at Karayanchavdi junction,"The footpath has not been spared either, say residents

A row of vehicles can be found dumped along a section of Poonamallee-Avadi Road — that is, from Karayanchavdi junction to the Office of Assistant Commissioner of Police (Poonamallee traffic). These are vehicles that had been seized by the traffic police. The presence of these vehicles hinders free movement of traffic at the narrow Karayanchavdi junction.

Those travelling to Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur and Vellore districts use this intersection; and therefore, it is extremely busy. Moreover, there are many healthcare and educational institutions, in addition to commercial establishments, in the vicinity; hence, traffic movement and other factors at the junction have to be well-regulated. However, residents complain of seized vehicles occupying a considerable road space at the junction. Interestingly, the premises of the traffic police is quite spacious. “These vehicles kept near the junction pose a threat to the safety of motorists and pedestrians. They have occupied the footpath as well,” says S. Murugesan, a resident of Poonamallee. As per norms, vehicles seized by the police are considered court property as they are under litigation. Till the respective cases are disposed of, the onus of protecting them lies with the respective police stations. It should be noted that in December 2019, the City Police Commissionerate with the help of Greater Chennai Corporation auctioned more than 12,000 unclaimed vehicles including 1,000 four-wheelers.

306,2020/02/22,Burrows of biodiversity,"During a low-tide hour, in the Adyar estuarine area, crabs put up a performance, demonstrating what they do every day — which is, keeping the mudflats healthy and rich

February 21, 2020;

12:51 p.m.

This story had to be narrated in medias res, going to the central part of the sequence of events, just to meet the objective of the exercise — which is about putting an elucidating spotlight on mudflats. So, let us fast forward to 1: 30 p.m., skipping the first 39 minutes of the trail.

This mudflat walk is at the Adyar esturaine system, near the Besant Nagar beach. M. Yuvan, member of Madras Naturalists’ Society, knows the land like the back of his palm, and enjoys easy, first-name familiarity with some of its residents — now, they are known to the wider world as horn-eyed ghost crab, ring-legged fiddler crab, red ghost crab and sand-bubble crab, to name only a few.

Yuvan has checked the low-tide chart for the day — it is 1:27 p.m. We arrive at the mudflats at 1:30 p.m, with the Adyar river mouth right behind us, not too near but well within sight. The estuarine system begins at what is known as the Broken Bridge.

The magic unfolds for us straightaway. The sediment-rich mudflats exposed by the low tide teem with crabs. The prima donna is clearly the ring-legged fiddler crab, which shows up in impressive numbers, and seems to own the space.

“Ring-legged fiddler crabs as well as sand-bubble crabs are easily identified by the finely-rounded sediment-balls found around their burrows,” explains Yuvan.

Today, the sand-bubble crabs are less forthcoming, and stay well within their burrows.

The role of crabs in the soil system can’t be overemphasised.

“They are masters of bio-turbation; with their burrowing, they work the soil, keep it aerated and promote aerobic conditions,” says Yuvan.

The mudflats at the Adyar estuarine system are largely inaccessible, especially if one tries to access it via Urur Olcott Kuppam near the Besant Nagar beach.

This is actually a good thing, as it would ensure the habitat is less disturbed.

However, we notice a spread of polluted water in its characteristic colour and consistency. Sadly, natural systems of this kind in urban environments are usually hardly inaccessible for sewage and other pollutants.

Now, during the first half of the trail, which involved walking from the end of the Besant Nagar beach to the estuarine system, the sea was sufficiently receding to expose some fascinating clams.

Suddenly uncovered, the tellin clam would try to quickly burrow itself back in the sandy soil, as they had to get away from the prying eyes of predators — especially crows and olive sea snails — as soon as they can.

Explains Yuvan: “The Olive sea snail preys on the tellin clams, as do crows. They just have a three-second window to get the clams. Usually, the clams burrow to safety in time.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ro2ad8/article30889019.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23dcCommonAdyarEstuaryMudflat2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/burrows-of-biodiversity/article30889026.ece
307,2020/02/22,Have you ever walked down the mudflats?,"Mudflats are an ecosystem in themselves; but what they have to offer is often not obvious. Worse still, we may be muddying the waters. Here is a look at the mudflats at the estuarine systems in Covelong and Adyar

February 20, 2020;

7 a.m.

It’s a walk down the mudflats at Kundrukadu in Covelong that are part of the Muttukadu backwaters and estuarine system.

The time to suss out the ecosystem was randomly chosen — significantly, the day’s tide chart was not consulted.

It however turns out to be an opportune hour to explore the mudflats.

A fisherman, who is winding up the morning session, having caught crabs in the backwaters and is getting ready to give a sales-pitch at the market — either the one at Covelong or the one at Kelambakkam — points out the low tide has set in.

They sure can read the backwaters effortlessly and accurately tell the nature of a tidal action — low or high — and how far a tidal period has progressed.

Later, consulting the tide chart for February 20, this writer discovered that one of the two low-tide periods began at 6:47 a.m., and this fisherman was working on the basis of an instinctual understanding of the inter-tidal zone honed by experience.

Exposed as result of the low tide, the mudflats suggest an abundance of life, without any of the small crawlies running around the space to demonstrate the fact.

There are innumerable small burrows. What lies around these tiny passageways into the earth leaves one in no doubt about the nature of the residents.

These are clumps of earth-balls, seemed to have been shaped to near-perfection, as if with a precision instrument. Certain crab species are said to “execute” this “accidental craftsmanship” while sifting through sediments for their feed.

Anirudh Kishore, project associate, Care Earth Trust, who is currently engaged in a study of the region, including the Muttukadu backwaters and estuarine system, as part of an exercise that seeks to identify what can be done to ensure water sufficiency over the years, states mudflats are rarely seen as an ecosystem by themselves, and that they should be.

“They may be a huge component of the estuarine system with its brackish water – as is the case with the Muttukadu backwaters — but mudflats are so rich that they deserve to be seen and studied as an ecosystem in themselves. They are essentially coastal wetlands formed out of deposited sediments,” explains Anirudh.

A key component

With nutrient-rich soil that supports many organisms, mudflats are part of what makes an estuarine system invaluable to man and animal.

He continues, “Estuarine systems and mudflats fit neatly into a few categories that come under a broad classification of ecosystems. When viewed against the services of ecosystems categorised by Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA), estuaries and mudflats have much to offer, but these benefits may not be obvious. This classification by MEA which has since been modified to address the little intricacies, are broadly: One, provisioning — those with market value, where an ecosystem supports people’s livelihoods such as fishing; two, regulating — flood control, water storage and purification and carbon sequestration; three, cultural — recreation such as eco-tourism; four, supporting — here, the various components of an ecosystem support the whole; together with other components, mudflats play a hugely supportive role.”

Anirudh lists out the benefits of mudflats: “They support the fishing community; an example being a proliferation of crabs, which create aerobic conditions by their burrowing activity. Mudflats help in not letting erosion take place as they don’t have loose soil. Depending on the kind of vegetation you find there, they also play a supportive role in carbon sequestration. As breeding and feeding grounds for organisms mudflats are invaluable.”

Problem of pollution

Anirudh says that protecting the Muttukadu estuarine system would include arresting sewage inflows.

Raghavan Murti, president, Union of Tower Association at House of Hiranandani Upscale in Egattur on Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR), points out that the Muttukadu backwaters, found between OMR and East Coast Road (ECR), gets polluted by sewage inflows.

“Due to lack of sewage connections, residents on vast sections of OMR, including the Muttukadu region, depend on private sewage-clearing tankers. After being removed, the sewage is let into the Muttukadu backwaters. So, the Muttukadu Backwaters suffers from a double whammy — there is sewage being let into it, in this manner, and then there is the polluted water that comes in via the Buckingham Canal,” says Raghavan.

Anirudh explains what is at stake: “Untreated sewage contains nitrogen and phosphorous. Mudflat ecosystems have evolved organically to support life forms, and when these elements get introduced, they alter the functioning of the ecosystem, and as a consequence, living organisms suffer as they will be unable to adapt to these changes. The food chain gets disturbed. When sewage comes in, it will affect the growth of algae and some planktons, which form the base of the food chain.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/8s6584/article30888989.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23dccommonMuttukaduMudflat1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/have-you-ever-walked-down-the-mudflats/article30888991.ece
308,2020/02/22,Pursue your rights down the walkways,"A national conference in Pune seeks to empower pedestrians to fight for safe walking spaces

When you have lived in two metros or more in a manner that requires you to travel their length and breadth on a regular basis, there is always an improved understanding of pedestrian infrastructure. You end up seeing patterns, and sometimes the lack of them.

Having seen Chennai and Bengaluru, I could say both have a lot of ground to cover, in terms of improving pedestrian infrastructure.

In both metros, there is a need for pedestrians to assert their right to safe walking spaces. Residents of these cities can probably take a cue from groups in a few other Indian metros, especially Pune.

Issues concerning pedestrians will be in the spotlight at a national conference on the theme ‘Right to Walk’, organised by Parisar — a civil society organisation that plays an advocacy role, for sustainable development — on February 28 and 29 in Pune.

A note says that the conference would enumerate the rights that exist, identify the factors that undermine the rights of pedestrians and explore ways in which pedestrians must organise and fight for their rights.

“We shall look at other such movements and identify strategical alliances. The event will also enable activists and organisations to ideate on ways to move ahead. Finally, it will highlight the plight of pedestrians as well as the need for a strong collective action if the rights, which only exist on paper, are to be realised on the ground,” reads the release.

A panel discussion, for instance, will focus on why pedestrians are not vocal about issues like illegal parking on footpaths and clashes with motorists, and what empower pedestrians.

Rishi Aggarwal, a pedestrians’ rights advocate and one of the speakers at the event, says unfortunately most of these topics do not resonate with most Indians. He says a lot more needs to be done to improve walkability in cities.

Aggarwal founded the Walking Project in 2012, which is as an advocacy group for a safer, convenient and joyful walking experience in Mumbai.

“We need committed organisations that are advocates for walkablity infrastructure and this should be membership-driven,” says Aggarwal, who is founder and director of Mumbai Sustainability Centre. Members should be from the city and they should be those who use the footpath regularly.

Lack of confidence

In most cities, most pedestrians don’t demand a street that is friendly to their concerns. Most people may not be aware of their rights and when they do, they may lack the confidence to act. No city has an effective mass-based pedestrian pressure group, say the organisers.

A panel discussion on efforts taken by community to assert the right of pedestrians will have case studies from West Bengal, Bengaluru public transport and also from a gender perspective.

A panel discussion on “Pedestrian, air pollution and health” will discuss how pedestrian-friendly city is also a healthy city. Social groups and individuals who are interested in issues related to pedestrians are welcome to attend the conference.

309,2020/02/22,DMK cadre stage protest on Chennai’s Adyar River bed,"The party alleged irregularities in the construction of a flood protection wall at the river

Over the years, the city has witnessed numerous protests, on the roads, in public places and more recently on the sands of the Marina. On Saturday, the cadres of the DMK, the main Opposition party in the State, staged a protest at the Adyar river alleging irregularities in the construction of a flood protection wall.

With the river flowing as a sewage stream on one side, hundreds of DMK cadre, including women entered the river bed near Saidapet abbatoir, after navigating garbage. Led by former Mayor and Saidapet MLA Ma. Subramanian, and two other MLAs, P. Thayagam Kavi and S. Arvind Ramesh, they put up a makeshift stage on the river and shouted slogans against the ruling AIADMK government and the alleged irregularities.

A sizeable number of police personnel were deployed with two Deputy Commissioners of Police, Adyar and T. Nagar who also came down and monitored the situation since the protest was conducted without obtaining permission.

The Public Works Department (PWD) has started work to erect a flood protection wall from Jaffarkhanpet bridge upto Saidapet on the bank sides of the Adyar river. The width of the river here is shorter, when compared to other parts of the city. This area was one of the worst affected during the December 2015 deluge, Mr. Subramanian said.

The government allocated ₹104 crore for constructing a flood protection wall along the banks following repeated demands from the DMK in the Assembly.

“Though ₹104 crore was allocated, the wall is being constructed only for 875 meters by spending a mere ₹18 crore. The authorities claim that they had strengthened the banks in the remaining areas with soil from the river bed,” he said alleging irregularities.

“As per specifications, the wall should be constructed using M-sand but the contractor is using the dirty river sand. Hence the stability of wall is questionable. Moreover, water with chemical effluents is also used. The wall will not protect people during floods,” he charged.

Residents would be affected in flooding situations in Thiruneermalai, Burma colony, Ambedkar Colony, MGR Nagar, Shoolai Pallam, Sarathy Nagar and Jothiammal Nagar, Jothi Ramalingam Nagar, Yogi Thottam, Atthumagar, Samiyar Thottam and Kotturpuram.

The DMK MLAs said though they gave a complaint to PWD secretary, there was no response. The protesting cadre along with the three DMK MLAs were taken into custody by police and were detained in a wedding hall.

M.S. Mani, a DMK veteran and a resident of Saidapet, said: “I’m with the party since 1967. No political party has ever entered into the dirty river and conducted a protest here. We are the first the protest inside the river for a public cause.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/d4dt6w/article30887919.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22FEBTH-Adyarjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/dmk-cadre-stage-protest-on-chennais-adyar-river-bed/article30887920.ece
310,2020/02/22,"Chennai airport’s international arrival hall becomes departure hall, may open in March","Facilities have been made for two airlines to use this new hall as a departure hall, officials said

After repeated delays over the last five years, the arrival hall of the international terminal at Chennai airport may be put to use by mid-March. The only change is that the arrival hall has been converted into a departure hall now, and facilities have been made for two airlines to use this hall as a departure hall, sources said.

When the phase I modernisation of Chennai airport was completed in 2013, this arrival hall alone could not be opened as there were not adequate customs and immigration staff to shift the arrival operations from the old hall to the new one.

Since then, Airports Authorities of India (AAI) has made several attempts to open the hall but could not. Finally, it was decided to convert it into a departure hall to reduce congestion and use it in some way, sources said. The AAI had held talks with another airline but there was no further development.

Now, AAI officials have held discussions with two airlines who are prepared to use the hall for a few flights. “We have already made arrangements for additional check-in, security and immigration counters. We have held a few rounds of discussions with the two airlines and they have agreed to begin operations from March. A few issues have to be resolved and that should be done too, in the coming weeks,” an official said.

The existing international arrival hall has over 50 check in counters and about 20 immigration counters. Everyday, lakhs of passengers travel through it and the congestion has exacerbated recently. As a result, passengers wait endlessly for both security and immigration, officials said.

When the phase II modernisation is over, congestion will be reduced for passengers as there would be more space and better amenities, officials said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/2yfvpw/article30887694.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22FEBTH--AIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-airports-international-arrival-hall-becomes-departure-hall-may-open-in-march/article30887695.ece
311,2020/02/22,Chennai Corporation to develop an innovation hub to find tech innovations for civic issues,"Engineers will be permitted to work on innovations for issues such as solid waste management, eco-restoration and re-mediation of existing dump yards

The Chennai Corporation is planning to develop an ‘innovation hub’ in the city to promote tech innovations for civic services, infrastructure, welfare schemes and local administration.

A meeting of civic officials was held to develop the innovation hub. Once the State government accepts the proposal, the civic body is likely to start work on its development, attracting research scholars specialising in urban studies.

According to officials, engineers will be permitted to work on innovations relating to solid waste management, eco-restoration and re-mediation of existing dump yards. The civic body is yet to find appropriate technology to handle its municipal solid waste.

312,2020/02/22,Support group for patients with heart ailments launched at Chennai hospital,"‘Rela Heart Beats,’ is an initiative of Dr. Rela Institute and Medical Centre

Diseases arising due to lifestyle-related changes are the major killers unlike communicable diseases that were prevalent in the past, said Mohamed Rela, chairman and managing director, Dr. Rela Institute and Medical Centre (RIMC) here on Saturday.

Inaugurating ‘Rela Heart Beats,’ a support group for patients with heart-related ailments, he said that while the average life expectancy has considerably increased over the past few decades, changes in lifestyles and a lack of physical activities have led to a wide prevalence of non-communicable diseases like hypertension and heart-related diseases now.

“A majority of these diseases are due to the excess food we eat since our bodies are programmed to store all excess calories as fat,” he said. Stressing the need to lead a healthy lifestyle, he said that being part of a group where experiences can be shared will be of great help.

Actor-director Cheran, who launched the support group, highlighted the importance of being a part of support groups that can help in better recovery and rehabilitation.

Balamurali Srinivasan, senior consultant and clinical lead, Department of Cardiac Sciences, RIMC, said the support group was intended not just for those who underwent surgeries but for anyone with cardiac ailments. He said that doctors from different specialities, dieticians, physiotherapists and nurses will also actively participate in the support group meetings, which are planned for twice a month to begin with.

A statement issued by the hospital said that members of the group can also avail discounts and special benefits for treatment at the hospital.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/support-group-for-patients-with-heart-ailments-launched-at-chennai-hospital/article30887617.ece
313,2020/02/22,OPS inaugurates CREDAI’s property exhibition,"The State government will study the feasibility of implementing a single window system for construction of houses and flats, said Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam on Friday.

He was inaugurating the 13th edition of Fairpro, a property exhibition organised by CREDAI Chennai.

Mr. Panneerselvam, who is also the Minister for Housing and Urban Development, said to ease the multi-layered procedures for granting planning permission for houses and flats, a study would be conducted before rolling out the system.

Mr. Panneerselvam said the petition given by CREDAI regarding reduction of stamp duty for registration charges would also be favourably considered by the State.

Releasing the amendments made to the TN Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019, Mr. Panneerselvam said the Land Pooling Area Development Scheme, which will replace the old Land Acquisition Act for speeding up civic infrastructure projects, will be introduced in the State Assembly very soon.

Mr. Panneerselvam said changes in the Floor Space Index (FSI) limit for normal residential building from 1.50 to 2 and for multi-storey buildings from 2.50 to 3.25 has helped in increasing the dwelling units and bringing down the construction cost making it affordable for middle class home buyers.

Rajesh Lakhoni, Prinicipal Secretary, Housing and Urban Development, said the amendments made to the Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019, have removed several anomalies that were present in the housing development purposes.

D. Karthikeyan, Member Secretary, CMDA, said steps are being taken to make the online application for planning permission and the inspection report to be transparent.

Chandra Sekhar Sakhamuri, Commissioner, DTCP, and W.S. Habib, president, CREDAI, also spoke on the occasion.

Students graduating from the SSN Institutions can be proud of the fact that they will be seen as products of a quality institution, not just in Tamil Nadu or India, but across the world, said Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Friday.

Delivering the graduation address at the 20th Graduation Day on the campus, Mr. Palaniswami lauded the institution for its efforts in providing higher education to students from underprivileged backgrounds.

“The institution provides financial assistance to over 600 students from underprivileged backgrounds every year, to ensure that they are able to pursue higher education. It showcases the lofty ideals of this institution,” Mr. Palaniswami said.

Referring to the permission given to SSN to start a private university, the Chief Minister asked them to start the institute at the earliest, and impart ‘world-class education’, as was envisaged in the permission granted to it.

The Chief Minister also exhorted the graduating students to have hope, cultivate talent and possess strength so that they can overcome obstacles in life.

“I hope that you become entrepreneurs and provide jobs to others, instead of becoming job-seekers, and take our country forward,” said Mr. Palaniswami.

The Tamil Nadu Film Exhibitors’ Association and the Chennai, Chengalpattu, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur Distributors’ Association said on Friday that they had decided to purchase theatrical rights of ‘big-budget’ movies only after watching their previews.

The decision reportedly comes after distributors of Rajinikanth’s Darbar, produced by Lyca Productions, said that they had suffered significant losses.

The federations also urged the State to remove the entertainment tax of 8% levied by local bodies, and ensure that new Tamil releases are broadcast on satellite channels and OTT platforms after 100 days and 8 weeks, respectively.

T. Rajendar, president, Chennai, Chengalpattu, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur Distributors’ Association districts, said that they would insist on watching the preview of the film if the producers insisted on selling the movie on a ‘minimum guarantee’ or ‘outright basis’.

“We have taken the decision due to an extraordinary situation. We are seeking support from Lyca Productions on a humanitarian basis, not on a legal basis. Many exhibitors were affected. Lyca Productions have said that they would look into the issue,” he said.

317,2020/02/22,Uro-oncology meet to push awareness,"Unlike cancers of the head and neck, breast, oral, cervix and the gastric system, awareness on urological cancers needs to pick up among the public. Though less common when compared to the top five cancers in the country, cancers involving organs of the genitourinary system in men come with a range of issues, including impact on the quality of life.

To promote better understanding of uro-oncology and sharing of knowledge among doctors, the Cancer Institute (WIA) and Stanford University, California, are jointly organising an international update on uro-oncology 2020, during the weekend.

“Uro-oncology covers cancers of the kidney, urinary bladder, ureter, testes, penis and the prostate gland. In India, the commonest cancers are those of the breast, oral cavity and the gastric system. There is plenty of awareness about these cancers and enough attention on treatment modalities among the public. Focus on urological cancers, that are less common, is less, and there is not much public attention,” said Anand Raja, associate professor, Surgical Oncology, Cancer Institute, on Friday.

He added that though rare, these cancers had issues concerning quality of life. Like all cancers, it required a multi-disciplinary approach for better outcomes.

T.G. Sagar, director (emeritus) of the institute, said urological cancers accounted for 75,000 new cancer cases every year in the country, and the conference would discuss prevention, treatment, new advances and technologies.

Doctors noted that these cancers were not among the top five commonest cancers in the country, and hence, there was not much exposure for oncologists either. For instance, self-examination of the testes is advised for men on the same lines of breast examination for women abroad. Doctors said that testicular cancer, that mostly occurs in the young, had high cure rates, while prostate cancer mainly occured among the geriatric population.

V. Surendran, associate professor and head, Department of Psycho-oncology, pointed out that it impacted the quality of life of a man. “In women, we talk about mastectomy, and hair loss due to chemotherapy. Similarly, we provide counselling for male patients before and after treatment as it has a psychological impact too, and a lot of issues surrounding masculinity,” he said.

Arvind Krishnamurthy, professor and head, Surgical Oncology, said that the incidence of prostate cancer was increasing in the institute’s cancer registry.

As many as 16 persons, including two officers, have been remanded by a court in a case relating to smuggling gold from other countries.

On Wednesday night, DRI officers detained 18 passengers who flew down with gold from foreign countries at the international airport. When the officers were taking the 18 to board a vehicle stationed outside the arrival hall for further enquiry at the DRI office in T.Nagar, an unidentified mob of around 50 persons gathered around the officers and attacked them.

Officers manhandled

In the melee, two DRI officers were manhandled. Later, the mob fled with the passengers. The airport police booked a case following a complaint from the DRI officers.

During the course of proceedings, the officers recovered and seized 12.693 kg of gold, valued at ₹5.44 crore, under provisions of the Customs Act, 1962.

Thirteen passengers, two staff of the Customs and a former Customs officer were produced before a magistrate court in the Egmore Complex and remanded to judicial custody.

321,2020/02/22,Extend Loop Road to Besant Nagar: Madras High Court,"High Court directs State govt., Corporation to examine feasibility

The Madras High Court on Friday directed the State government as well as the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) to consider the feasibility of reconstructing a road, that was reportedly in existence before the 1970s, connecting the Marina Loop Road, from Pattinampakkam to Besant Nagar.

Justices Vineet Kothari and R. Suresh Kumar issued the direction as part of a public interest litigation petition, through which they had undertaken a massive exercise of regulating numerous vendors on the Marina beach as well as the fish sellers on the Loop Road, connecting Light House and Pattinampakkam.

During the course of hearing, Justice Kumar told Additional Advocate General S.R. Rajagopal that the DGS Dhinakaran Road had become highly congested of late, due to residences of ministers, judges as well as others having been located there and on the Greenways Road, next to it.

“As per a study, around 36,000 motor vehicles pass through the traffic junction next to the DGS Dhinakaran Salai during peak hours. The traffic is high during the morning and the evening hours. The congestion can be eased if an alternative is found,” the judge said.

He said that the Marina Loop Road, which now ends at Pattinampakkam, actually extended up to Besant Nagar before the 1970s, when a flood destroyed that portion of the road. Stating that the portions of the damaged road still exist, the judge asked the government and the Corporation to examine the possibility of reconstructing it.

“When we say examine the feasibility, kindly come up with some positive response. Don’t come back and say that it is an area under the Coastal Zone Regulation and therefore you cannot do anything about it and the road cannot be re-constructed. Show some seriousness and try to find a solution,” the judge said.

Later, the senior judge in the Bench directed the Corporation to ensure that only local fishermen’s families residing in the tenements abutting the Loop Road are allowed to sell their catch at the temporary as well as the permanent fish market that the civic body had planned to construct.

He also asked the Corporation to consider the feasibility of constructing two foot overbridges connecting the seaside of the Loop Road to the fish market so that fishermen can carry their catch without causing disturbance to traffic.

The judges recorded the submission of the AAG that so far, 269 fish vendors from Nochikuppam, 11 from Dooming Kuppam and 76 from Mullaima Nagar and Srinivasapuram were found to be regularly selling fish on the Loop Road. Apart from these, no outsider must be allowed to sell fish on the Loop Road, they ordered.

In so far as the 900 vendors to be allowed on the Marina beach, they said 60% of those licences should be given to those who are already doing business on the beach and the rest should be given to outsiders. All beneficiaries of the vending licences should be selected only through a draw of lots.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/os9o1q/article30884256.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22THLOOP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/extend-loop-road-to-besant-nagar/article30884257.ece
322,2020/02/22,Forging a new India-U.S. modus vivendi,"New Delhi needs the superpower’s support to move towards a more organic rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific

It is easy to be contrarian about U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to India early next week, given his idiosyncrasies, his often-unpredictable, rambunctious ways and the roughshod manner in which he seeks to put America first. And yet, it is clearer than perhaps ever before in recent times, that New Delhi needs the continued support of the U.S. government on almost everything substantial that matters to India in its quest to be a power of substance in the international system.

The acceptance of this admittedly parsimonious explanation then accords a new gravitas to the Trump visit. While the elaborate festive arrangements for the American President’s 36 hours in India may seem over the top, they are part of an investment in an ‘unbridled’ (after the failed impeachment and the surge in his approval ratings) Mr. Trump that he could quickly return — even during the trip itself — given his reputation as a sharp deal-maker who often beats the odds.

Preparing for Trump 2.0

Moreover, on present evidence, not limited to the fratricidal war between Democratic presidential hopefuls, the world may have to deal with Mr. Trump for four more years after the end of his present term this year. From a fairer trade regime; to accessing cutting-edge technology; to the fight against terrorism; to stabilising our region, New Delhi stands to benefit from constructive ties on all issues, given a more sensitive United States. India must therefore seek greater understanding and engagement should there be a Trump 2.0.

Asymmetrical partnerships, as we know from history, are rarely easy. Partnerships with superpowers are even more difficult; in international politics, as in life, even the best of unequal relationships results in a loss of some dignity and autonomy. It took all of Winston Churchill’s weight, foresight, wisdom, and the frightening imagery of communism invading Europe, to convince the U.S. of the need of a special relationship across the Atlantic, after the Second World War; and even then the British had to accept that London would be just another city in Europe, and Washington would consult London only when deemed necessary. But as Churchill realised on that fateful day in March 1946 in Fulton, Missouri, when he delivered his ‘Iron Curtain’ speech, the consequences of not arriving at a modus vivendi with the U.S. would be disastrous.

Today, the Indo-Pacific has arrived at an ‘Iron Curtain’ moment in its history. Without the United States, the region could become willy-nilly part of a new Chinese tributary system; with a fully engaged United States, the region has at least the chance of creating a more organic rules-based order.

In New Delhi’s case, the history of, what diplomat Dennis Kux described as, “estrangement” with the United States, during the Cold War, has had consequences for vital national interests that continue to cast their shadow on the present. Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), nuclear non-proliferation, the festering of the Pakistan “problem”, the Chinese humiliation of 1962, are just a few examples.

But much of course has changed today. Anti-Americanism, once the conventional wisdom of the Indian elite, seems outdated. New Delhi has, over the decades, gone on to align itself more closely with Washington. More important, outside the Left, both within India and in the U.S., the consensus across the mainstream of political opinion favours stronger relations between the two countries. This is notwithstanding the recent concerns expressed in Congress about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and about the internment of political leaders in J&K.

Foreign policy’s pro-U.S. tilt

In 2008, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, in a gesture that seemed uncharacteristic for him, effusively praised President George W. Bush and told him that the people of India “deeply love him”. According to the latest Pew Surveys of Global Opinion, support for Mr. Trump in India is high enough to suggest a great deal of public affection for the American President. That itself is a marker of the way India and Indians now see the world.

The reason for the change in New Delhi ‘s geostrategic outlook can be summarised quickly. If the 1971 Friendship Treaty with the Soviet Union was a response to the continuing U.S. tilt towards Pakistan and the beginnings of a Washington-Beijing entente, at present, it is the prospect of a potentially hegemonic China in the Indo-Pacific region is helping to cement the relationship. Beijing has managed to alienate nearly all its neighbours and allies, except North Korea and Pakistan.

It is often tempting also to dismiss the gains made bilaterally during the last three years of the Trump Administration. A recent book, A Very Stable Genius, by Philip Rucker and Carol D. Leonnig, suggests that Mr. Trump almost wrecked the partnership with New Delhi because of his ignorance, insolence and by going against the advice of his own (former) Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson. There is, however, little other evidence to support this claim.

Indeed, two of the best informed American analysts suggest otherwise. In Foreign Affairs, strategic affairs analyst Ashley Tellis writes about the “the surprising success” of the partnership and argues that Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi have “deepened” the defence cooperation. And Jeff Smith of the Heritage Foundation lists the accomplishments India-U.S. ties have made over the years, including “a foundational military agreement that allows for the sharing of encrypted communications and equipment; a change in U.S. export control laws that places India in a privileged category of NATO and non-NATO U.S. allies; a new ‘2+2’ foreign and defense ministers dialogue; an exponential increase in U.S. oil exports to India; the inauguration of the first India-U.S. tri-service military exercise and an expansion of existing military exercises; the signing of an Industrial Security Annex that will allow for greater collaboration among the two countries’ private defense industries; the inclusion of India and South Asia in a U.S. Maritime Security Initiative...”

But, as Mr. Tellis points out, much work needs to be done for the two countries to fulfil the potential of the relationship, especially in the area of defence. This, together with other key issues including trade, is on the centrepiece of the Trump-Modi agenda for the visit.

Bipartisan consensus

There is, of course, a chance that we may have a Democratic President next year. In those circumstances, we can only hope that the bipartisan consensus on engaging India — which has continued from Bill Clinton’s second term will prevail. To be sure, however, a new President will seek to put his/her own imprimatur on the relationship. The Democrats will clearly be more proactive on human rights and on issues of inclusion and diversity, which would make a greater demand on South Block and test its capacity and creativity.

New Delhi must, of course, continue engaging with its strongest source of support in the United States: the Indian diaspora. Fortunately, there is a near consensus on the need to strengthen this constituency.

In any case, there is little doubt that whoever is the next occupant of the White House, a retreat from multilateralism (especially on trade-related issues) and concern about China will continue to be the two main pillars of contemporary American foreign policy. If for only those reasons, Mr Trump’s reason has undeniable significance.

323,2020/02/22,RSS and ‘nationalism’,"RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s decision to desist from using the word ‘nationalism’ has come somewhat of a surprise, for it is generally thought that for his organisation, it is the defining ‘ism’. His rationale for the removal of the oft-evoked word ‘nationalism’ from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)’s verbal repertoire is that worldwide it is associated with ‘Hitler, Nazism and Fascism’.

It is gratifying to know that the RSS has grown to be not quite comfortable with the perception of ideological proximity, if not similarity, between it and the National Socialist Party which controlled Germany from 1933 to 1945. Nevertheless, it cannot be taken to mean that the RSS won’t represent Hindu nationalism or divide people into ‘us and them’ on the basis of religion.

The mere expurgation of the term ’nationalism’ from RSS’s lexicon may not suffice to dissuade people from perceiving it as a quasi-fascist organisation. RSS will have to do a lot more than disowning and discarding ‘nationalism’ to become truly ‘patriotic’. It is rightly said that ‘patriotism is an inoculation against nationalism’ and if people are more truly patriotic they will be less nationalistic. ‘Nationalism’ is a fig leaf for the dominance of the ruling elites whereas ‘patriotism’ embraces all.

RSS has to acknowledge that India is a heterogeneous society and it is not amenable to be homogenised. It has to disprove that it is against the three Ms — Muslims, Marxists and Missionaries (the last two Ms no more matter that much). It has to repudiate its long-held narrow view that those who own India as their pithrubhoomi and punyabhoomi are more equal than others.

Most importantly, RSS has to reject the religious texts that sanctify caste and affirm human equality. It has to promote inter-caste marriages if it is to succeed in forging ‘larger Hindu unity’. But, given its raison d’etre — safeguarding the upper caste interest — it is doubtful whether it will be able to reinvent itself as an all-embracing ‘cultural’ organisation. For a change, RSS can make a Dalit the Sarsanghchalak.

Hindutva is the provenance of virulent nationalism and remains the main impediment to India’s emergence as a great nation. RSS can make a gesture towards public opinion and demonstrate that it is not tied down by narrow nationalism by prevailing on the Modi government to repeal the discriminatory Citizenship Amendment Act.

324,2020/02/22,Protesting against CAA,"It is the contention of every right-thinking person that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) is anti-Muslim. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would have included Christians too, but it was perhaps wary of the possible backlash from the U.S. and Europe. Since there is no ‘Islamic superpower’ and most of the terrorist organisations have their roots in hard-line Islamist ideology, it has become convenient for the BJP to target Muslims, since it can easily escape criticism citing terrorism. But the BJP is failing to understand that its Hindutva agenda is cringed and frowned upon even by most of the Hindus, and the recent string of electoral defeats is proof of this fact. The endeavour of any government heading a plural population like ours should be to unite the masses. But the BJP is trying to divide the people on religious lines. It may taste initial success but in the long run it would bite the dust. History is replete with many such examples.

T. Anand Raj,

Chennai

Chepauk turned out to be Chennai’s Shaheen Bagh during this week’s anti-CAA protests (“Anti-CAA protests erupt across T.N.”). Though there was every chance provocation as the protesters were emotionally charged, the silver lining was that they observed extreme self-restraint; the police personnel too deserve praise for having maintained order. While a few anti-CAA protesters in Lucknow were asked to pay for damages to property, it is heartening to know that the protesters in Chennai ventured to clear the roads and streets after they finished their rallies. The protest was mainly against the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) without whose support in Parliament the CAA could not have come into force.

A. Jainulabdeen,

Anti-CAA protests have caused unwanted chaos and, as a keen political watcher, I feel sad to witness many people shouting at the top their voices without knowing the actual facts on the CAA and how the legislation is going to affect their lives. The Centre has to bear in mind that it has take remedial measures at the earliest. In the larger interest of the country, I request our pragmatic Prime Minister to convene a meeting of all the Chief Ministers immediately and let them be assured that on no account will citizens lose the privileges hitherto enjoyed by them.

326,2020/02/22,Reducing inequality through state support,"With reference to the ‘Parley’ column, “What distinguishes welfare measures from freebies?” one has to appreciate the clear distinction between welfare measures undertaken by State governments and the Centre and the freebies that serve a limited purpose of luring voters with inducements. The overarching purpose of welfare measures is to create an egalitarian society and ensure a level-playing field by providing a leg up to the have nots who would otherwise have been left to languish without any kind of succor. The welfare measures initiated by the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP government are as different from freebies as chalk from cheese. Furthermore, some of these measures are not directed at any particular section of society and are intended to benefit all classes. When the late Jayalalithaa was in power in Tamil Nadu, she went on an overdrive to woo voters by providing consumer durables, clothes etc. all duly delivered with her smiling visage prominently displayed. Au contraire, Mr. Kejriwal has never sought to derive political mileage out of his welfare measures and has only revealed a genuine interest in uplifting those who richly deserve it. In spheres like education, for instance, he has broken the back of the education mafia that thrives on squeezing the last penny from parents, irrespective of their financial backgrounds, by continuously monitoring the fee tariffs. The AAP government has been voted to power with an overwhelming mandate thanks largely to its abiding interest in the people and their welfare.

To make a distinction between welfare and non-welfare measures is essential, however blurred it may be, as the reality in the Indian context is that the fiscal space available is very narrow and the public spending needs to be judicious to strike a balance between welfare and development. The measures such as free electricity, water, public transport, Amma canteens, etc. would definitely fall under welfare category, whereas the distribution of grinders, television sets, etc. should be categorised as freebies. To rationalise distribution of goods such as grinders with arguments like “it gives people more time to pursue other things” may be a bit far-fetched. For that matter, anything distributed free in material form, other than food items, should be considered as a freebie. Freebies tend to corrupt the voters and make them get addicted to such measures and even vitiate the electoral processes. Whereas welfare measures would be seen as actions expected from a democratic state designed to raise the living standards of the economically backward.

The families of poor patients sleeping on the footpaths outside government hospitals is a very common sight throughout India and needs government attention. If the government provides these families with free or subsidised food and shelter for the limited period of hospitalisation of the patients, it will be a good welfare measure. Instead of allowing political parties to convert the welfare measures such as free electricity, water, transport, etc. into vote-catching instruments at the time of elections, there should be a Central law to implement these welfare measures uniformly throughout the country based on economic criteria.

327,2020/02/22,Making welfare count,"Welfare measures and freebies are two sides of the same coin. The former is economically progressive while the latter gets political importance. Results of welfare measures take years to emerge while freebies can bring a leader quick returns. The Aam Aadmi Party won on welfare measures because Delhi is a small State and results were visible within one term. In big States, results will need more time (“What distinguishes welfare measures from freebies,” Feb. 21).

According to Oxfam Inequality Report 2019, India’s top 10% of the population holds 77.4% of the total national wealth; in stark contrast, the bottom 60% owns merely 4.8%. Given this astronomical inequality in the wealth distribution, the Central and State governments must leave no stone unturned to ensure wealth redistribution through well thought-out welfare measures — in the fields of healthcare, education and employment — and suitable tax schemes. It is clear that the AAP grasped these realities to an extent, as reflected in its policies, implementation and the recent electoral victory. Only time will tell whether the Central government can get its priorities right.

331,2020/02/22,Keeping poverty away,"The Indian government is doing a significant amount of window dressing to make sure that U.S. President Donald Trump’s gaze does not fall on anything deemed unsightly. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation is building a huge wall to keep a slum out of sight of the U.S. President. The Uttar Pradesh government has released water into the heavily polluted Yamuna river to get rid of foul smell. These involve spending crores of rupees and upending the lives and livelihoods of people who struggle to make ends meet. Instead of trying to whitewash India’s poverty, the government must show its will and commitment to bring real change.

Venu G.S.,

It is said that the long wall that is being built in Ahmedabad is just to hide the slums and the dwellers there from the U.S. President Donald Trump during his visit to the city on Monday. It is reported that the shanty dwellers too have been served notices to vacate for the time being in view of Mr. Trump’s visit. What I am unable to understand is how all this can be hidden from the visiting dignitary while the media, both print and electronic, all over the world have discussed this matter threadbare. It is likely that Mr. Trump has already been briefed on the developments.

332,2020/02/22,Road accidents,"Major road accidents take place during nights (“19 killed as container falls on Kerala-bound bus in Tiruppur,” and “Seven pilgrims from Nepal die in Salem accident,” Feb. 21). It has been suggested by the public time and again that lorries must not operate during certain hours after midnight since drivers, having spent long hours at the wheels, tend to doze off. It is common knowledge that high-level alertness is required while driving any type of vehicle. There is no use arguing that roads have become broader or medians prevent head-on collisions. Wider roads only encourage vehicle users to drive at higher speeds. Dazzling headlights, increased power in engines, etc. are a menace. Speed governors must be fixed for all vehicles and speed guns must be installed to discourage speeding. Road safety measures should be strictly implemented, failing which accidents will continue unabated.

V. Lakshmanan,

Tiruppur, Tamil Nadu

A deadly combination of a dozy driver at the wheels and an overloaded container truck caused the gruesome bus accident that claimed the lives of 19 people in Tiruppur, Tamil Nadu. It points to our society’s twin failures — disrespect for the law and a collective failure to nurture an enduring culture of road safety. The eagerness with which we exploit the law’s loopholes, like exemption from the need to have a cleaner-driver in truck cabins, and the brazenness with which we violate stipulations relating to speed and load limits, point to a perverse attitude that wantonly disregards road safety and trivialises the sanctity of life. The perception that one can get away with serious road traffic transgressions needs to be challenged through deterrent enforcement. Lenient punishment like paltry fines for serious offences makes up a moral hazard as it creates a climate of cost-free crime. The perceptible wielding of the regulatory stick is the only way to prevent roads from turning into killing fields until society respects the law as a public good and appreciates its role as a shield to protect our lives and limbs.

V.N. Mukundarajan,

Thiruvananthapuram

Our hearts go out to the 19 passengers who perished in a terrible accident near Tiruppur city near Coimbatore early on Thursday. Woe befell the occupants of the Ernakulam-bound KSRTC bus when a 30-tonne truck hit the central median of the National Highway and the container it was carrying fell on the bus, crushing one side of the passenger vehicle. The driver’s folly of falling asleep while navigating the truck resulted in the tragedy. While the errant driver deserves punishment, the authorities would do well to compensate the victims and their families suitably.

Mumbai airport on Friday became home to the world’s largest airport-based temperature-controlled facility — the Export Cold Zone.

The terminal houses various facilities for the processing and storage of agriculture and pharmaceutical products, for which Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport is the largest export gateway. Cargo Service Centre, a cargo handling service provider, will operate the Export Cold Zone.

A spokesperson for GVK-run Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL), which manages the airport, said the facility can hold over 700 tonne at a time, with a combined annual throughput of 5,25,000 tonne. It is equipped with truck docks, a spacious acceptance and examination area, automated workstations, X-ray machines and cold rooms, among other things.

Mumbai airport serves over 500 cargo destinations across 175 countries with a customer base of more than 60 airlines. The airport has also launched an air cargo community portal, GMAX, which enables stakeholders to access mobile applications that offer real-time tracking of shipment, which helps in delivering customised handling solutions.

The first-of-its-kind facility was inaugurated by Sungita Sharma, Principal Chief Commissioner of Customs, (Central GST), in the presence of Bhavna Singh, Deputy Director General, Ministry of Civil Aviation, and V. Rama Mathew, Chief Commissioner of Customs, Mumbai Zone – III.

“Understanding the rapidly changing climatic changes and compliance requirements, GVK MIAL has ensured that the pharma excellence centre offers an optimal temperature-controlled solution to export pharma products and enables advance technology to expedite handling and quick aircraft connection for transit pharma. The facility handling both active and passive temperature-controlled pharma movements, offers customer-specific solutions, end-to-end integrated digital systems and has a team of experienced, dedicated and well-trained staff,” the spokesperson said.

In December 2019, GVK MIAL, recognising the criticality of life-saving drugs, introduced an indigenous temperature-controlled transport solution ‘Cooltainer’ for pharmaceutical products on the airport tarmac region. The Cooltainer, the world’s largest cold chain solution on the airport tarmac, can accommodate two main-deck or two lower-deck pallets or a combination of both, offering a temperature range of 15 degrees Celsius to 25 degrees Celsius or 2 degrees Celsius to 8 degrees Celsius as per product requirement.

336,2020/02/22,Two held for making rifles using YouTube videos,"10 weapons, which they planned to sell, seized; material to make eight more found at accused’s house

The Navi Mumbai Crime Branch has arrested an electrician and a carpenter who allegedly made rifles with the help of YouTube videos and sold them.

The Central Unit of the Crime Branch, on receiving a tip-off, laid a trap on Tuesday near Sai Krupa Hotel on the old Mumbai-Pune highway. The officials nabbed Parshuram Raghav Pirkad (40) and Dattaram Govind Pandit (55), who were travelling on a bike with 10 rifles wrapped in plastic.

“The accused had come to sell the rifles. While Pirkad is from Nanivali village in Khalapur, Pandit hails from Kharvandi village in Karjat,” Deputy Commissioner of Police, Crime Branch, Pravinkumar Patil said.

Mr. Pandit, after completing Class X, had done an electrician’s course and started working as an electrician in Panvel, Khopoli and Karjat. He would also illegally repair licensed arms in these areas. Mr. Pirkad worked as a carpenter and had met Mr. Pandit in the course of work.

“The two have been making rifles for the last one year. They sourced steel pipes and springs, and the carpenter used his skills to make the butts for the weapons. With the help of YouTube videos, they then assembled the rifles,” senior police inspector Nivrutti Kolhatkar from Central Unit, Crime Branch, said.

During the investigations, the police found that the duo had previously sold such rifles at prices ranging from ₹15,000 to ₹30,000. The accused have revealed the names of two of these buyers.

“We are investigating who purchased the rifles and what they did with them,” Mr. Patil said. The seized rifles are similar to 12-bore double barrel rifles and have a similar mechanism. On searching the accused’s house, the police recovered raw material for making eight more rifles. In all, material worth ₹8 lakh was recovered from the accused.

“An original, licensed rifle costs between ₹50,000 and ₹1.5 lakh,” Mr. Patil said.

A software engineer with a telecommunication company in Thane-Belapur Road was earlier this week assaulted and robbed of valuables worth ₹52,000 by four men in Rabale MIDC.

According to the police, the complainant, Jignesh Shah (30), is a resident of Dombivli.

Around 9 p.m. on Tuesday, he had gone to Ghansoli railway station after work, when he noticed a white car with four men in it. Mr. Shah asked for a lift to Lodha Palava city and the driver told him to get in. Then he drove the vehicle towards Mahape-Shilphata road. But after reaching Bharat petrol pump, he took a U-turn and went towards Khairane MIDC.

When Mr. Shah questioned the route change, the man sitting to his right, snatched his cell phone. Then the person on his left put a pistol-like weapon on Mr. Shah’s stomach and asked him to hand over his wallet, gold chain, and finger ring. When he resisted, the accused threatened to kill him following which Mr. Shah also gave ₹1,000 from his bag.

The four then snatched his three ATM cards and assaulted him for the PIN. The accused then stopped at an ICICI ATM at Khairane MIDC, and withdrew ₹36,000 using the ATM card. While entering the ATM booth, the four had covered their faces with handkerchiefs to avoid capture by the CCTV camera.

Later, they abandoned him near L&T office at Mahape. Mr. Shah approached the Rabale MIDC police on Wednesday.

In a similar incident on Sunday morning, Balvir Jaiswal (22) of Thane was robbed by two men in a car. Mr. Jaiswal was going to APMC market when he got a lift from the two at Kalwa naka. After reaching Rabale, the duo attacked him with a blade and took ₹22,000 in cash from him.

“Both the cases are being investigated.

338,2020/02/22,"MCOCA invoked against Vicky Deshmukh, gang members","Multiple cases lodged against him with Navi Mumbai Police

The Navi Mumbai Police have invoked the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against Vicky Deshmukh, who is wanted in one murder and two extortion cases, and his gang members.

Nerul resident Sachin Garje (33), who went missing in September 2019, was allegedly murdered by Mr. Deshmukh and his gang members.

According to the police, after being kidnapped, Garje was brutally assaulted and shot dead by the gang members and dumped in the sea at Nhava Sheva. When the waves washed the body ashore, the gang members buried it at the beach. However, waves washed the sand away, again exposing the body. Eventually, two days after killing Garje, the accused burnt the body at Ransai jungle in Uran.

Four of the gang members, identified as Vikrant Koli (22), Narayan Pawale (27), Tushar Koli (25) and Rupesh Jhirale (37), were arrested. However, six others — Mr. Deshmukh, his brother Jitendra, Pritam Koli, Roshan Koli, Rakesh Koli and Parshuram Mokal — are still at large.

Given that Mr. Deshmukh has two cases of extortion registered against him with the Nhava Sheva and NRI police, and this murder case with the Nerul police, assistant police inspector Dynaneshwar Bhedodkar and senior police inspector Nivrutti Kolhatkar proposed that he and his gang members be charged under MCOCA.

Assistant Commissioner of Police, Crime Branch, Satish Govekar has approved the application.

Mr. Deshmukh started his criminal activities in 1998 and has since been booked in 31 cases, including robbery, extortion, attempt to murder and murder. In 2008 and 2011, MCOCA was invoked against him, but he was acquitted. Of the 31 cases, he was acquitted in 17.

“Whenever a case is registered against him, he tries to influence the complainant, and in most cases they turn hostile. In many incidents, complainants are afraid to come forward to register a case against him. Hence, we would like to appeal to the public that if he has threatened or extorted money from anyone, they should come forward and we will not disclose their identity,” Deputy Commissioner of Police, Crime Branch, Pravinkumar Patil said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/9j7ppn/article30884759.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22bm-Vicky-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mcoca-invoked-against-vicky-deshmukh-gang-members/article30884760.ece

The Bombay High Court on Friday denied permission to the three accused in the Dr. Payal Tadvi suicide case to resume their postgraduate course after the BYL Nair Hospital authorities informed the court that their presence will disturb the atmosphere at the civic hospital, and could also affect healthcare services.

A single bench of Justice Sadhana Jadhav allowed the three accused — Hema Ahuja, Bhakti Mehar and Ankita Khandelwal — to start their medical practice which the judge had suspended while granting them bail on August 9, 2019.

Special counsel for the State, Raja Thakare informed the court that that Dr Ganesh Shinde, head of department, obstetrics and gynaecology at Nair hospital, had conducted a meeting of all doctors, students and staff members and they were unanimous in their view on not allowing the three accused to resume their post-graduate course at the hospital.

Mr. Thakare also said that there are 127 witnesses in the case from the hospital, and it is not possible to isolate the witnesses from the accused if they were allowed to return. In the meeting most students said that they would not be able to concentrate on their studies if the three accused returned to the campus. “The incident has created an atmosphere of hostility against the accused, and has left many students shattered,” said Mr. Thakare.

The court took into consideration Thakre’s contention, and refused to allow the three accused any relief on the modification they sought of the August 9, 2019 order where they were granted bail, to complete their post-graduate course in gynaecology and obstetrics.

Senior advocate Aabad Ponda, who appeared for the accused, had contended that there were three units of gynaecology and obstetrics at Nair Hospital and the possibility of the accused coming in touch with witnesses could be negated if the three were shifted to another unit.

But the submission from Nair Hospital authorities on Friday left no room for the accused to return to campus.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/113a9/article30884751.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BMACCUSEDDOCTORS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bombay-hc-denies-permission-to-doctors-accused-in-payal-tadvi-suicide-case-to-pursue-masters-course/article30884752.ece

The Naupada police in Thane on Thursday arrested a 27-year-old man for allegedly harassing his girlfriend to the point of driving her to commit suicide.

The accused, Suraj Shirke, and the victim, Sonia Rane (21), were next-door neighbours at Tekdi Bungalow in Thane (West). The police said they had been in a relationship for the last three years.

On Thursday morning, Sonia went to her aunt’s residence, which is in the same area. Her aunt and cousin sister were at home. As Sonia would frequently visit their residence, they were not surprised to see her. However, five minutes later, she suddenly ran to the bedroom and locked herself in.

“Sonia’s aunt called her neighbours and broke open the door. Her parents, too, had reached by then. She was rushed to Jupiter Hospital where she was declared dead before admission,” an officer with the Naupada police said.

Sonia’s parents approached the police and filed a complaint against Mr. Shirke. “Sonia had recently told them that after three years of being in a relationship, when she broached the subject of marriage, Mr. Shirke flatly refused. He did not even give any specific reason behind his rejection of her, which made her suspect that he never had any intention of marrying her in the first place. Her parents further said in their complaint that the issue had become a reason for frequent arguments between the two, and that he assaulted her on several occasions,” senior police inspector Anil Mangale, Naupada police station, said.

Mr. Shirke was picked up from his residence and brought to the police station. After preliminary questioning, he was arrested late on Thursday night and charged with abetment to suicide under the Indian Penal Code.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/1s0pl8/article30884764.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BMBOYFRIEND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/27-year-old-thane-man-arrested-for-abetting-girlfriend-to-end-life/article30884725.ece
341,2020/02/22,Filmmaker who conned people on promise of giving loans held,"Accused, who was also a financial advisor, has earned ₹1.25 cr. in ‘processing fees’

The Mumbai Crime Branch has arrested a small-time filmmaker for allegedly committing a string of financial crimes in Mumbai and other cities. The accused, who was also a financial advisor, would target those with bad financial track records who could not seek loans from banks, and cheat them by assuring them large loans.

According to Crime Branch officers, inquiries were initiated after a Delhi-based businessman filed a complaint against Ajay Yadav. Mr. Yadav has directed and produced five films so far, while the sixth is yet to be released.

“The complainant wanted to expand his business and hence needed a loan of ₹200 crore. He came into contact with Mr. Yadav through some mutual friends, and the accused assured him that the loan would be granted easily,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Preventive) Dutta Nalawade said. Mr. Nalawade is currently holding additional charge of the post of DCP (Detection-I).

Mr. Yadav allegedly visited the complainant’s head office in Uttar Pradesh last year and took ₹20 lakh from him as ‘processing fees’. Mr. Yadav then cut off all contact with the complainant. When he could not be reached despite several attempts, the complainant reached Mumbai to locate him, and finally approached the police.

The Crime Branch Unit XI started investigation and got his current phone number. Officers tracked his location for several days before picking him up from Lokhandwala complex in Andheri on Thursday. “Inquiries so far indicate that the accused had similarly cheated at least eight to nine people in Mumbai, with the collective amount he had earned being around ₹1.25 crore. We are obtaining further information about these cases,” Mr. Nalawade said.

A Crime Branch officer said Mr. Yadav, having worked as a financial consultant, used his knowledge to his advantage.

“Mr. Yadav knew that several businessmen who deal in large amounts of money on a regular basis run afoul of banks, either due to frequent defaults on loans or a bad CIBIL score. For this reason, they need to seek loans from private institutions like finance companies, and are ready to pay any amount as processing fee. He would hand-pick his targets using this knowledge,” the officer said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/xk91bb/article30884697.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22bm-filmmaker,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/filmmaker-who-conned-people-on-promise-of-giving-loans-held/article30884685.ece

Official data shows that people have been hesitating to visit Thailand due to the sudden and massive outbreak of coronavirus. Tour organisers have let us know that people who had made reservations for Thailand are either postponing their dates or are going to a different location. However, no decrease in Indian tourists has been seen,” he said.

Thailand, Mr. Kunjara said, was taking various measures to identify infectants at airports and getting them treated at the earliest. The country has not seen any new case in the past five days and authorities have been successful in treating patients, he said. “We are constantly issuing instructions and guidelines for people to prevent infection.”

Mr. Kunjara said none of the tourist destinations were closed in Thailand and people could be seen everywhere on the streets.

“Stringent measures are being taken on flights and in airports. Every visitor is checked by thermal camera surveillance. Hand gels, sanitisers and face masks are available at various places in airports as well as outside. We are trying to build confidence so that people can visit all the places without fear,” the deputy governor said. Thai New Year will be celebrated from April 13 to 15 on a grand scale, he said.

Cholada Siddhivarn, director, western and southern India, Tourism Authority of Thailand, said they have 35 positive coronavirus cases and have cured 15 people till date. “While the tourism industry is seeing a setback, we look towards India as a saviour of the tourism industry. Last year, there was a huge increase in the number of tourists as well as the revenue generated from them and therefore, India remains a strong market for us. Indians in Thailand are celebrating marriages without fear. No Indian has been infected in Thailand till date, and we will remain consistent in working for the safety of tourists until we are confident that everything is fine,” Ms. Siddhivarn said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/2t7v14/article30884679.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22bm-Thailand,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/covid-19-has-hit-tourism-but-no-cause-for-worry-thai-official/article30884680.ece
343,2020/02/22,Upset accomplice spills the beans on Madh Island murder; two held,"Search on for victim’s wife, doctor who issued death papers

A woman and her paramour might have swept the murder under the rug had they kept their word to their accomplice. Upset over not being paid the money he was promised, the accomplice revealed the plot to a friend over a drink, and was overheard by a police informer.

According to Mumbai Crime Branch officers, the deceased, Mahesh Patel (35) was a luxury bus driver and stayed with his wife in Madh Island. Earlier this month, they got a tip-off that while Patel’s wife, a home maker, was telling everyone that her husband had died of natural causes, he was actually murdered by her and her paramour.

The informer also provided them details about Sagar Sharma, an autorickshaw driver, who was overheard telling his friend about the murder over a drink. The Unit VIII obtained details about Patel’s death.

“We found out that Patel had passed away on December 21 last year and was cremated the next day. We then kept a watch on Mr. Sharma and later picked him up for inquiries. After sustained questioning, he broke down and confessed to the entire plot,” a Crime Branch officer said. He was later arrested.

Mr. Sharma allegedly said that he was approached by his friend Arup Das (25), who had been having an affair with Patel’s wife. Mr. Das and the Patels stay in the same locality and Mr. Das works as a supervisor with a private hospital in Mumbai. Mr. Das sought Mr. Sharma’s help in eliminating Patel so that he could be with his wife without any hindrance. Officers said it was Mr. Sharma who came up with the idea of mixing sleeping pills in his food and also bought the pills.

“On the morning of December 21, Patel’s wife added four pills in his breakfast but they did not have any effect. That night, she mixed 10 pills in his dinner. But after he fell asleep, she realised that he was still breathing. She then called up Mr. Das, who came over and together, they smothered him with a pillow till they were sure he was dead,” the officer said.

The same night, they convinced a local doctor to issue a death certificate stating that Patel had died of natural causes, and cremated him the next morning.

An FIR of murder and destruction of evidence was registered against Mr. Das, Mr. Sharma, Patel’s wife, and the doctor following Mr. Sharma’s confession. The Crime Branch arrested Mr. Das from his residence.

“Patel’s wife and the doctor are on the run and efforts are under way to apprehend them. We are also finding out whether anyone else was involved in the offence,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Preventive) Dutta Nalawade, who is holding additional charge of the post of DCP (Detection I), said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/a6xa5y/article30884670.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22bm-Press-Conference,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/upset-accomplice-spills-the-beans-on-madh-island-murder-two-held/article30884666.ece
344,2020/02/22,Young ones to take centre stage at TEDxGateway tomorrow,"An eight-year-old climate change activist works to salvage the planet, while two teen innovators look to improve lives through early detection of diseases

At the 11th edition of TedXGateway to be held in Mumbai this Sunday, three child prodigies will take centre stage among 20 other speakers. The event at the National Sports Club of India in Worli will see over 5,000 attendees. The Hindu chats with the three youngsters about their work, aspirations and what drives them.

Licypriya Kangujam

The climate change activist from Manipur has been fighting for the cause since the age of four and is well-known for her strikes outside Parliament for a climate law. She formed an organisation called ‘The Child Movement’ and dropped out of school in February 2019 to work as a full-time climate activist. “My father has been an activist. I would attend international conferences and seminars on environment and climate change because of him,” Licypriya said. She had tagged along with her father to work after the Nepal earthquake in 2015, when she was only four. “It triggered something in me,” she said.

Stating that protesting on the streets alone will not resolve everything, she said, “Therefore through The Child Movement, I visit rural areas and make people aware about the changing climate and necessary actions to be taken. We are also working on including climate change as a compulsory subject in the school curriculum. Till now, Gujarat and Rajasthan have accepted our proposal and will be adding the subject from 2020-21,” Licypriya said. She said climate change will be taught as a subject in 1,43,596 schools.

Licypriya has been trying to get in touch with ministers since 2019 to pass a law to regulate the emission of carbons and greenhouse gases. “I have also decided to launch an initiative called Green Olympics during the Tokyo Olympics 2020, to reduce carbon emission by providing emission-free transport to and from the Olympics venue, and using drone, laser and sound show instead of firecrackers at the opening and closing ceremony. Every participant will be given a chance to plant a tree,” she said.

Born in California, this innovator is a Class IX student at West View High School in Portland in the U.S. His parents were born in Ambala, Haryana. Inspired by family members who are doctors, Rishab has always been interested in medicine and science, and his curiosity led him to research on cancer diagnostics and treatment.

He has developed two techniques related to pancreatic cancer, one for faster detection and the other to improve radiotherapy treatment.

“I started working on AI in 2017. Around the same time, I visited a laboratory in Boston which specialised in pancreatic cancer. The statistics of the mortality rate due to the cancer, and a death of a family friend due to cancer in the abdomen triggered my work in this area,” said the teenager.

Rishab’s first innovation, Pancreas Detective, predicts the mutations of the cancer tissue by processing its microscopic images with the help of AI. The second, called Pancreatic Cancer Deep Learning System, helps locate the tumour in the abdomen accurately by processing CT scan and MRI images. Both his innovations are in the trial phase.

A Class XI student from National Public School in Bengaluru, Vrishab and his elder brother Vishwesh (18) have developed a smartphone application for early detection of amblyopia, a vision development disorder. Early detection of the disorder is key to cure it, and experts say it should be detected before the age of eight. Vrishab, who himself suffered from the disorder, remembers the difficulty he faced while writing and playing games that needed hand-eye coordination. While his case was diagnosed at the age of four, he realised that not all are lucky.

“Therefore, I decided to create a smartphone application called Kanna (meaning ‘apple of my eye’ in Tamil), which can detect the disorder by just clicking two pictures of the child, one in low lighting and another in normal lighting,” he said.

The pictures are processed through artificial intelligence and results on the possibility of amblyopia are provided immediately. “I developed an algorithm which scans the disorder’s risk factors, such as refractive error, cataract, and drooping or squinting of an eye. If the application detects any of these factors, it will notify the signs of amblyopia and recommend that the user consult a doctor,” Vrishab said.

He said the application has completed clinical validation with 1,000 children at the Sankara Eye Hospital in Bengaluru, and has a 90.5% accuracy of detection. The innovation will be available in stores soon.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/young-ones-to-take-centre-stage-at-tedxgateway-tomorrow/article30884650.ece
345,2020/02/22,Kapil Wadhawan granted bail,"DHFL promoter furnishes ₹5 lakh bond, walks out of jail

The special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Friday granted bail to Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) promoter Kapil Wadhawan, who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for allegedly laundering money to buy the properties of Iqbal Mirchi, late aide of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim.

The ED had accused Mr. Wadhawan of playing a very ‘crucial role’ to launder money and had created shell companies under DHFL. These were eventually merged with Sunblink Real Estate Pvt. Ltd., which is controlled by the Wadhawans.

In Mr. Wadhawan’s defence, lawyer Amit Desai questioned his arrest on the ground that transactions of DHFL had nothing to with the money laundering case involving Mirchi. He said DHFL’s transactions are a separate case.

Mr. Desai also contended that Dheeraj Wadhawan and promoters of Sunblink Real Estate Pvt. Ltd., the key accused who were directly involved in buying the Worli properties of Mirchi, were granted bail.

The bail was opposed by ED on several grounds, including that Mr. Wadhawan may influence the probe.

The court imposed several conditions, including asking Mr. Wadhawan to surrender his passport and not leave the country. He was also asked not to tamper with evidence and not to directly or indirectly induce, threat or promise any person associated with the case to dissuade them from disclosing facts to the court or investigating officer.

Meanwhile, the ED moved the Bombay High Court to stay Mr. Wadhawan’s release but its application turned infructuous after Mr. Wadhawan furnished a cash bond of ₹5 lakh and walked out of Arthur Road jail. The ED had first moved its plea before Justices S.K. Shinde and P.D. Naik, who recused themselves from the case.

Later, Justice P.K. Chavan heard the ED’s appeal to cancel Mr. Wadhawan’s bail. Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, along with the ED’s counsel, Hiten Venegaonkar, sought a stay on the PMLA court’s order stating that the offence was serious and they did not know the grounds on which bail was granted as the order was not available yet. They also argued that Mr. Wadhawan was an influential man and could tamper with evidence once released.

Mr. Desai, who appeared for Mr. Wadhawan, opposed the ED’s application and informed the court that Mr. Wadhawan had walked out of Arthur Road jail, which then made the ED’s plea infructous. The court, however, asked the ED to file a fresh application for cancellation of bail.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ekm8j/article30884644.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BMKAPILWADHAWAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kapil-wadhawan-granted-bail/article30884594.ece
346,2020/02/22,Police officer booked for assaulting man at station,"The Mahim police on Friday booked one of their officers for allegedly assaulting a man at the police station.

The accused has been identified as police sub-inspector Gabhinath Satav. Officials said on Thursday Mahim resident Nadeem Sheikh approached the police station to report that his 14-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter had been missing since the previous night. In keeping with the procedure on missing minors, a case of kidnapping was registered against unknown persons.

“On Thursday evening, Mr. Sheikh went back to the police station to inquire about the progress in the case. Mr. Satav was on duty at the time, and Mr. Sheikh asked him what was being done to locate his children, which led to an argument. Mr. Satav slapped Mr. Sheikh, who fell and hit his head on a table,” an officer with the Mumbai Police said.

The officer said another Mahim resident Ganesh Jalgaonkar, who was also present at the time, lodged a complaint against Mr. Satav. He has been booked for assault and endangering life and personal safety under the Indian Penal Code, while a departmental enquiry has been initiated against him.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone-V) Niyati Thaker said, “Inquiries against Mr. Satav are still under way.”

Meanwhile, Mr. Sheikh’s children returned home safe on Thursday. While they initially claimed that they had been kidnapped, they later confessed that they were scared to go home early as they had bunked their tuition classes and hence cooked up a story.

347,2020/02/22,"Date palm jaggery, and the sweetness of Bengal winters","As winter winds down, a look at date palm jaggery and its distinguished place in Bengal’s sweet-making history

Winter is well on its way out now, and we are lapping up the last of the bright red winter carrots and pale green fresh peas. For us, winters always meant two things — ma’s ‘to die for’ peas kachori and khejurer gur. From sweets made on Makar Sankranti to the thick, creamy payesh and the everyday comfort food of doodh-bhaat (milk and rice), khejurer gur nudged and pushed white sugar out of business and elevated the mundane. I would break pieces of the soft, deep caramel gur and put it on my tongue and savour the complex sweetness slowly spreading in my mouth. It was like a small piece of sweet warmth. I still think this is the best way to eat it. Ma had trusted sources who would procure and deliver to her good quality khejurer gur from Bengal to Assam, the softer ones for immediate use and the harder roundels to last through the year, safely tucked in airtight containers inside the refrigerator. My sister and I inherited this trait and we fulfil it every year like a family ritual.

Khejurer gur or date palm jaggery, that highly prized seasonal produce, occupies a place of pride in Bengal’s already accomplished sweet-making history. As far back as the 4th century BC, Panini wrote, Gurasha auang desho goura, which means Gour is the place of gur. It is, however, difficult to know exactly when khejurer gur became popular in Bengal. Some early references can be found from the history of Joynogorer moa. The old Pundra Bardhan in undivided Bengal, now Bogra in Bangladesh, became known as Gour for its high-quality gur produced from sugarcane. At that time, Mitraganj was a famous market in Joynagar, which is now in Bengal’s South 24 Parganas district. A weekly market or haat was held on Mondays and Fridays in that village where people from different villages came to sell gur. The fine quality of the date palm jaggery sold in this haat is orally documented in the Piruli song of Farid Pir and also in the folk poems of Dakshin Kalikapur village. The reason why a more formal, ‘Sanskritised’ documentation of the origin of khejurer gur is unavailable is because the Siulis – the artisans — belonged to the lower castes.

Nomadic artisans

Amir Sheikh and his younger brother shift home from Nadia to Adityapur village in Burdawan district for three to four months every winter. This means staying in makeshift huts, away from their families and creature comforts. A few kilometres away, near the Kopai river in Bolpur, Sabir stays with his family of four, including two infants. These families are all seasonal nomads, Siulis, who specialise in tapping the sap of the date palm tree and making khejurer gur.

The Siulis mostly belong to Scheduled Castes or Tribes, or to the Mahishya and Muslim community, and they are spread across the four-five major gur producing districts of Bengal — Nadia, North and South 24 Parganas, Murshidabad and Malda. While the demand for khejurer gur has steadily increased over the years, nobody really knows much about its unique and climate-sensitive production or about the community that produces it. In the absence of this connect, the Siulis, the men who scale the thorny trees to collect the sap, are almost never acknowledged.

Obtaining the sap requires skill. The tapping is generally done at night, with an intervening period of rest for the tree. The Siulis climb the tree at dusk, cut the end of the inflorescence (flower cluster), and hang an earthen container from it, leaving it overnight to catch the dripping sap. The tree cannot be tapped if the weather is foggy, drizzly or warm, as the sap will become turbid and sour. It’s this that makes the gur so sensitive to climatic conditions. The fresh sap of the wild date palm is sweet, fragrant and as clear as drinking water. Rich in vitamins and iron and with 12-15% sugar, it is a delicious thirst quencher.

However, it ferments quickly along with the rising sun to turn into the alcoholic tari, so the Siulis start work before the crack of dawn. The pots are brought down from the trees and the collected sap is filtered and poured into open troughs. This juice is then put to boil till the Brix value reaches 118-120%, a calculation that experienced Siulis like Amir make just by sight and touch alone, without any modern instruments.

Many varieties

Date palm jaggery can be eaten as nolen gur — the softer, golden coloured gur, named after the nol, or the pipe that is used to collect the sap, and from nolen meaning new. Or as jhola gur, the viscous liquid gur made by reducing the sap but stopping short of crystallisation.

Jhola comes from the Bengali word for ‘hanging’ — the way the pots are hung. Jhola gur has low shelf life but high aroma, and is used to make the famous Joynagarer moa. Then there is poyra gur, from the word poila or ‘first’, for the gur made from the first sap of the season. This is believed to be the best variety because of the elongated period of rest that the tree gets.

The jhola gur made from the first sap is called jiren jhola gur — ‘jiren’ being the word for resting. The jiren gur is almost translucent. The sap is reduced further on low heat and poured into terracotta moulds to yield the solidified patali, which has the highest shelf life of about eight months but is the most compromised on flavour.

Khejurer gur has now became a part of fine dining and has inspired several refined sweets, but the first jhola gur each season still evokes memories of a winter special Bengali breakfast of luchi and jhola gur. Or, as the famous poet Sukumar Ray recalled, “kintu shobar chaite bhalo, pauruti aar jhola gur” — the best of all is bread with jhola gur.

SUNDAY RECIPE

Jhola gur diye moong-narkoler ichhamura

(Sweet croquettes of moongbeans-coconut served with jhola gur)

This is a take on the Bengali pithe ichhamura, which gets its name from the oblong shape that apparently resembles a prawn head.

Ingredients

1 1/2 cup jhola gur

Refined oil for deep frying

For dough:

150 gms shredded coconut

75 gms moong daal

200 gms sugar

50 gms kheer/ khoya

2 inches cinnamon

1/4 cup water

1 tbsp ghee

2-3 tbsp maida

Method

1. Take sugar and water in a kadhai and put on medium heat. Let it come to a boil. Add the coconut, mix on low flame for five minutes and add khoa. Keep stirring till it becomes sticky and coconut is glossy. Remove from fire, transfer to another container and let it cool a bit till you can handle the mix.

2. Roast the moong daal in ghee, add cinnamon and boil in just enough water so that the daal is cooked and the water is absorbed. Remove half the cinnamon stick, cool, and make a smooth paste in a blender. Prep the daal mix before the coconut.

3. Mix the moong daal, coconut and maida together and form a smooth dough.

4. Take a tbsp of the mix and mould into inch-long oblong croquettes. Deep fry till golden brown in hot refined oil.

5. Heat the jhola gur in a pan and put the ichhamura right after draining the oil into the jhola gur. Soak for a while and serve, with spoonfuls of jhola gur drizzled on top.

Note: Drop a little dough into the oil and check if you need more maida to bind. Do not add much as it will ruin the taste. Do not fry in piping hot oil as it will brown the outside too quickly and blister it too.

348,2020/02/22,This cafe is all about finger foods and fusion dishes,"A place to sit and chat: Enchante Cafe

Tucked in a lane in Jubilee Hills and nestled among trees is Enchante Cafe. This cafe cum patisserie would be your go to venue if you want to be at a less crowded place — away from the noise of the city. Its outdoor seating, in particular, with an artificial lawn makes for a good place to hang out once the sun is down. Apart from the outdoor seating, this cafe has two other indoor seating options. The interior is done in a mix of blue and white to which they have added quite a bit of quirky pictures of beaches, boats at one level. On another level, the wall is filled with pictures of various places and their iconic buildings or structures. Another wall is done up with wall decor accessories that look like travel bags. So, if the theme of the interior is to be guessed, it has to do with travel.

I would say, the staff is little informed about what is available and what isn’t. But that could also be because I happened to drop in just an hour after the cafe opened. On Zomato, the food suggestions to try here were almost the same. Suggestions that poured in ranged from Caesar salad with ‘flavoured mayo.’ So, I said no. Because mayo doesn’t go with caesar salad. Then came a suggestion of mozzarella sticks. Potato popcorn, pav bhaji fondue, chicken popcorn etc.

On a previous occasion when I had dropped in, I had tried the Penne arrabiata and had nothing to complain about, though it was a very average cafe pasta. The sandwich however, was a delight. This time, with a wish to try a few more options from the menu, I dropped in hoping to try some finger foods and a pizza.

The mozzarella sticks were unavailable, and so was the case with a few other things that I asked for. Because there was a power cut, all the oven food was out of question. But I really wonder why a kathi roll order was refused.

With few choices left I ordered the grilled chermoula chicken. It was pan-seared and over load with herbs. The meat was tender and even though a little sharp on salt for my taste, I didn’t mind eating it with the beautiful mash and a melted cheese dip instead of the mushroom sauce. I, however, like my chicken trimmed well before cooking, since this wasn’t trimmed I had to do that while being on the job of eating. I would have ignored it all, then towards the end of finishing my chicken, I saw a part that was absolutely raw. I lost my appetite and gobbled the veggies instead.

Since I am not a big fan of desserts and am rather picky about the places where I eat my desserts at, I skipped this course. To give it one final try, I went again and ordered a frittata, which was more like a cheese omlete.

If you are a fan of fusion food do try masala risotto, dal khichidi, cheese kulcha and maggi. The restaurant recommends these.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/8otqc9/article30887512.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym21enchante,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/enchante-cafe-jubilee-hills-cafe/article30887517.ece

Respected Madam/Sir,

Tragedy is always starting with comedy. This is the life. This is line they should put under four lions of Ashoka. Satyameva jayate and all nobody cares these days.

If you tell some youths, “Hello youths, please come here listen to me, truth alone is leading to success.” They will say, “Uncle please sit down. This is not jambuvan period. Nowadays morning to evening nonstop telling lies means some cash will come.”

Three days back I woke up in the morning. I said two-three prayers and stepped out of bed and where I am putting the foot? Directly on cover of superhit novel The Night of Wenceslas by Lionel Davidson. Then what happened? Book is flying one direction, foot in other direction, Mathrubootham is crashing to the floor like Skylab crashing in Australia in 1979. Whether you are remembering Skylab?

Immediately Kamalam came running: “Oh my god what happened? Can you hear? Can you talk? Can you see? Say something!” I said, “Kamalam, whole body is paining like anything but I can still talk. Please call Dr. Shankaramenon.”

Doctor came and said, “Mathrubootham, you are lucky. After retirement age falling like this means time to go only,” and he pointed at ceiling fan. I asked what is connection between myself falling and Khaitan fan? He said, “No, no, not fan.” And kept pointing up. I said, “What nonsense, whether Mrs. Nalini from upstairs is making me fall?” He said, “No, no! Up! Up!”

Madam/sir I knew very well what he is saying. But when you are doctor means some self-respect should be there? If everytime there is problem you are saying oho time to go to paralokam means why you got MBBS degree? Get nonsense degree like Botany no?

So I said, “Doctor ,shut up and do some doctor work.” He checked whole body and said, “Mathrubootham, no serious issues are there. All items working properly. But too much stiffness is there. Whether you are doing any gym or exercise or joggings?” I said, “Dr. Shankaramenon, for last 30 years you are living in next flat. What nonsense questions you are asking.” He said, “Mathrubootham please go for one massage treatment. I know one clinic in Anna Nagar West near Mainland China hotel.” Kamalam said, “I am booking appointment immediately, you keep quiet.”

Next day I went to massage establishment. Receptionist asked some questions, then I said about falling in bedroom. She closed her eyes and said, “Ayappa, time to take him up.” I said, “Excuse me madam what nonsense, this is customer service or customer insult?” That moment one massage fellow with name badge Ayappan came and took me to upstairs treatment room.

Madam/sir once during college days I had one accident. I am going to college on cycle. Going-going just like that. Suddenly one man on scooter came and put loud horn. I fully lost balance and fell into one ditch full of small stones. Motorcycle man is coming running to help but he is slipping and falling on top of me. How many stitches total? Seven stitches from stones and two from motorcycle man helmet.

But that pain and all nothing compared to pain that Ayappan is doing during massage. After long time, he said sir is it paining too much? I said Ayappa for 20 minutes I am crying and crying. You are asking now? I reached home tottering. Mrs. Mathrubootham asked old man, how you are feeling?

I said Kamalam absolutely no feelings anywhere. She said very good, I have booked weekly appointment for next two months. It is surprise gift.

Yours in extreme persecution,

351,2020/02/22,AIADMK wants CM to resign over ruling on direct benefit transfer,"Govt.’s confrontation with L-G pushing U.T. backwards: MLA

Seeking the resignation of Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy against the backdrop of High Court order dismissing his writ petition challenging the decision of the Centre and Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi to disburse cash to ration cardholders instead of supplying free rice, AIADMK floor leader A. Anbalagan on Saturday said the court order was “a big jolt for the government.”

The AIADMK leader told presspersons here that although the Chief Minister was responsible for the situation, the court order was a sort of suppression of the rights of Legislative Assembly.

The Chief Minister and the Ministers confronted the Centre and the Lieutenant Governor on all issues. “The confrontation has pushed the Union Territory backwards. The Chief Minister should shoulder the responsibility and quit office,” he said.

Criticising the opposition to cash disbursement for rice scheme, Mr. Anbalagan said the direct benefit transfer system was introduced by the United Progressive Alliance government. “How can a Congress Chief Minister question a scheme formulated by the UPA?” he asked.

The only solution, he said, was to attain Statehood so that the territory could come out of the direct control of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs.

The committee members held one-on-one meetings with the Ministers to get a first-hand account of the situation.

According to a senior party functionary, Congress president Sonia Gandhi in January had appointed manifesto implementation committees for Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Puducherry where the party was in power.

The committee headed Mr. Moily for the U.T. included Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy, Minister for Public Works A. Namassivayam, who is chief of PCC and AICC general secretary in-charge for U.T.

Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Saturday said he would appeal against the Madras High Court order dismissing a writ petition filed by him challenging the decision of the Centre and Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi to disburse cash to ration cardholders instead of distributing them free rice through public distribution system outlets.

“We are exploring all options to get justice. Certainly we will appeal against the single judge order since free rice scheme is a commitment the party gave to voters during last Assembly elections. The next Cabinet will take a decision on it,” he told The Hindu.

354,2020/02/22,Bedi welcomes verdict,"She is in favour of disbursing cash instead of free rice to cardholders

Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi on Friday welcomed the Madras High Court order dismissing a writ petition filed by Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy against a decision of Lt. Governor and the Centre to disburse cash instead of distributing free rice to ration cardholders in the Union Territory.

“We thank Justice C. V Kartikeyan of Madras High Court for upholding the directions of Government of India to the Puducherry Administration to transfer money directly into bank accounts for free rice and not the way it was earlier,” she tweeted.

In a message to reporters, Ms Bedi said the decision to transfer money was to prevent leakages and pilferages. “It empowers people financially without any middle men to buy rice of their choice and time,” the Lt Governor said. Denying charges levelled against her by Minister for Health Malladi Krishna Rao, the Lt. Governor said her office was not blocking any “financially sound and professionally vetted” proposals by the Chief Secretary and the Finance Department.

On the Minister’s claim about Island 5 in Yanam, Ms. Bedi said “We do not know what he is talking about. Nothing of this is on file please. I have nothing against the prosperity of Puducherry. I am only for due process, accountability and legality.”

On the delay in giving approval for a flood wall in Yanam, Ms. Bedi said the issue was under investigations by the CBI. “It’s still under a cloud,” the Lt Governor said. Ms. Bedi said time would tell whether the Lt. Governor’s office did anything for the people of Union Territory.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/bedi-welcomes-verdict/article30887129.ece
355,2020/02/22,Minister threatens to file case against L-G,"He accuses Bedi of blocking funds

Accusing Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi of blocking funds set aside for his departments, Minister for Health Malladi Krishna Rao on Friday said he would file a case against Ms. Bedi for working against the interests of people in the Union Territory.

Addressing a press conference, the Minister said the L-G had deliberately blocked funds and delayed projects pertaining to his departmentis, especially the schemes meant for the Yanam region.

The Minister said the Centre had sanctioned ₹137 crore for constructing a flood wall in Yanam after approving the project in June, 2018, and on an estimate prepared by a consultant appointed by the Centre. “The estimate is fully prepared by the Centre. We don’t have any role in the project preparation. Even then, the Lt. Governor has taken a stand that she will not allow the territorial administration to undertake the work. We are fine with even the Centre directly taking up the work,” he said.

The Centre had sanctioned ₹26 crore for setting up an engineering college in Yanam in 2018. Of the total amount, a sum of ₹7.8 crore was released. After waiting for over a year, the Lt. Governor gave expenditure sanction last month. Mr. Rao also cited the delay in getting sanction for spiritual tourism projects and the setting up of Tagore Cultural Centre.

Recalling statements made by Ms. Bedi in the past, claiming that Island 5 in Yanam belonged to Andhra Pradesh, the Minister said a joint survey by the Collectors of East Godavari and Puducherry revealed that the Island belonged to the Union Territory. “Thanks to the Lt. Governor, we got additional 185 metre of land from AP when we surveyed,” he said.

Referring to the decision of the CBI not to proceed with the investigation against six government officials allegedly involved in the 2017 medical admissions scam, the Minister said the government had maintained from the beginning that officials are not guilty.

The Minister said a bill would be enacted in the next Assembly session, making it mandatory for three medical colleges to part with 50% of the MBBS seats under government quota.

He also said he had sent a defamation notice to suspended Congress legislator N. Danavelou seeking an apology for raising corruption charges against him.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/pg250k/article30887124.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21MALLADI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/minister-threatens-to-file-case-against-l-g/article30887125.ece

357,2020/02/22,Karimkutty is all about classical finesse and the occult,"Written by Kavalam Narayana Panicker, the play leverages every aspect of Natyashastra

An occult world of spirits, overlords and dark arts animated the stage as Karimkutty, written by Kavalam Narayana Panicker, doyen of Malayalam theatre, was performed as the closing act at the week-long 21st Bharat Rang Mahotsav parallel theatre festival of the National School of Drama at Adishakti.

Staged by Sopanam theatre troupe, which was founded by Panicker, Karimkutty presents classical theatre in all its finery.

The play takes its name from Karimkutty, one of the spirits (chathans) enslaved by the overlord Kondadimadan.

Karimkutty evokes the emotional rhythm emanating from the five elements — earth, water, air, fire and ether (ether). He is the leader of the downtrodden, the oppressed.

In portraying Karimkutty as a loyal acolyte to his master — the one who commands the ‘chathan’ army, but also refuses to align with his master’s devious designs to grab more and more wealth — Panicker also shines a light on feudal practices. As the play moves along, it explores the tetchy relationship between the master, who is greedy for power and wealth, and his morally superior serf-spirit. Kundunni, the overlord’s caretaker, who is petrified of the spirits, provides comic relief to the story.

The play leverages every aspect of Natyashastra, from angika (body movements) to aaharya (costumery) to transcend the limitations of language.

The costumes were designed by the late filmmaker G. Aravindan, who, like Panicker, held a fascination for folk culture and the occult, which led to a collaboration between the duo in theatre and cinema.

Mantravanan, a former disciple of Kondadimadan, is accumulating wealth and more magical powers, and turns up with a retinue replete with a caparisoned elephant, to demand the debt owed by his former mentor.

Though he is humiliated by Kondadimadan’s invisible army of spirits (chathans) and sent back, the unsettled due is a matter of embarassment for the overlord. Mantravanan would return shortly and repeat his proposition that the master repay the debt or release one of his spirits.

Meanwhile, Poomala, daughter of the overlord, is charmed by Sundaran chathan, on a designated day of Makaram when all spirits break free and run riot. An incensed Kondadimadan banishes her from the house for not heeding his warnings about never engaging with a spirit on the particular day.

The moment of reckoning soon arrives when Mantravanan turns up to collect his debt. Kondadimadan prefers to betray Karimkutty and releases him instead. As Karimkutty, bound in rope, is led away by his new master, the other spirits turn on Kondadimadan attacking him with stones, to complete the downfall of the once-powerful overlord.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/jlttw5/article30887112.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21THEATRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/karimkutty-is-all-about-classical-finesse-and-the-occult/article30887115.ece
358,2020/02/22,Cash transfer to ration cardholders: Narayanasamy disappointed with Madras High Court ruling,"‘Free rice distribution was an electoral promise of Congress’

Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy has expressed disappointment over the Madras High Court order dismissing his writ petition challenging the decision of the Centre and Lt. Governor to transfer cash to beneficiaries’ accounts instead of distributing free rice to ration cardholders.

“It is a sad day for us. On one side, the Centre and Lt. Governor are working against us. Now the Court says it cannot go against the decision of the President of India. In this context, I don't know how to do anything for people,” he said in an emotional address at a function to mark the AICC membership drive on Friday evening.

Free rice distribution was an electoral promise of the Congress. The Lt. Governor objected to the decision and referred the matter to the Centre. The Union government concurred with the decision of Lt. Governor to transfer cash to the beneficiaries account, the Chief Minister said.

The government decided to approach the court after the cash transfer scheme did not find favour among the public.

L-G hails verdict

V Kartikeyan of Madras High Court for upholding the directions of Government of India to the Puducherry Administration to transfer money directly into bank accounts for free rice and not the way it was earlier,” she tweeted.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/r1jbiy/article30884962.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22NARAYANASAMY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/cash-transfer-to-ration-cardholders-narayanasamy-disappointed-with-madras-high-court-ruling/article30884963.ece
359,2020/02/22,Cash transfer to ration cardholders: Madras High Court dismisses Puducherry Chief Minister’s plea,"Court holds that V. Narayanasamy could not question the President’s decision concurring with Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi, in favour of disbursing cash to ration cardholders.

The Madras High Court on Friday dismissed a writ petition filed by Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy challenging a decision taken by the President concurring with Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi, in favour of disbursing cash to ration cardholders instead of supplying them rice as resolved by the Council of Ministers of the Union Territory.

Justice C.V. Karthikeyan held that Mr. Narayanasamy could not question the order of the President, communicated through the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, since as CM he had taken an oath to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution and act in accordance with the Constitution and the law.

Pointing out that the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963, empowers the L-G to refer an issue to the President if he/she disagrees with the advice provided by the Council of Ministers, the judge said that the Act specifically states that a decision taken by the President, on such a reference, must be acted upon without posing any question or expecting an answer.

Also Read Cash transfer to ration cardholders: Narayanasamy disappointed with Madras High Court ruling

“When a decision has been rendered by the President, then further actions must only be according to the decision given by the President. This is binding on the Council of Ministers, which includes the Chief Minister, and also the Lieutenant Governor. All who have taken oath to abide by the provisions of the Constitution are bound by it. It is not for this court to call for explanations from the Ministry of Home Affairs as to what were the supervening circumstances which prevailed upon the President to give a decision that the Direct Benefit Transfer (cash) scheme must be preferred in lieu of distribution of free rice. The immunity guaranteed under the Constitution is sacrosanct,” the judge observed.

He also stated that the court could not go into the merits of the case and give a finding as to whether disbursing cash would be better than distributing rice. “This court, even while exercising its writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, can never examine the merits/demerits of two different proposals. That would mean giving up the robe of a judge and wearing the apparel of a Chief Minister/Lieutenant Governor. This court certainly does not want to give up its robe and alternatively wear the apparel of those authorities. Therefore, very consciously, I am not entering into any discussion as to whether supply of free rice is a better option or not,” he said.

Hasty move

Also taking a dig at Ms. Bedi, the judge said that the Supreme Court, while deciding a similar case relating to the Union Territory of Delhi in 2018, observed that the Administrator (referred to as L-G in Puducherry) of an Union Territory must make every effort to resolve a matter of difference with the Cabinet before making a reference to the President. “In this case, very regrettably, it appears that not even a fleeting thought had swept across the mind of the third respondent (L-G) to attempt to make an effort, even a small effort to resolve the matter of difference... with intent to bring about an amicable solution which might have saved the exchequer this costly legal proceeding,” he added.

The judge also made it clear that the Supreme Court had clarified in its 2018 judgment that the administration of Delhi was different from that of Puducherry. Such a stand was also borne out by the Lok Sabha debate which took place when the then Home Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri moved the 14th Constitution Amendment Bill of 1962 regarding Puducherry, he said.

The Bill was moved after the ratification of the treaty of cession between India and France on August 16, 1962. Article 239A of the Constitution provided for creating a local legislature in Puducherry and it stated that the powers and functions of the elected as well as nominated members of the Assembly would be specified by law. “The law in this case is the Government of Union Territories Act of 1963,” the judge concluded.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/ukwyru/article30884193.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22THHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/hc-dismisses-puducherry-cms-plea/article30884194.ece
360,2020/02/22,Pathrakulam pond: Revenue dept to conduct a hearing more,"Sree Vidyadhiraja Sabha has been accused of encroaching upon and filling up the pond

As part of steps to resume the Pathrakulam pond, the Revenue Department will conduct one more hearing with the Sree Vidyadhiraja Sabha, which has been accused of encroaching upon and filling up the pond located in East Fort.

In a hearing conducted a few days ago, as per a court order, the trust requested for one more opportunity to prove their claims.

“The court had, after putting on hold the Government’s 2019 Order to resume the land over violation of lease conditions, ordered that the trust be heard once again. The first hearing is over now. As the trust has requested for one more hearing, a decision can be taken only after that,” said V. Venu, Principal Secretary, Revenue and Disaster Management.

The State government had assigned on lease the land, which includes the pond, to the trust in 1976 to construct a memorial for Chattampi Swamikal. The pond was later filled up. In 2007, the government issued an order to resume the land from the trust on the ground that they had illegally filled up the Pathrakulam and that they had not paid the entire amounts for the assignment of the land within time. However, this order was cancelled by the High Court. The 2019 order from the government to resume the land also led to similar results, as part of which the hearing is being conducted now.

The Pathrakulam pond once served as a natural flushing and recycling mechanism for the Padmatheertham pond situated nearby. Water from the Kochar, a tributary of the Killi River, was brought into the Padmatheertham pond, from where the excess water got diverted to the Pathrakulam, from where it was redirected to the Thekkanamkara canal. The water level as well the quality of water was maintained by this system of constant circulation. As a result of reclaiming the Pathrakulam and the blocking of the canal from Kochar, the Padmatheertham pond became stagnant.

As part of the ‘Operation Anantha’ flood mitigation drive four years ago, the district administration had cleared encroachments on drains in the Fort and nearby areas. But no efforts were taken to retrieve the Pathrakulam pond, without which the operation did not give the intended results.

With the city Corporation planning to construct an underground market, modelled on Delhi’s Palika Bazar, as part of the Smart City project in the East Fort area, reducing all possibilities of flooding in the area has become important.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/pathrakulam-pond-revenue-dept-to-conduct-a-hearing-more/article30890427.ece

362,2020/02/22,VACB to probe all bank transactions of ex-Minister Sivakumar,"It claims to have evidence about his benami dealings

After a 13-hour raid on his residence here on Wednesday, the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) on Friday appeared to indicate that it was yet to get to the bottom of the politically sensitive ‘illegal amassment’ of wealth case against former Health Minister and Congress legislator V.S. Sivakumar.

Officials privy to the investigation hinted that the agency would issue notices to banks where Mr Sivakumar or those close to him allegedly held lockers or had transacted business. The agency indicted three other persons, including Mr. Sivakumar's personal chauffeur, on the charge of having channelled the politician's ‘illicitly earned’ wealth into purchasing prime real estate in their name. They also included a lawyer, who Mr. Sivakumar said he barely knew. However, the officials indicated that the investigators appeared to have mobile phone call data records that proved otherwise.

Investigators enumerated the cash and gold in Mr. Sivakumar's house and copied documents they reckoned were relevant to their case. The agency had simultaneously raided the residences of the other three persons named as accused along with Mr. Sivakumar. It was cagey about the outcome of the raid and whether the inspections had yielded any incriminating evidence.

ED being roped in

However, an official said the VACB would pass on its findings to the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which had sought ‘third party information’, if any, to find out whether there was a money laundering angle to the anti-corruption probe. The agency had done the same in the disproportionate assets case against former Excise Minister K. Babu. The ED had also evinced interest in the corruption case against former Public Works Minister V. K. Ebrahim Kunju.

Meanwhile, Mr. Sivakumar termed the raid as a blessing in disguise. He said the agency was now convinced about his many financial liabilities. He had nothing to hide.

‘To divert attention’

Mr. Sivakumar reiterated his allegation that the government had unleashed the VACB against him to divert public attention away from the high-level police corruption flagged by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/qmek99/article30886778.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21KRAVSSIVAKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/vacb-to-probe-all-bank-transactions-of-ex-minister-sivakumar/article30886779.ece
363,2020/02/22,Experts call for a National River Policy,"International Conference on Rivers for Future held in capital

Participants of the International Conference on Rivers for Future (RFF-2020) held in the city has urged the Central government to put in place a National River Policy, introduce ‘health cards’ for rivers, and focus on integrated river and wetland development.

RFF-2020 was organised at Karyavattom earlier this month by the Department of Aquatic Biology and Fisheries of the University of Kerala in association with the Centre for Innovation in Science and Social Action (CISSA).

The conference recommended Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu to establish State-level River, Biodiversity and Climate Interpretation Centres (RBCIC) for initiating awareness programmes, conducting surveys, and monitoring rivers and wetlands with the participation of the civil society.

In the era of climate change when dependence on rivers was only going to increase, there should be a master plan for river restoration for individual rivers, participants of the conference said.

Degradation

A National River Policy is important in this context, as rivers face ever-increasing threats related to carrying capacity, dams, decline in water quality, non-perenniality and overexploitation of river resources, and degradation of riverine features such as flood plains and wetlands.

The policy should incorporate, among other things, concepts such as the right for existence of the river, sand auditing and river bank mapping, creation of green buffer zones along river margins, and geo-spatial mapping of rivers, watersheds, and floodplains, it said.

It should also incorporate ‘health cards’ for individual rivers, decentralised watershed development plans and ecosystem-based integrated river restoration programmes with the participation of all stakeholders.

The conference also wants river festivals and a National River Day to be part of the policy.

“This ecosystem approach places river restoration within the wider context of Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) and sees river basins as Sources (upland water gathering grounds and the origins of floods), Pathways (rivers and floodplains) and Receptors (downstream communities impacted by flooding and pollution),” RFF-2020 organisers said in a statement.

Water flow patterns, annual sedimentation and carrying capacity of reservoirs should be assessed periodically along the Western Ghats, the conference demanded.

“Further, the lateral connectivity of the rivers with wetlands should be reinstated, and the wetlands along the watersheds and flood plains should be reclaimed, besides creating artificial wetlands to receive flood waters and managing flood,” it said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/experts-call-for-a-national-river-policy/article30884176.ece

Contemporary political and social issues ranging from the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) to the gruesome rape and murder of two sisters in Walayar became the subject of plays from across the State on the first day of the youth theatre festival organised by the State Youth Welfare Board at the Tagore Theatre here on Friday.

Plays representing all the 14 districts are being staged at the festival, aimed at highlighting the works of young theatre practitioners. The festival here is the culmination of weeks of district-level competitions, in which winners were chosen to represent the district at the State level.

On the first day, nine plays were staged, each of them varied in their content and form. Roundana, presented by Vijayeswari Arts from Kollam, was on the oppression of the common people by those in power. Pets of Anarchy, presented by Apt Performance and Research Centre from Thiruvananthapuram, with its story woven around a situation wherein the government bans pets except those of one colour, talked about contemporary political issues.

When the couple filled up the application form on the day, they did not specify any religion. On seeing this, the school authorities expressed reluctance in giving admission claiming that not filling the column could create difficulties for the child in future, alleges Naseem.

The parents were also told that the Education Department’s Sampoorna school management software on which a child’s details are added required that religion be specified. Else, they should furnish the necessary government orders to prove that declaring religion on the form was not mandatory.

The couple then contacted the Directorate of General Education where they were told that specifying religion was not mandatory on Sampoorna. They were also asked to contact the school Principal directly.

‘Furnish declaration’

On returning to the school, the parents were asked to furnish a declaration that the school would not be responsible for any problems that cropped up owing to their unwillingness to fill up the religion column, Naseem says.

Worried about his son’s future in the school, the couple decided against seeking his admission there.

Naseem says his son was earlier a Class 1 student of a prominent government school but since he had skipped upper kindergarten (UKG), they put him into UKG. When it was time to admit him to Class 1, they approached St. Mary’s school, especially since they planned to shift to their new house in Pattom. “We were never asked by the government school, where our son studied earlier, about our choice not to specify religion,” says Naseem.

After controversy erupted over the denial of admission, a local manager called up offering admission, but they decided against it in the wake of the school’s approach, says Naseem.

Archdiocese stance

Run by the Major Archdiocese of the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church, St Mary’s school is one of the largest schools in Asia.

Meanwhile, a statement issued by the Archdiocese said the school authorities had not denied admission to the child or behaved in a provocative manner. Moreover, on coming to know of the matter, the school local manager had informed the parents that there was no hurdle to seeking admission.

The statement said when religion was not specified on the child’s application form, the parents were asked about it. They replied that they were disinclined to fill the column.

Parents, the statement said, had every right to make the decision. However, as most government benefits to students were based on religion, parents would be responsible if any student lost the benefits.

This was needed in writing, and was what the school authorities sought from the parent. However, a propaganda was being unleashed against the school by hiding facts.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/admission-denied-for-not-specifying-religion/article30884081.ece
368,2020/02/22,Expert suggests a new way to study COVID-19,"‘Raman Spectroscopy will be useful’

A scientific technique named after C.V. Raman, which has created a huge impact on diverse fields including biology and medical application, could contribute to expanding our understanding of the COVID-19, according to renowned scientist Wolfgang Kiefer.

Raman spectroscopy is a universal technique suited for solving problems in physics and chemistry and it has had a huge impact on biology and medical application as well, Dr. Kiefer, who ranks among the top names in the field of Raman Spectroscopy, said during an interaction with students of Sarvodaya Vidyalaya.

Laser beam

“A single virus or bacterium can be trapped in a focussed laser beam and can be studied for its characteristics and also the changes when antibiotics are used on them to develop effective medicines or treatments,” he was quoted in a statement.

“The effect of SARS-CoV-2 can be studied in great detail using a Raman spectroscope in a medical environment and ways of eradicating or treating this virus can be understood in future researches using this technique,” he said.

Dr. Kiefer has contributed to expanding the horizons of Raman spectroscopy, the development of novel instrument techniques and their applications in a wide range of scientific areas.

He met the students as part of an initiative of Talentspire. Underscoring the importance of the study of science, he urged the students to “get infected by the virus Ramanus Spectroscopus rather than by the SARS-CoV-2.” Talentspire is a collective formed to promote holistic learning of science among students. Over 200 students and teachers of Sarvodaya Vidyalaya attended the session.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/ld41k4/article30884065.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22tvtv-DrWolfgangKiefer,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/expert-suggests-a-new-way-to-study-covid-19/article30884066.ece
369,2020/02/22,ISL | ATK rallies to hold BFC,"Host misses chance to seal third spot because of stalemate

Bengaluru FC missed the chance to seal third spot in the ISL after being held to a 2-2 draw by ATK at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium on Saturday.

A second-string BFC side was leading 2-0 until the fag end, courtesy first-half goals from Dimas Delgado and Kevaughn Frater. But ATK hit back in the last five minutes through goals from substitutes Edu Garcia and Soosairaj to deny BFC the win.

Chennaiyin FC can now grab third place with a victory against NorthEast FC away on Tuesday. Any other result will benefit BFC.

On the day, ATK, despite having sealed second position, put out a full strength side that included top-scorer Roy Krishna. But it showed little verve for large tracts of the contest.

Only in the final quarter did it hit the stride; in the 86th minute Garcia played two delightful one-twos in succession with Krishna and David Williams before slotting the ball into the bottom left corner. Soosairaj’s equaliser came when his weak shot from the edge of the area deflected off Gursimrat Singh Gill and looped above BFC goalie Prabhsukhan Singh Gill into the goal.

Earlier, BFC opened the scoring in the 17th minute through a freekick from Delgado. Goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh — of FIFA U-17 World Cup fame — flapped at the ball but didn’t have the strength to parry it away.

The visitors almost hit back immediately through a corner but Harmanjot Khabra was at hand to effect a goal-line clearance. The hosts doubled the lead on 35 minutes when Leon Augustine dashed past defender Victor Mongil on the right flank and crossed to an unmarked Frater to drive home.

With the strike, the Jamaican, making his first start for the club, would have expected to be on the winning side. But it was not to be.

The result: Bengaluru FC 2 (Delgado 17, Frater 35) drew with ATK 2 (Garcia 86, Soosairaj 90).",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/4wdgdn/article30891403.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23BFC,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/isl-atk-rallies-to-hold-bfc/article30891404.ece
370,2020/02/22,Premier League | Giroud on target as Chelsea claim vital win over Tottenham,"Giroud, making his first league start since November, rifled home in the 15th minute; Alonso doubles the Blue’s lead three minutes after half time

Chelsea’s Olivier Giroud and Marcos Alonso returned to the starting lineup to stunning effect by grabbing a goal apiece in a crucial 2-1 home win over Tottenham Hotspur in the battle between the London rivals for fourth place on Saturday.

It was only Chelsea’s sixth win in 14 home Premier League games this season but means they remain fourth, which brings Champions league qualification, with 44 points from 27 games, four more than Spurs.

A poor run of form had weakened Chelsea’s grip on fourth spot but they controlled the lunchtime derby from the moment Frenchman Giroud, making his first league start since November, rifled home in the 15th minute.

Spaniard Alonso, back for only his seventh league start after falling out of favour under coach Frank Lampard, doubled the lead three minutes after the interval with a thumping left-foot finish at Stamford Bridge.

Tottenham did manage a late consolation with an Antonio Rudiger own goal but the hosts fully deserved the win as Lampard got the better of his former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho for the second time this season after a 2-0 win at Spurs in December.

The margin of victory should have been bigger with Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris making several fine saves and Alonso also curling a free kick against the bar late on.

Tottenham had been on a three-game winning run and arrived with the incentive of being able to move above their London rivals. But with leading strikers Harry Kane and Son Heung-min injured they offered only a sporadic threat.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/i0gng2/article30890403.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SOCCER-ENGLAND-CHE-TOTREPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/premier-league-giroud-on-target-as-chelsea-claim-vital-win-over-tottenham/article30890404.ece
371,2020/02/22,Not happy with results: Nawas,"Have to get something out of this match: Stanley

It has largely been a tale of missed opportunities for Chennai City FC (CCFC) and Aizawl FC in the Hero I-League so far. While the host is placed eighth in the table, the visitor is two below.

Not ruing their bad luck or lost chances, the teams are looking forward to a positive outcome.

When CCFC, the defending champion, and Aizawl meet at the Nehru Stadium here on Sunday, each will fancy its chances.

Akbar Nawas, CCFC’s head coach, said he is happy with the performance of his players and that only the results had not been favourable. He insisted that one win would change the dynamics altogether. “Playing-wise I am very happy with our performance. Result-wise I am not. The foreigners are working very hard. The only thing is we have to do is put the ball into the net,” he said. “Once the results come, we will be able to get consecutive wins and climb up the ladder.”

According to Nawas, the biggest gain of the league was that his players have developed tactically and their positional play improved manifold.

Aizawl’s chief coach Stanley Rozario said if his side can pull up its socks, a mid-table position is still possible.

Stanley said the areas of concern have been the team’s laxity in letting in goals at the last minute and conceding penalties unnecessarily. “We need a focussed approach and have to get something out of this match,” he said.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/g0y77f/article30890138.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23CCFC,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/not-happy-with-results-nawas/article30890139.ece

We did video analysis before the match with our coach (Owen Coyle) telling us there is going to be space for the second ball at the far post. Fate put me there, I scored and am very happy for that.”

He added: “I feel bad for Mumbai that they did not qualify, but I feel we were the better team at the season’s end.

“It was an open game with lot of chances. I am happy Chennayin FC is the team which is qualifying and happy that my goal helped my team.

373,2020/02/22,‘Real Madrid is a fantastic club’: Raheem Sterling's comment sparks transfer rumours,"Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola appeared calm about Sterling's flattering Real Madrid comments.

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola appeared unfazed by his winger Raheem Sterling's decision to pose with a Real Madrid shirt on the front of Spanish newspaper AS in an interview where he discussed the possibility of a move to the Spanish capital.

City play Real in Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League next week and the winger, has been linked with a possible move to Real, speculation which has intensified after City's two year UEFA ban from European football.

Asked whether he would like to play for Madrid in the future, Sterling said: “How do I answer that one? Is the camera live or is it just taking pictures?”

“No one knows what the future will hold. I am a player and I am always open to challenges but right now my challenge is at City and I'm really happy. I have a contract with City now and I have to respect this. Real Madrid are a fantastic club. When you see the white shirt you know exactly what the club stands for, it's massive,” he said.

Sterling featured on the cover of the newspaper with a Real shirt and City shirt hanging over each shoulder.

Guardiola was asked at Friday's press conference what he felt about the interview and appeared unperturbed.

“The players are free to talk and say what they believe and what they think,” he said. “So we are not here to tell them what they have to say. It's normal to make an interview for the Madrid media and speak about Madrid,” said the City coach.

Guardiola said despite the ban, City's players remain fully committed and focused on the rest of the season.

City were banned from European competition for the next two seasons and fined 30 million euros by European soccer's governing body UEFA last week after an investigation into alleged breaches of Financial Fair Play rules.

City will appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport but it has not stopped media speculation about players potentially leaving the English champions if the ban is upheld.

“I am completely sure about the commitment of our players. They have shown it for many, many years,” Guardiola told reporters ahead of Saturday's league trip to Leicester City.

“No one knows what will happen, but right now the commitment for the last three months, every single game, I don't have any doubts... We cannot change what people think. I know how hard we work. I am so proud about how hard we've worked all these years. No one helped us outside, we did it day by day, game by game. This is not finished, it's not over. We appeal as a club and we see what happens,” he added.

374,2020/02/22,ISL | Goian carries Chennaiyin into top four,"A red card given and one not given prove crucial; heartbreak for Mumbai City FC

Lucian Goian’s late strike — an airborne right-footed volley — turned out to be Chennaiyin FC’s match-winner in an enthralling, hard-fought encounter against his former team Mumbai City FC in the ISL season six here on Friday night. The Romanian, a defender with the instincts of a goal-poacher, arrived at the post in time for a corner-kick, squeezed the ball past rival captain Amrinder Singh from a narrow angle and silenced the crowd at the Mumbai Football Arena.

The result pushes CFC into the semifinal playoffs. It is currently placed fourth in the table — 28 points from 17 games and has a match in hand — against NEUFC — to move higher up. Two points behind is Mumbai City in fifth.

Professional foul

Forced to play with a player short from the 54th minute onward, following a red card to defender Sourav Das for a professional foul on Lallianzuala Chhangte, the host gained strength from adversity to attack the rival goal, missed a chance to take the lead, before Goian’s knockout punch in the 83rd minute.

Two card decisions in the space of two minutes in the second half injected life into the game. Vishal Kaith was lucky to escape with a yellow card in the 52nd minute for a side-footed challenge on Amine Chermiti.

The goalkeeper rushed out, realised that the Tunisian was faster and after missing the ball, tripped the forward.

The home team hoped for a red, but the referee decided the foul deserved only a yellow.

Chermiti held his head in shock at the decision, appeals for a red card were brushed aside and players lined up for a free-kick just beyond the box on the right.

The low shot rolled back off the wall, and Chennaiyin launched a counter-attack via Chhangte. The little forward streaked across the turf, crossed the centreline, chased by Das whose challenge from behind after seeing goalkeeper Amrinder rushing back led to his sending off.

Thoi Singh and Geermanpreet Singh came off the bench, as Own Coyle decided to turn on the pace, needing a win and handicapped with 10 men on the pitch.

MCFC attacked with all its might and Diego Carlos created the best chance of the night for Chermiti, who brought down a long ball from the left with a superb first touch, then toed with his left to wrong-foot Kaith, only to see the ball roll just wide off the left post.

375,2020/02/22,Students clean government hospital campus in Tiruchi,"The students of Oxford engineering college were ordered to clean the premises as a corrective measure after they were arrested in a case of campus violence

Students of a private college in the city undertook cleaning work at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital on Saturday following a Madras High Court directive.

Twenty eight students were ordered to clean the hospital premises as a corrective measure after they were arrested in a case of campus violence using beer bottles and wooden logs on July 28, 2019 where at least five students sustained injuries. The order was given by Justice A.D. Jagadish Chandira of the Madurai bench of the Madras High Court after the students submitted a plea to quash the FIR registered against them.

K. Vanitha, dean, MGMGH, said that the students, all belonging to Oxford Engineering College, had undergone an hour of counselling at the Department of Psychiatry before undertaking the cleaning work. “They have understood their mistakes and have shown regret. To show them the uncertainty of life, I also took them to meet some patients of road accidents admitted in the ICU,” she said.

The students began cleaning the campus of dried leaves and garbage and will also clean the general ward later on in the day, Dr. Vanitha said. “They have also shown interest in donating blood. We will make arrangements to do that at the blood bank in the evening,” she said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/m9iy27/article30888049.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22FEBTH--Cleanjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/students-clean-government-hospital-campus-in-tiruchi/article30888050.ece

377,2020/02/22,Two girls in TN’s Aranthangi develop nano satellite,"The satellite would be launched from a Mexico airbase through helium capsule next month.

Two girls studying Plus Two in Pudukottai district have developed a nano satellite with applications in agriculture.

The efforts of M. Subuhana and T. Kiruthika of Sheikh Fathima Girls Matriculation Higher Secondary in Aranthangi taluk in developing the satellite came in for praise from Collector P. Uma Maheswari who invited them to her office.

The satellite would be launched from a Mexico airbase through helium capsule next month. The nano satellite would be useful in finding climate change, atmospheric moisture, humidity and greenhouse gas, which would all be useful for agriculture purpose, said Ms. Kiruthika, daughter of a farmer.

The idea to develop a came to them after a student from Tiruchi, Villet Oviya, developed a nano satellite a couple of years ago, said Ms. Kiruthika.

The two students conveyed the idea to the Agni Foundation in Chennai.

“Technical support came to us from the Foundation and Garuda Air Space in Chennai and it took us about four to five months to develop the nano satellite,” said Ms. Kiruthika. The satellite weighing 400 grams has sensors and would be sent through a helium capsule and positioned in the stratosphere at an altitude of 50 km, she said.

378,2020/02/22,Leaders call for upholding democracy,"The disinvestment policy of the Central government was wreaking havoc on social justice, K.Veeramani said.

A call to uphold federalism and democracy through sustained struggle against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was made by speakers at the Social Justice Conference of Dravidar Kazhagam here on Friday.

The CAA was not the problem of Muslims alone, the leaders said, assailing the AIADMK and PMK for toeing the line of the BJP and voting for passage of the CAB in the Rajya Sabha.

Dravida Kazhagam president K.Veeramani, who earlier addressed the anti-CAA protesters close to the conference venue, said Muslims had been in the country for generations. The BJP was trying to usher in a ‘fascist regime’ and destroying the foundations of democracy, social justice and secularism, he charged.

The disinvestment policy of the Central government was wreaking havoc on social justice, Mr. Veeramani said.

The agenda of RSS to establish Hindu Rashtra through divisive approaches would not fructify, he added.

Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol. Thirumavalavan alleged the BJP was misleading OBCs who had been denied the benefits of reservation as per Mandal Commission recommendations on the plank of Hindutva. With brute force, the Centre was interfering even in verdicts of judiciary, he said.

The CAA was aimed at making Muslims Stateless people and denying them voting rights. The BJP government was trying to tamper with the Constitution with the aim to do away with the secular tenets of the nation. People were being forced into a situation to launch a struggle to safeguard Constitution, Mr. Thirumavalavan said.

State secretary of CPI R. Mutharasan said the Centre was discriminating people on the basis of language, citing what he described as the huge allocation for development of Sanskrit and the neglect of Tamil and other Dravidian languages.

The ongoing protest against CAA will not dissipate. The CPI respects democracy and people's mandate for BJP’s rule at the Centre, but will not accept dictatorship. Disruption of educational empowerment of the poor caused by the National Educational Policy will not be tolerated, he said, while opposing NEET.

Assailing the Centre for enacting CAA, DMK Rajya Sabha MP Tiruchi N. Siva said the country was in danger of disintegration. Federalism was crumbling and democracy was under threat. Normality had not returned to Kashmir due to abrogation of Article 370. The BJP was having its way due to lack of unity among opposition parties, he said.

CPM State committee member Kanagaraj said the BJP was trying to derail democracy and trying to bring about a single-party rule..

General secretary of Manitha Neya Makkal Katchi Abdul Samad said CAA has put the citizenship of Muslims at stake.

The ship was quarantined after a passenger who de-boarded last month in Hong Kong was found to be the carrier of the COVID-19 on the ship. After news of the stranded ship spread, the man's wife petitioned the Collector, requesting his intervention in bringing him back home safely.

The woman, who did not want her husband to be identified, presented a petition to the Collector on Thursday.

381,2020/02/22,Harvesting over in three-fourth of cultivated area in Thanjavur,"2.48 lakh tonnes of paddy procured through 447 DPCs in the district so far

Harvest of paddy has been completed in three-fourth of the total area in which samba and thaladi cultivation was taken up by farmers in Thanjavur district.

According to a press release from the Agriculture Department at the Farmers’ grievance day meeting held at the Collectorate here on Friday, paddy cultivation was taken up in 1,03,052 hectares during samba season and in 32,135 hectares as thaladi crop. As of February 20, out of the total 1,35,187 hectares of cultivation, harvest had been completed in 1,04,370 hectares.

While around 77,000 tonnes of paddy had been procured through 90 direct purchase centres in Orathanadu taluk till February 20, 8,684 tonnes of paddy had been procured at 20 DPCs in Peravurani taluk.

In all, 2,48,982 tonnes of paddy had been procured by the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation through 447 DPCs in the district so far. As far as crop insurance was concerned, this year 2,78,173 farmers had insured their samba and thaladi crops of 3,11,787 acres, the release added.

Participating in the meeting, the president, A.K.R. Ravichandar, Cauvery Delta Vivasayigal Sangam, alleged that paddy brought from other districts were being procured at some DPCs. Vigilance at check posts should be stepped up and goods vehicles transporting paddy bags from the neighbouring districts prevented from entering the delta.

The malpractice would affect the delta farmers’ prospects of getting adequate crop insurance compensation for the yield loss they have suffered due to Gall Midge, grain fruiting and other diseases, he added.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/hq9l47/article30886729.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22TYDELTA-HARVEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/harvesting-over-in-three-fourth-of-cultivated-area-in-thanjavur/article30886730.ece
382,2020/02/22,Signs of resurgence after four years at Mallur industrial estate,"Small Industries Development Corporation allots plots to two entrepreneurs

Almost four years after establishment of an industrial estate at Mallur on the outskirts of Ariyalur, the Small Industries Development Corporation (SIDCO) has allotted industrial plots to two entrepreneurs.

The SIDCO promoted the industrial estate at Mallur in 2015 to support small, medium and micro entrepreneurs and promote industrial activities. Of the 25 acres, SIDCO developed 31 plots ranging from 5 cents to 75 cents on 5 acres, in the first phase, so as to suit the varied requirements of entrepreneurs. It also laid roads at the industrial estate and an approach road. Other basic infrastructure such as water supply, storm water drainage and power lines were also provided.

The plots were opened for outright sales or 30-year-lease. Interested persons were given six months time for settlement from the date of allotment. Since the estate is located near cement factories, the SIDCO officials expected that the estate would find many takers.

On the contrary, none came forward to buy the plots. Despite a promotional campaign, the SIDCO could not make any headway in promoting the estate.

Now, after a long gap, SIDCO has managed to sell two plots to small entrepreneurs recently. They are expected to start their ventures shortly. SIDCO officials say there are signs of demand picking up for the plots.

“Until recently, there were hardly any enquires for plots. But, we get credible enquiries on a daily basis now. We hope that the allotment will pick up pace shortly,” a senior official of SIDCO told The Hindu.

The estate is well connected by rail and road. A number of development works have been taken up in Ariyalur.

The laying of highways from Perambalur to Thanjavur via Ariyalur and Tiruchi to Chidambaram via Meensuriti might be the reason for increasing enquiries for industrial plots, officials said.

The SIDCO has invited fresh applications for allotment of plots at Ariyalur industrial estate. Interested persons can apply online. The last date for submission of application is February 29.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/signs-of-resurgence-after-four-years-at-mallur-industrial-estate/article30886628.ece
383,2020/02/22,"Rail users seek train services to Bengaluru, Coimbatore","Nagore-Nagapattinam Rail Users’ Association has appealed to the railway administration to introduce train services to Bengaluru, Madurai and Coimbatore either from Velankanni or Nagore.

Its secretary MMAA. Sithiq said Velankanni, Nagore and Tirunallar towns attracted a large number of tourists from southern and western districts, besides from Bengaluru. However, there was no direct train service to Madurai and Coimbatore or an overnight express train to Bengaluru from Velankanni or Nagore.

The lone passenger train that was operated to Bengaluru from Karaikal via Mayiladuthurai and Cuddalore started verey early in the morning, around 3.40 a.m., from Karaikal, and at 4.15 a.m. from Nagapattinam. The departure timing of the passenger train was not suitable for tourists from Karaikal and Nagapattinam and was useful for passengers boarding midway.

A large number of tourists from Bengaluru who visit Velankanni, Nagore and Thirunallar prefer an overnight express train for undertaking their journey. But there was no overnight express service to Bengaluru.

The association has appealed to the railway administration to operate an overnight express train either from Nagore or Velankanni daily to Bengaluru or Yeswantpur taking into account the huge tourist arrivals to Velankanni, Nagore and Tirunallar.

It has also appealed to the administration to operate a daily early morning express train from Velankanni to Madurai via Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Tiruchi and Dindigul since the section from Thanjavur to Madurai was now a double line.

The association has also requested for operation of a daily express train from Coimbatore to Karaikal and back via Pollachi, Palani, Dindigul and Tiruchi and Thanjavur. Mr. Sithiq said Palani was a important pilgrim town which does not have direct train service either from the delta districts or Tiruchi.

Train timings

It wanted the authorities to make suitable changes in the timing of Tiruchi - Karaikal passenger for the benefit of passengers coming by the Coimbatore - Mayiladuthurai Jan Shatabdi express and proceeding to Velankanni, Nagore and Tirunallar.

The Coimbatore - Mayiladuthurai Jan Shatabdi express reaches Thanjavur Junction at 12.05 p.m., while the Tiruchi - Karaikal passenger departs Thanjavur at 11.25 a.m. There was no connecting train to Karaikal from Thanjavur till 6 p.m forcing tourists coming by the Jan Shatabdi Express to catch a bus to either Velankanni, Nagore and Tirunallar from Thanjavur.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/rail-users-seek-train-services-to-bengaluru-and-coimbatore/article30886627.ece
384,2020/02/22,Bad roads leading to temple causes much inconvenience,"The approach roads to Kuzhumayi Amman Temple situated near the aqueduct at Puther Weir lies in a poor state. Lack of street lights add to the problem during night time, residents say.

The roads leading to Kuzhumayi Amman Temple from both sides, from near the District Court Complex along the Uyyakondan canal or from the Vayalur Road along the Kudamurutti canal, lay in a sorry state while residents, primarily farmers, struggle to travel to and fro. Rapid urbanisation and the setting up of a private school along the stretch has increased the number of travellers on the road. However, it remains isolated at night.

The upcoming annual temple festival will bring hundreds of devotees to the temple. “Every year during Maasi month a sacrificial offering is given here. People from the city and nearby villages visit and offer their prayers. These roads, which are already narrow, become choked with traffic and it is difficult to navigate,"" said R. Sivan, a resident.

The Puthur weir near the Kuzhumayi Amman Temple has also turned into a leisure spot for residents residing in nearby Sozhanganallur, Uyyakondan Thirumalai, Pratiyur and other villages. The civic body has adequate funds which can be utilised to benefit the public, said V. Sundararaju, president, Society for Conservation of Nature (SOFCON). The road is a short route for people from these villages to access the Tiruchi Collectorate, the Central bus Stand and the Court complex, he pointed out.

Residents say that in spite of repeated requests, the authorities have failed to pay heed, let alone make necessary arrangements. “At night, several chain snatching and mugging incidents occur here because it is so isolated. People prefer not to travel alone at night. Even during the day, women and children are asked not to take this route,"" said T. Raju, another resident. The Nachikurichi panchayat, under which the side from Kudamurutti river falls, is also aware of the condition of the roads but has not done anything, they say. ""Until somebody slips and falls into the river or meets with an accident,"" Mr. Raju said.

Corporation officials said that road extension work would require land acquisition, which the landowners were not willing. “On one side there is the Uyyakondan canal, so land can only be acquired from the other side. These residents complain but are not willing to give their land,” an official said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/bad-roads-leading-to-temple-causes-inconvenience/article30886615.ece

386,2020/02/22,Over two-decade-long passion to serve,"Friends come together to dish out delicious prasadam to devotees on every Maha Sivaratri

The devout from the city look forward to Maha Sivaratri every year to take a holy dip in the Krishna and then head to various temples to perform special pujas on the auspicious day. And there is another section here which waits for this day, to serve the devotees with various kinds of prasadam, as a goodwill gesture.

Tents lined up on Canal Road in One Town distributing a variety of food items and water sachets is a common sight on the festival day, and one of them is known for drawing huge crowds. Living up to its reputation, five types of prasadams were distributed here on Friday – chakra pongali, katte pongali, kadambam, tomato baath and sweet boondi– much to the delight of the visitors.

‘Service to God’

What started off as a one-off gesture by nine friends, this service has been going on at this place for over two decades now. “We picked up this idea 23 years ago and have been continuing the service ever since without a break as we consider it a service to god,” says P. Siva Subrahmanyam, a businessman.

“We began by pooling ₹15,000 from our pockets in the first year and slowly other friends and relatives too started showing interest and contributions this year have reached ₹1.5 lakh,” he added. “The preparations started on Thursday evening to meet the early morning deadline to dish out a mammoth 1,000 kg of food. We have served it to about 10,000 people today,” said another businessman Vandanapu Srinivasa Rao, who plays a key role in organising the process.

“We take up this task seriously and with devotion. Scores of our friends came in today and vied with one another to personally serve the food to devotees,” remarked Ch. Motilal.

An inspiration to many

The team has also inspired many others make a similar effort and now there are nearly a dozen locations where prasadam is served to devotees on Sivaratri.

“We have been doing this service for about a decade now and this year we have distributed pulihora and chick pea in leaf bowls to over 7,000 people,” said Kasula Venkata Srinivas, treasurer of Vasavi Walkers Association, overseeing distribution at an adjacent tent.

“I don’t miss the prasadam here which is delicious and they keep changing the varieties every year,” said K. Nageswara Rao of Gandhinagar, who takes a dip in the Krishna at the Durga Ghat every year on this day. Many devotees prefer to have darshan of Lord Siva early in the morning and after remaining on fast for a few hours, the prasadam helps us break the fast, and it is quite filling too, he added.

“We wish to keep this service going as long as we can since this tiny gesture towards society gives us a lot of satisfaction,” beamed Mr. Subrahmanyam",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/d97g5/article30884169.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23VJPRASADAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/over-two-decade-long-passion-to-serve/article30884170.ece
387,2020/02/22,"The Huddle 2020 | Heroes still not okay with ceding screen space to women, says actor Taapsee Pannu","Men reluctant to play secondary role in Indian movies, says actor

Even though the Hindi film industry is witnessing a surge in the number of women-oriented films, male actors are still not comfortable sharing lesser screen space compared their women leads, said actor Taapsee Pannu on Saturday.

She was speaking at The Huddle 2020 at the session, “Gender Bender: Women in the new age of cinema” and narrated several instances of male actors showing reluctance to play a secondary role in a film. Ms Pannu said a leading actor, in fact, had refused to work with her in a film where he was given 40% screen time. He said he had been advised by people that he should not do this film at “this stage in his career”, the actor quoted him as saying.

Ms. Pannu also spoke of how women are always put on a pedestal which often deprives them of “feeling the regular emotions.”

‘Female voice’

“We are now, however, walking down from the pedestal to become normal human beings. In films, the aspirational hero is now being replaced by real people,” she said.

Speaking of women in the new age of cinema, screenwriter Atika Chohan said the “consolidation of the female voice” was a collective momentum of all female artistes. She also spoke of how feminism could not be superimposed on any story but should be organic.

“My perspective is feminist and I make sure that there is an equal balance between male and female characters,” she said. Writers like her believe that a female protagonist should claim her voice in the film and not let men take away the narrative from her.

Talking on the #MeToo movement, Namrata Rao, editor, spoke of how the movement had brought out solidarity and a sense of sisterhood among the fraternity. Ms. Chohan said she was grateful to the movement, but added that it did affect her work opportunities and some men in the industry had distanced themselves from her.

‘Social conditioning’

All the three panellists spoke of how they had to battle with their own social conditioning. Ms. Chohan said she constantly questions herself at work and wondered if she could be a “carrier of misogyny.”

Speaking of sexism which is deeply ingrained, Ms. Pannu spoke of how she was told by a producer that she was the “female Ayushmann Khurrana.”

“Things are normalised to such a large extent that a compliment is not actually a compliment. For how long will my benchmark be based on achievements of male actors?” she asked.

The session was moderated by Namrata Joshi, Cinema Editor, The Hindu.",the huddle,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/8wu7b5/article30891101.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23TH-PANNU,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/the-huddle-2020-heroes-still-not-okay-with-ceding-screen-space-to-women-says-actor-taapsee-pannu/article30891102.ece
388,2020/02/22,"The Huddle 2020 | Widening direct tax net should be key priority, say economists","‘Biggest fiscal stimulus that could be provided would be to simplify the GST to a single tax rate of 12%’

Widening the direct tax base should be a key priority for the government and the biggest fiscal stimulus that could be provided would be to simplify the GST to a single tax rate of 12%, according to economists speaking at a session of The Huddle titled ‘Rebooting the Economy: What needs to be done and how we go about it’.

“The first thing we need to is to converge on a single lower rate,” said Ajit Ranade, Group Executive President & Chief Economist, Aditya Birla Group. “Secondly, we need to expand the net. A large part of the GDP is still not in the GST tax net. Areas like electricity, petroleum... are still not under the GST,” he added.

“A higher GST rate is a virtual admission of failure that we were unable to go for a progressive tax regime that includes higher direct taxes,” he asserted.

“The [economic] slowdown is terrible for the unemployed,” said Jaimini Bhagwati, a former diplomat, World Bank Treasury Specialist and author. “For those who are underemployed, the need is to create more jobs. The Government has been unfair in not allowing the numbers [on GDP growth] to come out as they should. We are growing at 5% or even lower when we should have been growing at 8%. The problem is both structural and cyclical, not one or the other.”

Dr. Bhagwati said that the main concern is that India is largely a tax non-compliant society. The Central Board of Direct Taxes had recently said that only 5.78 crore individuals filed returns disclosing income for the financial year 2018-19.

“It is high time that the Government tracks the consumption pattern of things like scooter sales, how many are sending children abroad, how many people are buying a house and clamp down on those who are not paying taxes,” Dr. Bhagwati suggested. “In most other countries direct taxes are invariably more than indirect tax collection,” he observed.

“India’s direct tax-to-GDP ratio is among the lowest in the world,” said Dr. Ranade, participating in the panel discussion moderated by Raghavan Srinivasan, Editor, Business Line, on Saturday. “GST is a virtual admission of failure that we were unable to go for a progressive tax regime that includes higher direct taxes: About 70 % should come from direct tax. Indirect tax is regressive,” he added.

Responding to an audience question on equitable growth, Ashima Goyal, economist and author said, “There is a rise in rural unemployment because of the stress in agriculture. We need to deal with that issue on priority. For example, we could set up training agencies and provide opportunities in other areas.”

Dr. Bhagwati said there is a link between the poorest in the country and those working in the agriculture sector. “Over a period of the next 10 years, we need to get farmers off the land and get them jobs. India has roughly 50% of the population in agriculture while in developed countries it’s not more than 2-4%,” he remarked, adding that more funds should be given to village panchayats and local administrations, and in a transparent manner.

To a question on reviving investment in infrastructure sectors, Dr. Bhagwati said that the PPP model does not work because the risk is shifted to the public and the returns are taken by the private partner. “Government has to do the heavy lifting on infrastructure,” he added.

Dr. Ranade said that the lock-in period of 30-40 years in infrastructure projects should be done away with. “There should be something called ‘take out financing’ where a private investor comes in for say 7 years and he should be able to hand over the project to the next investor. We need development of the corporate bond market,” he suggested.

Addressing a question on why women’s participation in the economy was not addressed, Dr. Goyal observed that India had one of the lowest levels of women’s participation in the economy. “If women are empowered to transition from informal to formal [work] then that will boost GDP growth,” she said.",the huddle,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/vnxfx3/article30891045.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23TH-JAIMINI,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/the-huddle-2020-widening-direct-tax-net-should-be-key-priority-say-economists/article30891046.ece
389,2020/02/22,The Huddle 2020 | The delicate strings of musical thought,"In pursuit of middle ground

The concluding session of day one of The Huddle 2020 began with a song. Two artistes — Anil Srinivasan, pianist and educator, and musician Sikkil Gurucharan — opened their act, aptly titled “Between jazz and Jaunpuri: finding music’s middle ground”, with an interesting medley of poetry and music.

Starting off with a composition by 15th century poet-saint Arunagirinathar’s Nada Bindu Kaladi Namo Namaha, a song in praise of Lord Muruga, and segueing into Ave Maria and a poem on Allah, both by poet and freedom fighter Subramanya Bharathi, Srinivasan and Gurucharan set the context for their session.

With an intent to present music that was universal in its spirit and appeal, the session reiterated the pursuit and possibility of multiple truths. “There’s your truth, and then there’s mine,” said Srinivasan reinforcing music and its potential to enable and nurture multiple, meaningful and truths that are manifold.

Against the backdrop of the polarised world of today, Srinivasan made a statement about how as musicians, they [referring to himself and to Gurucharan] were neither left nor right. “We walk the middle ground because music is after all about compassion and if there is any side that requires for us to be on it, the best way to do it would be by expanding our empathic universe.”

The two, who have collaborated for over a decade now and constantly created music that marries the classical and the contemporary in a way that the overall experience is genre-bending, laced their session with interesting pieces of music that helped demonstrate the very idea of the middle ground.

Srinivasan spoke about the very magnanimous nature of music and how, in a sense, it doesn’t belong to any one place, region or community that can, therefore, claim ownership of it.

They demonstrated this idea of inspiration, layering and universality with Srinivasan playing a little verse of the national anthem of the United Kingdom, God Save the Queen.

Gurucharan went on to present how that melody manifested itself in a composition called Santhatham Paahimam by Muthuswamy Dikshitar, one of the Trinity in the Carnatic music repertoire, way back in the early 19th century.

“Thank god we didn’t have Twitter then,” said Mr. Srinivasan drawing attention to how audiences today had perhaps lost the ability to enjoy the music purely for its beauty and sentiment.

Making references to the music of the blues, jazz and its relevance, the journey of Tamil Isai, and Frederic Chopin and traversing through them all, with ease and conviction, Mr. Srinivasan and Mr. Gurucharan demonstrated the premise and philosophy of music, at large.

“We are, after all,” said Mr. Srinivasan, “just one community and we need to allow music to speak to ourselves and to others.”",the huddle,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/the-huddle-2020-the-delicate-strings-of-musical-thought/article30891015.ece
390,2020/02/22,"The Huddle 2020 | Govt. should resume talks with Pakistan, says M.K. Narayanan","The Former former National Security Advisor also urged the govt. to open dialogue with political leadership in J&K

India needs to reopen a dialogue with Pakistan, former National Security Advisor M.K. Narayanan said on Saturday while also advocating the resumption of political engagement by the Modi government with leaders in Jammu and Kashmir.

Speaking at The Hindu’s thought conclave The Huddle in Bengaluru, Mr. Narayanan said the government is “running out of time diplomatically” to explain its actions on the decision to amend Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, as well as the communication shutdown and mass detentions that have followed.

“The truth is, despite all the misgivings on the subject of Pakistan and its support to terror, we did see a relatively more peaceful time in Kashmir when there were talks in the period between 2003-2008,” said Mr. Narayanan, a former police officer and chief of the Intelligence Bureau who was known to take a hard line during his tenure as NSA under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh from 2005-2010.

“I am known as a hawk, and I am not in favour of Pakistan, but I believe we must move towards a dialogue with Pakistan,” he added.

Mr. Narayanan was speaking as part of a panel moderated by The Hindu’s Resident Editor, Delhi, Amit Baruah, which included Ashoka University Professor Srinath Raghavan and Assistant Professor at the University of Kashmir Mohammad Ibrahim Wani, that discussed the Article 370 decision and the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, entitled “The Kashmir Gambit: Can it pay off?”

According to Mr. Raghavan, the government’s decision was spurred by a desire to change the entire political dispensation in the erstwhile State as had been done by former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru when he dismissed the State government and imprisoned Sheikh Abdullah for a decade in 1953, as well as by subsequent Central governments that installed alternate chief ministers over the past 70 years.

“However, it is important to remember that Indira Gandhi had also acknowledged the error in those actions when she worked towards an accord with Sheikh Abdullah in 1975. It remains to be seen how the present situation in Jammu and Kashmir will be judged in the future,” he said.

Mr. Wani said the difference in the 2019 Kashmir decision was that there is no alternate leadership in place when the government decided to detain former Chief Ministers Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti and other leaders. The government has explained its decision as necessary for law and order in the Union Terriotory, and filed charges under the Public Safety Act against the leaders.

Acknowledging that there was widespread support in the rest of India for the government’s decision, Mr. Narayanan said there is a divide in the country between those who think the government’s decision was unwarranted, and those who support it as overdue.

“This section believes that the root cause of Kashmir issue is an excess of freedom of choice. India is not united in looking at what happened in Jammu and Kashmir,” he said, adding that the continuing detentions and the strictures on communication were leading to misgivings about the situation there.

When asked about whether economic development of Jammu and Kashmir might be accelerated now, given the government’s plans for “investor’s summits” to attract industry to set up there, the panellists felt that it was too early to predict a positive outcome.

According to Mr. Raghavan, people in Jammu are worried about losing land and jobs to “outsiders” and have now demanded a special “domicile law” to restrict ownership of property and government jobs to residents. Mr. Wani felt that investors would not feel “comfortable” at present to invest in the Kashmir valley unless restrictions are lifted. Mr. Narayanan also said it would be a “mistake” to believe that economic development alone would reduce levels of violence, and stressed that a process of “political engagement” was necessary first.",the huddle,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/ql3jpd/article30890950.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THEX-NSA,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/the-huddle-2020-govt-should-resume-talks-with-pakistan-says-mk-narayanan/article30890951.ece
391,2020/02/22,"The Huddle 2020 | CAA is creating two pathways of citizenship based on religion, says Yamini Aiyar","Act is reopening a debate long settled by the Constitution, says expert

The Citizenship (Amendment) Act fundamentally upends the Indian Constitution by creating two very distinct pathways of citizenship on the basis of religion, according to President of the Centre for Policy Research Yamini Aiyar.

The Act fast-tracks citizenship for illegal migrants of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian communities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who have come to India until December 31, 2014.

By “introducing a religion test into our definition of citizenship and what it means to be an Indian”, the Act is now “reopening in a fundamental way” a debate that was long settled by the Constitution, said Ms. Aiyar on Saturday, speaking at a session on the CAA at The Huddle, the annual thought conclave of The Hindu.

Mirroring the on-going, heated national debate about the CAA, the session brought into sharp relief differing views not only about the Act, but about fundamental constitutional principles. Ms. Aiyar, Bharatiya Janata Party Member of Parliament Rajeev Chandrasekhar, and Congress Member of Parliament and national spokesperson Manish Tewari were in conversation with Mukund Padmanabhan, curator of The Huddle and former Editor, The Hindu.

Mr. Chandrasekhar said while the Act would fast-track citizenship for a group of people who have been refugees in India for several years post-Partition, it was incorrect to suggest that the Act “prohibits any other class of foreigner to apply for and get citizenship”.

The BJP and Congress MPs sparred over who was to blame for the current national divide over the issue. Mr. Tewari said the government’s intent was to blame, and pointed out that there was no need in the first place to pass a new Act, as the existing architecture already allowed it to give citizenship to any persecuted minority. The Act not only violated Article 14 of the Constitution that provides for equality before the law, but also went against several of India’s international obligations on non-refoulement.

Mr. Chandrasekhar countered that the CAA was itself “non-controversial” and only because it had been hyphenated with the National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) that concerns arose. “The narrative that it is discriminatory to a group of people or that somehow we have shut the door on them for citizenship is plain and simply factually wrong. Nothing in the Act prevents refugees from Bangladesh or elsewhere from applying for citizenship.”

He acknowledged there were legitimate concerns over how the NRC had been implemented in Assam, but added it was wrong to suggest the government wanted to implement a similar process elsewhere. “When you have 19 lakh people left out of 3.3 crore in Assam, it is problematic. No government will go into an NRC process that is so heavily exclusionary,” he said, adding that lessons needed to be learnt from a “failed and disruptive” process in Assam that, he noted, was a court-monitored and court-mandated exercise.

Ms. Aiyar said the problem arose precisely because the CAA created a different channel for citizenship on the basis of religion, particularly against the backdrop of the NPR-NRC.

“When the CAA gets twinned with other administrative processes, it essentially creates paths of statehood for one religion and paths of statelessness for others. Decoupling CAA, NPR and NRC is problematic because the two are quite linked. The CAA creates the legislative framework using which what emerges out of the NPR-NRC process will potentially create protections for some communities, and question the citizenship of others.”

Political sparring aside, Ms. Aiyar told her fellow speakers that one heartening outcome they both should agree on was the large-scale political awakening of university students.

“They are making the Constitution a live document and using it as a starting point to engage in public consciousness,” she said of the on-going movement. “No matter what your party or position, that infuses hope for the future of India.”",the huddle,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/tu3g5p/article30890381.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/YaminiAiyar,https://www.thehindu.com/the-huddle/the-huddle-2020-caa-is-creating-two-pathways-of-citizenship-based-on-religion-says-yamini-aiyar/article30890382.ece
392,2020/02/22,The Huddle 2020 | Farming should be ecologically and economically sustainable: Bhupesh Baghel,"We have improved the purchasing power of the rural community by reducing their economic burden and substantially raising their incomes, says the Chhattisgarh chief minister.

People would stick to farming as long as they get remunerative prices for their produce and governance initiatives in Chhattisgarh over the previous year have proved this beyond all doubts, Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel said on Saturday. Mr. Baghel speaking at The Huddle, on the topic ‘Bettering Rural India: Challenges in the time of climate change’. The session was moderated by Nistula Hebbar, Political Editor of The Hindu.

Listing the series of measures that significantly raised the income for farmers in the State, Mr. Baghel said due to the resultant buoyancy in rural sector, there was an overall uptick in Chhattisgarh’s economy. “We have improved the purchasing power of the rural community by reducing their economic burden and substantially raising their incomes. While the country as a whole is witnessing a slowdown in the automobile sector, Chhattisgarh has seen the sector growing by 36%. Similar is the case with real estate, which has appreciated by 150%. GST and demonetisation had sucked out the purchasing power of rural population but we put money back in the hands of farmers by higher prices and more savings for them,” Mr. Baghel said.

Pointing out that the State has 44% forest cover and the attempt is to develop a balance between industry and agriculture, the chief minister said Chhattisgarh has become the first State to return the land acquired for industry but remained unused for five years, back to the farmers.

“We returned the land in one case, as per the provisions of the land acquisition Act. We need cement, steel, and coal. To do this we need proper rehabilitation and compensation for affected people,” Mr. Baghel said.

‘Youth don’t prefer agriculture because of lacklusture remuneration’

Responding to a question on why young people did not want to become farmers, Mr. Baghel said it was clearly a function of the remuneration. “Youths don’t want to go to farming because it does not give them fair compensation for their effort. Wasting the productivity of the youth is harmful for the entire country. Their productivity needs to be used. When we ensured fair and remunerative prices, in Chhattisgarh, we saw the number of farmers going up by 2.5 lakh.”

Linking remunerative pricing for produce to environment-friendly outcomes, the chief minister said he has been lobbying with the Union government for converting a portion of the grain stocks to biofuels. Mr. Baghel also claimed the Centre was trying to stop him from paying bonuses to farmers. “This is not the first time that States and Centre are ruled by different parties, but this government has been disrespectful of our federal spirit. ₹23,000 crore due to us under the GST regime has not been given to us for several months now.”

Keeping farming and animal husbandry sustainable economically and environmentally was the focus of his government, Mr. Baghel said. Paraphrasing writer Harishankar Parsai's words, Mr. Baghel in a lighter vein said: ""All over the world cows are meant to produce milk and in our country they stand also for votes.""

He said government schemes were in place for recharging ground water and reviving rivulets across the State.

The CM said after he took over, earlier categories of beneficiaries for the Public Distribution System was done away with. “Our PDS is now universal.”

Turning the discussion to Congress politics, Mr Baghel said his was the only party that confronted the BJP and its current leadership on questions of ideology and governance. “People are generally very reluctant to speak up these days. Yes, The Hindu is one platform that is not afraid of speaking up. Police violence happened in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi in the recent times.

393,2020/02/22,"‘Truth cannot be eclipsed by blinkers of prejudices,’ says President Ram Nath Kovind at The Hindu’s Huddle","He pays glowing tributes to The Hindu for “relentlessly aiming to capture the essence of this great country”

“Truth exists in absolute form which cannot be eclipsed by blinkers of prejudices. It cannot be a case of ‘your truth’ versus ‘my truth’. Truth has to be one,” President Ram Nath Kovind said on Saturday, while inaugurating the fourth edition of The Huddle organised by The Hindu group of publications.

Paying glowing tributes to The Hindu for “relentlessly aiming to capture the essence of this great country”, Mr. Kovind pointed out that sometimes dogmas and personal prejudices distorted the truth.

“In the 150th year of Gandhiji’s birth, let us ponder this question: Will it not be proper to pursue truth itself as the ideology. Gandhiji has shown us the path by walking ceaselessly in search of truth…” the President told a packed house at The Huddle.

Today, however, Mr. Kovind pointed out that the world seemed to be living in the post-truth era. “I wonder what Gandhiji would have said about it. Of late, there have been attempts to give various shades to truth and define its stages as if some truth exists beyond provisional truths.”

The President pointed out that debate and discussion were internalised in India’s social psyche since time immemorial. “They are means to an end. On a lighter side, I am talking about an era that preceded high-voltage TV debates!”

“Even in this period of transition, The Hindu continues with its tradition of conducting informed debate through news and views. It would not be an exaggeration to say that The Hindu seeks to protect the sanctity of the printed word and holds fast to the ideology of the truth,” the President stated.

Pointing out that the perception of truth was conditioned by circumstances, Mr. Kovind pointed out: “Through arduous research, we came to know it well that neither does the sun rise nor does it set. The conditions that cloud the truth’s positions are effectively dispelled by a contestation of ideas through debate, discussion and scientific temper. Prejudices and violence vitiate the search for truth.”

According to Mr. Kovind, the world was “above all” being shaped by information technology. “These trends have impacted journalism in all its aspects, from news gathering to delivering news to readers and finally making money to sustain the activity.”

“The internet and social media have democratised journalism and revitalised democracy. This process is ongoing, but in its current stage, it has also led to many anxieties. The new media is fast and popular and people can choose what they want to watch, hear or read. But only the traditional media has, over years, developed skills to authenticate a news report, and that is a costly operation. I hope that we will arrive at the ideal trade-off soon,” the President stated.

“In the meanwhile, the traditional media will have to introspect on its role in society and find ways to earn the reader’s full trust again. The project of democracy is incomplete without informed citizens – which means, without unbiased journalism,” Mr. Kovind stressed.

The President said that those at the helm of The Hindu began their journey with a “huddle”, 142 years ago, for a cause. “That thinking must also be behind naming the event ‘The Huddle’ that covers a wide array of topics ranging from politics, economics, the environment and entertainment to gender and sports.”

“At this conclave, speakers are invited to come together and form a huddle to deliberate and review the strategy for the benefit of society and the country.

394,2020/02/22,President Ram Nath Kovind's inaugural address at The Huddle 2020,"President says The Huddle is a platform for the churning of thought on a variety of issues that concern people

President Ram Nath Kovind inaugurated the fourth edition of The Huddle, The Hindu’s annual thought conclave, at the ITC Gardenia in Bengaluru on Saturday. The keynote address will be delivered by the former Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, Ranil Wickremesinghe.

The two-day event will feature 15 sessions and 32 speakers, showcasing some of the best minds from the world of politics, business, academics, sports, entertainment and the arts. The sessions are designed to be interactive, and they take place before an invited audience.

Here is the full text of his inaugural speech.

I am happy to be here to attend ‘The Huddle’ organised by The Hindu, a name that connotes not only India’s cultural diversity but also covers a sweep of history which is unparalleled in the world in civilisational context.

The Hindu group of publications has been relentlessly aiming to capture the essence of this great country through its responsible and ethical journalism. I commend them for their insistence on sticking to the five basic principles of journalism – truth-telling, freedom and independence, justice, humaneness and contributing to the social good. I am borrowing here Shri N. Ram’s wonderful description of these principles as ‘Panchsheel’ for The Hindu group of newspapers.

Churning of thought

You all deserve appreciation for organising ‘The Huddle’ as a platform for the churning of thought on a variety of issues that concern people. I am sure that the nectar, that is, Amrit, coming out from the churning would benefit the nation and the world.

Let me tell you why it is civilisationally contextual to hold ‘The Huddle’ in this land. Long before the West discovered the benefits of democratic decision-making, Sant Basaveshwara, a 12th century philosopher endowed with extraordinary wisdom, had promoted a culture of collective discussion which was called ‘Anubhav Mantapa’. This is remembered as one of the world’s first parliaments where people were encouraged to speak their mind irrespective of their social status. This was also a unique experiment of gender equality as women were also encouraged to take part in discussions and express their views. We, the people of India are blessed to have sages like Bhagwan Basaveshwara among our ancestors.

Debate and discussion are internalised in India’s social psyche to arrive at truth since time immemorial. They are means to an end. On a lighter side, I am talking about an era that preceded high-voltage TV debates! Even in this period of transition, The Hindu continues with its tradition of conducting informed debate through news and views. It would not be an exaggeration to say that The Hindu seeks to protect the sanctity of the printed word and holds fast to the ideology of truth.

There is no doubt that perception of truth is conditioned by circumstances. For example, we tend to describe the day’s progress with the rising or setting of the sun. But we know that it is more of a popular and metaphorical expression than the truth. Through arduous research, we came to know it well that neither does the sun rise nor does it set. The conditions that cloud the truth’s positions are effectively dispelled by a contestation of ideas through debate, discussion and scientific temper. Prejudices and violence vitiate the search for truth.

Ladies and gentlemen,

As one of the oldest newspapers in the subcontinent, The Hindu has contributed immensely to the nation-building. Fired by a nationalist impulse, six intrepid youth of Madras, barely out of their teens, founded The Hindu in 1878 to redeem our cultural pride. They challenged the imperial power at its peak and nourished nationalism. Since then, the story of The Hindu’s journey is quite instructive for those who wish to understand the spirit of India that is Bharat. Readers too responded enthusiastically. For many in Chennai and elsewhere, the morning came to mean a cup of filter coffee and a copy of The Hindu.

One of this newspaper’s avid readers was the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, himself. When The Hindu celebrated its golden jubilee in 1928, Gandhiji wrote, [And I quote] “I gladly add mine to the many tributes that will be paid to The Hindu on its Golden Jubilee. I consider The Hindu to be one of the best, if not the best, among the Indian owned dailies throughout India.” [Unquote]

Gandhiji’s insistence on truth, that is, Satyagraha, was based on his unique understanding of truth. Gandhiji, as we all know, was a journalist too and edited a range of journals, in several languages, in South Africa as well as in India. His journalism was, journalism with a cause. Yet, he was deeply aware of the cause of journalism itself too, which is simply truth itself. That is why he cautioned against the superficiality, the one-sidedness, the inaccuracy and often even dishonesty that had crept into journalism. As he evolved from Mohandas to Mahatma, Truth – with a capital T – became his sole cause, sole quest.

Sometimes, dogmas and personal prejudices distort the truth. In the 150th year of Gandhiji’s birth, let us ponder upon this question: Will it not be proper to pursue truth itself as the ideology? Gandhiji has shown us the path by walking ceaselessly in search of truth which would ultimately encompass every positive attribute that enriches the universe.

Today, however, we seem to be living in what has come to be called the post-truth era. I wonder what Gandhiji would have said about it. Of late, there have been attempts to give various shades to truth and define its stages as if some final truth exists beyond provisional truths. To my mind, such attempts are nothing more than indulgence in semantics. Truth exists in absolute form which cannot be eclipsed by blinkers of prejudices. It cannot be a case of ‘your truth’ versus ‘my truth’. Truth has to be one.

I am sure that society has been moving in this direction to discover truth through persistent dialogue, argumentation and scientific approach. Let me cite one instance of how society has been transforming itself. Two weeks back, I visited the Kendriya Vidyalaya located in the Rashtrapati Bhavan premises for an interaction with students. I faced a volley of questions about fundamental duties, and many schoolchildren asked if those duties should not be made mandatory for citizens. I was quite surprised when a girl student of class 11 asked if it would be correct to make it legally binding upon citizens to pay their genuine taxes, exercise their franchise, follow rules and respect constitutional entities. Such questions, asked without any prompt, are indicative of the new generation’s yearning for arriving at truth through their own experience.

Ladies and gentlemen,

The world is now being shaped above all by information technology. It is so rapidly evolving that what was outright unimaginable only a few years ago has not only become a reality but has even lost its novelty! These trends have impacted journalism in all its aspects, from news gathering to delivering news to readers and finally making money to sustain the activity.

Journalism democratised

The Internet and social media have democratized journalism and revitalized democracy. This process is ongoing, but in its current stage, it has also led to many anxieties. The new media is fast and popular and people can choose what they want to watch, hear or read. But only the traditional media has, over years, developed skills to authenticate a news report, and that is a costly operation. I hope that we will arrive at the ideal trade-off soon. In the meanwhile, the traditional media will have to introspect on its role in society and find ways to earn the reader’s full trust again. The project of democracy is incomplete without informed citizens – which means, without unbiased journalism.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Those at the helm of The Hindu know that their journey began with a huddle, 142 years back, for a cause. That thinking must also be behind naming the event as ‘The Huddle’ that covers a wide array of topics ranging from politics, economics, the environment and entertainment to gender and sports. At this conclave, speakers are invited to come together and form a huddle to deliberate and review the strategy for the benefit of society and the country. Implicit in this effort is welfare of the entire cosmos consistent with the philosophy of “Sarve bhavantu sukhinah”. I once again commend The Hindu group of publication for organising this conference that lays out a roadmap for posterity.

I wish my best to all of you. Thank you.

396,2020/02/22,Three Indians in a London bar: Review of Dawood Ali McCallum’s ‘Mrs A’s Indian Gentlemen’,"A remarkable novel with its subtle balancing of humour and gravitas

The year is 1943. The Great Western Railway in Swindon has just hired the services of three Indians for special covert operations. The Indians include railwaymen Vincent Rosario, Imtiaz ‘Billy’ Khan, and mathematician Akaash Ray. Their work is imperative to push the war effort in Britain and to free Europe of the scourge of Nazism. While the three debate who’s the most English of them all, their fates are intertwined through a series of extraordinary events including romantic entanglements, espionage, murder, and a broken-down toilet.

McCallum’s finest hour is his characters; he creates simmering tension and passive aggression simply by layering them with opposing cultural and political values. His study of people pays off in the fine details he flourishes them with. The competitiveness of Indians is captured in the heated exchange between Akaash and Vincent about Akaash’s Ph.D. and Vincent’s derisive remark about Akaash not being a real doctor. One of the longest-running gags in the novel is the ironic representation of culture, say, in the way Akaash slurps his tea or Billy’s dress uniform.

This same attention to detail is evident in the descriptions of locomotive engines, local flora and fauna. One forgets that the past is a different place; McCallum evokes it with such completeness.

The trope of using cultural differences to elicit laughter is often laden with stale clichés such as accent jokes, unintentional double entendres and clumsy gaffes related to cultural ritual. This is where McCallum’s treatment shines. He turns a simple domestic meal into an occasion for hilarity through the divvying up of pork chops and chicken soup among a by-choice-protesting-vegetarian Akaash, a devout Billy, and an opportunistic Vincent.

Mrs. A’s Indian Gentlemen is a remarkable novel for how McCallum manages a subtle balancing act between humour and gravitas by portraying a working class that tries to make the best of what it has. McCallum reminds us of the truth that despite cultural differences, what binds us is kindness, and that, surprisingly, people are capable of it.

397,2020/02/22,Too much of a good thing: Review of Usha K.R.’s ‘Boys from Good Families’,"Usha K.R.’s usual attention to detail is a bit too much for this novel

Readers familiar with the works of Usha K.R. will be aware of the large canvas she works on. Her eye for detail, her ability to capture every distinct sight and sound of a setting is her trademark. If that is what you expect in this novel as well, you won’t be disappointed. Too much of a good thing, however, robs this story of its impact.

This is the story of a young man, Ashwath, who leaves his family to find himself. No, no. This is the story of a brother and sister whose lives get trapped within ideas of location and freedom. No, again. This is the story of a house called Neel Kamal and how it records the passage of history. Maybe, no.

This is a love story — of a young rebel from a well-to-do household and a poor young girl who lives in the outhouse. Or perhaps, it is the story of reversals of fortune — a domestic help’s son makes it big in the U.S., the girl from the outhouse becomes a rich and successful spiritual healer while the family that employs them both struggles at material, emotional and personal levels. A large novel can deal with multiple stories but this novel distracts you from choosing a direction. The title of the novel is no great help either.

There are many insightful passages like this one, which represents a typically successful Indian diaspora in the U.S. seen from the point of view of one who fails to succeed: “They all reminded him of characters out of The Truman Show — the men with their cars and golf and professional ease, their razor sharp superwives, the couple who wanted to do South America one country at a time, their children’s success and their unbearable energy.”

And there is the poignancy of poetry too: “When he had left the frozen waters of Lake Michigan in January, there was a splinter of ice embedded in his heart. He had been watchful not to pull it out because then he would have to deal with the haemorrhaging.”

The pointless Rushdie-like foregrounding of history, the meanderings into needless details, and the self-indulgent verbosity erode an otherwise refined narrative experience.

398,2020/02/22,Classics in the attic: Forgotten works have a habit of resurfacing unexpectedly,"There’s a peculiar delight when long forgotten or long ignored books are discovered and resurrected

Forgotten works have a habit of resurfacing most unexpectedly, in the most unexpected places. You may find one while sifting through the pickings of the local raddiwallah and lo, your life changes. Earlier this month, a novel from the early 1930s was published for the first time, marking a rare and momentous event.

The novel, Romance in Marseille, is by Claude McKay (1889-1948), a leading figure of the Harlem Renaissance. Given that the book revolves round queerness, slavery and explores the possibility of the creation of a post-colonial African identity, McKay’s agent felt that it would be too shocking for readers of the time. For McKay, a writer of Jamaican origin who was bisexual and a Marxist, that was reason enough to shelve the novel.

Scholars had been aware for some time that two manuscripts of Romance in Marseille were held by Harlem’s Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and Yale’s Beinecke Library. But copyright issues and a perceived lack of market interest prevented the book from being published. Until now.

Incidentally, this is the second of McKay’s works to resurface. Amiable with Big Teeth, a 1941 work that remained unknown until a scholar found the typescript in an archive a decade ago, is another. This was published in 2017.

Mere mischance?

In 2019, a British publisher reissued a long-forgotten work, What Not, by Rose Macaulay. Originally published in 1918, the novel sketches a dystopian future where the government ranks people by intelligence, insists on ‘mind-training’ for all its citizens, and maintains strict control on childbirth. Clearly, the space that Brave New Worldand 1984 later came to own had already been explored to chilling effect by Macaulay. Why had the novel been neglected for so long? Did Rose’s gender have anything to do with it? Or was it mere mischance?

Like the publication of Harper Lee’s Go Set a Watchman in 2015, readers are awaiting unpublished stuff from the estate of the reclusive J.D. Salinger.

Look again

But anyone talking of discoveries and rediscoveries of lost literary classics must necessarily remember U.V. Swaminatha Iyer (‘Tamil Thatha’). Born in 1855, Iyer was a Tamil scholar who studied under the formidable Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai and was later employed in the Government Arts College at Kumbakonam as a Tamil teacher. On October 21, 1880, a day “etched in red letters” (as Iyer was to describe it in En Sarithiram, his autobiography), he met Ramaswami Mudaliar, a District Munsiff recently posted to Kumbakonam.

A Tamil scholar himself, Mudaliar asked Iyer where and what he had studied. As Iyer rattled off the ancient Tamil texts that he had spent years mastering, Mudaliar remained unimpressed. He then asked if Iyer had read the Jeevaka Chintamani or Silappadikaram. A.K. Ramanujan writes in his essay, ‘Language and Social Change’, that Iyer was aghast that “he had not even heard of them”. Mudaliar handed him the palm-leaf manuscripts of Jeevaka Chintamani.

Iyer went on to transcribe Jeevaka Chintamani, a Buddhist work, on paper and published the epic with notes and commentaries in 1887. It was an instant success.

The success of Jeevaka Chintamani motivated Iyer to search for the original texts of other ancient literary works, a search that lasted till his death. He visited hundreds of villages to obtain palm-leaf manuscripts. He rediscovered Purananooru (from the Sangam era) and Manimekalai (an offshoot of Silappadikaramfeaturing some of the same characters). He had these twin epics of ancient Tamil literature republished. In a span of about five decades, Iyer published close to 100 books — all of them long-forgotten Tamil works.

In 2005, Arun Kolatkar’s Jejuri — one of the classics of Indian English poetry and for many years available only in small numbers from one publisher — was issued internationally for the first time, to great acclaim.

Similarly, in the early 90s, G.V. Desani’s All About H. Hatterr came up for air after decades of neglect and non-availability.

Are there other masterpieces that deserve a second look? A lost/ forgotten novel by Raja Rao, perhaps? Set off to your nearest library or raddiwallah — who knows what treasures lurk there.

399,2020/02/22,What the swirling clouds said: A unique blend of myth and memory gives literature from the Northeast its distinct flavour,"It would seem that many shamans are beginning to sing the Northeast into existence for the rest of us who are seeking its myriad identities

Once I imagined a dusty library and a woman sitting alone, caught in a beam of light, thinking: ‘Among all these books on these shelves there is not one that mentions this place where I come every day to unlock the cupboards and look at the big atlas of the world.’ Of course I was thinking of the old library in my hometown, near the airfield, and the woman was another me, scrutinising oceans and coastlines and fiddling with notebooks.

The image became a secret map for ‘A Diary of the World’, which is a poem, a chapter title of The Legends of Pensam, the recurring theme of a novella. Now that small building is overshadowed by a new stadium and the woman has vanished. Or maybe she is around but in another guise — who can tell? Ask an author about their writing and most likely the question will curve and swerve in their mind with myriad answers. It is like diving into a deep pond, trying to catch the ripples expanding from shore to shore. How did we even begin to write?

The hidden place

Today there is talk about ‘mappings’. Nothing like the contours of a world I once imagined. This is about cultural mappings, with conferences on margins and borders and emerging literatures. A publishing boom in the last decade has brought into focus literatures from the Northeast. This has happened along with the growth of media, literary forums and festivals to strengthen public understanding of the region’s art, culture and the social transformations taking place there. Post-publication territory is like a minefield. What voice, genre, gender, to find a place in literary canon. How and why does one write, and what do we write about?

One is stumped for answers.

In the small library of my imagination there was no thought of ‘meaning’ or motivation to convey specificity like a territory — ‘the Northeast,’ — the Adi tribe, although all the time the land was the other character stealthily exerting its presence to set the context of time, place, remembrance, and the type of stories. The land is a definite physical presence, but above and beyond this I believe every writer creates their own space that is quite simply the hidden place, conjured up by some strange magic where thought and feeling can roam freely in the indescribable freedom of writing.

The story leads us and we follow, sometimes happy, sometimes resisting, struggling, blank, and wondering. Who would ever know how a story slips out of our hands. We are never in complete control. Like a piece of music, all our remembrances, the chance encounters, that things that happened to us and the way we responded, or did not, float in and out of memory like breath and life to make up a kaleidoscope of you, me, them, us, the way we were, or the way we hope to become. Words only try to catch a tune. Perhaps this is all that writing is about — transformation. Our lives altered by our desire.

Nurturing stories

Imagine a shaman singing an epic poem for five days and five nights. This is a performance art of the oral tradition where a man can sing a world into existence. It is the world of myth and legend, but I heard someone say something that changed my ideas or at least posed a new question about my understanding of myths and legends. It was at a wake and we said the other rituals would be done in the morning since we couldn’t cut wood at night. Everyone agreed. ‘Of all the trees and plants the only one that offers itself for use at any time, day or night, is the bamboo,’ they said.

I was wonderstruck. In the indescribable atmosphere of mourning all my relatives were carrying on with the business of performing obligations, and the source of these obligations was our stories. Here was consolation. The stories nurture us: suddenly I was moving through the land again, aware of new textures and vibrations.

Perhaps we can say that since time began, the first travellers were words — spoken, written, and communicated in totems and hieroglyphs. Perhaps a great ancestor stood watching the movement of clouds. His thoughts travelled through time and words were released to the sky, to the mountains, along desert dunes and sea waves to convey such feelings of wonder, love and awe and longing in song, then inscribed on rocks, painted symbols slowly falling on a stone tablet or on a page with the invented tools of ink and paper.

Often literature from the Northeastern states is taken as one indiscrete whole. But the place is heaving with cultural diversity. Historically, it was quite a ‘globalised’ part of the world, carrying on lively cross-border trade with Tibet, China, Burma, Tai-Ahom, the Shan state, and the greater Mekong region. The same is true of the literary scene, which is wide and as varied as the number of ethnic and linguistic communities. Apart from the literature of the script languages of Assam, Manipur and Tripura, a large chunk of the customs of different communities comes to us via the oral tradition.

Myth and memory

This has promoted a literature that mingles recorded history and the oral tradition for an interpretation of the unwritten past in a peculiar blend of myth and memory, and aesthetics unique to the region. Each State has its distinct voice with acclaimed writers writing in different languages and there are as many symbols and images as there are voices. There is blood, fire, water, despair and hope and all that links human fate.

More recently, writings have appeared about the region from across the mountains. I am thinking of Stuart Blackburn’s novel, Into the Hidden Valley, that is a view from the ‘other’ side, of British relations with northeast India. I think this is important. Since we delve into old records left by early explorers, a contemporary book is like a new bridge creating a place of confluence.

And so it will go on. Perhaps everything will change all over again. New voices will call and reshape everything, and why not. There is digital media, e-books, audio books, new storytelling and new publishing to record oral traditions.

Tradition is not set in stone. The past is an amorphous place that we can abandon and revisit. Someone will break in and breathe new life into what is concealed. The journey of words will begin anew, sprout wings, delineate its own features and reach out in elation or silent discourse to enhance our perception and tell us that words have power. Words can stop the clock. Words can foresee the future.

400,2020/02/22,"Literature does not need caste politics; it goes beyond that, says writer Poomani","Tamil writer Poomani, whose ‘Heat’ was recently made into a successful film, is scathing about both the movie and about Dalit politics

Vekkai, translated into English as Heat, was the first novel that the Sahitya Akademi-winning Tamil writer Poomani wrote. The heat that his book generated can be felt even now, 38 years after it was published. It was translated into English by N. Kalyan Raman last year. And a few months ago, it was made into a film, Asuran, directed by Vetrimaaran.

Though the film was successful, Poomani is not too happy with the political colour given to his story. “It is the story of a teenage boy who takes revenge for the murder of his elder brother. His intention was not to

kill, only to chop off the hand of Vadakooran, the antagonist in the novel,” says Poomani, whose works are set in karisal bhoomi or the semi-arid and rain-fed regions of southern Tamil Nadu. Excerpts from an interview:

More than three decades have passed since you wrote the novel. How do you feel about its form and content today?

I am satisfied with the form. The story is told from the perspective of a teenage boy. The narration is based on his exposure to life.

Are you happy with the translation?

While I am happy, I must say that proficiency in two languages alone cannot do justice to a translation. The translator should have an idea of or exposure to the landscape and existential conditions of the people living there. For translating a literary work, that is more important than knowledge of the language.

While the film adaptation has been highly appreciated, you seem to be unhappy. Why?

In the film, Dhanush falls at the feet of every villager. He is also forced to carry chappals. Those are all different stories.

There are no panchami lands (lands reserved for Dalits) in our areas, as shown in the movie.

The film has retained the novel’s larger framework, but developed its own story. My friends advised me to keep quiet, because if I had said anything then, it would have embarrassed the film crew.

I did not want to discourage them at that time. I trusted them.

Can you mention some of the changes made in the movie?

Even the cultural language of the novel has been changed. The book has sharp and short dialogues: those are missing in the film.

Many more characters are murdered in the film. And the film has murdered the novel.

Both the novel and the film are interpreted as a battle between Dalits and landlords. Your comments.

Vekkai is not a Dalit novel. It centres on the agony of a teenage boy and in my book I have not given the boy a caste identity. The idea of a Dalit identity is imported from Maharashtra.

The novel was written and published long before the term came into vogue in Tamil Nadu. The filmmakers have treated Vekkai and Asuran on a par with Kabali and Pariyerum Perumal. Literature does not need caste politics; it goes beyond that.

Then what is the way out for communities seeking to liberate themselves from the clutches of oppressors?

Liberation from what? There was caste even before the time of the Mahabharata. It is intricately woven into the culture of the country. It came from the temple tradition. How do you achieve liberation? By breaking statues? Don’t forget that in some places, the scheduled castes are the oppressors.

401,2020/02/22,Nothing comes out of nothing: Jeet Thayil’s ‘Low’ reviewed by Aditya Sudarshan,"The shadow of loss overhangs the narrative. But instead of a human story what we have here is a charade of humanity

Jeet Thayil’s Low is a difficult work to review. Ordinarily, a book review continues the dialogue which the book itself enters into. A harsh review, no less than a fulsome one, validates the importance of that dialogue, and respects the author’s contribution to it. But when a book, by the manner of its writing, shows itself to be quite indifferent to other interlocutors, and quite uninterested in a meaningful encounter with them, then a reviewer faces a trap.

Neither praise nor rebuke will turn out well; the former will degenerate into empty sighs and grunts of pleasure, the latter into futile lecturing. Instead, the proper task here is to simply delineate the error of the book — that which renders it a nullity. This must be done (naturally) with reference to something without, because the text itself is beholden to nothing.

Low fascination

To illustrate, Low follows the manoeuvres of one Dominic Ullis, an autobiographical writer-character whose much younger wife has died suddenly and unnaturally, precipitating, on Ullis’ part, a flight to Bombay, various desultory conversations, bouts of ill-tempered social commentary, apocalyptic ruminations and the studious consumption of many chemical substances, in the evanescent company of drifters.

All this is indeed overhung by the shadow of loss, but the human story one is tempted to impute to this narrative (that of tragedy driving addiction, with some kind of passion) is not actually present. What Thayil has put on display is the equivalent of the ‘crocodile fighting python’ brand of viral video; a spectacle of low fascination which originates from, and powerfully appeals to, naught but our reptile brain.

Recall that this ‘reptilian brain’ also produces responses to loss and death; it can form plans, and verdicts about others and the world; it can harbour feelings of emotional discomfort; and upon this existential plane, it can even utter expressions of mesmerising felicity. Therefore, it baits our tendency to anthropomorphise and exoticise it, but if we can retain a grasp of the truly human, the deception is really paper-thin; even openly confessing itself, as Dominic Ullis candidly admits: “he was devoted to the image of [Donald Trump].”

Why? Because “everything [Trump] did was a satire of itself, a satire of presidential gravitas, a satire of compassion and grievance, a satire of civility, masculinity and patriotism. This is why the president was a comfort and an inspiration. It was thrilling to know that nothing was true and therefore everything was true... The president was living proof that you could say anything and it didn’t matter. Communication was concealment.”

And moreover: “Ullis understood the need to burn down the house, the country, the planet... he understood this president.” Just such a charade of humanity, with such nihilism underlying it, suffuses Low, as Ullis sends every event and encounter (the death of his wife, as much as the kick of a drug), and even his very self-awareness and self-criticism, down the way of his absolute self-centredness.

Block of narcissism

This pathology, however, in no way follows from his subject matter. According to Thayil, he has sought in his writing “to honour the people I knew in the opium dens, the marginalised, the addicted and deranged, people who are routinely called the lowest of the low.” And it is quite true that misfits, burnt-out folk, selfish and addicted people of whatsoever social strata lose nothing of their humanity, and are fit subjects for the most humanistic literature.

Dostoevsky, perhaps more than any other novelist, has shown us this. But he has also shown us how this is so, and the contrast with Thayil could not be starker. In the light of Dostoevsky’s gaze, we understand addiction as an unhappy derailment of (nonetheless) passionate and upward-reaching energies. Therefore, a man like Alexei (in The Gambler) is able to tremble with his wretched love for roulette and his hopeless love for Polina, teaching us that it takes a human being to be so deceived.

Whereas Ullis trembles to nothing at all, beyond the realm of physiological reactions to this or that powder. “I see nothing. I hear nothing. Most of all I know nothing,” he confesses to a taxi driver. Yet, even this utterance, accurate as it may be, is not truthful, for thereupon: “the ride passed in companionable silence.”

In Low, no racked human being appears before us, but rather a well-mannered reptile, and from the same standpoint, only so many others, who populate the world of Thayil’s imagination.

In all this, encased as it is in a rigid block of narcissism, blowing neither hot nor cold but always lukewarm, Thayil’s writing is perfectly critic-proof. There are, however, endearing chinks of honestly bad writing. Low does attempt to throw some structure of meaning around its unfolding, via the use of a ghostly imaginative device, a ‘climactic’ instance of grief, and a set-piece ending slathered with resonance. These attempts come off hammy, heavy-handed and remarkably stilted. But they are at least ‘signs of life,’ heartening moves towards humanity, whose genuineness is not for me to judge.

The writer is the author, most recently, of The Outraged: Times of Strife.

402,2020/02/22,‘India’s Founding Moment – The Constitution of a Most Surprising Country’ review: How India came to be one,"In replacing the colonial system of governance with a democratic model predicated on a written Constitution, the Indian Republic sought freedom from the shackles of the past

For long, the best analytical account of the Indian Constitution was Granville Austin’s classic The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation. Now Austin’s tome has found a worthy partner, in Madhav Khosla’s aptly titled book, India’s Founding Moment: The Constitution of a Most Surprising Country.

Most scholars in the West, with the exception of Austin and a few others, have been largely sceptical of India’s constitutional experiment. Some of them like Perry Anderson, a professor of history at UCLA, have also either been condescending or derisive or both. In his book, The Indian Ideology, Anderson writes, “The body that created Indian democracy was itself not an expression of it.” He adds that “the constitution to which it gave birth moreover owed the majority of its provisions to the Westminster: some 250 out of its 395 Articles were taken word for word from the Government of India Act passed by the Baldwin cabinet in 1935.”

Break from democracy

Khosla is conscious of this criticism. In a convincing introduction to his book, he writes: “Regardless of the number of words that were taken from the 1935 Act, democratisation signified a major break from the past.” That is a point Anderson misses. By no stretch of imagination can one refer to colonial rule as having anything more than a semblance of democracy. In replacing the colonial system of governance with a democratic model predicated on a written Constitution, the Indian Republic, as Khosla writes, took a leap of faith, through which it sought to break itself free from the shackles of the past.

The methodology at the heart of this leap no doubt brought with it tension between different, and at times competing, lines of vision. Khosla brings out this tension admirably. Indeed, one of the hallmarks of this book is the author’s ability to merge into one coherent whole constitutional theory with the history of India’s political struggle.

Nehru, for example, Khosla writes, while not opposed to the idea of a written Constitution still saw a long document as one that might deny “constitutional elasticity.” “So far as the nature of the Constitution is concerned,” he notably said, “it must deal with fundamental aspects of the political, the social, the economic and other spheres, and not with the details which are matters of legislation.” Ambedkar, on the other hand, was keen to fill the Constitution with details. He accepted that the document’s length and content was atypical, but, to him, given that India was unused to constitutional democracy, the only way to build “constitutional morality” was through maintenance of fidelity to matters of form and procedure. The ease and frequency with which the Indian Constitution has since been amended tells us that Ambedkar’s fears were well founded.

Asymmetrical federalism

Khosla covers plenty more ground. He builds a narrative that shows what went into the founding of the republic, the various choices that the framers ultimately wrote into the Constitution. For instance, he tells us how and why the Indian Constitution came to adopt an asymmetrical model of federalism with a strong centre. On this, the Nehruvian conviction that a strong centralised state was necessary to hold India together came through. Nehru feared that fissiparous tendencies would balkanise the country. The text of India’s Constitution reflects this belief.

He also discusses in some depth how the framers’ quest to bring about parity between popular rule and substantive justice resulted in the drafting of a set of ‘Directive Principles of State Policy.’

These principles are non-justiciable but they have still come to occupy an important space. What Khosla doesn’t tell us though is how these principles have since proved controversial. In some instances, their inclusion has given a handle to extremist Hindu sentiments, as we have seen with the rise of ‘cow vigilantism’ while in other instances they have led, for example, to the hasty rollout of a flawed Panchayati Raj system that has worked well only in a few States.

What is more, some of the provisions that ought to have been made inalienable nonetheless found themselves in the Directive Principles for many decades, such as the one directing the state to provide free and compulsory education for all children until 14.

But this is a mere quibble. India’s Constitution is a revolutionary document. It seeks to transform our society, and our polity. It serves as a marker between colonialism and self-governance. Coming as it does on the 70th anniversary of the republic, Khosla’s book will remind readers for years to come of the truly radical vision that the Constitution enshrines.

403,2020/02/22,‘Karl Marx – Philosophy and Revolution’ review: Reading Karl Marx in the 21st century,"A historian introduces the German philosopher and his critical thinking for the times, warts and all

Reading Karl Marx amid political uncertainty and rise of populism could be a challenging exercise. However, no one could have done a better job than Shlomo Avineri in resuscitating Marx in a non-Marxian period, where students in humanities have rarely heard of The First International and Das Kapital.

Professor emeritus of Political Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Avineri dedicated more than half a century in reading, teaching and writing on Marx and Hegel. In his most recent book, Karl Marx: Philosophy and Revolution, published in Yale’s ‘Jewish Lives’ series, Avineri, once again introduces us to Marx the philosopher, economist, journalist and revolutionary, while “liberating the real-life Marx from the canonization in which his thought has been wrapped.”

Two in one

Avineri’s book is really two books in one. The first is the author’s account, as a historian of ideas, of the development of Marx’s critical thought in relation to his Jewish background and the influence of Hegelian philosophy.

The second is about Marx’s struggles and difficulties as a revolutionary, a friend, a husband and a father. In less than 200 pages, he captures the essence of Marx’s relation with his Jewish identity and presents him “in the actual historical contexts, intellectual and political, in which he lived and acted.”

Avineri portrays Marx as a Jewish thinker who is far from being involved with the idea of Zionism, but writes his notorious essay ‘On The Jewish Question’ (ZurJudenfrage), associating Judaism with the worship of money in a typical anti-Semitic trope, while on the other hand arguing for equal rights for Jews. As Avineri shows us in his interesting research, there is a degree of awareness in Marx of his Jewish background, which doesn’t make of him a Jewish thinker.

The book captures the range of Marx’s work, from his early writings as a critique of Hegel’s philosophy to the publication of The Communist Manifesto in 1848 with Friedrich Engels and finally the publication of the first volume of Das Kapital in 1867.

Avineri portrays Marx as a man of complexities, with a great intellectual ability to listen, to learn and to lead, but also with a venomous tongue against his opponents.

That is to say, “The singularity of Marx’s intellectual brilliance and learning also carried a hidden curse that accompanied him for most of his life: because he was so intellectually superior to many of his colleagues in the socialist movement, he could not stop himself from pointing out the inconsistencies in their writings, their occasional muddled thoughts, and sometimes their sheer ignorance.”

Impartial study

The impartial study is very successful in engaging with Marx’s intellectual timeline and to do justice both to the thinker and his writings.

In doing so, Avineri follows in his book the path of another historian of ideas, Isaiah Berlin, who in his book Karl Marx, written in 1939 and considered today as a classic of the genre, wrote the following: “No thinker in the nineteenth century has had so direct, deliberate and powerful an influence upon mankind as Karl Marx. Yet Marx could not, at any time, be called a popular figure in the ordinary sense: certainly he was in no sense a popular writer or orator.”

In the same line of thought, Avineri’s conclusions on Marx are not very different from those of Isaiah Berlin. He agrees with him on the worldly impact of Marx in the first half of the 20th century.

However, he adds that “such a fascination with radical social revolution is no longer a central factor in the political life of western societies.”

It is true that tributes to Marx are quite rare in today’s world, and maybe this is another reason to list this book among the very best studies on Marx in the past two decades.

404,2020/02/22,‘The ISIS Peril – The World’s Most Feared Terror Group and its Shadow on South Asia’ review: The long reach of ISIS,"What are the ideological underpinnings of the jihadist movement in South Asia?

Why did Kerala, one of India’s most advanced States, with high literacy levels, have the most number affected by the Islamic State (ISIS or IS) outreach in India? “The answers are in fact rooted in migration, economics and religion,” writes Kabir Taneja in his book, The ISIS Peril: The World’s Most Feared Terror Group and its Shadow on South Asia. Taneja, a fellow with the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi, tells the IS story from a South Asian perspective, bridging a vital knowledge gap in the rise and fall of the ‘Caliphate’.

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the IS, announced the establishment of the Caliphate from Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, in July 2014. By that time the group had captured huge swathes of territories in Iraq and Syria. At its peak, the reign of Baghdadi’s Caliphate stretched from Der Ezzour in eastern Syria to the outskirts of Baghdad, the Iraqi capital. The declared aim of the Caliphate was to expand its territories through military action and formation of ‘provinces’ across the world. As part of this campaign, IS units came up in several South Asian countries, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and the Philippines. Taneja offers a holistic view, starting with the IS’ origins in Syria and Iraq and then goes into its leadership.

New grounds

Taneja provides details of IS-linked activities in the region. The group has made a lasting institutional presence in Afghanistan. “Afghanistan’s political vacuum and divisive socio-religious landscape could, however, become a new ground for ISIS,” he writes. The IS has claimed responsibility for a couple of attacks in Pakistan, which “offers an intertwined military jihadist civilian complex to accurately place ISIS’s presence or influence.”

In Bangladesh, the IS claimed the July 2016 Dhaka cafe attack. IS posters and flags have been seen in Jammu and Kashmir. And the group attracted dozens of youth from India, especially from Kerala. “South Asia’s complex socio-political and socio cultural narratives remain an open door for ISIS’s marketable fantasy, more than an ideology,” writes Taneja.

But despite these complexities and a vast Muslim population in the region who are directly targeted by IS propaganda channels for recruitment, the group failed to make any major impact in the region, except in Afghanistan.

As for India, Taneja lays down a historical background of India’s engagement with West Asia, the source of the IS threat. He argues that India’s non-interventional foreign policy with its roots going back to the Non-Alignment Movement (NAM) has allowed the country to build capacities in the region, while also prevent transnational jihadist organisations such as the Islamic State and al-Qaeda taking institutional roots.

While this is true, what he could also have looked into is the character of Islam in the sub-continent, which is fundamentally different from the Salafi-Jihadist version that jihadist groups champion.

The chapter on Kerala stresses on the historical connection between the State and the Gulf and their ‘Muslim solidarity’. But this alone doesn’t explain why so many Malayalis were drawn to the IS network. ‘Muslim solidarity’ is not a problem in itself. But Taneja is careful when he says “much more empirical work needs to be done on modern jihadist groups.” “Terrorism has evolved, its study must follow suit,” he writes.

405,2020/02/22,My books help people make sense of the world: Malcolm Gladwell,"The Canadian writer and journalist says that he sees his role as trying to explain both sides of a debate

In many ways, Malcolm Gladwell is the Francis Bacon of our era. His prose is aphoristic, he distils the complex into the simple, and his narratives are distinctively preachy. His books are sold in millions, and they get cleverly and suitably clubbed under myriad genres — from self-help to pop psychology, business strategy, science and sociology to leadership and even allegories. As if on cue, Gladwell wears many hats as a writer. His latest book, Talking to Strangers, is quintessential Gladwell. It creatively and positively trivialises humanity’s complex problems in order to derive lessons that can offer readers provocative insights. Talking from London over the phone, Gladwell speaks about the book and beyond. Excerpts:

Why was it important now to write about talking to strangers?

This is one of the dominant facts about the modern world. Twenty years ago, we would not be having this conversation. Twenty years ago, books by Canadians may have been sold, but they weren’t selling many copies in India and we wouldn’t be having a conversation over mobile phone this easily with a connection this good. There are all kinds of reasons why typically strangers like us would never have met, but now we meet all the time. That’s a central fact of a connected world. And the issue is, are we any good at this kind of communication? For instance, there is a world of difference between you interviewing an Indian author face-to-face and you talking to a Canadian author over the phone.

But doesn’t a connected world make it easier for strangers to know each other?

Yes, today you can dig up the past of strangers from their social media profiles. But my book is really concerned with personal communication, and understanding its nuances and subtleties. It is so easy for meaning to be lost when I’m unfamiliar with your background, your culture, the assumptions you’re bringing. I talk a lot in the book about what it means to interpret facial expressions. All of us, every day, are forced to use facial expressions and body language to interpret someone’s emotional state. If I know you very well, I can do that. I can do that with some degree of accuracy. If I don’t know you at all, it’s really hard and we make mistakes.

In the book, I tell the story of Amanda Knox (who was first convicted and then acquitted in the murder of her British roommate). That’s as much a cross-cultural misunderstanding as anything. Such problems will only be magnified if we don’t learn to understand strangers.

In a book about talking to strangers, it is highly unlikely you’ll meet characters like Sylvia Plath or Anne Sexton. How did this book come along?

When I write books, I start with a single story that I think is powerful and has depth and meaning and I build from there. So I begin with (the death of) Sandra Bland not just because I thought that story was moving and tragic and fascinating, but because I thought it had layers. It is the kind of story you could think about and investigate on a number of levels. And that’s what I’m always looking for in a book; stories I can tell and that allow me to take a step back and examine from a number of perspectives.

Many say your books blend self-help and pop psychology. Are you a self-help writer?

Well, it’s funny. I suppose I am in a certain way. Although it’s not; it’s a different kind of self-help in this book. Normally, in self-help books, people end with, say, 10 rules you make sense of, and I don’t do that at all. Perhaps mine are a little more complicated. My books try to explain social processes. Any book that does that is basically a self-help book, right? It’s that way to help people make sense of the world.

That’s why reviewers say you bring “intellectual sparkle to everyday subjects”. Is this a deliberate approach?

Yeah, it’s deliberate. I’ve often observed that people are experience-rich and theory-poor. All of us have an enormous wealth of stories and experiences. But what we lack is the means to make sense of all that, to organise it, to understand it and to comprehend it. My books are addressing that. I’m not telling you facts you didn’t know before. You’ve all been in situations I’m describing. What I’m doing is saying, here’s a way of organising your thoughts.

Is that why your narratives sound apolitical? Critics say you ignore politics altogether in your writings.

I feel like there are enough books about politics. I always joke that my book was the only American book published in 2019 that did not mention Donald Trump. I don’t think the world needs more on Trump and Brexit and Modi and whoever else. So I have deliberately steered clear of that. And also, I think politics has become so divisive. The minute you mention politics, people take sides and they’re not listening to what you’re saying any more. And they’re distracted. I’m going to talk about other things and leave politics to the politicians. We forget in these politically charged moments just how much there is outside of politics, and I’m not someone who has terribly trusted in politics anyway, so it’s never been hard for me to be apolitical.

You’ve said you want to get people to take human psychology seriously and to respect the complexity of human behaviour and motivations. Since when have you been interested in writing about people and their inner workings?

I’ve always been kind of curious about people’s motivations. When I began to read a lot in academic psychology in my 20s, I became fascinated by the mountain of work that had been done by some very brilliant people. A lot of my reading is about the specifics of human interaction. As someone who is an immigrant many times over, I’m always in the situation of observing things that are certainly unfamiliar to me. And that’s a good jumping off point for this kind of writing.

Who are the writers that have influenced your writing?

Richard Nisbett has been tremendously influential in the world of psychology and also on my thinking, and he’s someone who has a great theme.... to investigate the ways in which our environment, our situation, influence our behaviour.

Your writing style is pedagogical.

The role of the journalist is to be the observer; the curious observer. As a journalist, that comes very naturally too. As I said, I’m not someone who’s taking sides in debates. I’m trying to explain debates. So you’re not going to participate directly in them. I kind of try to help people understand both sides. That’s the natural position to be in.

Your writing reminds me of Truman Capote. Is he a favourite of yours?

Yes! I’m glad you found that out.",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/l7a18w/article30879624.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23SMMalcolmGladwellArtjpga,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/my-books-help-people-make-sense-of-the-world-malcolm-gladwell/article30879625.ece
406,2020/02/22,Mohammed Shafi’s Gramophone Museum and Research Centre in Wayanad,"Mohammed Shafi’s Gramophone Museum and Research Centre in Wayanad houses a rare collection of gramophones and musical instruments

“I wanted to name it Museum of Music but the word ‘gramophone’ is likely to attract more people,” says Mohammed Shafi from Kallai, Kozhikode, of his Gramophone Museum and Research Centre at Thalipuzha in Wayanad. Shafi admits that music is his life as he tries to get the right tempo for a record placed on a gramophone that has seen better days.

Not without reason is Shafi popularly known as Gramophone Shafi. He has dedicated his life to not just gramophones, but its predecessors and successors ranging from antique valve radios or record players.

The Gramophone Museum, for starters, houses around 4000 vinyl records. This is not even a quarter of Shafi’s collection at his home in Kallai and his gramophone repair shop at Palayam in Kozhikode.

“I caught this obsession from the days when I was working in Kolkata 20 years ago,” says Shafi, adding that he spends all his income and more for his passion. “I have hunted down rare devices from all over the country, as if my life depended on them.”

The museum houses around 40 gramophones representing different eras. A Symphonion Music Box from 1856, is the oldest music device while a Gypsy Gramophone made in Germany in 1910 is the oldest gramophone in store. Then there is the Almarah Gramophone, box gramophones of various sizes, and a variety of the popular gramophone with a horn speaker made of brass.

Also part of the collection are a ‘Cylinder Record’ of a Phonogram, a 1920 Mickey Phone from Japan, the dpool recorder/player and changers that can play a set of records one after the other. Shafi is also the proud owner of a Sitar and a Pedal Harmonium. “I don’t think even All India Radio has some of the sound records that I have,” Shafi said, picking out the sound records of Subhash Chandra Bose, Sarojini Naidu, Rabindranath Tagore, Jawaharlal Nehru and, of course, Mahatma Gandhi from his collection.

“There are only very few manufacturers of records these days, like Saregama and Sony Music. The latest ones include records of songs from movies like Mughal-e-Azam, Dil to Pagal Hai, Mohabattein and 1942: A Love Story,” Shafi said humming ‘Hum ko hamee se churalo’ (Mohabattein).

“Once you get used to music played on a gramophone, you won’t like it coming from any other device,” is his explanation for the renewed interest among a section of music lovers.

Shafi's Gramophone Museum is not the first of its kind. That credit goes to his close friend Sunny Mathew who set one up in Pala, Kottayam, a few years ago, with help from Shafi. What makes this second museum special is that every device on display is in perfect working condition.

“This is a live museum. These exhibits are not just for show. They are functional too. I have dedicated a lot of time to this fine art, which one can not master without enough interest and patience.” Shafi curates the gramophone collections of many a collector in the country including Sunny Mathew.

“I want more people to enter the world of gramophones. Setting up a museum in a tourist spot like Wayanad is the first step,” Shafi said before being swept away by a Mohammed Rafi song on his latest record player gifted by a well wisher.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/ezlgjv/article30887284.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpGramophone4jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/mohammed-shafi-and-his-gramophone-museum-in-wayanad/article30887285.ece
407,2020/02/22,The gentle villain,"Professional footballer, art teacher and a fight master Rambo Stanly wears different hats with aplomb

He’s a professional footballer and an art teacher for differently abled children and now a fight master and stunt choreographer. Rambo Stanly aka Ramly is a popular character in Fort Kochi, who often associates himself with social causes.

The 36-year-old usually dresses in military fatigues, because he loves the army, and sports a long beard and a man bun. Tall and muscular, Ramly makes heads turn and that could be why he was selected for a film role.

In 2012, he participated in an audition for Action Khiladi, an adventure reality show on Kairali Channel and was declared winner.

“At the event, stunt master Mafia Sa

si asked me to work as his assistant,” says Ramly, adding that he began getting roles in Tamil, Telugu and Kannada films. His first film was Salaam Kashmir (2013) and he directed a fight scene in Oru Kadathanadan Katha, which released last year.

Ramly had a tough childhood and “big dreams of becoming a scientist or an army man. That’s reason why I dress in military clothes,” he says. He dropped out of a science course in St Albert’s College and began working as a mason to contribute to the family. At the same time, he had been playing cricket and was invited to play in matches. ““I was a fast bowler and played for Kanampally Cricket Club, Vaduthala.”

Unfortunately he was injured during the Ranji Trophy selections. Dejected, he turned to football and coached under famous Rufus D’Souza. Simultaneously he joined martial arts classes in Palluruthy and Michael Johnson’s dance classes in Moolamkuzhy where he learnt cinematic, western and traditional dance styles. Playing professional football and performing at social events began fetching him a small income.

Art was another calling. A self-taught artist, he began teaching painting and sculpting to children at Agostino Vicini Special School in Mundamveli.

408,2020/02/22,"With gradually increasing numbers, tigers give wildlife enthusiasts reason to cheer","Eye on the tiger

In the middle of the interview, N Senthil Kumaran’s phone beeps a notification and his eyes light up. “Three tigers and 17 cubs have been spotted roaming near Kabini’s tourist area,” he tells me, barely able to contain his excitement. The information came from a WhatsApp group — Indian wildlife explorers — that has 300 plus IT professionals and animal lovers from all over the country as members. Now Senthil can’t wait to visit Kabini Wildlife Sanctuary, he has lost count of the number of times he has been there, his last visit was on Pongal when he took a gorgeous photo of three leopards sitting on a tree.

That he has just returned from Pench National Park in Madhya Pradesh where he shot beautiful pictures of India’s super mom tigress, Collarwali, on January 4, does not satiate his thirst for more sightings. “After waiting for three hours, I identified the highly-fertile T-15 by her radio collar,” he says, showing the photos. “Around the same time, another tigress and her five cubs were spotted in the Terai region of Uttarakhand,” he continues.

“The big cats are increasing in number and I want to see as many of them as possible,” says Senthil who took to exclusively photographing them three years ago. One could spend the whole day browsing through his incredible frames and listening to an endless stream of stories about his collection of over 1,500 wildlife photographs taken in the last 10 years. “About 250 of them are classic images,” he admits and adds, “the best are the 35 that I have taken of tigers in various reserves.”

The widely-followed photographer in the South periodically shares the stories behind every frame with his 5,000 plus followers on social media. His narratives give hope; they show why the odds of tiger sightings in India are good now. But Senthil worries about tourism activities in tiger reserves. “People need to understand and respect the beauty of wildlife to maintain ecological equilibrium,” he says.

His own transformation is a case in point. Just a decade ago, he was a plainspeak businessman focussed only on manufacturing underground storage tanks for petroleum products. Based in Dindigul, his work frequently took him on the Kozhikode-Mysore highway cutting through the Bandipur Tiger Reserve, but he paid scant attention to the outdoors.

One particular ride in 2010, he says, changed the course of his life. “The Western ghats mesmerised me like never before and I spontaneously took a few pictures with an ordinary camera I happened to carry,” he says. When his friends appreciated the photos, he was inspired to buy a Canon DSLR. “Now that I had a better camera, the travel bug bit me,” he says and adds, “I realised how much I loved being immersed in National Parks, observing and photographing creatures that call it home.”

Among his best shots, Senthil considers an imposing shot of a tusker, a leopard on a roadside tree and a black panther — all taken in Mudumalai between 2012 and 2015. “I was fascinated to read about the panther’s journey spanning 150 kilometres from its birth place to Kabini backwaters in 2016 and it drove me to photograph it the second time last August in Kabini,” he says.

Prince, the legendary tiger of Bandipur whom Senthil photographed a year before its death in 2016, drew him to the flagship animal in the wild. “The bold and handsome tiger of Bandipur never shied from humans and would often be spotted taking a stroll on safari roads. I got plenty of shots of the most photographed tiger of the South and it made me realise that tigers will remain calm and will never attack unless disturbed.”

Whether you are an aspiring wildlife photographer, animal lover, or conservationist, the sheer excitement of tracking and identifying the endangered species and capturing their expressions and communication gives one unmatched joy, says the self-taught photographer, who now occasionally takes his teenage son along to initiate him into wildlife conservation.

“By observing, reading and exchanging information, I have realised that photography is one of the strongest tools in wildlife conservation,” he says. And he spends his time, money and resources in planning trips to national parks far and near. During summers, he goes for photo-shoots and his winter visits are aimed at better learning and understanding of animal corridors and natural habitats.

Armed with high-end Sony ILCE-9 camera now, Senthil has travelled multiple times to the premier tiger reserve in Nagarhole in Karnataka, Dudhwa in Uttar Pradesh, Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand, Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra, and Maasai Mara in Kenya. “Learning what to look out for takes a lot of time and all these expeditions have taught me patience,” he says.

409,2020/02/22,FIH Pro League | India pulls off a victory,"Beats Australia via the shootout to pocket three points

India bounced back in style to beat holder Australia 3-1 via a shoot-out, after being locked 2-2 at the end of regulation time, in the second match of the two-leg FIH Pro League match on Saturday. India had lost 4-3 on Friday.

India converted two penalty corners through Rupinder Pal Singh (25th minute) and Harmanpreet Singh (27th), while Trent Mitton (23rd) and skipper Aran Zalewski (46th) were the scorers for Australia.

In the shoot-out, Harmanpreet, Vivek Sagar Prasad and Lalit Upadhyay scored for India, while only Daniel Beale found the net for the visitors.

By virtue of the win, India earned three points while Australia pocketed one. Both the teams have 10 points from six games but the Kookaburras are a rung above the Manpreet Singh-led side at third spot in the standings on goal difference.

The result: India 2 (Rupinder 25, Harmanpreet 27) drew with Australia 2 (Trent Mitton 23, Aran Zalewski 46).

410,2020/02/22,Himalayan wolves with hypoxia adaptation are separate species,"Himalayan wolves, also called as Tibetan wolves, which live at more than 4,000 metres altitudes are genetically distinct from grey wolves, according to a study published in the Journal of Biogeography. The divergence of Himalayan wolves relates to past uplift of the region, the authors of the paper note.

Living at such high altitudes, these wolves have genetically adapted themselves to live in low oxygen (hypoxic) conditions. While effective oxygen availability at sea level is nearly 22%, at 4,000 metres altitude, the effective oxygen availability is nearly half — 12.7%.

The researchers collected 280 wolf faeces from across the Tibetan Plateau of China, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan and studied the mitochondrial DNA. A subset of 110 samples was genotyped too. The genetic analysis revealed a clear divergence of Himalayan wolves and marked them as separate breed. There was considerable admixture at the lower edges of the range.

The study based on mitochondrial DNA supports an early divergence for the Himalayan wolves, making them the sister taxon to the grey wolves. The nuclear genome markers analysed also suggests differences between Himalayan wolves and grey wolves. But other studies suggest a recent ancestry for all extant wolf lineages.

Interestingly, unlike the grey wolves that inhabit the lower elevations the Himalayan wolves showed clear hypoxia adaptation. The admixed wolves had a mixture of genes belonging to Himalayan wolves and grey wolves but always carried the Himalayan wolf hypoxia adaptation.

The specialised genes for hypoxia adaptation allowed the animals to overcome the lack of oxygen at such high altitudes. Such adaptations are seen in dogs and humans to mitigate the deleterious effects of free radicals that are produced in response to low oxygen availability. While the precise genetic mechanism that facilitates humans to live in hypoxic conditions remain poorly understood, interbreeding of wolves and dogs is how the dogs might have acquired high-altitude adaptation.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/1emyyo/article30889466.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23TH-SCIHIMALAYANWOLFJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/himalayan-wolves-with-hypoxia-adaptation-are-separate-species/article30889467.ece
411,2020/02/22,"In a boost to vaccine development, structure of SARS-CoV-2 key protein mapped","This will allow better understanding of how the virus binds to the human cells.

Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and the National Institutes of Health, U.S., have produced a 3D atomic scale map of the protein of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that binds to and infects human cells.

Mapping the 3D structure of the protein — spike (S) glycoprotein — will allow better understanding of how the virus binds to the human cells. Knowing the structure of the spike protein will, in turn, allow scientists to develop vaccines and antivirals against the virus and even better diagnostics.

Shape of the virus

Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 virus particles are spherical and have mushroom-shaped proteins called spikes protruding from their surface, giving the particles a crown-like appearance. The spike binds and fuses to human cells, allowing the virus to gain entry.

The spike protein of the novel coronovirus shares 98% sequence identity with the spike protein of the bat coronavirus, the researchers say. The results were published in the journal Science.

Similar yet different

The researchers also found that like in the case of the SARS coronavirus, the spike protein of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 disease binds to the cellular receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which serves as the entry point into human cells. But unlike in the case of SARS, the spike protein of the novel coronavirus binds to the cell receptor with much higher affinity — 10- to 20-fold higher.

Greater binding affinity

The much greater binding affinity to the cell receptor explains the apparent high human-to-human transmissibility of the virus compared with the SARS coronavirus.

“The high affinity of the 2019-nCoV S for human ACE2 may contribute to the apparent ease with which the 2019-nCoV can spread from human-to-human,” the researchers write. “Additional studies are needed to investigate this possibility.”

Since both the SARS coronavirus and the 2019 novel coronavirus share structural similarity and bind to the same receptor, the researchers tested three monoclonal antibodies specific to SARS virus for their ability to bind to the novel coronavirus. But none of the three antibodies tested were found to be effective in inhibiting the novel coronavirus from binding to the human receptor ACE2 and prevent or treat the disease.

New antivirals

However, the 3D map of the S protein will help researchers design new antivirals to stop the virus from binding and infecting human cells.

“Knowing the atomic-level structure of the 2019-nCoV spike will allow for additional protein engineering efforts that could improve antigenicity and protein expression for vaccine development,” the researchers write.

The researchers were able to determine the structure of the spike protein as the Chinese researchers shared the whole genome sequence data in the global database.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/xqcg7f/article30889583.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23TH-SCI3Djpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/in-a-boost-to-vaccine-development-structure-of-sars-cov-2-key-protein-mapped/article30889584.ece
