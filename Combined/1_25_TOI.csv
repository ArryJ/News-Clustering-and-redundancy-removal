0,['25/01/2020'],Kochi Times Most Desirable Man on TV 2019: Sreeram Ramachandran,"With his innocent smile and unassuming personality, Sreeram Ramachandran has become a household name in Kerala. The actor, who incidentally began his TV career by playing a struggling actor named Anand in Chumma, is now popular as superstar Jeeva in Kasthoorimaan. The son of veteran Carnatic musician Palai C K Ramachandran, Sreeram is also a singer and it’s no wonder with this enviable fan following that he has topped the Kochi Times Most Desirable Men on Television poll for 2019. The Thattathin Marayathu and Uyare actor shares his delight bagging the most desirable man on TV title. Excerpts.I feel really happy. I have been following Kochi Times and it’s a proud moment for me to win this title. It’s a boost to my career. TV has been a popular medium in Kerala and when I am chosen as the most desirable man on TV, I realise that I have been accepted by many and that feels special.I am someone who prefers to choose the path less travelled. Whenever I do something, I try to make it subtle and simple. Considering the struggles that I have endured, I have never been able to do anything loud, but I try to be genuine. I think that’s what makes people like me.I do not have to go anywhere to find the qualities of the most desirable woman as I see them every day at home, in my better half Vanditha. She is benevolent, compassionate and socially committed, and that’s why she has chosen a career as a speech therapist. Before meeting her, I was unaware of such as career option and what I attracted me to her was the commitment she has to the society.After acting in films such as Malarvadi Arts Club and Thattathin Marayathu, I began my career in TV through Chumma in 2012 and went back to act in Shyamaprasad sir’s Artist. Again, I came back to mini screen to do Kasthoorimaan. There is a common notion that an established actor in mini screen will not be able to return to Mollywood, I really wanted to break that stereotype. Actors like Shah Rukh Khan, Sushant Singh and Madhavan came into films after becoming popular faces in television. I came back from films to small screen as I wasn’t getting much opportunities in movies, but I got the mileage from TV to return to Mollywood with a bang. Acting is acting, no matter the medium.I am a hardcore fan of Hrithik Roshan, not just because he is a handsome actor with a chiselled body, but because I admire his dedication and perseverance to chase his dreams. He was someone who was bedridden due to a severe back injury; many told him he can never dance again. He overcame that and became one of the best dancers of Bollywood. Later, he was diagnosed with chronic subdural haematoma and I remember reading his mom’s interview where she said how Hrithik, smiled and gave her confidence just before getting into the operation theatre for surgery.My most desirable woman is Priyanka Chopra as she is now living her dreams. She became an international actress through her hard work, attitude and dedication.Of course. Kozhikode has been always an encouragement for my career growth. It is a place where you will have at least five people who would encourage you to do what you are good at. Kozhikode being my hometown is special to me.I am still taking baby steps in my career and I am not sure, if I am qualified to assess my experience. It was during my second year of engineering that I was smitten by films. I decided to complete my course, become secure and then venture into films as there is always an element of luck in becoming successful in films. My dad is a musician and I was also focused in music but acting was always there in my mind and it eventually happened. I began as an assistant director and slowly turned an actor.I prefer to take life on day-to-day basis and whatever I have gone through in life has become an inspiration for me while acting, so I would prefer to take the energy that I gain from the industry to perfect my characters.Right after watching Anjaam Pathira, I was comparing its making and quality with Hollywood films. It’s great that we are raising our standards and keeping it high. I am proud of being part of films like Uyare that are making a mark. Our Malayalam films by those like G Aravindan, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, John Abraham and now Lijo Jose Pellisserry, have always been looked upon by filmmakers across the world. It is interesting to see our filmmakers treading their own path and making films that are unique in their narratives, making and even gender sensibilities.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73583295,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-344190/73583295.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/malayalam/kochi-times-most-desirable-man-on-tv-2019-sreeram-ramachandran/articleshow/73583295.cms

It was only then that directors like Amol Palekar and Satyadev Dubey took note of me and gave me the opportunity to act in Hindi plays directed by them. Interestingly enough, I have hardly done any Kannada plays, except the few directed by my brother, the late Shankar Nag.”Although Anant has not been active in theatre for a while, he has been keeping track of developments in the field. “There was a time when people used to complain that there are no takers for plays, but today, if there is interesting content you will absolutely find an audience.

4,['25/01/2020'],A script needs to resonate with my musical sensibilities: Amit Trivedi,"Right from his early albums like Aamir and Dev D, film composer and singer Amit Trivedi has always been drawn to off-kilter scripts. A decade into the industry, this is something that the National Award-winning composer still looks for in films. Most of his works that have worked have always resonated with his sensibilities, said the composer in an interview, ahead of Indradhanush , his three-hour experiential concert today in Chennai. Excerpts from the interview:It means an emotional ride. We will depict seven different emotions — love, sadness, anger, hope, courage, fear and friendship — through the songs. We have worked with a huge team and it is my dream come true. A very long time ago, I had created this song called Nikhra Hai Rang Indradhanush. This was almost around 25 years ago. I could not find an outlet for it back then. I wanted to use that line somewhere and wanted to use it in my show. The idea for the concert came from that song.2020 looks great and I am looking forward to it. I share different relationships with all directors. I share a beautiful working relationship with Anurag Kashyap. Sriram Raghavan is such an inspiration and I have always wanted to work with them. I gel really well with filmmakers like these. There was Kedarnath also, which worked out really well. Numbers wise, it fared far far better then Manmarziyaan or Andhadhun. It has been a great year. These directors add a lot to the music because their passion often rubs off on me.There is a medium that I am composing for and cinema is that medium. I need to know the film inside out to compose music. Otherwise, it is difficult. I need to relate with the directors and the milieu of the setting. Once you connect to a film, things flow naturally. And there are times where you don’t connect with a film. In these situations, you just have to see through it. We are professionals and just have to give our best at the given circumstances.A script needs to resonate with my musical sensibilities. And most of my films that have worked have resonated with my sensibilities. When that happens, the work automatically ends up being beautiful and I do end up giving my best.I don’t know if it was way ahead of time (laughs). I had no idea it would turn out to be such a big rage. I was just composing music as I would normally do for any film. Anurag sir loves songs. When he heard the music, he became so excited. He actually rewrote the entire script around the music. Even in 2020, we have a film releasing, and the process is the same. He tells me to make the music first, which inspires him and then he starts writing the script around it. It is so beautiful that when you watch the film, the marriage between the visuals, the music and the storytelling is seamless. It is what I call the Kashyap magic.It is the most important thing. Lyrics is the face of any song. The combination of composition, lyrics and singing is what makes a song a song. I love good poetry and thoughts put into simple words. Anand Bakshi used to do exactly that in the olden days. Now, we have Amitabh Bhattacharya, Javed (Akhtar) saab, Gulzar saab, and so many who do that in Hindi cinema. I have always had a beautiful working relationship with all my lyricists. Javed saab wrote Iktara and Sham from Aisha, 10 years back. The songs still resonate with people and covers of them are still being made. I hear a Sham cover almost every day. It is not just the music that has stood the test of time, but it is also the writing, which has a timelessness to it. Amitabh Bhattacharya’s work for Dev D is still talked about.The only challenge that I face is when the director does not understand or want the music that we compose. It becomes a challenge to crack what exactly the director wants at times. Any or every album is difficult to crack at the starting stage because it involves creating a new idea out of a blank space. Once you crack that, it becomes easy.I would love to do more Tamil films. I had a great time composing music for the Queen remakes. The directors were really cool. But I think the project has run into some trouble right now, and it is on an absolute hold. But the soundtrack has turned out very beautifully. I want it to come out soon. The experience was a great one.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73583511,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-719481/73583511.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/music/a-script-needs-to-resonate-with-my-musical-sensibilities-amit-trivedi/articleshow/73583511.cms

12,['25/01/2020'],Could eSports be a medal event at bigger platforms?,"For the longest time, the general perception of video games was that it was a colossal waste of time, much to the dismay of hardcore gamers. Gaming, they maintained, requires a lot of quick thinking, hand-eye co-ordination and so much more. Over the years, professional gaming has been growing and gaining recognition with events across the world. But its inclusion at the recent Southeast Asian Games 2019 as a medal discipline has really upped the ante for the sport. Not only did the gaming community see this as a validation of their passion, but it also raised their hopes for eSports to be included in the Olympics, given that the Southeast Asian Games are supervised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Olympic Council of Asia (OCA). “Imagine playing a video game and winning a gold medal for your country in the near future? Now that eSport was a part of the 2019 Asian Games, it will revolutionise the way Indians (and others across the world) see the potential in this field,” says Bengaluru-based professional gamer Vishal Rangwani.“The SEA Games 2019 signifies a new dawn for the eSports industry with its inclusion as a medal sport,” says Vishal, who adds thatdiscussions for it to be included in the Olympics are reportedly going on. Despite the huge numbers involved, the business-first nature of eSports — and the question of whether leisure gaming is a sport at all — has made the Olympic movement cautious. But gamers feel differently. ""It is all about national pride and these games also require dedication, focus and planning. It would be wrong to say that it’s only a leisure sport,"" says Ankit Panth, a professional gamer from Mumbai, who is also the brand ambassador for a software giant that is conducting an eSports tournament in the lead-up to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.“We are just getting started with gaming in the country. Tournaments like ESL India Premiership and Dreamhack India getting international eyeballs and bringing talent to our country, is a big thing. With the rise of Pubg Mobile tournaments, mobile gaming has been exploding. Internationally, the eSports market will reach $1.8 billion by 2022. A more optimistic scenario places revenue at $3.2 billion. The audience growth is expected to grow to 645 million in 2022. But the icing on the cake is the recognition that we as players can get through a medal event. Getting a medal gives us the kind of respect that other professional sportspersons get,” adds Ankit.A software giant announced an esports tournament in the lead-up to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. The firm said that it would sponsor an Olympic-endorsed event with a prize pool of $250k for each game. The tournament is to be held between June 22 and June 24 inTokyo.India had nearly 201 million users of mobile games in 2016. This was projected to reach about 370 million users by 2022.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73583060,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1057404/73583060.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/could-esports-be-a-medal-event-at-bigger-platforms/articleshow/73583060.cms

Amid lights and music, he embarks on a journey with the audience, investigating the mundane voices that riddle the life of a lonely woman, named Amma Bi, in her deserted Lucknow. “It’ll be an evening of theatre in Bengaluru,” says the veteran artiste, who is set to present a dramatised reading ofin the city, a tale he had penned nearly 30 years ago. “It’s an entertaining piece that brings alive literature on stage,” he adds. Presented by Flo Bangalore, the show will be held at Chowdiah Memorial Hall on February 6.finds Bengaluru to be a culturally-aware city. “Every time I am in town, either performing a play on stage or speaking at a literature festival, I have noticed that people here are very well-educated and informed. Audiences respond to each nuance of a performance — be it storyline, structure or dialogues — which is kind of encouraging for the artiste,” he says. When he had brought his play,, to Bengaluru a couple of years ago, several local actors were made part of its ensemble cast. “We usually don’t get the time to watch local plays when we are travelling with a production. But this gave us the opportunity to interact with local actors. And it was a good experience,” he explains.When asked about his perspective on India’s current socio-political situation,says, “People are already speaking up about what’s happening in the country right now. I don’t think there is anything new to add. But all I want to say is that every human being is the same, and everyone should be treated with equal respect.”Amid all the travelling, film shoots, stage performances and writing, the veteran actor also takes time out to be with his grandchildren, Misha and Zain. He says, “I usually meet them on Sundays. They are delightful kids. I don’t get to spend as much time with them as I would want to because of my work schedule. But, like any other grandfather, I am indulgent when I am with them. It’s amazing to see the two growing up together.”Fresh from the success of his ode to Charlie Chaplin,says he might be writing more short stories in the near future, some of which might turn into stage adaptations too.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73583667,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-79225/73583667.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/bengaluru-gets-ready-for-an-evening-of-theatre-with-pankaj-kapur/articleshow/73584508.cms

Well, as it turns out, Meghana Raj has, and Republic Day brings back warm memories for her. “I was in Class 9 and belonged to the junior wing of NCC 8 KAR BN company under the Karnataka and Goa Directorate. As a cadet, representing your state at the Republic Day Parade in Delhi is a big deal. Only 18 cadets are selected from the junior wing to represent the state at the parade and I was one of them. It was a prestigious moment and it was a first for my school (Baldwin Girls High School) as well,” says the actress.Reminiscing about her training days, Meghana says, “We had to be all-rounders and had to be good at everything including cultural activities. Our marching had to be perfect, as well as the drill. We also had to be good at singing and dancing. Once in Delhi, we had to train for one and a half months and I remember it was extremely cold when we got there. Even then, we would wake up at 4 am and have a full day of practice, only to hit the bed after midnight. The pursuit of perfection was such that even the slightest mistake meant that would we would be caned or get some other form of punishment for an entire day”But that’s not all, Meghana also got a chance to perform for the then prime minister Manmohan Singh. “From the junior wing, I got to perform in front of the prime minister and meet the then Air Force Commander. After the parade, we headed straight to the NCC decamp, a 15-day camp held at the outskirts of Bengaluru, which was also quite memorable. The decamp had a more relaxed setting. Those were the days before mobile phones, so staying in touch with family was not easy. I could talk to my parents, say, once in 5-6 days. I really enjoyed the whole experience of being a part of the parade,” the actress sums up.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73585075,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-266302/73585075.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/representing-your-state-at-the-republic-day-parade-is-a-big-deal-says-meghana-raj/articleshow/73585075.cms
15,['25/01/2020'],Eesha Suchi’s new medley is a tribute to Kannada music,"Singer Eesha Suchi, who already has a number of Kannada songs to her credit, has come up with a new medley, in which she is celebrating 40 years of Sandalwood music . The artiste had earlier sung a medley of 50 Kannada songs. This time, however, Eesha has sung 100 songs on one beat.“I chose American singer-songwriter Charlie Puth ’s How Long beat, because when I had begun working on this series last year, this song was very popular. On the recommendation of a few friends, I put together a medley of 100 popular Kannada songs that were released between 1975 and 2019,” says Eesha. This medley, according to Eesha, is an attempt at bringing something new to the Kannada industry, while retaining the essence of all the songs. “Some of these old Kannada songs had chords similar to the English track I chose. Also I picked songs that had a little fast tempo. I wanted to use a hero-music director combo, but then figured that it wouldn’t work out. So, I just chose songs that were popular and went well with the beat. Selecting the appropriate songs was a tough job. And while doing so, I also had to keep in mind the popularity of those songs. It was also important to maintain the energy throughout, because some of the old songs were melodious but slow numbers,” she explains.So, what’s next? “I think I will wait for the feedback from my listeners and see what they want to hear next. Based on their suggestions, I will work on my next medley,” the singer signs off.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73585286,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-228194/73585286.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/music/eesha-suchis-new-medley-is-a-tribute-to-kannada-music/articleshow/73585286.cms

21,['25/01/2020'],Music review: Happy Hardy and Heer,"A love triangle, 'Happy Hardy And Heer', has Himesh Reshammiya in a double role for the first time alongside Sonia Mann.The album of 12 songs composed by Himesh and DJ Kiran Kamath features Himesh’s older hits that he has recreated for this film. The composer, who has earlier brought in singers like Darshan Rawal and Akasa Singh ('Kheech Meri Photo'), Aaman Trikha ('Go Go Go Govinda') and Palak Muchhal ('Jumme Ki Raat'), has introduced Ranu Mondal in this album.Last year, Ranu became an overnight singing sensation after her rendition of Lata Mangeshkar’s 'Ek Pyaar Ka Nagma Hai' ('Shor', 1972) went viral on the internet. Apart from himself and Ranu, Himesh has roped in multiple singers with a variety of voice ranges and scales to bring certain freshness to it.The first song, 'Teri Meri Kahani', a duet by Ranu and Himesh, begins with her impeccably sung aalap, which is also the theme music for the film. It is a melodious track and showcases her voice beautifully.The next is a Sufi-folk based romantic track 'Heeriye' and Arijit Singh along with Shreya Ghoshal own this pleasant number completely. This song shows how trained voices can effortlessly take any number to a different level altogether.'Heer Tu Meri' sung by Anusha Mani and Himesh is a fun romantic number and so is the next one, 'Cutie Pie'. Jubin Nautiyal , Asses and Harshdeep Kaur ’s 'Ishqbaaziyaan', a Punjabi love song is worth a mention. 'Looteri' is a quirky Hinglish track by Aaryan Tiwari and has a rock, jazzy vibe to it, that stands out.'Ashiqui Mein Teri 2.0', is a recreation of his 2006 chart buster with the same name from '36 China Town'. The next, 'Duggi', is a Punjabi track with a hookline 'Kaleje vich duggi vajdi' sung by Himesh, Navraj Hans , Raja Sagoo and hit-maker Kumar Sanu ’s daughter Shannon K.'Le Jaana' gives you a 'Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge' feel with its predictable Punjabi soundscape.For 'Aadat', Himesh has roped in Rabbi Shergill and Asees Kaur (who does a fab job with the alaap) along with Ranu. Himesh-Ranu’s sad love song 'Keh Rahi Hai Nazdeekiyaan' that goes on for more than seven minutes also features Payal Dev and Sameer Khan The over 30-minute long album finally comes to an end with a remixed version of 'Teri Meri Kahani'.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73583983,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-69299/73583983.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/music/music-reviews/music-review-happy-hardy-and-heer/articleshow/73583983.cms

23,['25/01/2020'],2020 travel trends point to sustainability,"With 'travel' and 'wanderlust' being some of 2019's most used words on an Indian dating app, it is safe to say that millennials are smitten by the travel bug. However with rising environmental awareness, people's travel patterns are also evolving. Moving ahead from the 2019 trends of Insta-worthy travel experiences and multigenerational trips, here's a look at some tourism trends that are touted to become the norm in 2020.Last year saw a lot of popular tourist destinations like Iceland, Santorini and Everest requesting tourists to not overcrowd them and spare the natural environment of the place. Emerging as an antidote to the harmful environmental impacts caused by this overcrowding, undertourism seems to be the perfect solution. This travel trend underlines the practice of people consciously travelling to lesser known cities. These have less tourists and are also similar to other famous tourist destinations. The port city of Trieste in Italy is fast replacing the crowded Venice and the Incan site of Kuelap is drawing some of the crowd that Machu Pichu usually sees. Similarly Kep, Guimaraes and Brussels are some places which can easily be considered as some under-tourism destinations.A lot of lesser-known mountain ranges are expected to see tourists this yearSpartan travel is about giving up all the frills of traditional travel, including regular gadgets, in exchange for a simpler way of life. Even the accommodations availed on such trips are minimal. Bringing along as few belongings as possible is encouraged. The aim is not only to declutter but also to travel more sustainably. Staying in eco-huts and choosing JOMO (Joy Of Missing Out) are a part of these trips.Eco-conscious travellers are keen to join beach clean-up drivesWhile the concept of veganism isn't a new one, it was in 2019 that veganism started making its way into the mainstream. From consuming local vegan diets to putting up at vegan friendly hotels (which use absolutely no animal products), many people are embracing the idea of a vacation experience which is fully animal cruelty-free. Data from a travel e-commerce sit suggests that 70% travellers would be more likely to book a place if it has green credentials.Eco-consciousTravellers are opting for slower modes of transport to reduce their environmental impactMost travel companies predict that 2020 will witness a considerable percentage of travellers opting for slower modes of transport to reduce their environmental impact. Types of transport that play into our desire to take the pace down a notch will also come into their own – from peddle bikes and trams to sleds and boats and of course, our own two feet.What used to be just a travelling concept with few takers previously, is predicted to become a preferred travelling trend this year. This agriculturally based activity that brings visitors to a farm or ranch and helps them have a DIY experience, not only aims at promoting environmental friendly tourism but also helps local farmers grow their business.To save oneself from the hassle and worry of carrying around wads of cash, travellers are increasingly going for entirely cashless trips.The holiday hybrid of business travel and leisure travel has been on the rise for a while, and as work-life boundaries continue to blur, it makes sense to combine work with pleasure. This trend takes the form of business travellers working remotely and extending the business trip to explore the destination, either alone or with their family.This is for the time poor millennial who simply cannot afford a long vacation. Instead of trying to plan one long vacation, people are nowadays trying to make multiple short trips and weekend getaways throughout the year.-- Imana.Bhattacharya@timesgroup.com",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73581249,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-321608/73581249.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/2020-travel-trends-point-to-sustainability/articleshow/73581214.cms

The multi-composer album has Gourov-Roshin, Tanishk Bagchi and Prem-Hardeep and the lyrics have been penned by Devshi Khanduri, Shellee, Preet Harpal, Mumzy Stranger and Shabbir Ahmed.Composed by Sukshinder Shinda and written by Preet Harpal, the Jazzy B track featuring Apache Indian, 'Dil Luteya' (2011), was a massive hit. And for this film, it has been recreated by Prem and Hardeep as 'Gallan Kardi'. Sung by Jazzy B and Jyotica Tangri, with a rap by Mumzy, this version is snappier with a markedly increased tempo. It won’t be a surprise if this makes it to the charts and ends up as a party anthem.The next, 'Ole Ole 2.0' makes you nostalgic as you yearn to listen to Abhijeet Bhattacharya ’s original version. It had been composed by Dilip Sen-Sameer Sen and written by Sameer Anjaan for 'Yeh Dillagi' (1994). Not just the song but Saif, too, is an upgraded version in this number and has come far from the ‘cute guy’ way back then, to the ‘hot metrosexual man’ in this one. This dance track, recreated by Tanishk Bagchi, has Amit Mishra’s vocals and is easily one of the grooviest dance tracks in the album.Composers Gourov-Roshin’s Hinglish song 'Bandhu Tu Mera' is a pleasant melodious number interspersed with some EDM and singer Yasser Desai’s rendition takes this track to another level.'Mere Baabula' is another Gourov-Roshin creation and this soulful, slow track has earthy-voiced singers Harshdeep Kaur , Akhil Sachdeva who do complete justice to it.The music album, like most in Bollywood these days, is a predictable mix of recreations and originals.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73582481,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-116929/73582481.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/music/music-reviews/music-review-jawaani-jaaneman/articleshow/73582481.cms

All the tracks have been written and composed by the director and that is why, probably, there is an almost tangible yet seamless connect between the tracks.Sivamani’s excellent percussion skills, Naveen Kumar’s flute, Suresh Lalwani’s violin combine to create melody that touches you.While the first song 'Maula Mere' is a heart-wrenching one in the soulful voice of Kailash Kher , 'Gudda Guddi' by Azmat Hussain is more about poetry and the situation than a song.The third track, 'Haq Maula' sung by Piyush Mishra has an indescribable haunting quality about it that jars you.Khan also lends his vocals to this disturbingly beautiful piece of music.

29,['25/01/2020'],"Upcycling: With a little creativity, repurpose old items sustainably","Food containers, cartons and even old boots, almost all of your 'useless' items can be upcycledIs decluttering on your New Year's resolutions list? If yes, then before you start throwing out every 'useless' item , you should know that a lot of what you think is useless, can be made useful again. With some creativity and patience, you can give a new life and purpose to your discarded items through upcycling.According to the estimates of Central Pollution Control Board, Delhi generated about 2,24,810 tonnes of plastic waste in the year 2018-19. As residents of this city we should be concerned about that number and do everything we can in our power to reduce it. Upcyling old items can help reduce the amount of waste we create. Wondering how to start? Here are a few tips and tricks to help you become an upcycling pro.From old glass bottles to old CDs, upcycling can also be easy on the wallet as it may even help you make your own home decor. Iesha Sharma, a 30-year-old HR professional, who believes in sustainable living and upcycles old items at home, says, ""A year ago, when I had just moved into my new apartment, I decided to be creative and picked up old plates, CDs and cartridge sheets to make showpieces out of them. I painted the old plates with acrylic paint, made ceiling decor out of the CDs and made cut-out lamps out of the cartridge sheets and old bulbs,"" she says, adding, ""I also don't buy new phone covers and instead just paint the old ones to give them a new look."" Tarunima Bajpai, a 24-year-old social activist, adds, ""I have several painted bottles as showpieces at my house. They can also be used as decorative lighting by putting a bulb or fairy lights inside them.""Iesha Sharma upcycled her phone by painting it with acrylicsAnamika Chaturvedi, a 40-year-old IT professionala, who runs residents' group to encourage people to lead a sustainable lifestyle, says, ""By making bags out of old clothes, we upcycle and eliminate waste. I also use old petticoats to make new salwars and old saris as cooler and mattress covers"". Antara Roy, a 35-year-old entrepreneur, who is a kitchen gardening enthusiast, adds, ""Since my son is still growing, we have to buy him new clothes every year. I take out the waist strings of his pajamas and reuse them to support my plants.""Giving a creative twist to upcycling, Tarunima Bajpai grows plants out of her old boots. ""I didn't want to get rid of my boots but they weren't in a usable condition either. So I placed small glass bottles with plants in them, and now I have plants growing out of my boots!,"" she says.Upcycling food containers and cutlery is another option. ""Some outlets deliver biryani in clay pots. I either use them for setting curd or to cook non-veg dishes. I also reuse chopsticks to either support my creepers or as skewers for barbecue,"" says Antara Roy. Tarunima Bajpai adds, ""I use cheese or jam containers to store small earrings or safety pins.""Tarunima Bajpai uses cardboard boxes to make homes for stray dogs.""Big cartons come in handy to make shelters for strays. To make them waterproof, I cover them with old flex sheets that I use for events at work. I also convert matchboxes into drawers for buttons and earrings,"" she says. ""From incense stick holders and pen holders to just plain old storage boxes, every cardboard box that comes into our house is always painted and reused,"" says Rashi Grover, a 43-year-old freelance consultant, who is a part of a residents-led campaign encouraging waste segregation.Your baby is all grown up, but you don’t want to throw away his/her first cot? Don't worry, there's an upcycling option for that, too. ""Since it has a special place in my heart, I upcycled my daughter's first bathing sink and sleeping cot. While the sink has been reused as a planter, the cot is now used as storage for toys,"" says Rashi Grover.Rashi Grover uses an old cot for storage purposesUpcycling is the act of taking something discarded/no longer in use and giving it a new life and new function. It means you refashion something, which results in an item that is typically better or the same quality as the original.

In the end, the upcycled item is usually of betterquality and is used for a purpose other than what it originally served.is recovering a product that has been used and putting it through a process to make it into a new version of the same product.

01:53Ahead of Republic Day celebrations, tableaux artistes showcase their talent

Enter the Rashtriya Rangshala Camp in Delhi and you will immediately sense the patriotic fervour as people from different parts of the country prepare for the 77th Republic Day Parade. Giving a sneak peek into the rich and diverse culture of the country, tableaux from different states are one of the most fascinating aspects of the Republic Day parade. The Rangshala camp is currently housing the life-sized 3D models representing the different states and departments.With just a day left for the ceremony, participants are busy with last-minute preparations – from giving finishing touches to the colourful models, fixing the costumes and rehearsing the dance steps.Filled with a sense of pride that he will be representing his state at a national level, 25-year-old classical dancer Sunil Kumar Bala from Odisha says, ""This is not my first time performing here but it always feels special."" Decked in shiny drapes and with elaborate eye makeup, Sunil and his troupe is all pumped up to perform a blend of Odissi and Sambalpuri dance forms and portray the famous Rath Yatra festival of Odisha.Assam will showcase the state’s bamboo and cane crafts in its tableau . Bamboo and cane are abundant and an integral part of the lifestyle and economy of Assam and a variety of products are made of these things – including bamboo mats, baskets of various sizes and shapes, winnows, sieves,(traditional umbrella) and various fishing implements.Punjab's tableau is themed around first Sikh master Guru Nanak Dev 's teachings. A group of 36 artistes couldn't be happier that they are getting to be a part of the celebration of India's biggest festival. ""We have so many states with diverse, cultures and celebrations. But when we participate in the R-Day parade, we stand united to represent India. It is our biggest festival and we all have been working hard to put up our best show before the world,"" says 24-year-old Kulwinder Singh, who has come to participate in the parade for the first time.The theme of J&K tableau this year is 'Back To Village' and 30 artistes, who are a part of the R-Day tableau for the first time, say that they have worked hard for days to make sure they highlight the developments in villages of J&K through their tableau. ""It is a big privilege for us to get a chance to come to Delhi and be a part of the R-Day celebrations. Even watching the parade on TV gave us goosebumps, so you can imagine what an honour it is for us to be here,"" says Sunny Mujoo, a choreographer for the J&K tableau, which will depict J&K's cultural life and traditional arts and crafts.A first-time visitor to Delhi, tribal musician Pratap Singh seemed to be in awe of the capital city. ""It is not only my first time to this event but also to the city and I am very grateful for that,"" says Pratap. Here to showcase the Gond tribe's Saila Nach on behalf of Madhya Pradesh 's tableau, the 28-year-old is thrilled that his family and friends can watch him and his troupe on TV. ""I want everyone in the country to know about ourart forms, and of course, it is a big deal to be here,"" he says with a smile.Meghalaya will showcase its unique double-decker living root bridge in its tableau. The state's Khasi and Jaintia people are known for bridging the gaps by using the secondary roots of trees. Locally known as 'Jingkieng Diengjri', it literally means rubber tree bridge.Praveen Kumar from Andhra Pradesh tells us, ""It is our first time here and we are looking forward to enjoy ourselves. I feel fortunate as it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."" In a rich display of culture, Praveen and his troupe are here to perform Chekka Bhajana, a nearly-vanishing folk dance from the Rayalaseema region. The troupe, which has been preparing for three months, is all set to enthrall visitors.The tableau will exhibit the cultural & religious tourism and the ' Sarva Dharma Sama Bhava ' theme. The tableau will give a glimpse of Kashi’s cultural heritage along the river Ganga, and also recreate the Sufiyana character of Deva Sharif, located in the Barabanki district of UP.-- Imana.Bhattacharya@timesgroup.comIn Video: Celebrating India: Here's a glimpse of tableaux that will be a part of Republic Day parade",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73583246,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-611847,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/republic-day-tableaux-give-a-glimpse-of-indias-diversity/articleshow/73583269.cms

But with time, things have definitely changed for the singer, who was recently in town for a gig. ""I was not as big then as I am today, so I could shoot portions of the video at the India Gate. But now, my team is not sure about shooting outside because they think I will get mobbed,"" he shares.Jubin talks about his love for Dilli ka khana, quality of content that in the music industry and gives his reaction to an old video from the sets of a reality show when he was rejected from the singing reality show, that recently went viral.Ask him what brings him to the city and Humnava Mere singer says, ""Honestly, the food brings me here. Delhi has the best food in the country. From Mughlai to Chinese and rolls, you name it, the city has it. You guys have the best butter chicken.""With gigs and performances lined up in different colleges of the city, Jubin says that Delhiites will get to see him a lot this season. ""Last year, we were not pushing much, but this time I have told my team that I want to perform at as many college fests as possible. What really works with the audience at college fests is the honesty. When I am on stage, I am just an honest artiste who tries to let people know me, not only as a musician, but also as a person. That honestly creates a vibe and people can connect to me,"" he adds.""If I don't feel the song then I am not able to sing it,"" says Jubin when we ask him if there are any prerequisites that he has before agreeing to do a project. ""I am a very choosy guy, sometimes it gets very irritating for composers. If I don’t feel it, then I am not able to perform. As my career is moving ahead, I spend a lot of time with the songs before I jump into a project,” he shares.But is he content with the talent and music that we currently have in the industry? ""It is not about being content or not. I think music is more like fashion, sometimes bell-bottoms are in fashion, then slim fits make their way and later we have bell-bottoms again. Similarly, in music, there is Sufi, rock, recreations and originals. As far as artistes are concerned, it is about what you want. Do you want the stardom or money? Do you want to impress people or yourself? These are some of the questions that an artist should always ask because these days, bachchon ki awaaz abhi bani nahi hai aur woh market mein utar gaye hain. It is not that they are not good artists but they need to spend more time with their craft, they need to master it. Any singer would agree that when they begin their journey, they need to have some substance. Then, you attract fans because they are not people who only listen to your music, but they get attached to your journey as well,"" he explains.Reacting to a viral video that surfaced last month from the sets of a reality show when the singer was rejected on the singing reality show, Jubin shares that he has no complaints against the judges. ""I never knew that people will dig up something that old and make it big. I was thrown out of the show and that made me who am I today. It is not about the judges, honestly. It was not their fault, it was not a wrong decision on their end. Being a small town boy, I was killing it back home, and I think mere paer zameen pe thay nahi. I think all of that got into my head, and going to a reality show broke that,"" says Jubin, adding that standing in a queue with 5,000 other people who were all singing better than him made his realise that he needed to work hard.""I think that really played a very important role in my journey, it got me questioning myself and my work. Starting from the bottom and then killing it, I don't think there is any better way to do it. Becoming famous with one song was never my agenda, I wanted to take it slow and probably, that is why I am growing as a musician. If you listen to my voice in my first song and listen to my voice now, you will find a huge difference in the delivery and expressions. As an artist, the only job of the artist is to grow in the art, getting better and break boundaries. You can’t be a creator if you are not willing to take that extra step,"" he concludes.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73579990,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-878798/73579990.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/music/news/jubin-nautiyal-i-was-thrown-out-of-indian-idol-and-it-made-me-who-i-am-today/articleshow/73579900.cms
34,['25/01/2020'],"Excessive tax results in social injustice, says CJI","This story is from January 25, 2020

Chief Justice of India S A Bobde (File Photo)

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the 2020-21 Union budget, Chief Justice of India S A Bobde had a word of caution for finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman — excessive tax results in social injustice by the government.

Speaking on the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal’s 79th foundation day on Friday, CJI Bobde said, “While tax evasion is a social injustice to fellow citizens, arbitrary or excessive tax also results in social injustice by the government itself.”

Despite spending almost two decades as a judge of constitutional courts, the CJI admitted that the Indian tax law regime, like those in other countries, was complex. “There is no denial of the fact that tax administration is complex. With so many amendments one after another; provisions with exceptions, provisos, cross references; many delegated legislations, it is one of the most mazed branch of law,” he said.

Indirectly impressing upon the government to attempt simplification of the tax regime, Justice Bobde quoted renowned jurist Nani Palkhivala, who had said, “The time has come for Parliament to enact some new legislation, say, ‘Prevention of Cruelty to Taxpayers Act’, which should override all fiscal legislations.”

Lauding the stellar role played by ITAT in speedy adjudication of tax disputes to the satisfaction of taxpayers and revenue authorities, the CJI said, “Tax judiciary plays a very important role in resource mobilisation of the country. Just and speedy dispute resolution is perceived as a tax incentive by the taxpayer. To tax collectors, an efficient tax judiciary ensures that demands arising out of legitimate assessments are not strangled in delayed litigation.”

Recalling that though the SC had observed in the landmark L Chandrakumar case that tribunals in India had not performed to expectation, Justice Bobde said, “However, if there is one tribunal in India that has made its mark for its professional excellence, independence and neutrality, it is ITAT. To that extent, ITAT is certainly an exception to the general perception about tribunalisation of justice.”

He said the United Nations Development Programme had picked ITAT as a case study of a success story from the developing world and projected it as a role model for other nations. “While ITAT has done a great job on the judicial side, equal focus must be given to the infrastructure,” Justice Bobde said and complimented ITAT president Justice P P Bhatt for taking initiative to construct ITAT’s own buildings in several places.

ITAT was constituted on January 25, 1941, much before independence and was India’s first experiment with tribunals. “It has proven to be a very successful one. It is a recognised fact that over the years, ITAT, through its transparent working, has protected the faith of the assessee as well as revenue authorities. It has complete functional independence, a high degree of legal and technical expertise, assessee friendly approach and quick decision making,” the CJI said.

Pak PM Imran Khan (AFP photo)

NEW DELHI: With Pakistan getting the all clear on 14 out of 27 action plans by the FATF at the recent review meeting, chances of it escaping the dreaded blacklist are much brighter as geopolitical considerations and some clever diplomatic moves by Islamabad might make things easier at February’s FATF plenary in Paris .

Sources at the meeting of the Asia-Pacific Group (APG) which wrapped up in Beijing on Thursday, said it was left to India to ask tough questions of Pakistan on its compliance of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) regulations. The four initial sponsors for Pakistan’s greylisting — US, UK, Germany and France — had been more demanding earlier.

According to sources, there is a definite softening of the western position on Pakistan. China has pushed to get Pakistan off the hook at the FATF and will continue to make efforts in the next meeting.

However, French diplomatic sources, when questioned about a possible softening of stance on Pakistan and terror, told TOI, “France is determined to continue combating money laundering and terror financing, and on this occasion, will objectively evaluate, without any concession, Pakistan’s actions.”

They said the meeting in Beijing “analysed Pakistan’s situation from a technical point of view”. A report on actions undertaken by Pakistan for implementing its plan of action will be presented in February, during the FATF plenary meeting in Paris. However, other sources suggested the US and the EU had moved quite a distance to accommodate Pakistan, even being critical of India’s repeated questioning of Islamabad’s compliance record.

The current desire to give Pakistan a reprieve may have its roots in the ongoing peace process in Afghanistan. The US needs Pakistan to deliver the Taliban on the peace deal, which would allow Donald Trump to bring back US troops from Afghanistan before the elections scheduled for November. This unofficial timetable has seen a renewed push on a deal with the Taliban. The latter may agree to a short “reduction of violence” as a concession. The Taliban has to agree to an intra-Afghan dialogue which it has been resisting.

For all this, Pakistan is back in favour with the US. Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi was in the US requesting assistance with the FATF — that quid pro quo may be in play. It would explain Trump’s outreach to Pakistan as well as improved US-Pakistan relations. There is little chance of Pakistan getting into the blacklist, but it is likely to stay on the greylist, perhaps with fewer restrictions, sources said. Keeping Pakistan on its side helps the US try to build some distance with China.

According to media reports from Pakistan, it would need an extra 12 votes to stay out of the greylist and in the whitelist. Pakistan, they said, was confident of securing these votes. Pakistan gets support from China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and West Asian countries .

37,['25/01/2020'],Supreme Court may ban tainted netas fighting polls,"This story is from January 25, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to examine if political parties could be restrained from fielding people with criminal background in elections while expressing concern over growing criminalisation of politics despite several orders passed by the apex court to deal with the problem.

A bench of Justices R F Nariman and S Ravindra Bhat said something needs to be done in national interest to control the problem after the Election Commission contended criminalisation of politics is going on unabated and SC’s previous verdicts have made virtually no impact.

The court asked the EC and petitioner Ashwini Upadhyay to frame a proposal in a week’s time.

The issue though remains contentious as barring a person who faces charges but has not been convicted may be seen as constitutionally questionable. However, the court has over the years considered the need to stop persons facing serious criminal charges from contesting polls.

The court was hearing a contempt petition filed by BJP leader Upadhyay for non-compliance of a 2018 SC verdict by which both the candidate and parties were mandated to publish criminal record of a candidate in newspapers and TV channels at least three times after nomination papers were filed.

At the outset, senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the Commission, told the bench that the SC’s verdict had not made any impact in controlling the problem as more than 43% of winners in 2019 Lok Sabha elections face criminal proceedings. “The better way to deal with the problem is to ask political parties why they are selecting such candidates. Winnability should not be the only criteria for selecting a candidate and they should be asked not to select people with criminal background. It would have huge impact,” Singh told the bench.

Agreeing with the EC’s contentions, the bench said, “You are right. It is a good suggestion.” Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for Upadhyay, also supported the plea of the Commission.

The bench thereafter asked both lawyers to sit together and frame a proposal in a week. It said the court will examine the proposal on the next date of hearing. “You both sit together and give us a joint proposal. Do it in a spirit of co-operation and do not treat it as adversarial litigation. Something must be done in national interest,” the bench told them.

Out of 539 winners analysed in Lok Sabha 2019, 233 MPs were found to have criminal antecedents and have declared criminal cases against themselves. However, analysts have also pointed out that politicians are named in cases by hostile governments and that a differentiation should be made as regards heinous crime. There is an increase of 44% in the number of MPs with declared criminal cases since 2009. Nearly 29% of cases relate to rape, murder, attempt to murder or crime against women.

MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das on Friday called for structural reforms and fiscal measures to activate growth, saying monetary policy has its limits.The governor identified five growth drives that could be prioritised to push growth. These are food processing industries, tourism, e-commerce, startups and efforts to become a part of the global value chain.Speaking at his alma mater, St Stephen’s College in Delhi, Das said that estimating a country’s growth potential was turning out to be a major challenge for central banks. “Nonetheless, a view has to be taken on the true nature of the slack in demand and supply-side shocks to inflation for timely use of counter cyclical policies,” he said. Estimating the country’s growth potential is crucial for a central bank as it is believed that easing credit beyond a point will be akin to pushing a string.Pointing out that the government is focusing on infrastructure spending which will augment the growth potential of the economy, Das said that states should also play an important role by enhancing capital expenditure which has high multiplier effect. His comments come days ahead of the Union Budget on February 1.“One of the major challenges for central banks is the assessment of the current economic situation.The precise estimation of key parameters such as potential output and output gaps on a real time basis is a challenging task,” said Das.He said that monetary policy worldwide was in a state of flux because of shifting trend growth in several economies, global spillover effects and disconnect between the financial cycles and business cycles in the face of supply shocks.He said the RBI was dealing with this uncertainty by constantly updating its assessment of the economy based on fresh data and survey-based forward-looking information juxtaposed with model-based estimates for policy formulation. He added that this approach had helped the RBI cut rates last year in anticipation of a slowdown.Das said that although the global experience with financial stability as an added policy objective is still unsettled, the RBI was giving due importance to it. In addition, there was a focus on financial inclusion and on promoting secured, seamless and real-time payments and settlements. “This renewed focus on financial inclusion and secured payments and settlements are not only aimed at promoting the confidence of the general public in the domestic financial system but also improving the credibility of monetary policy for price stability, inclusive growth and financial stability,” said Das.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73596917,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-68723,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/monetary-policy-has-limits-need-structural-reforms-rbi-governor/articleshow/73596663.cms

42,['25/01/2020'],Centre gives Elgar case to NIA day after Sharad Pawar presses for SIT,"File image used for representation.

MUMBAI: A day after it emerged that NCP chief Sharad Pawar had written to Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray asking him to set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the police action in the Elgar Parishad case in which nine activists were arrested by Pune police for their alleged links with the banned CPI (Maoist), the Union home ministry transferred the probe to the National Investigation Agency (NIA).This move takes the matter entirely out of the three-party Maha Vikas Aghadi government’s hands and nullifies what BJP has perceived as attempts by the new three-party alliance government in the state to dilute the case filed when Devendra Fadnavis was leading the previous BJP-Sena regime.The order signed by Union home ministry joint secretary Dharmender Kumar stated that the Centre was of the opinion that the case needed to be investigated by the NIA given the “gravity of offence” involved, the “role” of CPI (Maoist) and the imperative of unearthing the “larger pan-India conspiracy involved”. The arrested accused have been booked for sedition and waging war against the Indian government, among other sections.Section 5 of the NIA Act empowers the ministry to take over investigation of a case without permission or recommendations of the state government.The Pune police’s case was that inflammatory speeches at the December 31, 2017 Elgar Parishad in Pune allegedly funded by CPI (Maoist) contributed to caste violence at Koregaon Bhima the next day. One of the arrested activists, Rona Wilson, has been accused by the cops of having written a letter where she allegedly mentions how senior comrades have “proposed concrete steps to end Modi raj” and a plot to carry out a “Rajiv Gandhi-type incident by targeting the PM’s road-shows”.Though Sharad Pawar had alleged a frame-up and noted in his letter to Uddhav Thackeray that those arrested were “respectable citizens”, the Shiv Sena had reportedly not been enthusiastic about forming an SIT given its traditionally hawkish stance on national security issues .After Pawar wrote to Thackeray, it was expected by some constituents of the Aghadi that the CM would accept the proposal and order the setting up of an SIT headed by an IPS officer. Thackeray, however, took the view that since the probe was already in progress and two chargesheets had already been filed in a special court, it would be improper to form an SIT at such a stage. If a senior official is to be believed, the CM made no remarks on Pawar’s letter.Senior police officials too stood strongly by the investigation carried out by Pune police at a meeting to review the case convened by state home minister Anil Deshmukh and deputy CM Ajit Pawar on Thursday. According to reports, the senior cops told the ministers that admissible evidence had been gathered by Pune police. “Our people submitted admissible evidence to the team of cabinet members. At a juncture when chargesheets have been filed and framing of charges is in its final stages, it would be bad in law to entrust the case to the SIT, we told the ministers,” an official said.Sources said the police officials also told the ministers that a case, once probed by an agency, could not be given to another state agency. The Bombay high court and Supreme Court had made this clear in their orders in other cases, they said. The cops also presented the entire list of forensic evidences to Deshmukh, sources added.Among the officials present at the meeting were DGP Subodh Jaiswal, Pune police commissioner Venkatesham and then joint commissioner of police Ravindra Kadam.The NCP chief had accused the Pune police of “conspiring with the BJP for framing social workers”. Pawar wrote to Thackeray after former judge of the Bombay high court B G Kolse Patil called on him to complain of “police high-handedness”.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73597411,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-46162,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-gives-elgar-case-to-nia-day-after-sharad-pawar-presses-for-sit/articleshow/73597244.cms

44,['25/01/2020'],JNU students who haven’t registered can do so at old fee,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Jawaharlal Nehru University (File Photo)

NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Friday allowed students of Jawaharlal Nehru University who are yet to register for the ongoing winter semester to register as per the old hostel manual within a week. It also sought the varsity administration’s response to a plea of JNU Students ’ Union (JNUSU) challenging the decision to amend the hostel manual.

Justice Rajiv Shakdher directed that no late fee should be imposed on such students for late registration. The court said that for room allocation, the reserved category students shall be dealt with as per the old hostel manual — one that existed before October 28, 2019.

Senior Advocate Akhil Sibal, who appeared for the petitioners, argued that the administration took the decision without consulting any student, hence defeating the objective of the hostel manual including the views of all stakeholders whenever its provisions are changed.

The petitioners objected to the introduction of Below Poverty Line (BPL)/Economic Weaker Section (EWS) categories in the hostel manual, calling it irrational and arbitrary. They stated that there was no explanation about how such categories were to be made applicable or even identified when a “merit-cum-means scholarships” category already existed in the university.

They argued that the decision was contradictory to the March 2019 high court order acknowledging the importance of student representation in welfare committees.

Additional solicitor general Pinky Anand opposed the plea and submitted that 90% students had already registered as per the new hostel manual. To this, the court responded, “When you don’t have a choice, what do you do?”

The court then asked the university administration to engage in dialogue with the student representatives.

It also said the “government cannot get out of education” because the salaries of the institution’s contractual workers had to be paid. “The government has to fund public education. The responsibility of paying salaries (of contractual workers) cannot be on students. Someone has to find the funds,” the HC remarked.

Anand submitted that the new manual was introduced as per communications from the UGC and the ministry for human resource development.

The petition slammed the Inter Hostel Administration’s move to amend the hostel manual and allow the fee hike while urging the court to restrain the JNU administration from imposing a late fee on students registering for the winter semester.

The petition, filed by JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh and other office-bearers, challenged the minutes of the IHA meeting and jurisdiction of the high-level committee that made the fee hike recommendations. The petition wanted the court to quash the amendments, saying the “minutes of the IHA meeting also stated that mess services, sanitation services, room charges, amongst others category of charges will be increased by 10% every academic year, i.e., from the monsoon semester”.

“Amendments to the hostel manual include an increase in hostel fee, and this affect the rights of those in reserved categories vis-a-vis allocation of hostel rooms and also reduces the representation of JNUSU in the IHA amongst several other changes,” the petition said.

The room rent for students, including those in the BPL category with junior research fellowship, senior research fellowship and other equivalent scholarships or fellowships, for single and double-seater rooms has been hiked to Rs 600 and Rs 300 per month, respectively. That for BPL students for double and single-seater rooms has been increased to Rs 150 and Rs 300 per month, the plea informs the court. Earlier there was no utility and service charge but now the university will charge BPL students Rs 500 and other students Rs 1,000 for the same.

NEW DELHI: The income tax department said on Friday its searches on a “hospitality group” has led to the detection of undisclosed foreign assets of more than Rs 1,000 crore, days after it conducted searches on Bharat Hotels that owns the Lalit chain of hotels and Cargo Motors . In addition, domestic tax evasion of more than Rs 35 crore has been detected, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said in a statement that did not name any entity.

The department said that may lead to lead to consequences under the Black Money Act, 2015, as also, action under the Income-tax Act, 1961. Foreign assets include investment in a hotel in UK, immovable properties in UK and UAE and deposits with foreign banks, the tax department said, adding that further investigations are in progress. It did not name the group.

The tax department on Monday had conducted raids at the premises of Bharat Hotels chairperson and managing director Jyotsna Suri and her associates in connection with an alleged tax evasion case. Bharat Hotels operates several five-star hotels and resorts across the country and its flagship property is The Lalit in central Delhi.

Repeated calls and text messages to the group did not elicit any response till the time of going to the press.

The department had also raided the premises of Jyotsna’s brother Jayant Nanda, managing director of Cargo Motors, the largest dealer of Tata Motors ’ commercial vehicles in the country. A known name in the auto business, Nanda has dealership outlets in Delhi, Gujarat, Punjab and Rajasthan. Sources had said that eight locations were covered in the raids which continued late into the evening. The tax department did not share any details of the operation. However, sources had said transactions of the two groups, which were being probed, were related.

Jyotsna, a former chairman of industry body Ficci, has been associated with the Bharat Hotels group since 1989 and took over as CMD in 2006 after the death of her husband Lalit Suri. Lalit Suri shot into prominence because of his close links with Congress but fell out with the party. A man known for his contacts across the political spectrum, he entered Rajya Sabha from UP with support from the BJP and the SP.

The tax department said that taking forward the mission of the government against black money, particularly undisclosed foreign assets, authorities conducted searches on January 19, on this group which has been on their radar for having substantial undisclosed foreign assets. The operation covered 13 premises in the national capital region.

“The group is a leading member of the hospitality industry, running a hotel abroad and a chain of luxury hotels under a prominent brand name, situated at various locations in India,” the CBDT said.

The search operation has so far resulted in seizure of unaccounted assets valued at Rs. 24.93 crore (cash of Rs. 71.5 lakh, jewellery worth Rs.23 crore and expensive watches valued at Rs.1.2 crore), the tax department said.

“Evidence seized during the search reveals that a large amount of black money was stashed abroad by the group, through the mechanism of trusts, formed in early 1990s in tax havens,” the CDBT said.

It said such foreign holdings of the main persons have remained hidden for decades beneath complex multi layered structures, located in different countries, ensuring secrecy. Search action further revealed that one of the close relatives of the promoter family was intentionally introduced as a front to ostensibly escape the provisions of domestic tax laws.

BSF soldiers patrol the India-Bangladesh border in Dharmanagar on Friday. (PTI photo)

KOLKATA: The number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants trying to exit India through the porous land border has “increased substantially”, though it can’t be called an “exodus” as of now, according to the Border Security Force .

BSF troops along the 913-km south Bengal frontier apprehended 268 Bangladeshi nationals — nearly 90% of them going back to Bangladesh from India — in the first 23 days of 2020, BSF inspector-general (South Bengal Frontier) Y B Khurania said in Kolkata on Friday. Most of them used the international border in North 24 Parganas ’ Ghojadanga, he added.

Prodded by journalists whether this rise could be attributed to the new citizenship law, Khurania said that might be the case. “We believe that it is because of our increased vigil that fewer people from Bangladesh are trying to illegally enter India. Most of those without valid documents apprehended by us near the border were on their way out. But there seems to be no exodus-like situation,” Khurania said.

“We apprehended 1,677 Bangladeshis without valid papers in 2018 (or a daily average of 4.5) and 2,194 in 2019 (or a daily average of 6) and most of them were India-bound. But, in 2020, we have already apprehended 268 Bangladeshis (almost 12 daily) and 90% of them were returning to Bangladesh,” he added. Officials said all these figures pertained to only the 913-km south Bengal frontier (about a fourth of the total length of the India-Bangladesh border). Fewer people may have actually tried to cross over into India from Bangladesh illegally fearing detection by agencies after the passage of the CAA, they said.

The civil surgeons have been instructed to orient their health workers, stock up sufficient number of masks and form a sample collecting team to tackle any emergency situation.State surveillance officer Dr Ragani Mishra said though the virus had not been detected in India and people should not panic. She further said Union ministry of health and family welfare, in coordination with civil aviation authority, has issued advisory to all the international airports.“This virus is so new that even its incubation period is not known. Hence, it is better to take precaution and create awareness. Also, no one has come to Bihar from China recently, but students or any individual of our state staying in China can return. So, we have to be on alert,” she said.In the instructions given to the districts, civil surgeons have been told to form a district surveillance unit, a sample collecting team in each government medical college and hospital and ensure sufficient stock of masks. Mishra said the sample collected will be sent to National Institute of Virology in Pune for test.Union ministry of health and family welfare regional director (Bihar and Jharkhand) Dr Kailash Kumar said Gaya airport authorities have been instructed in this regard.There are daily flights from Gaya to Bangkok and Yangon till March-April, three flights in a week to Paro from December to February or extended up to March and one weekly flight to Hanoi from October to March.“Airport authorities have been told to distribute pamphlets with symptoms of the new virus. People infected with this virus suffer from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), fever and cough. They face problem in breathing because of lack of oxygen,” said Dr Kailash, recalling the 2003 SARS outbreak which had infected thousands of people and killed many.Gaya airport director Dillip Kumar said though they do not have any flight from China, still the precautions were being taken because people do come from other countries, including Singapore where one confirmed case has been reported. “One terminal manager here has been made the nodal officer. If he gets any such case, then he will report the matter to the civil surgeon. Even the cabin crew have been oriented and have been told not to take anyone on board with CoV symptoms. However, if anyone develops the symptom on a flight, the crew will inform the pilot, who will alert the air traffic controller and then to terminal manager.

A girl adds final touches to idols of Goddess Saraswati in Patna

PATNA: Artisans and sculptors are working around the clock to prepare idols of Goddess Saraswati for Basant Panchami celebrations on January 29. They are now giving final touches to their creations.

Raju Prasad, an artisan on Bailey Road , had started making Saraswati idols in November last year. He told this newspaper on Friday, “They are in high every year because of which I start making them two or three months before the festival. Since I use mud, the idols take a lot of time to dry, especially during the winter season when the weather is foggy.”

Another artisan, Prabhakar Kumar, makes use of plaster, instead of mud. He said, “My idols are lightweight and take lesser time to dry.”

Like Prabhakar, Rajesh also uses plaster. “I have made more than 100 idols. I only have to colour them now,” he said.

City students are also ready to worship Goddess Saraswati, who is the epitome of knowledge, music, art, wisdom, and learning, in their respective schools, colleges, and coaching institutes. A number of them have collected money for buying idols as well as sweets and setting up pandals.

Sajid Khan, who studies in a private college on Boring Road, said, “My friends and I have been setting up a Saraswati Puja pandal outside our college for the last two years. Since this is our last year here, we have decided to celebrate the festival on a bigger scale.”

Meanwhile, district magistrate (DM) Kumar Ravi said several artificial ponds would be made near rivers for the immersion of Saraswati idols. “The Patna Municipal Corporation has been instructed to look after the arrangements. Besides, idol makers have been told to use very less chemical colours,” the DM said.

The violence that was reported briefly by TOI on Friday left a Kolkata Police anti-rowdy squad officer injured. Eight others were also reportedly injured. A Trinamool supporter, sources said, is still being treated in a hospital. The officer, Pushpal Bhattacharya, sustained serious injuries in three fingers and had to get seven stitches. The attack on the officer prompted the Lake police to draw up a suo motu FIR on the incident. The Trinamool also submitted a complaint alleging their workers were severely assaulted and some women members were molested.

According to sources, the incident took place during BJP’s pro-CAA campaign on Rahim Ostagar Lane. The clashes were triggered after a row between rival party workers when BJP workers passed by a Trinamool party office. The clashes turned violent with a parked bike nearly being set ablaze and around eight persons of either group sustaining injuries. Police said most of these injuries were minor with only one still recuperating in a local hospital.

A senior BJP leader said, “The attack was pre-planned. Our supporters were attacked. Some are injured. The police did not accept our complaint and arrested our party workers instead. To protest against this, we gathered at the Lake police station and demonstrated. Police were then forced to accept our complaint.” However, a local Trinamool leader said, “BJP supporters instigated the clash when they were passing by our party office. They assaulted our workers and did not spare the women. We have lodged a police complaint.”

Officers said the Lake police station was sealed during the protests and additional forces had been sent there. “The situation is tense, but under control. Additional forces will be stationed there from now,” an officer said.

The cops said all complaints have been accepted.

51,['25/01/2020'],"Siemens to buy 99% in C&amp;S Electric for Rs 2,100 crore","This story is from January 25, 2020

(File photo)

MUMBAI: In what is its first M&A in India, German industrial icon Siemens has agreed to buy New Delhi-based C&S Electric for 267 million euros (Rs 2,100 crore). The purchase, subject to Competition Commission of India’s approval, has been routed through its local listed subsidiary Siemens Limited. This is also the largest domestic M&A announced this year.

Siemens Limited will acquire 99.22% from R N Khanna and his brother Ashok Khanna, the promoters of C&S Electric, and plans to make an offer to minority shareholders holding the balance 0.78%. The company intends to keep C&S Electric as a separate entity and not merge with itself in the immediate future.

The acquisition strengthens Siemens’s India position as a key supplier of low-voltage electrical products and solutions. Siemens had pioneered the switchgear market globally and in India. C&S Electric, with a turnover of Rs 1,241 crore in fiscal 2019, has more than 5,000 employees across multiple locations, including three manufacturing units in Noida, Haridwar and Guwahati.

Siemens Limited, however, will not be acquiring C&S Electric’s medium-voltage switchgear business in India as well as its China and Belgium units. This is because Siemens already has a presence in the medium voltage switchgear business and C&S Electric’s portfolio overlaps with it. “The low-voltage products complements the company’s offerings,” said Sunil Mathur, managing director & CEO, Siemens Limited.

The company’s history in India dates to 1867 when Werner von Siemens personally supervised the laying of the first telegraph line between London and Calcutta. It today has 21 factories in India, employs 10,000 people and has a revenue of Rs 13,323 crore. “Siemens’s objective has always been profitable growth. This growth has been through the organic way and hence not tapped acquisitions, until the company found an opportunity in C&S Electric,” said Mathur.

The electrical systems division is the second-largest contributor to Siemens Limited’s revenue after energy solutions. The deal, advised by Ambit and S&R Associates, comes nearly two years after French major Schneider announced plans to purchase Larsen & Toubro’s electrical and automation business in India.

Siemens Limited expects the C&S Electric transaction to be completed before the end of this year. The announcement was made after the stock market had closed. On Friday, the shares of Siemens Limited ended at Rs 1,626 on the NSE, up 2.7%.

Paytm hopes the government and the telecom regulator could use the database to stop the fraud attempts on consumers.In October, TOI reported how seven internet-based companies had come together to share data with the Reserve Bank of India, State Bank of India and other relevant stakeholders to fight rising online frauds.Along with the list of offenders, a list of SMS shortcodes was given to the authorities. SMS shortcodes are essential tools to use the company’s name falsely to fool consumers. For example, one of the most used shortcode is Pytm, mimicking Paytm. This can deceive a consumer to believe the text is coming officially from Paytm.“Telecom operators should be directed to have stringent control on the issuance of shortcodes for bulk messages to companies. There is also a need to blacklist companies permitting such SMSs to be sent,” said Paytm Payments Bank managing director & CEO Satish Gupta.In its communication to Trai, Paytm has stressed on the need to give financial institutions the authority to raise requests with telecom companies for the immediate blocking of phone numbers and shortcodes sending fraudulent SMS.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73605851,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-73829,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paytm-moves-against-fraudsters-files-fir/articleshow/73595275.cms

While transaction details were not disclosed, the new round is pegged at $100-150 million (Rs 713-1,069 crore). This will make the Sequoia-backed Pine Labs the first Indian unicorn in 2020 with a valuation of $1.5-1.6 billion, said one of the sources briefed on the deal.In a prepared statement, Pine Labs said it will work with Mastercard to deliver a range of card and real-time payments-based instalment financing at checkout — both in-store and online. The funding comes at a time when the company has been expanding its lending business with debit and credit card-based financing options for consumers in partnership with banks and merchants.It has about 1.4 lakh merchants across 4.5 lakh network points. It already offers working capital loans and the company also set up a unit called Pine Labs Finance earlier last year.

54,['25/01/2020'],Multiple fires had broken out at Raghuvir Celeum Textile Market,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Surat: It was not a single fire but multiple fires that broke out in A and C wings of Raghuvir Celeum Textile Market in Saroli on Puna-Kumbhariya Road, which ended up completely destroying about 600 shops on January 20. Fire officials say the fire could have started on second floor of a wing and on the top floor of another simultaneously. Forensic Science Laboratory experts are trying to find out how the fire started. Last year’s data shows several fire incidents occurring in textile markets in the months of January, February and March.

NV Upadhayay, deputy commissioner in-charge of fire and emergency services in Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC), said, “Contrary to general perception, there were multiple fires in the two wings of the building. Simultaneous fires atop C wing and on second floor of A wing gave a scary picture. On first day, the flames were witnessed on right side and next day, they had engulfed the left portion.”

Another senior official said some types of fire spread through AC and electrical ducts. Storage of combustible material could result in early flames while it takes take time at other places. “This incident is suspicious because just 10 days ago there was a fire in its premises. Possibility of mischief cannot be ruled out,” the officer added.

“The mystery of this fire remains unresolved. In the past too, the city has witnessed many such fires with the exact cause remaining unknown. It seems not a single fire but multiple fires that engulfed the major portions of the textile market,” Upadhayay added.

Fire and emergency services department records indicate that fire calls from textile markets almost double from January to March compared to other months of the year. “It is strange, but figures show that number of fire calls for some unknown reasons increase two-fold during the first three months of the year. Majority of these fires take place during night or early morning hours,” said Basant Pareek, chief fire officer, SMC.

55,['25/01/2020'],Guv asks state to train farmers in natural farming,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Acharya Devvrat presided over 61st AAU convocation

Vadodara/ Anand: Gujarat government should train at least 25,000 farmers in natural farming. This is what Acharya Devvrat, state governor, suggested on Friday.

Devvrat, who presided over the 16th annual convocation ceremony of Anand Agricultural University (AAU), has been advocating a shift towards natural farming.

He said Himachal Pradesh government had fixed a target to train and cover around 50,000 farmers under natural farming in the current financial year. Expressing satisfaction over the progress made by the Himachal Pradesh government in the direction of natural farming, he urged Gujarat government to start training farmers in this direction.

The governor said he had about 25 years of practical experience on chemical and organic farming but ultimately had to switch over to natural farming as it was beneficial in many ways.

“It helps in protecting our environment, improve soil fertility, decrease cost of production and improves economic condition of the farmers,” he said.

During the convocation ceremony, 99 students received gold medals while a total of 719 students were conferred with degrees. The governor, who is also chancellor of the state agriculture university, appealed to the students to remain students throughout their lives by remaining connected to farming. “Knowledge should not remain restricted to universities. Instead, it should reach the end beneficiary,” he said.

56,['25/01/2020'],"Mayor calls urgent GB, set to oppose Raut’s plan of NIT’s comeback","This story is from January 25, 2020

Nagpur: Mayor Sandip Joshi has called for an urgent special general body meeting of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) where the BJP is likely to pass a resolution opposing guardian minister Nitin Raut’s plan to put the Nagpur Improvement Trust back in charge of Gunthewari areas.

With this, the BJP, which is the ruling party in the civic body, seems to have decided to take the Maha Vikas Aghadi head-on after recent decisions which questioned the authority of the NMC. The meeting will be held in the Town Hall on Monday.

Normally, the general body is held once a month on or before 20th. A meeting has already taken place on January 20.

NMC sources told TOI that the BJP will ensure a resolution is passed for the complete dissolution of the NIT. “BJP is in majority in the house and will be able to achieve it,” they said.

The state urban development department had written a letter to municipal commissioner and NIT chairman on January 10 seeking their opinion on Raut’s plan. On the same day, municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar sought the views of the NMC town planning department.

Even before the department could come out with its views, Joshi has called for the meeting.

According to Raut, it is not mandatory on the state government to accept “the decisions taken by the NMC”. “The NMC house is a public body and can take its decision. However, the government can decide on its own too,” he said.

The state energy minster said former CM Devendra Fadnavis did not dissolve the NIT. “The agency still exists. Why didn’t the BJP not move ahead with its decision,” asked Raut.

According to Fadnavis, no city in India has two civic authorities in the same jurisdiction. “Nagpur has suffered enough due to conflict of jurisdiction. It would not be advisable to do it again,” he told TOI.

The Fadnavis government decided to dissolve the NIT last year on August 13 but never did so. The BJP government only took away the planning authority status of the NIT and made NMC the sole agency for the entire city.

The NIT continues to execute works in city even though the Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority (NMRDA) was formed with NIT officials as its members.

TOI has a copy of Raut’s letter dated January 2 to CM Uddhav Thackeray on this issue.

He writes: “NIT regularized 2,200 unauthorized layouts, 14,000 unauthorized plots and executed developmental works of over Rs700 crore in regularized areas. NIT ensured successful development of the city. NIT was carrying out process to regularize remaining unauthorized layouts and develop areas. But NMC was made planning authority of NIT areas four months ago. NMC is not having expert and experienced officials and employees. NMC did nothing in the last four months. People are upset over pending works. NIT is having no works. Therefore, it is very important to control the situation and make NIT planning authority of Gunthewari areas.”

57,['25/01/2020'],Inaccessible narrow lanes add to hazards in Ring Road textile market,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Surat: Firefighters had an easy access to Raghuvir Celeum Textile Market on Puna-Kumbhariya Road in the city. However, this wouldn’t have been the scene had the textile market been part of the markets on Ring Road. Fire safety was probably the last thing that architects had kept in mind while designing the several textile markets here.

After the Raghuvir Celeum fire incident, the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) had ordered survey of all the textile markets. After a two-day survey, the civic body has identified more than 36 textile markets, which will pose serious threats in fire fighting exercise.

The main gates leading to the more than 36 textile markets here are totally rendered inaccessible for the fire tenders as these are either too narrow or covered with cement arcs and iron grills. The 36-odd markets house thousands of shops. The situation is even worse, particularly in the textile markets located behind the Surat Textile Market (STM) on Ring Road.

These markets, which register the highest presence of traders including transport vehicles loaded with highly inflammable polyester fabric material in peak hours after 4pm on any given day on both sides of the road, are fraught with hazards.

If not for the gates, a bigger challenge for the fire department is the rampant encroachments in the corridors of the textile markets by traders and dealers. Bundles of finished and unfinished fabrics could be seen lying in the corridors and in the parking area making matters even worse.

In-charge city engineer of SMC, Jatin Desai said, “Most of the markets in Ring Road do not have proper entry gates for the fire tenders to enter during emergency. At many markets, we found that there are no separate entry and exit for people to be evacuated safely. Keeping all these parameters in mind, we have issued notices to the market managements to comply with changes within seven days.”

Majority of the markets on Ring Road are constructed 35 years ago. After Takshashila fire incident, FOSTTA has been trying hard to make necessary changes in the textile markets. It is needed that the senior officers of SMC should sit with the market managements and guide them with necessary changes.

Champalal Bothra, vice-president, FOSTTA

We are ready to comply with all fire safety norms. In fact, our market has installed fire safety system to thwart any major incident. If our gates are narrow, we are ready to widen them in accordance with norms.

Eateries with LPG cylinders pose a grave threat

Surat: If you consider the hundreds of roadside foodstalls that line up here cooking recipes of disaster using LPG cylinders on the narrow lanes of Ring Road, Salabatpura and Sahara Darwaja — the textile markets are nothing less than powder kegs waiting to explode.

Along with transport vehicles loaded with unfinished and finished fabrics, the lanes are perennially chock-a-block with merchants who come here for business. These small-time vendors have encroached upon the footpaths to sell food items, close to the textile shops where such fabric-laden tempos are parked.

At Begumwadi in Salabatpura, the entire lane is encroached by such eateries. Due to the heavy influx of people including daily wagers, customers and traders, the stall owners do brisk business.

President of Federation of Surat Textile Traders’ Association (FOSTTA), Manoj Agarwal lamented, “We are really concerned with the presence of roadside eateries in the markets using LPG cylinders. We have repeatedly urged the civic body to remove these stalls permanently, but nothing has been done so far.”

Chief fire officer (CFO), Basant Pareek said, “A blast in the LPG cylinder could invite a big fire tragedy in the textile market area. All the eateries in Begumwadi and on the Ring Road are illegal and not registered with the SMC.”

Bhairav Desai, executive engineer, Limbayat zone said that the anti-encroachment department carries out regular exercise of removing these eateries from the textile market area. “However, they reappear after a few days. We seize the carts, but we can’t seize LPG cylinder as it comes under the purview of directorate of explosives,” Desai lamented.

Desai further said that the carts seized can be kept with the department for around 50 days after which going by the policy they will have to return the carts to the owners. “Meanwhile, these owners keep spare carts and during that period, they use these to run their business,” he added.

Bengaluru: LogiNext , a software-as-a-service ( SaaS ) player focused on logistics space, has raised $39 million in a new round of funding from Steadview Capital and Tiger Global Management. The new funding values the Mumbai and Fremont, California-based startup at nearly $100 million.

The fresh funding round, which comes three and a half years after the company raised $10 million from China’s Alibaba and mobile payments major Paytm, takes its total capital raised to $50 million. “The biggest thing we did well was that we built the company in capital-efficient manner and became ebitda profitable in the last quarter. That is why we were able to command a higher multiple on the valuation,” said LogiNext founder and CEO Dhruvil Sanghvi, explaining the gap in the rounds of funding. He had set up the company along with his wife Manisha Raisighani, who is the CTO, in 2014.

With the fresh capital, LogiNext is looking to double its workforce of 125, of which 100 are in Mumbai, in the next 12 months. The startup is also looking at acquisitions of $3-5 million over the next couple of years.

LogiNext has built an end-to-end logistics management platform which helps companies in automated order management, route optimisation, and post-delivery processing and analytics, among other things. It has about 150 clients, which include companies like McDonalds, Decathlon and Singapore Post, while it is also in talks with 30 Fortune 500 companies to bring them on board as clients. While technology companies like Amazon and Uber are able to invest money to provide solutions, LogiNext’s target is traditional organisations which comprise 95% of its clients.

The new round will also see the exit of its angel investor Sanjay Mehta, who has recently set up venture firm 100X.vc. “In 2015, when we invested in LogiNext it was poised for accelerated growth, I used to call them Google for shipments & they have been true on their business plans. It is rare to see founders being able to walk the talk,” said Mehta.

PATNA: A joint team of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar police conducted raids in Arwal district on Friday in search of one Mohammad Mehmood alias Kalam for his alleged involvement in a terror funding case lodged in Gonda last year.

Mehmood (28), a resident of Motha village under Town police station in Arwal district, is also suspected to be involved in the bomb blast on a private school premises at Bangaon under Gonda district of UP on July 20 last year. Mehmood has been on the run since his name figured in the case.

The station house officer (SHO) of Arwal Town police station, Ranjeet Kumar Vats, said a police team led by RPF inspector Praveen Kumar sought cooperation for carrying out a raid on Mehmood’s village. “We cooperated with the UP police team in the operation,” he told this newspaper over phone.

According to police sources, the members of the raiding team, which consisted of RPF, vigilance and IT cell of UP police, quizzed the family members of Mehmood. A warrant of arrest is pending against him for having his close connections with those involved in terror funding from the UAE.

Mehmood’s name figured during interrogation of a suspect — Shahil Khan alias Md Ali — who was arrested from Bunkar Colony near Romania at Varanasi in August 2019. Shahil’s close aide Rasheed Ahmad, a resident of Ramgarh Dargah Sharif, was later arrested from Chunar in Mirzapur district.

“No incriminating documents were recovered from the house of Mehmood,” SHO Vats said, adding that the UP police returned after executing the warrant of arrest. The SHO, however, clarified that no case was pending against Mehmood in Arwal district.

Authoritative sources said gelatin rods and dynamites were used to blow up the boundary wall of Bright Future Public School in Gonda through remote control system on July 20 last year. “The investigating officers were taken aback by the latest technology used by the terror suspects in the incident,” a member of the visiting UP police team said.

An FIR was lodged on the statement of Shamsher Ahmad, stated to be the founder of the school. Detonator rods, gelatins, electric wire, battery boxes and a bag were seized from the spot.

In the first such case, M S Kotwal, the in-charge inspector of Khokhra, on Thursday detained an alleged loan shark, Punamchand Mangaldas Agrawal, 32, a resident of Amraiwadi, booked him under PASA and sent him to Rajkot jail.

This is the first detention of an alleged loan shark under PASA.

The city has been racked by the menace of loan-sharking. In the past month, seven such complaints have been registered at various police stations. Illegal financiers, lending money interest rates up to 40% a month have proliferated.

In some cases, borrowers have committed suicide and others have attempted suicide due to mental and physical harassment by such loan sharks.

In one case, the owner of a furniture showroom in Chandkheda, had borrowed money for his business. He had repaid about twice the principal in eight months, but the compound interest had him in a debt trap.

He wrote a suicide note with the names of the money lenders and killed himself by jumping into the Narmada canal. His motorcycle was found next to the canal in Kadi.

65,['25/01/2020'],Muda will open Urwa Market soon,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Mangaluru: The Mangaluru Urban Development Authority (Muda) will open the Urwa Market soon.

At a meeting held at the Muda office, it has been decided to open the new market complex , which was built at a cost of Rs 12.3 crore. With this, the confusion over handing over the building to Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) comes to an end.

MCC commissioner S Ajith Kumar Hegde said that the building will be opened and managed by the Muda soon. “MCC has decided not to take over the Urwa Market since it has been built by taking a loan of Rs 13 crore. It will be a burden on the MCC. Hence, the Muda has decided to open it, and we will be providing the required logistics,” Hegde said.

Though the market complex at Urwa was inaugurated on January 2019, it still remains closed due to confusion regarding its operation and management. While the then district minister of Dakshina Kannada, B Ramanath Rai, had laid the foundation stone for the market complex in 2016, the building was inaugurated by urban development minister U T Khader on January 27, 2019.

The three-storey market complex of 84,891sqft size was built at Urwa after vacating all shopkeepers three years ago. The new building has a total 122 stalls and a spacious parking area in its basement, with a capacity to park 73 cars and 40 two-wheelers. It has space for 21 fish outlets, stalls for mutton, vegetables, fruits, flowers and premises for other businesses. In addition, the complex also has space for offices and a canteen.

All shopkeepers, who were conducting business at the location, were shifted to a temporary market yard when the project was taken up in December 2016. In fact, it was the MCC’s market, and the same was handed over to Muda for development. The market was inaugurated in January this year. Though the market complex was inaugurated, all the shopkeepers are still continuing their business at the temporary market yard, since the process of auctioning is yet to be taken up.

Surat: State commissioner for micro , small and medium enterprises (MSME), Ranjeeth Kumar J , said the department has not received a single file from MSME entrepreneurs for upgradation of projects in the last one decade.

Speaking at an interactive session on MSME industry organized by Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) here on Friday, Ranjeeth Kumar said, “Gujarat has highest number of MSMEs compared to Tamil Nadu. However, MSME department has not received a single proposal from existing MSMEs in Gujarat for upgradation of projects.”

The state government is prepared to resolve the issues faced by MSME sector, but the entrepreneurs lack proper knowledge on various MSME schemes to take maximum benefits, he said.

About existing schemes in MSME sector, Ranjeeth Kumar stated that MSME facilitation council protects the rights of MSMEs. MSME unit owners can directly file complaint in the facilitation centre for disputes regarding non-payment by buyers and get justice within 45 days.

Also, there is credit guarantee trust fund where budding entrepreneurs not having property for mortgage can avail bank loan facility from the state government. Under Baba Saheb Ambedkar Yojana, state government provides 55% subsidy on construction of industrial shed on minimum of two hectares of land.

MK Ladani, general manager of district industries centre (DIC), said, “DIC has forwarded a proposal to the state government to release Rs700 crore worth of fund under various MSME schemes for Surat district till March 2020. This would further give boost to MSME sector in the district.”

SGCCI president Ketan Desai said, “South Gujarat has emerged as MSME hub. There are many MSME units in engineering, chemical, textile, textile ancillary and diamond sectors.”

67,['25/01/2020'],Dancing is her Durga-inspired cure,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Ever since that fateful July day in 2008, when she first heard the word ‘ carcinoma ’, Ananda Shankar Jayant , rode on her inner strength to fight cancer. In her ‘battle’ with the dreaded disease, the metaphor she relies on is the one of Mahishasuramardhini, of Durga , the fearless one, with 18 arms, riding a lion and the epitome of creative feminine energy.

On Friday evening at Nishagandhi Auditorium here, it was another turn for the renowned Kuchipudi and Bharathanatyam dancer, choreographer and scholar to become one with Simhanandini, the rare piece from the ritualistic repertoire of Kuchipudi revived from an artform of the 13-14th century East Godavari. Drawing the lion with her feet, she was once again making clear and positive affirmations.

The fight with breast cancer was not easy, rather quite difficult. “I felt horrible when I heard of it. I was angry, irritated. I asked my husband whether it’s the end of the road for me. He said no. I somehow pulled myself up with positivity, and my husband supported,” the Padma Shri recipient recalled.

Jayant refused to take a break from dancing even while undergoing cancer treatment. In fact, she called up her friends and relatives to tell them of her ailment. “Look, I am diagnosed with breast cancer. If you feel upset or uncomfortable, please don’t bawl in front of me,” she told them. She had a reason. Usually, people visit the ailing with a long sad face, making the patient more miserable. “I want to tell families, in case a member is going through it, try not to mollycoddle them. Instead, allow them to do what they love to do, which is what my husband did. Even during the chemo, he said, listen to your body. If it says dance, go and dance. I am there to protect and support you. But I will not stop you from doing anything,”

“Your art, your talent or your passion will be your strength. When you nourish it early in life, you will be well prepared to ride out your challenges with greater ease,” Ananda says.

Is this missing in our education? The educators and administrators should now make way for this kind of training, to give the child something to hold on to, be it art, craft or sports. “I became a cancer conqueror only because I was able to focus on my dance. Thanks to my gurus, I have been able to nurture and nourish my passion, because of which I continue,” she said.

This Hyderabad-based IRTS officer has shown to the world how to balance a career and life-long passion so successfully. What next? To upgrade her 40-year-old studio institution into an establishment like Kerala Kalamandalam. It’s her dream. To leave her legacy for the future, where even foreign students can come and learn.

“A space where they can learn mathematics and mridangam together. Many are doing it, but I want to do it in a larger scale,” she adds.

Madurai: A group of anti-CAA protesters gheraoed the vehicle of Theni MP O P Ravindranath Kumar in Cumbum late on Thursday night showing their opposition against their MP for voting in favour of the act in the parliament.

According to police sources, Ravindranath Kumar took part in a public meeting organized at Cumbum in connection with MGR’s birthday celebration. A group of protesters, mostly Muslims, had gathered in a road in Cumbum and awaited the MP’s return to show black flags.

Although the police controlled the protesters using barricades, 13 youths jumped over the barricade and blocked the MP’s convoy. As they refused to leave the place and raised slogans against the MP, police forcefully pulled the protesters away from the spot. A police officer said that 43 protesters were shifted to a hall and released later. A case was registered with the Cumbum North police station against the protesters, he said.

In response, a large number of AIADMK cadres took part in road block protests in places like Cumbum, Periyakulam and Bodinayakkanur in Theni district and Vedasandur in Dindigul district. They condemned the behaviour of anti-CAA protesters and demanded stringent action against them. They withdrew the protest after some time.

O R Ravindranath Kumar, in a statement released on Friday strongly condemned the act. “It was a preplanned and deliberate negative campaign by a group of people with vested interests,” he said.

He added that they are trying to create unrest and trigger violence in Theni district. He has also appealed people not to believe false propaganda created by miscreants.

Representative image

AGRA: Aligarh police has registered an FIR against 13 persons from a Noida-based DTH service firm, Independent TV , in connection with an alleged fraud of over Rs 400 crore by not providing services to their 15 lakh customers across the nation even after taking payment.

One of the 60 zonal distributors, Chetan Dixit in Aligarh had lodged a police complaint against 13 persons, including five directors of the company, for allegedly not providing services to around 50,000 customers in Aligarh zone since June 2019. The operator was acquired by Pantel Technologies Pvt Ltd. He also alleged that they made an attempt to kill him when he had demanded his money back.

All of the suspects have been booked under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC at Kawarsi police station.

Dixit claimed that when he contacted the company’s office bearers, they assured to re-start the services but later they stopped even responding to his calls and emails.

“When I went to meet them in their Noida office, they abused and misbehaved with me,” said Dixit, adding that they even threatened to kill him. He told TOI that he had made a payment of Rs 80 lakh, including Rs 15 lakh cash, to them.

The complainant stated in the FIR that the digital service provider had launched their services in August 2018 and their first office was located in H Block, Sector 63, which was later shifted to some other location in the same sector without informing the distributors in April 2019.

According to the Aligarh-based distributor, their customers, who had paid Rs 2,250 per connection for subscribing to the services, started facing problems after the service provider had stopped broadcasting many channels in February 2019. He alleged that they completely stopped broadcasting from June 2019, due to nonpayment to the channels subscribed for the viewers.

Independent TV was originally launched as Reliance Big TV on August 19, 2008. The service acquired 1 million subscribers within 90 days of launch, due to limited competition from other operators in the market. The service was later renamed to Reliance Digital TV . The operator was acquired by Pantel Technologies & Veecon Media in January 2018. In March 2018, the company launched a pre-booking DTH offer. The company took bookings and collected revenue from customers, but the connections were not installed.

After launching the DTH offer, the Pantel Technologies & Veecon Media group rebranded the company as Independent TV.

The company was unable to provide installation to customers, as their agreement with Star India group had expired due to nonpayment. On July 23, 2018, Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) requested Star India and Independent TV to enter into a fresh agreement within 4 weeks. The company’s services were disrupted after further payments to the Antrix Corporation were missed. Independent TV closed its services on June 12, 2019.

PATNA: More than 15 temporary structures and 19 huts in the city were razed and penalty to the tune of Rs59,800 was collected as the three-day anti-encroachment drive concluded on Friday.

PATNA: The 96th birth anniversary celebration of former CM and extremely backward caste (EBC) leader Karpoori Thakur by Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) was a low-key affair on Friday. The BJP, on the other hand, chose the occasion to criticise the Congress and RJD for “neglecting” EBC sections as far as job quota is concerned.

RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha led his party’s ‘maanav kataar’, which was formed by students on the Miller School ground here. However, barring the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) chief Mukesh Sahni, other Grand Alliance functionaries were conspicuous by their absence at the event. “These parties had their separate programmes to celebrate the day. There is no rift in the Grand Alliance,” Kushwaha said.

Meanwhile, senior BJP functionaries reminded the EBC sections of the way the Congress and RJD “neglected” their job quota interests. State BJP president Dr Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi , several ministers and MLAs also addressed the gathering.

Modi said the RJD has only three MLAs from the EBC sections compared to 12 from the BJP.

“The BJP and JD(U) together have seven Lok Sabha MPs from EBC,” the deputy CM added.

(Representative image)

MUMBAI: The Supreme Court on Friday issued a notice on a plea filed by Tata Sons, challenging a January 6 order by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The appellate tribunal had rejected an application by the Registrar of Companies-Mumbai (RoC-Mumbai) seeking removal of certain observations made in connection with the conversion of Tata Sons from a deemed public limited company into a private entity.

An SC bench, comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant, issued the notice to the parties concerned. It also said it will hear the matter along with Tata Sons’ main appeal filed against the December 18 NCLAT order that reinstated Cyrus Mistry as the chairman of the company.

It may be noted that the Supreme Court on January 10 had stayed the operation of the December 18 NCLAT verdict. Following that verdict, the RoC-Mumbai had filed an application as it found certain strictures passed by the appellate tribunal against its statutory actions unwarranted. The RoC also said these were against the principles of natural justice that require the concerned party be given an opportunity of being heard before a judgment is passed against it.

The December 18 judgment stated that the Tata Sons conversion was done in a hurried manner with the help of RoC-Mumbai, whose action was illegal.

RoC-Mumbai wanted phrases like “with the help of RoC-Mumbai” and “illegal” to be deleted from the 172-page judgment.

The NCLAT later clarified that the hurry in the judgment was referred to be on the part of Tata Sons and its board of directors to change its status and “nothing has been alleged against RoC-Mumbai”. It said that it is its finding in the judgment that the action taken by the RoC was “prejudicial“ and “oppressive” to the minority shareholders of Tata Sons, specifically to Cyrus Mistry and his family. It added “no specific mala fide action has been alleged against RoC-Mumbai”. The NCLAT then dismissed RoC-Mumbai’s application.

“Businesses go through phases and when we evaluated, this was the next step towards finding a new customer base and finding more growth opportunities,” said Nick Bloor, CEO, Triumph Motorcycles.

The vehicles will be manufactured at Bajaj Auto’s Chakan plant in Pune, which has a monthly capacity of about 1 lakh motorcycles. Bajaj Auto has earlier tied up with Austria’s KTM and Japan’s Kawasaki.

Muzaffarnagar: Samajwadi Party MLA from Kairana, Nahid Hasan, was on Friday arrested and sent to jail after a local court rejected his bail plea in connection with a cheating case filed against him last year. The MLA was booked on January 17 last year after a local, Mohammad Ali, filed a case alleging that he was cheated of Rs 80 lakh by Hasan in a land deal.

Hasan was booked under section 420 (cheating) of Indian Penal Code at Kairana police station. His lawyer Intezar Ali said, “Hasan had nothing to do with this case. We will approach high court for bail soon.”

This is not the only case that MLA Hasan is facing. His trouble started on September 9 last year after a public spat with Kairana’s sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Amit Pal Sharma when the officer stopped his SUV and asked for its papers. Later, during a probe, it turned out that the vehicle was not registered at all. Hasan was then booked for allegedly misbehaving with the government servant and driving an SUV without valid papers.

Later, district administration and police in Shamli, under which Kairana town falls, decided to dust off 11 old cases filed against the MLA and expedited probe in all of them.

80,['25/01/2020'],Nothing wrong in Rajini’s statement: Pon,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Madurai: BJP leader Pon Radhakrishnan has come to the defence of Rajinikanth by stating “Rajinikanth did not utter a word that is defaming Periyar,” adding that some political parties are inclined to play politics around the actor. Radhakrishnan was interacting with reporters at Tiruchendur in Tuticorin on Friday.

Recalling that he was at the event and also listened to the speech many times later, he felt there was nothing wrong in it but expected issues to be raised on two or three points. He said Rajinikanth only spoke highly about a magazine at the event organised by the magazine and the argument over his speech was unnecessary.

“I am surprised that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is ‘imposing’ Tamil in Delhi and the United Nations. This is contrary to the previous governments that tried to impose Hindi in Tamil Nadu. Should we condemn the imposition of Tamil in the international arena?” he asked in response to Dravida Kazhagam leader Veeramani’s allegation that Sanskrit is imposed by the Centre.

Radhakrishnan said there was nothing wrong in every party preparing themselves to fight the assembly polls independently as BJP has grown to a stature wherein only the party that has an alliance with them will form the government in Tamil Nadu in 2021. “BJP does not have the thought of leaving the AIADMK alliance,” he said in response to controversies on the alliance raised by a few AIADMK ministers.

About the delay in appointing a state president for the party in Tamil Nadu – a vacancy for nearly five months – he said that it is due to the concern of the BJP headquarters on its Tamil Nadu unit. “Not only in Tamil Nadu, but state presidents (of the party) are yet to be appointed in a few other states like Kerala, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. State presidents have been elected only in 21 States,” he said. Meanwhile, information and publicity minister Kadambur C Raju told reporters in Tuticorin that the state government will not remain a mute spectator to disturbance to law and order over the Rajinikanth – Periyar row. “We will take strong action,” he said.

Illegally parked trucks on Digha-Danapur canal road on Friday

PATNA: Commuters and residents find it difficult to pass through the two-lane road along the Digha-Danapur canal owing to long queues of trucks parked on the road.

The12.27km-long road underneath the Digha-AIIMS elevated road connects the southern and northern parts of the city along the western outskirts. Similar is the problem in other areas like Phulwarisharif and Naubatpur as well.

Agitated over the frequent snarls and disturbed vehicular movement, commuters claim that the authorities should not allow parking of heavy vehicles on main roads. They further said the alternative routes are either blocked or in very bad condition.

“Traffic snarls during morning hours on roads leading to JP Setu, Digha and other areas of the city have become a daily phenomenon. Trucks have been parked on Khagaul canal road for the last two days. The authorities haven’t done anything despite knowing about it,” said Manoj Tiwari, a resident of Mustafapur.

Vikash from Ekma in Saran district said: “I was stuck on Khagaul canal road for more than one and a half hours on Thursday morning. The vehicles were moving at a snail’s pace.”

Meanwhile, schoolchildren are also having a tough time in reaching home due to slow traffic movement in the area. “My school’s dispersal time is 2pm. It takes me an hour to reach home but now it is taking more than one and a half hours,” said Ananya of Chanakya Puri.

Vivek Sharma, who drives a private school bus in Digha area said: “Khagaul Nahar road, which is the easiest route for going to Anisabad, remains chock-a-block throughout the day. I have started taking different routes now.”

Meanwhile, senior traffic police officers said truck drivers park their vehicles in Phulwarisharif, Khagaul and Danapur areas because of unavailability of parking heavy commercial vehicles in other parts of the city.

“Chhapra-bound heavy vehicles get stuck in the city due to several reasons, including dense fog. The truck drivers fear accidents while travelling in low visibility due to foggy conditions in the early morning hours, because of which they park their vehicles in areas like Phulwarisharif and Khagaul-Danapur Canal road,” a senior Patna traffic policeman officer said.

He added: “Regular monitoring takes place on all such roads. Police officers have also been deputed to ensure hassle-free vehicular movement. Besides, trucks are parked in only one lane of the road.”

The eunuchs who were arrested on Friday

JHARGRAM: Three eunuchs were arrested after one of twin baby boys they forcibly danced with died soon after at Jhargram hospital on Friday. Villagers in Radhanagar — in Jhargram’s Silda — held them captive after the 50-day-old child, Suman, fell ill when the eunuchs were dancing with him. As Suman showed signs of collapsing, his father Chandan Khilar rushed the baby to Silda Hospital, which referred him to Jhargram Hospital, where the infant died.

The arrested trio — Rumala Mondal, Suhana Mondal and Rani Mondal — had knocked on Khilar’s house around 9.30am. Khilar’s wife Tanima had delivered the twins on December 4 and they had been at the local hospital’s neonatal care unit for a month. The family had brought the boys home just 20 days ago.

Khilar, a driver, said, “The three eunuchs got wind that we had infants in our house and knocked on our door on Friday morning. They demanded Rs 12,000 and wanted to dance with our twins. I told them I could not afford the money they were demanding. After a lot of negotiation, we agreed on Rs 2,000. I requested them to take the money and leave without dancing with our babies. But they insisted. While they were dancing, Suman fell very ill. I rushed him to our local hospital where doctors advised we take him to Jhargram Hospital. Suman passed away soon after.”

Khilar then lodged a police complaint.

His neighbours in Radhanagar had caught the three eunuchs after Khilar left for the hospital and they later turned them over to a team of officers that arrived in the village.

Jhargram SP Amit Kumar Bharat Rathore said, “We are investigating the complaint of the deceased child’s father. We have arrested the trio whom the father has accused in his complaint. They all belong to the third gender.”

VADODARA: The marriage of this woman from Shehra taluka of Panchmahal district to an army man from Navi Vadi in 2014 turned out to be a chapter in harassment and ignominy.

Not only did the in-laws harass her out of their house, but also made the woman suffer the pain of being widowed in isolation. They didn’t even inform Kanta Valand, who now stays at her parental home at Ujda village for the past one year, about the death of her husband Kamlesh Valand.

Such was their animosity that her kin had to approach the Abhayam women helpline to ensure that the ritual of breaking her bangles after her husband’s death could be performed.

Deceased Kamlesh used to work with the army and visited home only during holidays. According to Abhayam members, Kamlesh had died on January 17 after a brief illness. His last rites were performed on the next day.

According to an Abhayam member, they had reached out to Kamlesh’s family asking them to ensure that the widowhood ritual of breaking Kanta’s bangles was performed. “When we reached the place, the atmosphere was tense. We had to call Shehra police to ensure that no untoward incident took place,” said a member of the team that accompanied Kanta to Navi Vadi village for the ritual.

It was high drama when the ritual could be performed in the presence of large number of people. But soon after it was over, the team from Abhayam, along with the police left the place swiftly to avoid further friction.

Abhayam team however assured Kanta that her rights as the widow of Kamlesh would not be affected and she would get her dues.

Kolhapur: The district planning and development council on Friday decided to grant funds to develop blood separation unit in Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) limits.

The proposal seeking Rs 2 crore was pending for last six years and several assurances were made to the KMC regarding the funds. Now, the DPDC has decided to provide all the funds for the unit under the ‘innovative schemes’ category of its budget.

After a meeting of the DPDC no Friday, district guardian minister Satej Patil announced that the funds would be granted to the blood separation unit. The unit is expected to come up Firangai Talim area of the city. When the project was proposed, the KMC had sanctioned Rs 50 lakh through its own budget. However; just the civil works were carried out through the funds and the machineries were not procured and staff was not hired.

“As the cases of the vector-borne diseases such as dengue are increasing, the demand for blood components such as white blood cells and plasma is rising. Mostly, poor patients admitted in the civic hospitals cannot afford the blood components required for the treatment of such diseases. Once the unit is set up, we will be able to provide the blood components to such and other critical patients immediately,” said a senior KMC official, requesting anonymity.

At present, there are several blood banks in the city but only a handful of them have the facility of blood component separation. The modern equipment required for the separation of the blood components is costly. The KMC’s blood bank is located in the Firangai Talim dispensary itself. The preservation centre will also be developed at the separation unit.

The DPDC has approved an estimate of Rs 581 crore for the next financial year. The other works to be taken through the DPDC budget include — developing facilities for the visitors at Mahalaxmi temple, provide water bottles to the students, install fire-fighting systems in several places and install traffic signalling system in the city.

-A detailed letter from them airing their concerns has claimed that the “suggested (redevelopment) plan of the government required thoughtful conservation of many issues such as autonomy and mandate of different trusts, consensus of Ashram residents and preservation of the sanctity of the place keeping in mind the values and ethos of Gandhiji.”

The trustees include, SEWA founder Ela Bhatt, CEE Founder Kartikeya Sarabhai, Gandhi heritage committee chairman Sudershan Iyengar, former honorary president of the Crafts Council of India, Ashoke Chaterjee, and former MD Hazira LNG and Port Companies, Nitin Shukla. They have issued a public statement in this regard. The trustees have claimed that they had been invited to participate in the discussions without providing them a copy of the plan. Earlier on Friday morning, Ashram residents protested against the government’s redevelopment plan.

The trustees have said that the, “lack of formal communication with residents (of Ashram) has created anxiety , concerns and misunderstanding at many levels.” There are six trusts that operate from the Gandhi Ashram complex , which include the Gujarat Harijan Sevak Sangh, Sabarmati Harijan Ashram Trust, Gujarat Khadi-Gramudyog Mandal, Khadi Gramudyog Prayog Samiti and SAPMT.

KOLHAPUR: Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatnana (SSS) has threatened to shut down sugar mills in the district if cane in the flood-affected areas is not cut before January end.

SSS delegation led by its state president Jaindar Patil met district collector Daulat Desai and pointed out that sugar factories were not following his directive to cut sugar cane in flood-affected areas on priority basis.

Patil said that the delay in cutting sugar cane in the flood-affected areas was badly affecting its recovery, resulting in financial losses. He told Desai that the farmers in the district faced severe crisis, especially during floods and unseasonal rain at a time when government schemes were not implemented for them.

Soon after, Desai contacted officials of sugar commissionerate to address the problem. Sugar commissioner office said that a meeting of all stakeholders would be held next week to address the issue. Desai promised the delegation that sugar factories which failed to comply with the directives will face legal action.

In November last year, the collector had issued an order stating that the cane cutting exercise in flood-affected areas should be given priority and that the activity must be completed by January 21. However, farmers have been complaining that their cane still lies in the fields without being cut.

Majority of the cane growing talukas were badly hit during floods last year as the standing crop was completely submerged underwater for more than a month.

Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath

BAREILLY: The father of a biker who allegedly died in a road accident has written to Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath , requesting him to order a probe into the circumstances of his son’s death.

The deceased’s father, Pintu Rastogi, claimed that his son, Deepu (25), was alive two hours after doctors had declared him “dead”. He claimed he went to the mortuary and found his son was breathing. Precious time was wasted by government hospital doctors in failing to diagnose his son’s condition and he died on way to a private hospital. He accused the emergency medical officer on duty at the district hospital of negligence, resulting in his son’s death. The CMO has denied the allegations leveled by the man.

Speaking with TOI, Rastogi said his son used to run a confectionary shop in Sheeshgarh town and met with an accident on Baigul bridge. “He was brought to hospital by Dial 112 team but the doctor on duty did not even bother to remove his helmet to check his condition,” he alleged. The bereaved man claimed that the doctor concerned declared him “brought dead on a junior’s advice”.

It took Rastogi two hours to reach the hospital. He went to the mortuary. “I found that my son was alive and all the staff in the hospital also witnessed the same. The doctor wasted crucial two hours and even kept my son in the freezer, which led to his death. I have shot videos of the entire incident and have lodged a complaint with the CM, local police and DM. I am waiting for their response.”

Chief medical officer, Bareilly , Vineet Shukla told TOI, “We are yet to receive any official complaint from the deceased’s father and will take appropriate action on the basis of evidence. However, I had conducted a preliminary investigation in this case earlier but didn’t find any truth in the allegations leveled by the man. The patient was brought dead to hospital.”

When TOI contacted SP (crime) RK Bhartiya, he said, “Police can file an FIR against the government doctor when a probe is completed by a panel of doctors and they recommend action against the doctor on duty. Since the complaint is out of our jurisdiction, we advised him to contact the health department and complain there.”

Madurai: Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association has condemned the participation of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro as chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi. Association state president N Palanisamy, Tamil Nadu farmers association secretary K Rajendran and others said Brazil had complained to World Trade Organisation (WTO) against the facilities and subsidies being provided to sugarcane farmers in India. Hence the invitation extended to Bolsonaro has caused anguish to them.

The farmers’ leaders said Brazil cited WTO rules to show that the Indian government was extending many facilities in violation of them. This has caused concern among sugarcane farmers in India. ``If WTO takes a stand in support of Brazil, India will have to change its trade rules which would affect farmers more,’’ Palanisamy said. At a time when sugarcane farmers countrywide are seeking more subsidies, they feared that the Brazilian government’s move may rob them of the existing subsidies.

They alleged that like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Bolsonaro too was a supporter of corporate firms and had opened the doors to them to rob the resources in the Amazon forests. Sugarcane farmers throughout the country would conduct a protest against Bolsonaro’s visit. In Madurai, they have decided to stage a demonstration in front of the Alanganallur sugar mill against Jair Bolsonaro’s visit and also demanding their pending dues to the tune of nearly Rs 20 crore.

AHMEDABAD: An insurance agent on Thursday filed a complaint with the Sector 21 police station in Gandhinagar stating that he has been duped of Rs 120,500 through online transactions by two fraudsters. The complainant was apparently targeted while he attempted to secure a franchise of a fuel retail station from a large company, according to the FIR.

Kirtikumar Mehta, 56, a resident of Vastunirman Society in Gandhinagar’s Sector 22 and a native of Santalpur in Patan, stated in his complaint that on December 26, 2019, he had sent a request on the website of “Essar Petroleum” to set up a petrol pump at his native place. The two fraudsters allegedly stole the details online and falsely claimed that they were the executives of the company.

“Mehta had filled up an online form on a website and has added his email address,” the FIR said. “On January 1, 2020, he received an email from the email id ‘essarpetrolpumps.org’ in which he was asked to pay Rs 35,500 to register with the company.”

On January 3, Mehta paid the amount through RTGS (real time gross settlement). On January 4, he received an email asking him to pay a licence fee of Rs 85,000 and he paid the amount. Seven days later, a person identifying himself as Arun Jayaswal called Mehta and informed him that he would not need to pay any other fees. But on January 13, a man identifying himself as Mukesh Khurana asked Mehta to pay Rs 2.20 lakh more as deposit. Later, Jayaswal called Mehta and told him to pay the amount.

But as Mehta became suspicious, he approached the area manager of Essar in Patan who told him to contact the company’s Ahmedabad office. Two officials of the company in Ahmedabad — Chirag Rana and Diptesh Mathur —told Mehta that he had been cheated. The officials also told him that they had received four such complaints.

After acquiring Essar Oil in 2017, a consortium of companies led by Russia’s Rosneft renamed Essar Oil as Nayara Energy. However, it continues to operate its fuel retailing network under the brand name of ‘Essar’. “We are not aware of this particular incident. Our on-boarding process follows stringent protocols and processes for awarding dealership. As the fastest-growing pan-India private fuel retail network, we proactively inform those desirous to be our franchisee about our best practices and caution them about unauthorised persons/company/websites that can lead to defrauding and cheating. To this effect, we have alerted the general public by issuing a caution notice that is also available on our website,” said a company spokesperson of Nayara Energy.

Nagpur: Local leaders of two political parties have been booked recently for fraud and extortion. A senior woman leader, representing a political party in power, was arrested by Bajaj Nagar police on January 21 for siphoning off almost Rs11 lakh in the name of a car loan from a private financial institute. Another group of political party workers was booked for extortion by Pardi police on Friday, while they were trying to extort money from a betel-nut trader by threatening to ‘expose’ him.

In the first case, women unit wing leader of Prabhag 10 Savita Kadwe was arrested by Bajaj Nagar police after her involvement in a racket to dupe a financial institute in the name of car loan came to fore. Kadwe, immediately after the arrest, complained of illness and got herself admitted at hospital where she was taken for medical examination as part of arrest procedures. Cops have reserved their right to take her custody remand after discharge.

After Kadwe’s arrest, Bajaj Nagar police have also registered an offence against Swati Pawar and Swapnil Ramteke for posing as government officials to dupe the financial institute to the tune of Rs9.61 lakh.

In Friday’s incident, Zonal DCP Neelotpal cracked down on the group of political workers led by Nagesh Dedmuthe, who tried to allegedly extort Rs10,000 per month from betel traders Narendra Dahikar and Sanjay Jaiswal at Pardi. Apart from Dedmuthe, his two accomplices, Rakesh Jadhav and Vicky Meshram, too have been named in the FIR. Police are now trying to ascertain the roles of others involved with Dedmuthe.

Later in the evening, Dedmuthe too issued a press release, claiming that he was wrongly framed. Dedmuthe also said that he had alerted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and also police control room about poor quality of betel nut being stored at the godown before leaving for the place.

Dahikar, who lodged a police complaint against Dedmuthe, said the political group had barged into their godown and asked for ‘payment’ to suppress the issue of stocking bad quality betel nut, but his workers informed him. “There is nothing for which we are supposed to pay any political group that is summoning police to raid us,” he said.

It’s learnt that the cops reached the place after Dedmuthe called up the control room. As Pardi police were inquiring into the issue, DCP Neelotpal too visited the place on hearing about the so-called raid. He is learnt to have asked Pardi police to take necessary action since the political group could not explain their present there.

Sources said Dedmuthe and his gang had conducted a similar raid last week at Kalamna, where also cops were present. A press note was also issued by Dedmuthe’s outfit saying he had got the raid conducted.

Sources in the trade said some political groups are active in the city in extorting money from betel nut traders, threatening to expose them and file complaints with police and other agencies.

“The run-way expansion work is also underway and will be completed in the coming months. The additions of these new services will surely help in adding more routes to Kolhapur,” he said.

When asked about the shifting of the temple in the midst of the runway expansion work, Kataria said that it is under progress and will soon be completed.

“If everything goes well, the temple will be shifted within next week. It will be helpful for the speedy runway expansion work,” he said.

The current Kolhapur airport runway is of around 1,300m in length while after the expansion, it will be around 2,300m. After the expansion, heavy aircraft, too, will be able to land at the airport, said officials..

Tej Ghatge, airport advisory committee member, said that the current developments at the Kolhapur airport are quite important and will pave way for its future growth. The fact that the airport caters to some major destinations in the present conditions speaks volumes about its importance.

It has to be noted that the airport is going through development works worth Rs 274 crore which include 14 km compound wall, Rs 80 crore runway expansion, Rs 65 crore terminal building and air traffic control tower.

At present, the airport is served by Air Alliance, IndiGo, and TruJet on the Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Tirupati and Mumbai routes respectively. The airport is located at the Ujalaiwadi neighbourhood which is around 9 km from the city.

Madurai: Only around 36% of the students, who have enrolled in the free government National Eligibility cum Entrance Test-Under Graduate (NEET) coaching classes, have applied for the exam to be held in May this year, according to the data available so far with the district education officials.

A total of 510 Class XII students have enrolled in Madurai so far for the free government NEET coaching classes.

Out of them, only 182 students have applied for the upcoming exam. Among the 182 students, 96 students are from Tamil medium and 86 English medium. Education officials said that though it was not the final figure, the number is not expected to go beyond 50%.

“Not all students can cope with the pressure and workload to prepare for NEET as well as board exams. There is no flexibility. Preparing for NEET requires a different focus, which is in contrast to board exams. At the same time, since you cannot be assured of a seat, you have to focus on board exams too. This dilemma is making MBBS seat seem like a far-off dream,” said a government school teacher, who takes classes for NEET preparation.

Students also echoed similar concerns and said that teachers did not even encourage low and average-scoring students in Class X to take science groups.

“If I don’t succeed despite working so hard for NEET, then my whole future may get spoiled so why take risk. There are other career choices that are easier, I feel. Teachers also suggested taking arts group when I joined Class XI because it is easier,” said a government school student, who did not wished to be named.

Although coaching has started for Class XI students, too, from this year so that it is easier for them in Class XII, many students feel the coaching classes lack the structure for comprehensive preparation.

“When compared to private coaching, we are of course at a disadvantage. The faculty, too, while some are dedicated and teach really well, others are disinterested. The time for classes is also limited and there is a lot of burden that falls on us. We don’t get as many chances to practice online tests too,” said a NEET aspirant undergoing free coaching.

Sources said in all likelihood, Datke would be appointed full-time president for three years. Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis and former guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule will choose a new district president.

Names of Hingna MLA Sameer Meghe, Kamptee MLA Tekchand Sawarkar, former MLA Sudhir Parwe, district general secretary Arvind Gajbhiye and senior leader Anandrao Raut are doing the rounds. Though a source said Meghe is not keen on becoming the president.

Other than the two presidents, the three leaders will also appoint assembly constituency-wise presidents. Three names in the city have already been unanimously cleared while there were two strong claimants for the remaining three. Gadkari, Fadnavis and Bawankule met late on Friday night to finalize the names.

Poddar had resigned following party’s poor performance in the six rural seats of the district. In 2014, BJP had won five out of six seats. This time, it lost Ramtek, Umred and Katol seats. Poddar, who was party candidate from Saoner, himself lost badly.

Puducherry: Lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi has urged officials of the territorial administration to strive hard to serve all sections of people and not be bogged down due to vested interests that plot to weaken their resolve to perform their duty.

In an open letter to the officials on Friday, Bedi said she was aware that they were being ‘browbeaten time and again’.

She said the vested interests have launched attempts to overawe them or make them ineffective or compromise or reconcile or weaken their resolve in problem-solving or doubt their own capacity and capability.

She pointed out that the officials must work for the benefit of the people, who do not have the courage and capacity to raise their voice for their basic needs or do not have the capacity to make decisions due to hidden constraints. She insisted that they focus on all sections of people and not only a few.

“Several vested interests have already been broken through in Puducherry in the recent past by conscientious team members and complex situational decision making which is cleaning up the Augean stables. I am aware that it is not a pleasant situation to be in always. But that is what life is all about. But all I can say is that it was and will remain inevitable in situations, personal and professional. And in administration anywhere. Losers at times are known to become desperate when they see options close. Understand them. It’s the way of human nature. But we must remain professional. Because this is our accountability. We are here to improve matters whatever the price. This is expected of us,” she said in the letter.

She said the current situation they face will neither be the first time nor the last. “Observe and learn and perform. As long as we are upright and honest in our intention, we remain protected. We remain accountable too. Remain aware and deal as the situations arise. Observe and respond. Not react. All we are expected to do is remain professional and forthright,” she said.

She said the officials will be protected as long as they follow the laws, rules and regulations. She urged them not to feel weak while defending the rules. “Bullying in the form of harassment does not last long. It is stressful though. But that is what personal and professional training is for, to deal with such situations time to time,” she said.

A Congress MLA had earlier raised a breach of privilege issue against four officials, including the chief secretary, for releasing an advertisement to select a state election commissioner (SEC) following Bedi’s direction bypassing the government’s appointment of Balakrishnan as SEC. The privilege committee of the legislative assembly has begun a probe into the charges levelled by the MLA.

Jaipur: Commuters dependent on the private public transport had a troublesome day on Friday as vehicles varying from taxis, autos, private buses and trucks observed one day strike in the city on Friday.

Schoolchildren remained the worst-affected as at many places the school vans did not turn up to pick them up.

The strike was called by Jaipur Commercial Vahan Mahasangh, a federation of 17 different unions including auto rickshaw union, e-rickshaw union, private bus operators union and truckers union in protest of privatization of the fitness Centre by the transport department.

Since morning, the parents of school going children were in tizzy when they were informed by their carriers to drop and pick up their children on their own.

Similarly, those commuting to their offices in private buses, auto rickshaw, e-rickshaw and taxi were also been affected by the strike which invoked a mixed response.

At the Jaipur airport the travellers were affected as those who called the strike did not allow the private taxis to enter inside the airport.

“It was a successful protest in which 17 different unions participated in the strike. Those who participated included Jaipur Transport Operators Association, All Rajasthan Tourist Car Association, Pink Nagar Auto Driver Mazdoor Union, Bus Operators Association. Due to the strike, 18,000 auto rickshaws, 10,000 taxis, 4,000 buses and 5,000 trucks were not available for service,” said Anil Anand, convener of Jaipur Commercial Vahan Mahasangh

On the strike he added that fitness centre is now in the hands of private persons. “They are fleecing us and it has also enhanced corruption. We were though invited by the transport commissioner for the talks, the transport department failed to give us any amicable solution,” he added. Transporters have been objecting for shifting the Fitness centre of private vehicles on Ajmer road, which is 35 km away from the city.

DEHRADUN: During the early hours of Friday, police swooped down on hundreds of women and children, agitating for the third day against CAA and NRC at at Taj Chauraha which is being called Haldwani ’s Shaheen Bagh, and shifted them to another spot nearby, while imposing Section 144 across the town.

The protesters though claimed they will continue their protest irrespective of these actions. While the protest at Taj Chauraha, which started on Wednesday, was slated to continue till Friday, another organisation, ‘Samvidhaan Bachao Manch’ will hold a 72-hour-long protest in Haldwani from Saturday onwards.

On Friday, police had asked protesters to end their agitation, citing law and order problems. After failing to convince the crowd comprising mainly of women, along with their children, to end their 72 hour-long protest, the cops allowed them to sit at gali number 8, some 400m away from the Taj crossing.

“Does it appear we were disturbing law and order earlier, and are not doing so anymore, now that we have been moved just 400m further interior? The cops came here just to intimidate us. Since they failed, they used Section 144 to move us,” said Rukhsara Begum, 50, who is sitting on protest since Thursday morning.

According to Danish Ali, another protester, cops acted on the orders of the state government, as the protest got “huge response, both from locals and political parties.”

“From Congress MLA Indira Hridayesh to local SP and BSP leaders, many have joined our protest, which gained momentum over the last 48 hours. That’s why the administration decided to shift us. Otherwise, we were not causing any inconvenience to people,” he added.

Haldwani circle officer D C Dhaundiyal meanwhile had another version to offer.

He told TOI the protestors were shifted to gali number 8 as the number of protesters had fallen.

“By Thursday night, just a couple of women were left at the protest site, after others returned home. So we asked them to relocate,” he said, adding Section 144 was imposed on Thursday night, but only in few areas of the town.

113,['25/01/2020'],NIT should go as two planning authorities not needed: Citizens,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Nagpur: Guardian minister Nitin Raut of Congress and BJP-ruled Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) are at loggerheads over dissolution of the Nagpur Improvement Trust ( NIT ). While BJP wants to dissolve it and its chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had almost done the job, Raut wants to strengthen it further. Mayor Sandip Joshi has taken steps to scuttle Raut’s move.

Nagpurians, who were contacted by TOI, feel that NIT should go. They said that there was no need for two planning authorities in the city as it added to the confusion and led to harassment of citizens. Also, it led to double taxation for some.

Pramod Pande, president of social organization Jan Manch, said that he strongly opposed the existence of NIT. “As per the seventy-fourth constitutional amendment, there should only be one planning authority in one city. NIT, therefore, has no reason to exist. The government is strengthening it to increase corruption,” he added.

Architect Ashok Mokha also expressed similar views. “All cities across the world have only one planning authority. Nagpur is perhaps the only one that has two. Everywhere, the municipal corporation is the planning authority and so there is no doubt that the same should be the case in Nagpur,” he said.

Tejinder Singh Renu, secretary of Vidarbha Taxpayers’ Association (VTA), said that his organization had always supported moves that simplify government working. “We have been against NIT right from the beginning. A parallel authority only leads to harassment of citizens. NIT lease holders have to pay ground rent as well as property tax. If only one agency manages the city, we can have a single window system. Besides, two authorities increase administrative expenses, which are ultimately recovered from taxpayers. I urge Raut to change his stand in the interest of the city,” he further said.

Senior Congress corporator Praful Gudadhe refused to comment, saying the party’s stand would be announced in the general body meeting of NMC on Monday.

Environmentalist Shrikant Deshpande also feels that all NIT areas should be handed over to the NMC. “There is no need for parallel agencies in the city. However, NIT staff should be asked to join NMC, otherwise the exercise will be meaningless. For example, if NIT gardens are handed over to NMC but the staff is not, then how will NMC manage the gardens?” he said.

Activist Anil Wadpalliwar demanded that NIT should be immediately dissolved. “Each and every staffer is corrupt and government should initiate a CID inquiry against them. If they are transferred to NMC, they will ruin its working,” he said.

116,['25/01/2020'],Bareilly: Junior doctor dies after her blanket catches fire in hostel room,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Representative image

BAREILLY: A 24-year-old junior doctor at a city-based medical college allegedly died of burns after her blanket caught fire due to short circuit in room heater while she was asleep in her hostel room.

The incident took place late on Thursday. According to college administration, the junior doctor was sleeping when the fire quickly spread across the room. Notably, the junior doctor had a narrow escape earlier when her room heater caught fire again caused by a short circuit. However, at that time, she was awake and had doused the fire immediately.

DIG Rajesh Pandey , SSP Shailesh Pandey, SP (crime) and other senior police officers, after receiving information, arrived at the hostel premises to take stock of the situation. Police have sent the body for autopsy to ascertain the cause of her death.

The junior doctor came to Bareilly in 2014 and was interning with a medical college after completing her MBBS here. She was staying in a PG hostel inside the college campus. Late on Thursday, a student of MBBS, who was reportedly sleeping in the same room, saw the fire and promptly alerted other hostel inmates. The hostel administration then informed fire tenders and the police. The fire caught the blanket and spread quickly. The building was later evacuated.

The fire was doused by the rescue team of hostel administration, before the arrival of fire tenders and police. However, the junior doctor’s life could not be saved. Her partially burnt body was purportedly found over the heater and the other belongings in the room were badly damaged due to the fire.

The forensic experts were called to collect evidence from the room to investigate the cause of fire. Hostel inmates’ statements were also recorded. The junior doctor was awake till late at night and was with her hostel inmates, medical college sources said.

SSP Shailesh Pandey told TOI on Friday, “There was another girl in the same room who alerted the hostel administration about the fire. We are still not in a position to comment whether the junior doctor died of burn injuries, due to suffocation or any other reason. We are waiting for the autopsy report now. Her family members are on their way to the city and we are waiting for their reaction as well.”

118,['25/01/2020'],"Delhi elections 2020: Government schools pass test, colleges not in syllabus","For Aam Aadmi Party education has been a top priority.

NEW DELHI: “Yes we are doing politics over education. It is our responsibility to bring education in the purview of politics.” So said Manish Sisodia , deputy chief minister and education minister , while presenting the Delhi budget last year. For Aam Aadmi Party, education has been a top priority and it gave education the highest budgetary allocation among all sectors in the five years since forming the government in 2015.Complete coverage on Delhi electionsChanging government school education meant improving the infrastructure, beautifying schools from the outside and in the classrooms, providing educational and co-curricular facilities and installing security cameras. Where new school buildings weren’t feasible, the government added classrooms to address the problem of overcrowding and for improving the student-teacher ratio. Before all this, the effort began with 54 government schools being transformed into model ones for the rest of replicate in a phased manner. Then came the establishment of five Schools of Excellence, essentially English-medium government schools, and the setting up of 26 new schools.Neetu Bansal, who lives in Ambedkar Nagar’s J Block in south Delhi, said, “In a few years’ time, my daughter’s school has completely changed. I had moved her here from a private school, so not only is she getting better education, but I am also saving a lot of money in school fees.” Meera, waiting to pick up her daughter at another school in the same area, similarly said, “Our children love going to the school now, and teachers too have started taking extra care of their studies.” Her Class VIII daughter simply testified, “In four years, our school has transformed completely.”But it wasn’t just the school infrastructure that the government targeted. School principals and teachers were sent for training abroad, to Oxford and Cambridge universities and the IIMs in the country. It provided amenities, like tablets, to encourage digital learning. A teacher in Subhash Nagar appreciated the opportunities opened up for them, but claimed there now was increased work burden and “continuous surveillance”, the last perhaps a reference to classroom monitoring via CCTV.As part of improving the learning process, the AAP government also introduced skill improvement schemes like Chunauti and Buniyaad, meant to segregate students on the basis of their reading and writing capabilities. Educationists weren’t taken by such innovations, however, arguing that these would affect the children psychologically.The Vishwas scheme was begun to assist students of Class IX who had failed twice and were to appear for the Class X exams under CBSE’s patrachar, or correspondence, mode. In 2017, such students were shifted to the National Institute of Open Schooling. Critics, once again, carped that this was meant only to improve government school pass figures. As Anita Rampal, professor of elementary and social education at Delhi University, said, “Earlier they had the students appearing as patrachar candidates, but their broad results showed they were government students. By sending them to NIOS, they are obscuring their origin.”When Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Dufloo won the Nobel for economics this year, CM Arvind Kejriwal claimed the scheme was based on their model and said the government would continue with it. Where there was no recrimination was with regard to quality improvement, with the government showcasing this in the form of the upward trajectory in pass percentage in Class XII board results.There was wide acclaim too for two path-breaking introductions in government schools: the happiness curriculum and entrepreneurship curriculum. These not only prepare the students for life and career, but also brighten their days in school. Tina Parcha, a Class VIII student in Sangam Vihar, beamed, “This is one period for which I love going to school these days.”The hiccup was the unfilled vacancies of teacher posts and the failure to regularise the appointment of 25,000 guest teachers. In all fairness, AAP did pass a bill in the assembly for their regularisation, but it was not approved by the lieutenant governor on legal and constitutional grounds. A representative guest teacher said, “For five years now, we have been betrayed. The government claims achievements in the field of education, but we have also worked equally hard for this and yet remained uncared for.”The AAP government also scored well with people whose children study privately. Actions have been taken against private schools found violating rules, particularly with regard to fees. Model Town resident Rekha Ahuja commended the government for renovating government schools and ensuring there were no “exorbitant fee hikes in private schools”.In higher education, there has been slow progress, with no word on the 20 new degree colleges promised by AAP in its 2015 manifesto. In Najafgarh’s Mitraon, Sanjay Kumar, said, “We have seen the changes in government schools and parents in general are very happy. But for youngsters who want to study in college, it means travelling long distance every day. In the next five years, a college should come up in our constituency.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73601367,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-668223,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-schools-pass-test-colleges-not-in-syllabus/articleshow/73594984.cms

Image used for representational purpose only

BAREILLY: The postmortem report of an adult leopard which was killed in Budaun on January 12 has stated that the animal’s upper left canine and right lower canine were missing. Veterinarians said they are not sure if leopard lost its canines before or after death. Experts suspect that its one paw was cut down after it was killed.

A source at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute here, where the leopard’s carcass was sent for a postmortem, said, “The cause of death is concussion of brain and contusion in left frontal area.”

The leopard was allegedly beaten to death by a group of villagers soon after it attacked and injured a teenager and another person in a span of two hours. After killing the leopard, one of the villagers cut off a paw of the big cat. Later, it was recovered by the forest department personnel. The following day, an FIR was registered against eight named and 30-35 unidentified villagers under sections of the Wildlife Protection Act. However, no arrest has so far been made. The forest department later constituted a three-member special task force to probe the matter.

The killing of the leopard in Budaun was the third in west UP this month. One leopard each was killed in Bijnor and Moradabad .

After three leopards were killed in west UP this month, the forest department has directed staff to hold meetings with villagers and inform them where to contact them if they spot any big cat. Officials said as most of the villagers do not have details of the forest department, the information at times reaches the forest staff late and time is wasted before rescue operation can be started.

Chief conservator of forests, Rohilkhand zone, Lalit Verma said, “In the Budaun incident, the information about the presence of a leopard here reached the forest department late. We have now asked the forest staff to hold meetings with villagers and share contact details. Besides, if the foresters receive fake information about the presence of a tiger or leopard, they should probe and identify if the animal is a big cat.”

Jaipur/Ajmer: Several civil rights groups under the banner of Samvidhan Evam Loktamtra Bachoa Andolan held an anti-CAA protest march from Shaheed Smarak to the governor’s house on Friday.

The protestors including Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians gathered at the Smarak holding banners and raising slogans against the CAA .

Addressing the protest, Sawai Singh, the convenor of the protest, said people from all castes and communities are standing together against the draconian Act. “We are the defenders of the Constitution and will go to any extent saving it from the fascist forces,” said Singh.

Rizwan Ahmed, state president of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), said the protest would continue till the government rolled back its decision. “It is shameful that the Centre has no regard and respect to the sentiments of people. It is a testing time for people to restore democratic values in the nation,” said Ahmed.

A mega protest rally was organised against CCA and NRC in Ajmer which went up to the collectorate where local Muslim bodies handed over a memorandum to the President via the collector to abolish the Act.

There were hundreds of protestors shouting slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home Minister Amit Shah saying the CCA and NRC was against the Constitution.

Police force was deployed as there was some suspicion that the protest would turn violent. The rally started from Khanpura village and after the special Friday prayers, Muslims started joining the rally from Dargah region.

Protestors have been staging a protest at Dargah Bazaar every Friday.

Then came the establishment of five Schools of Excellence, essentially English-medium government schools, and the setting up of 26 new schools.Neetu Bansal, who lives in Ambedkar Nagar’s J Block in south Delhi, said, “In a few years’ time, my daughter’s school has completely changed. I had moved her here from a private school, so not only is she getting better education, but I am also saving a lot of money in school fees.” Meera, waiting to pick up her daughter at another school in the same area, similarly said, “Our children love going to the school now, and teachers too have started taking extra care of their studies.” Her Class VIII daughter simply testified, “In four years, our school has transformed completely.”But it wasn’t just the school infrastructure that the government targeted. School principals and teachers were sent for training abroad, to Oxford and Cambridge universities and the IIMs in the country. It provided amenities, like tablets, to encourage digital learning. A teacher in Subhash Nagar appreciated the opportunities opened up for them, but claimed there now was increased work burden and “continuous surveillance”, the last perhaps a reference to classroom monitoring via CCTV.As part of improving the learning process, the AAP government also introduced skill improvement schemes like Chunauti and Buniyaad, meant to segregate students on the basis of their reading and writing capabilities. Educationists weren’t taken by such innovations, however, arguing that these would affect the children psychologically.The Vishwas scheme was begun to assist students of Class IX who had failed twice and were to appear for the Class X exams under CBSE’s patrachar, or correspondence, mode. In 2017, such students were shifted to the National Institute of Open Schooling. Critics, once again, carped that this was meant only to improve government school pass figures. As Anita Rampal, professor of elementary and social education at Delhi University, said, “Earlier they had the students appearing as patrachar candidates, but their broad results showed they were government students. By sending them to NIOS, they are obscuring their origin.”When Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Dufloo won the Nobel for economics this year, CM Arvind Kejriwal claimed the scheme was based on their model and said the government would continue with it. Where there was no recrimination was with regard to quality improvement, with the government showcasing this in the form of the upward trajectory in pass percentage in Class XII board results.There was wide acclaim too for two path-breaking introductions in government schools: the happiness curriculum and entrepreneurship curriculum. These not only prepare the students for life and career, but also brighten their days in school. Tina Parcha, a Class VIII student in Sangam Vihar, beamed, “This is one period for which I love going to school these days.”The hiccup was the unfilled vacancies of teacher posts and the failure to regularise the appointment of 25,000 guest teachers. In all fairness, AAP did pass a bill in the assembly for their regularisation, but it was not approved by the lieutenant governor on legal and constitutional grounds. A representative guest teacher said, “For five years now, we have been betrayed. The government claims achievements in the field of education, but we have also worked equally hard for this and yet remained uncared for.”The AAP government also scored well with people whose children study privately. Actions have been taken against private schools found violating rules, particularly with regard to fees. Model Town resident Rekha Ahuja commended the government for renovating government schools and ensuring there were no “exorbitant fee hikes in private schools”.In higher education, there has been slow progress, with no word on the 20 new degree colleges promised by AAP in its 2015 manifesto. In Najafgarh’s Mitraon, Sanjay Kumar, said, “We have seen the changes in government schools and parents in general are very happy. But for youngsters who want to study in college, it means travelling long distance every day. In the next five years, a college should come up in our constituency.”",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73601367,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-668223,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi-assembly-elections/govt-schools-pass-test-colleges-not-in-syllabus/articleshow/73601368.cms

Jaipur: The resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) will be taken up in the assembly on Saturday. The current session is likely to be a two-day affair as the budget session will begin only after the Union budget.

The ruling Congress has decided to bring a resolution expressing its disapproval of the contentious legislation by the Centre as CAA passed by Parliament is discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional. The Congress argued that there is no provision in the Constitution to grant citizenship based on religion.

However, it likely to be acrimonious as the opposition BJP already made it clear that bringing such a resolution was uncalled for as the Supreme Court is already seized of the matter. The apex court will decide the legislation’s legality not assembly, argued the opposition.

The assembly also must ratify the Constitution (126th) Amendment extending reservation to SC and ST in Lok Sabha and state assemblies for another 10 years on Saturday. On Friday, the amendment was tabled in the House by the assembly secretary.

The house will also take up the Rajasthan Krishi Upaj Mandhi (amendment) Ordinance 2019, Rajasthan Jan Aadhaar Authority Ordinance and Rajasthan Goods and Services Taxes (amendment) Ordinance, which were tabled in the house on Friday.

Vadodara: A resident of Ajwa Road who runs an optical shop has registered a case of cheating against two persons at Sama police station. Hussain Madarwala told the police that the accused had promised him last year to make him a partner in a company they are going to start in Dubai. They took Rs 11.57 lakh from him but didn’t float the company and later refused to return the money.

According to the police, Madarwala had come in contact with Nasreen Baloochi and Neeraj Chauhan, partners in a company, last year. The accused duo told him about their plans to float a company in Dubai. They said that the proposed company would do currency trading and get into software technology for which they would require Rs 1.5 crore.

When he showed interest in investing, the duo asked him to invest Rs 50 lakh. Madarwala, however, said that he can invest only Rs 10 lakh in the proposed firm. The accused then took cash from Madarwala and also got him to sponsor their flight tickets to Dubai. They also asked Madarwala to sign on some papers and told him that the firm has been registered.

When Madarwala asked for the firm’s registration documents and the duo couldn’t produce any, he got suspicious and asked them to return his money. After the cheques they gave Madarwala bounced, he approached the police.

Chennai: Miscreants early on Friday vandalised a statue of Dravidian stalwart and social reformer Periyar E V Ramasamy at Kaliyapettai near Salavakkam in Kancheepuram district.

The right hand of the statue was found broken and there were minor cracks on the head, police said.

The incident came to light around 6.15am when a resident found the statue damaged . The defaced portions have been covered. A huge posse of policemen has been deployed at the spot. Senior police officers visited the scene and carried out a detailed investigation.

Villagers, who gathered at the scene, alleged that fans of actor Rajinikanth could be behind the incident. Some of them condemned the daring act. However, police pacified the villagers, promising action against those responsible.

Local functionaries of Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi lodged a complaint with the Salavakkam police following the incident. Police are examining CCTV camera footage in the locality and further investigations are on to trace the culprits.

The 4-ft tall statue was installed by local residents in 1988 and was inaugurated by Dravidar Kazhagam leaders.

The incident has come in the wake of organisations gearing to hold protests against Rajinikanth for his recent speech regarding the anti-superstition rally attended by Periyar in Salem in 1971. Security was also stepped up at the actor’s residence in Poes Garden here to prevent untoward incidents. Police personnel have been deployed near some other statues in Kancheepuram district.

Meanwhile, DGP J K Tripathy warned that police will take strict action against anti-social elements who vandalise statues of Periyar or those of other leaders in the state.

Muzaffarnagar: Samajwadi Party MLA from Kairana, Nahid Hasan, was on Friday arrested and sent to jail after a local court rejected his bail plea in connection with a cheating case filed against him last year. The MLA was booked on January 17, 2018 after a local, Mohammad Ali, filed a case alleging that he was cheated of Rs 80 lakh by Hasan in a land deal.

Hasan was booked under section 420 (cheating) of Indian Penal Code at Kairana police station. His lawyer Intezar Ali said, “Hasan had nothing to do with this case. We will approach high court for bail soon.”

This is not the only case that MLA Hasan is facing. His trouble started on September 9 last year after a public spat with Kairana’s sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Amit Pal Sharma when the officer stopped his SUV and asked for its papers. Later, during a probe, it turned out that the vehicle was not registered at all. Hasan was then booked for allegedly misbehaving with the government servant and driving an SUV without valid papers.

Later, district administration and police in Shamli, under which Kairana town falls, decided to dust off 11 old cases filed against the MLA and expedited probe in all of them.

JAIPUR: The BJP on Friday boycotted governor Kalraj Mishra’s speech and walked out of the assembly.

As soon as Mishra began his address, Opposition leader Gulab Chand Kataria raised objections over the session being called without prior notice of 21 days as per rules of the assembly.

Kataria said the Constitutional amendment extending reservation to SC/ ST in Lok Sabha and assemblies for another 10 years must be ratified by January 25 but the government was careless about it earlier. The session was hurriedly called when the last date of ratification was near, he said.

Kataria said the state government suddenly woke up and decided to call the session with just four days’ notice. A notice must be served 21 days before calling a session so that members can make their preparations, he said.

When the governor continued his address, Kataria announced the decision to boycott the address. BJP ally, Rashtriya Loktantrik Party MLAs, too boycotted the proceedings along with BJP MLAs.

However, there was embarrassing moment for the opposition as former speaker Kailash Meghwal refused to toe the party line.

Meghwal refused to join his party in the ‘protest’ initially. He obliged only after slips were sent to him thrice from the opposition lobby outside the House.

Meghwal said that as the Sspeaker he too had opposed the first session called by the Gehlot government without consulting him and following same rule, but the BJP did not support him then.

About Meghwal’s action, state BJP president Satish Poonia said, “Nobody is above party.”

Kapil Mishra

NEW DELHI: Police on Friday registered an FIR against BJP candidate from the Model Town assembly constituency, Kapil Mishra , under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, for allegedly trying to aggravate differences between two communities.

Complete coverage on Delhi elections

The case was filed on the directions of Delhi’s chief electoral officer, Ranbir Singh. Earlier in the day, EC issued a showcause notice to Mishra for his ‘mini-Pakistan' remarks with reference to the protests against Citizenship Amendment Act at Shaheen Bagh in south-east Delhi.

Mishra had on Thursday remarked in a tweet that the February 8 election would be a “muqabla” between India and Pakistan and followed it up with remarks that several “mini-Pakistans” had been created in Delhi and that Shaheen Bagh was being replicated all over the capital. The EC has already asked Twitter to remove his controversial tweet.

The notice, sent by the office of the returning officer of Model Town assembly constituency, where Mishra is contesting, stated that the remarks violated provisions of Model Code of Conduct and Representation of the People Act and is punishable under law. It stated that in case the reply was unsatisfactory, action would be initiated against Mishra without any further notice.

“People have occupied the streets at Shaheen Bagh. They are not allowing children to go to school and adults to office,” the BJP candidate had said. They have refused to follow Constitution and Parliament. Videos are emerging of children talking about the death of PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah. The site has virtually turned into a mini-Pakistan. It is being backed by political parties.” He had claimed that for political gains, parties were creating Shaheen Bagh-like protest centres. “In such a scenario, Hindustan will stand up against Pakistan and the assembly elections will be a contest between Hindustan and Pakistan,” Mishra had stated.

In a four-page reply, Mishra said his comments had been taken out of context and misrepresented intentionally to paint a one-sided picture for stoking differences. “My statement must be seen in the context of Pakistan’s attempt at sending their proxies to take undue advantage of the prevailing law and order situation in Delhi,” he said.

Mishra appeared to be standing by his remarks which he elaborated upon in the reply. The Shaheen Bagh protests have witnessed presence of politicians and anti-social elements who spew anti-establishment sentiments. Seditious and anti-India slogans have been raised at these protests that solely intend to disturb communal harmony and destroy peaceful co-existence, he said.

He explained in the notice that the Shaheen Bagh protest is not a Delhi-specific issue but a national one. The protests have been going on even before the Delhi assembly election was announced and these are not within the Model Town constituency.

“I have only given my general opinion on the issue and not by way of an election rally or speech. These impugned remarks should not be considered as election related statements. They thus do not fall under the ambit of the Model Code of Conduct or Representation of People Act, 1951,” Mishra stated in his reply.

He pointed out that he had neither named any caste, community, religion or linguistic group, nor did he intend to aggravate any differences to gain electoral benefit. “My statement merely refers to two countries, two entities who are not involved in any election process at the national level at present,” he said, adding that the protests are causing inconvenience to people.

Chakali Tharun

HYDERABAD: A four-year-old boy, playing near his house in the cellar of a building in Malkajgiri , died after he came under the wheels of a car of one of the residents on Friday.

The family of Chakali Tharun , the boy, had moved to Hyderabad from Wadat village in Mahbubnagar district about a month ago. Tharun’s father, Rangappa, works as a watchman at Venkat Plaza apartments in road no. 11 of Anand Bagh. Rangappa, his wife and two sons used to stay in a room in the cellar.

On Friday morning, Rangappa was away and his wife, Mahadevi, was inside the room, attending to her four-month-old younger son. Tharun had stepped out of the room to play. “As he went towards the entrance of the cellar, the car that was entering hit him. He fell on the floor and one of the tyres ran over his head,” said Malkajgiri SI P Nageswara Rao .

The boy was rushed to a hospital, where he was declared brought dead. Police identified the person driving the car as J Manohar Sudhakar, 48, a private employee and resident of the building. “The building’s gate was closed. So, Manohar Sudhakar got down from his car, opened the gate and began driving into the cellar. He did not notice the boy ahead,” said the SI.

It was on the instructions of Tharun’s uncle, Laxmaiah, that the family shifted to Anand Bagh from their native place. “After the mishap, Rangappa and Mahadevi called me. I sell fruits near their apartment. At Malkajgiri government hospital, doctors declared him brought dead. I had called them to the city and got Rangappa the watchman’s job. Had I not called them here, my nephew would have been alive,” said an inconsolable Laxmaiah. Police registered a case against Manohar Sudhakar under Section 304-a of the IPC and took him into custody.

Rioters pelting stones from a terrace in Khambhat town on Friday

VADODARA/ ANAND: An elderly man died in firing and several others were injured in communal riots that broke out in the sensitive Akbarpura area of Khambhat town of Anand district on Friday.

Though the exact trigger for the rioting was not immediately ascertained, it is suspected that it was a fall-out of some fight between two groups during Uttarayan.

Mobs from both communities resorted to heavy stone pelting at each other and nearly 10 houses and shops were set ablaze and several vehicles vandalized.

Police fired six rounds in the air and lobbed 25 tear gas shells to quell the mob, but the rioters continued to pelt stones even in the presence of cops. At least 15 cops including driver of Anand district superintendent of police (DSP) Makrand Chauhan were injured in stone pelting.

Chauhan confirmed death of Vinod Chavda, a nearly 65-year-old man, who was hit by a bullet when he boarded a rickshaw. According to sources, Chavda hailed from Pangadia village on the outskirts of Khambhat town.

“We are ascertaining whether he died of private firing or government firing,” said Chauhan.

Auto driver Mukesh Rathod, howeverm told reporters that Chavda had boarded the rickshaw from Tran Bati area. “When we were on our way to Lal Darwaja area, a bullet hit him. He died in police firing.

Chauhan said the situation was brought under control but heavy bandobast has been deployed along with constant patrolling to prevent escalation of violation.

Markets in the town closed down immediately after the clash. Till late night, the police was in the process of identifying the rioters.

This is not for the first time that Akbarpura area has been on the boil. In February last year, a petty dispute over children throwing stones at each other had snowballed into communal clashes. Police had to fire seven rounds in the air and lob 22 tear gas shells to bring the situation under control then as the rioters had damaged three vehicles and set five houses on fire leaving a cop injured. Later, 52 accused were booked and arrested.

Devotees take a holy dip in Ganga at Sangam during the Mauni Amavasya snan at Magh Mela ground on Friday

Allahabad: Before the sun rose to greet the city on Friday, Shivdulaari was already up and walking several kilometres to reach the Magh Mela ground.

Her old age no bar, the sexagenarian didn’t mind the exhaustion as she set out to take a dip in Sangam on the Mauni Amavasya snan on Friday.

“I can walk the entire day and can cover several kilometres without feeling tired, such is our belief in Maa Ganga,” said Shivdulaari, who lives in Mahi village.

Shivdulaari was among the crores of devotees who flocked to the Magh Mela ground in Allahabad on Friday to attend the third main snan. According to Hindu tradition, one can seek salvation by taking a dip in Sangam on Mauni Amavasya.

As devotees took a dip in the cold water of Ganga, chants of ‘Har har Gange’ reverberated through the air. Devotees, many from other states as well, started pouring in at the crack of dawn as the ‘muhurat’ of the snan started from 2.40am.

Many walked barefoot, some with help of sticks, while parents were seen carrying children on their shoulders to reach the ghats bank. “I walked barefoot from Allahbad Railway Station to the Mela ground to mark my belief that God is present in every inch of Sangam,” said Ashok Shivpuri, who came from Chauri Chaura in Gorakhpur.

Unlike the tradition of maintaining silence on Mauni Amavasya until a person took a dip, the Mela was abuzz with a cacophony of sounds of chants and various rituals. The air was thick with the fragrance of incense sticks as devotees not only offered prayers, but also served meals to the poor.

“I carried a five-kilogram sack of rice and pulses to distribute among the needy and poor at the Mela,” said Parvati Kumari, a native of Khadra Khurd village.

There were others who chose to serve the animals like birds and dogs at the ground. “Har jeev ko anya miley, koi bhookha na rahe ye Magh ka mahatva (No one should be go hungry, this is the importance of Magh Mela) said,” devotee Amrit Nagar, another devotee from Mahi village. The number of devotees swelled as the day proceeded and many even lost their way while negotiating their way through the rush.

NEW DELHI: Police on Friday registered an FIR against BJP candidate from the Model Town assembly constituency, Kapil Mishra , under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, for allegedly trying to aggravate differences between two communities.The case was filed on the directions of Delhi’s chief electoral officer, Ranbir Singh. Earlier in the day, EC issued a showcause notice to Mishra for his ‘mini-Pakistan' remarks with reference to the protests against Citizenship Amendment Act at Shaheen Bagh in south-east Delhi.Mishra had on Thursday remarked in a tweet that the February 8 election would be a “muqabla” between India and Pakistan and followed it up with remarks that several “mini-Pakistans” had been created in Delhi and that Shaheen Bagh was being replicated all over the capital. The EC has already asked Twitter to remove his controversial tweet.The notice, sent by the office of the returning officer of Model Town assembly constituency, where Mishra is contesting, stated that the remarks violated provisions of Model Code of Conduct and Representation of the People Act and is punishable under law. It stated that in case the reply was unsatisfactory, action would be initiated against Mishra without any further notice.“People have occupied the streets at Shaheen Bagh. They are not allowing children to go to school and adults to office,” the BJP candidate had said. They have refused to follow Constitution and Parliament. Videos are emerging of children talking about the death of PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah. The site has virtually turned into a mini-Pakistan. It is being backed by political parties.” He had claimed that for political gains, parties were creating Shaheen Bagh-like protest centres. “In such a scenario, Hindustan will stand up against Pakistan and the assembly elections will be a contest between Hindustan and Pakistan,” Mishra had stated.In a four-page reply, Mishra said his comments had been taken out of context and misrepresented intentionally to paint a one-sided picture for stoking differences. “My statement must be seen in the context of Pakistan’s attempt at sending their proxies to take undue advantage of the prevailing law and order situation in Delhi,” he said.Mishra appeared to be standing by his remarks which he elaborated upon in the reply. The Shaheen Bagh protests have witnessed presence of politicians and anti-social elements who spew anti-establishment sentiments. Seditious and anti-India slogans have been raised at these protests that solely intend to disturb communal harmony and destroy peaceful co-existence, he said.He explained in the notice that the Shaheen Bagh protest is not a Delhi-specific issue but a national one.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: A plea was filed in a Delhi court on behalf of the Nirbhaya death-row convicts on Friday seeking relevant documents from Tihar Jail authorities.

The petition, filed through advocate AP Singh, urged the court to direct the authorities concerned to provide the required information so that the curative petitions of convicts Pawan Gupta and Akshay Thakur could be filed. The plea also stated that convict Vinay Kumar Sharma’s mercy plea could not be filed as his personal diary, which was sought from the jail authorities, was not provided. “Sharma expressed desire to attach his 170-page diary to the mercy petition,” it added. Supreme Court had earlier dismissed the curative petition of Sharma and Mukesh Singh.

Seeking an “urgent” direction to the jail authorities to provide the diary, the plea stated that in the case of the other convicts, Pawan Gupta and Thakur, relevant documents, including their medical records, need to be provided. The matter is likely to be heard on January 25.

On January 7, a court said that the convicts were given “sufficient time and opportunity” to exhaust their legal remedies. It had issued fresh death warrants and direction for their hanging to take place on February 1 after President Ram Nath Kovind had rejected the mercy plea of Singh on January 17.

Nirbhaya’s mother, through her advocates Jitendra Kumar Jha and Seema Kushwaha, had filed a plea in Patiala House Courts seeking death warrants against the four men on December 13, 2018.

In its January 7 order, the court said that the convicts had either exhausted their remedies or hadn’t resorted to them despite being given sufficient time and opportunity. “In these given facts and circumstances, when reasonable time and opportunity has been afforded, there is nothing to delay passing of the order on the applications seeking issuance of death warrants,” it added.

The free assistance will help litigants who can’t afford high lawyer fee (File photo)

PUNE: Lawyers registered with Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority ( MahaRERA ) have decided to help homebuyers with free legal consultancy and representation before the tribunal from February 1.

In the logjam between builders and homebuyers, the advocates of the Bar Association-run Legal Aid Cell will assist those in need of help. The members conducted several workshops to raise awareness about the RERA Act, 2016, and MahaRERA.

The Legal Aid Cell is a natural extension of a social cause, said the secretary of the Bar Association, Anil D’Souza.

The free legal aid will help litigants, who cannot afford high lawyer fee as well as those who are not conversant with legal procedures. The petitioner will only have to pay Rs5,000 as fees to MahaRERA to file the complaint. This is in addition to the conciliation option already being offered by MahaRERA as an alternate dispute redressal (ADR) mechanism to litigants. This option is also cheaper as the buyer needs to pay just Rs1,000 as the fee.

The Bar Association is readying a list of 15-20 members, who will help assist consumers. The list will either be put up on a separate website created by the association or on the MahaRERA website.

While the first step would be to cover Mumbai, the remaining cities will be covered with the help of the association members, stated D’Souza.

With the MahaRERA seeing the highest number of project registrations at 23,795, the number of cases that have been disposed of is 7,000 as against the total 9,490 registered cases. D’Souza said although self-representation by litigants is encouraged, some litigants are unable to present their grievances in the right manner and format.

Members have noticed several anomalies in the case representation, like buyers not giving the entire data and proper information upfront in their complaint.

This information includes the exact amount paid, dates of payment, specific details in the registered agreement like date of possession and, importantly, if there is a grace period allowed in the registered agreement.

Besides, there are other terms and conditions in the registered agreement, which the flat purchasers have already agreed and signed upon. Such important details surface when the presiding/adjudicating officer interrogates the parties concerned.

“All this leads to a huge time lag and exasperates the system,” D’Souza shared.

united in dissent

Allahabad: The cold temperature — which dropped to 7.6 degrees Celsius on Friday— failed to hamper the courage of protesters gathered at Mansoor Ali Park in Roshan Bagh against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Wrapped in shawls, the protesters, most of whom were women, were seen seeking comfort from the cold while sipping on cups of tea.

Meanwhile, Allahabad police has served notices to around 30 more people for participating in the protest.

“We have served notices to around 30 persons because although the protest is peaceful, we have inputs that several unscrupulous elements have started participating in the dharna. This could disturb the peaceful atmosphere of the city,” said SP (city) Brijesh Kumar Srivastava.

Women from different groups came out of their houses to lead a small procession, which was even joined by some minors.

Many local residents flocked to the park to distribute water, snacks and food packets among the protesters who were braving the cold weather.

Ajmer: Secretary of the District Legal Aid Authority and additional district judge Shakti Singh Shekhawat on Friday said if a single girl was left uneducated, then there was no use of celebrating the National Girl Child Day.

On the occasion, rallies were organised in all the block headquarters with the message that girls should be educated.

The day was celebrated in 1,700 schools of the district, both government and private, and even in hospitals, railway stations and different departments where people took a pledge to abide by the Constitution. It was also decided to bring dropouts back to school.

Shekhawat said awareness was necessary and every child should know the child helpline number and they should use their rights against any crime in society. He added that if a girl child was safe, it proved society was safe and people were civilized. He said it was the duty of every girl child to stand for their rights. He also flagged off a rally in which hundreds of students participated under the banner of ‘save the girl child’. Such rallies were also held at Kekeri, Sarwar, Pushkar, Bijaynagar, Nasirabad, Kishangarh and Beawar.

The district legal aid authority took this as a mission in Ajmer. Member secretary of Rajasthan Legal Aid Authority Ashok Kumar Jain and district and session judge and president of the authority Anoop Kumar Saxena asked authorities to organise awareness programmes at village level with help of legal aid committees. District collector Vishwa Mohan Sharma said such programmes will bring awareness on educating girls in the district.

156,['25/01/2020'],"No additional FAR charges on 300 private schools, rules Delhi high court","This story is from January 25, 2020

Representative image

NEW DELHI: Right to education is in a position to prosper and thrive and one must bear in mind the fact that, at the end of the day, the voiceless students are the ones who are sacrificed in the tussle between the bureaucracy and the educational institutions. Delhi high court said this on Friday, when it held that private schools built on Delhi Development Authority ( DDA ) land were entitled to run senior secondary level classes without paying additional charges to the authority.

“In a welfare state, such as ours, this is unthinkable,” said Justice C Hari Shankar referring to the plight of students. The court also highlighted that it would be wise to remember that cases dealing with educational institutions had an “overwhelming element of public interest”.

Action Committee Unaided Recognised Private Schools, a society comprising around 300 such schools, had petitioned HC saying that they be allowed to run as senior secondary schools without requiring to pay additional charges. The society, which argued through advocated Amit Sibal, claimed that DDA had refused additional floor area ratio (FAR) to various primary and secondary schools despite the grant of recognition by the Directorate of Education (DoE) and Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).

The court noted that DDA had stipulated that a site, which was allotted for establishing a primary school, could not, in any circumstances, be used for setting up middle, secondary or senior secondary school.

It also came on record that the schools that had fulfilled the requisite area criteria to function as senior secondary schools were unable to do so owing to the fact that the original lease deeds executed by DDA, stipulated that the land was allotted for setting up primary or middle schools. The court noted that it had already held that schools, which were entitled to income tax exemption, would not be required to pay any charges for availing additional FAR.

The authority, through advocate Rajiv Bansal, argued that the terms of the original lease deeds executed by DDA with the petitioner schools could not be altered in order to allow them to function as senior secondary schools without paying additional charges.

Justice Shankar, however, emphasised that the right to education also stands statutorily sanctified in what came to be popularly known as the Right to Education Act. “Maximising the reach of education is therefore, not only an avowed constitutional objective but is, indeed, a treasured constitutional imperative. Every effort has to be made towards achieving this end and financial considerations of the government, though undoubtedly entitled to their due weight, have to cede place to the right to education,” added the judge.

It was noted that DDA was willing to allow additional FAR to the petitioner schools, but in case the latter desired to have its lease deeds amended, they required to pay the charges demanded by the authority. “To my mind, this stand is completely unreasonable and amounts to an attempt to take away, with the left hand, that which is given with the right,” the court said.

The authority was accordingly directed to modify the lease deeds, executed with the individual societies. “However, it is clarified that the right of the societies to run their institutions at the senior secondary level would not be conditional, or dependent, upon such modification,” the court held.

Chennai airport

CHENNAI: The government’s move to limit quantity of liquor and cigarettes purchased from duty-free shops at airports and the order waiving fee paid by oil companies for jet fuel sold to airlines could affect commercial revenue earned by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) at Chennai airport .

A new order that has exempted oil companies from paying a fee of Rs 1,000 per litre of aviation turbine fuel lifted by flights from the airport from mid-January has dealt a severe blow to the airport which is struggling to generate revenue.

Duty-free shops bring a good percentage of the total non-aeronautical revenue earned by the airport as retail shops are not a big draw among passengers.

If passengers are allowed to buy only a single one litre liquor bottle instead of two bottles, the revenue earned by duty-free shops is expected to dip by almost 50%. Sale of liquor and cigarettes constitutes more than 80% of the revenue generated by duty-free shops. The company that runs the duty-free shops pays around Rs 5crore a month to AAI.

An airport official said, “The licence fee given to the airport will become unviable if the new rule is implemented. They may have to renegotiate the fee so as to reduce it. This will cause a loss to the airport. They may ask for a cut in the fee to the extent of Rs 2crore or less if the proposal comes into effect.”

Chennai airport has two-duty free shops. One at the international terminal, which witnesses the maximum sales, and another at the domestic terminal.

The move has come at a time when private airport operators and AAI suggested that passengers should be allowed to buy more liquor from duty-free shops.

AAI is struggling as it controls only Chennai and Kolkata airports where it can boost non-aeronautical revenue. The scope to earn money from retail, food and beverages and duty-free shops from small airports is minimal. “It has been a struggle to promote retail business in small airports as passenger footfalls are low. At the same time, fuel charge and landing and parking charges are waived at small airports for small planes to promote regional connectivity scheme,” said an official.

A senior official said this would go against the idea of Airports Economic Regulatory Authority that higher earnings from commercial entities can be used to retain aeronautical charges such as landing and parking charges levied on airlines low.

Duty-free shops are being closed at small international airports.

Investigating officer ASI Pawan Kumar said that they had received information about the death from MY Hospital at 10.15 am. The bus driver had taken the body to hospital after a cleaning staff found him on his berth even after the bus reached the stop, said Kumar.

“The doctors declared him brought dead and the body was sent for a postmortem. The reason for death, however, couldn’t be ascertained and we are waiting for the postmortem report,” he said.

Gurjar’s mobile phone was found near his berth in the bus which helped in ascertaining his identity. Gurjar worked in a private company and had gone to Jaisalmer because of official work, he said.

He travelled from Jaisalmer to Jodhpur and boarded a bus to Indore. At 10 pm on Thursday, he told his brother over phone that he had boarded the bus and would reach Indore in the morning.

His kin was trying to contact him since morning but couldn’t connect until a bus staff member answered the call.

When asked whether he was suffering from any disease or had any family problems, Kumar said that for the time being, they had found nothing concrete.

165,['25/01/2020'],Gujarat: BJP MLA threatens to slap government officer,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Madhu Shrivastava

VADODARA: Gujarat Agro Industries Corporation (GAIC) chairman and MLA of the ruling BJP from Waghodiya, Madhu Shrivastava, finds himself in the midst of another controversy.

This time around it is over threats to slap an official of the revenue ministry and entering into a scuffle with media persons.

Even Shrivastava’s own party condemned his actions. Bharat Pandya, Gujarat BJP spokesperson said that, “We condemn Waghodiya MLA’s behaviour with media persons. Persons in public life must have control over their conduct.”

The issue revolves around a project to erect an idol of Lord Hanuman in the Mahadev Talav in Wadi in Vadodara. The project was funded by the Amit Educational and Charitable Trust (AECT). Shrivastava is a devotee of Lord Hanuman and the AECT has his blessings and his family members were involved in the project.

Shrivastava courted controversy when he tried to toe the line of Savli BJP MLA Ketan Inamdar by saying that officials were not heeding to MLAs, something that Inamdar had also said in his resignation that he subsequently withdrew after intervention of the party top brass.

The Waghodiya MLA said that he had been seeking permission for the 31feet high Hanuman Idol from the revenue department, but a secretary had been misleading minister of state for revenue Kaushik Patel sighting a Supreme Court order. He said that he had gone to look for the secretary, but could not find him. “Had I seen him, I would have slapped him,” Shrivastava said. He argued that while the party was willing to work, there were some officials who were creating problems.

The controversies did not end here, Shrivastava even pushed media persons and their cameras around on Friday when they asked him some uncomfortable questions. He even used abusive words in a fit of rage. Later, however, he argued that he was angered as they were speaking against Lord Hanuman whom he had been worshipping since 40 years.

Shrivastava had sought permission from the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) and the district collectorate for a 108feet high Hanuman idol. He subsequently decided to reduce the size of the idol. While VMC gave him permission for the idol, he had to seek permission from the state revenue department too as the idol was to be erected in a waterbody.

Work on the bridge connecting the embankments of the pond to the platform where the idol will be erected has already started. Shrivastava says he has already spent a large amount on the project. “I will be handing this over to the government,” he said.

Bhopal: The power discom officials and policemen are at loggerheads in Morena town after an additional general manager of the discom was summoned to the Kotwali police station on January 22 and held captive for over three hours and pressured to waive off electricity bill worth Rs 1.47 lakh.

After the AGM apprised senor officials, the managing director of the discom Vishesh Gadphale wrote to the state’s director general of police while the power engineers’ association met the DGP on Friday and gave a strike call in Morena on Saturday.

Kotwali police station incharge, Kaushlendra Bhadoria however denied the allegations.

AGM of MP Madhya Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company’s, Morena city circle Rajesh Singh Bhadoria while talking to TOI said, “I was in office at around 11 am when four policemen came to me saying that TI Kotwali has summoned me. When I enquired in what connection, the cops told me it was related to some power bill. I informed my senior officials and went to the police station with a colleague in the police jeep.

At the police station, I was shown a bill and the police station in-charge asked me to waive off the bill, instructing his subordinates not to let me go. On verification, it was found that the bill had already been waived in the past. Then the police station in-charge asked his colleagues to not to let me go and came up with another bill of Rs 1.47 lakh after an hour and half. On checking the details, it was known that the consumer had not paid a single month electricity bill ever since he took the connection which was informed to the SHO. Later, at around 2.30 pm, someone called the SHO, and he asked to sign a receipt of application wherein it was written that an application was given for rectification of power bill. I wrote everything that had happened on which he snatched the paper and let us go.”

“After coming out I informed senior officials about the treatment meted out and informed our association office bearers. Action should be taken against him,” he said.

Denying the allegations, SHO Kaushlendra Bhadoria told TOI, “more than a dozen employees of police lines have been receiving inflated power bills. Bills as much as Rs 1.47 lakh are generated, but despite attempts no officer was paying heed for rectification.

“So, he was summoned. He came on his own and also left the police station on his own. No one forced him. He told us that he cannot rectify without seeing records and he needs time and left the police station,” he added.

Convener of the Madhya Pradesh Vidyut Mandal Abhiyanta Sangh VKS Parihar said, “We have met the DGP and apprised him of the situation. He had assured us of appropriate action. In the meantime, we have called for a strike in Morena town on Saturday. On Sunday, the strike would be extended to Morena district if no action is taken against the police official.”

Prakash Javadekar

NEW DELHI: Referring to the ongoing sit-in at Shaheen Bagh against the Citizenship Amendment Act, Union minister and Delhi election in charge Prakash Javadekar on Friday accused Aam Aadmi Party and Congress of “poisoning” the minds of the minorities.

Complete coverage on Delhi elections

Addressing a press conference, Javadekar said it was for the people of Delhi to decide if they wanted “Jinnah wali azaadi” or “Bharat Mata ki jai”. He added that AAP and Congress were “instigating” violent protests against the CAA in Delhi.

With just two weeks to the Delhi assembly elections, the BJP leadership has sharpened the attack on the ruling AAP and Congress over the CAA and continuing protests at Shaheen Bagh. At his first public meeting since the polls have been announced, Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday targeted the two parties accusing them of instigating riots over the issue.

Javadekar said the people of Delhi should ask both AAP and Congress why did they instigate violence. “The nexus of AAP and Congress is behind the Shaheen Bagh protest. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy have supported the protest,” Javadekar alleged. “They are misleading and poisoning the minds of the minorities,including children.” Javadekar asserted that CAA was not going to affect the citizenship of any Indian and blamed the other two parties for raising the bogey of the CAA and NRC to defeat BJP.

sea of humanity: Devotees throng the Magh Mela ground on Mauni Amavasya on Friday

Allahabad: Battling the chill, over one crore devotees took holy dip at the Sangam on Mauni Amavasya during the ongoing Magh Mela on Friday.

A sea of humanity had started converging at the Mela area since Thursday evening. The third snan of ongoing mela concluded peacefully amid chants of Har Har Gangey.

While devotees took holy bath, officials of district administration showered flower petals on them from a chopper.

The city recorded maximum 21 degrees Celsius and minimum of 7.6 degrees Celsius while wind speed touched a maximum of around 40kmph.

Mela Adhikari Rajnish Kumar Mishra said, “The devotees started taking holy dip since the wee hours of Friday, the auspicious muhurat of Mauni Amavasya was between 2.17am (January 24) and 3.11am (of January 25). By Friday evening, around one crore devotees had already taken bath. The number of devotees continues to rise as the Muhurat is till wee hours of January 25.”

“According to our estimate, around 1.3 crore devotees will take bath on Mauni Amavasya. We will be able to give the final estimate on Saturday morning (January 25),” he added.

Though chilly winds swept the mela area in the morning, bright sunshine in later part of the day made things easier for devotees.

Besides devotees and kalpwasis, members of Kinnar Akhara, led by its head Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, took a holy dip at sector 5. It was a picturesque view as pilgrims filled up the space around Sangam and took holy dip in specially designed ghats. The Mela administration has set up 20 ghats.

Meanwhile, devotees who had come from other states had a tough time in reaching their destination as they were stopped about 5-6 kms away from the Mela area and asked to proceed on foot.

A visitor from Gorakhpur, Nityanand Jha, who had come to take a holy dip along with his family was angry over the fact that they had to toil for nearly 10 kms given the route diversions to reach the Sangam.

“Yeh kaisa intezam hai ki Parade maidan ka pura area khaali pada tha aur hamare saadhan (conveyance) ko bahut pahle hi rok diya,” he said.

Mela police had ensured separate entry and exit routes for pilgrims and implemented diversions on roads leading to Sangam area. Police had regulated the movement of pilgrims on five pontoon bridges with each being used for entry and exit routes. At least 50 special trains and 2,500 buses were operated to deal with the rush of devotees.

“Major bathing day of Mauni Amavasya concluded peacefully and no untoward incident was reported from any sector of Magh Mela area,” said nodal police officer, Magh mela, Ashutosh Mishra.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: The first list for this year’s nursery admissions was released on Friday and the parents can register their grievances with individual schools from January 27 to February 3. The second list for the general-category aspirants will be released on February 12.

Many parents returned home disappointed in the afternoon. Sambhavi Sahni had applied in 15 schools for her daughter and was hopeful of securing at least one seat. But her daughter’s name is in the waiting list and Sahni is not sure about her next step.

The nursery admission in Delhi is held on the basis of points allotted by each school against different criteria, which can’t be discriminatory. In that list, neighbourhood — those living within 0-3km range of a school — receives the highest point.

“My daughter is part of the waiting list in most schools despite getting a good score for neighbourhood. But as she is my first child, she missed the points for certain criteria such as siblings,” said Sahni, who lives in Sector A, Vasant Kunj. There are many others like Sahni, who put in a lot of effort but have missed a seat by a few points.

For Nitin Mahajan, a resident of Greater Kailash, too, the admission has turned out to be a difficult affair. “I will let him continue at the play school and try again next year. But due to the upper-age limit, I can only try for KG class. For higher classes, the seats for general category students are fewer,” said Mahajan, who had applied in 10 schools. “This is the situation even after south Delhi having so many schools,” he added.

The admissions for the 25% reserved category section will start on Saturday. It is a centralised admission process conducted by the education department for admissions in close to 1,600 private schools.

Trichy: The survey by the city-wide inclusive sanitation (CWIS) initiative has commenced in slums through public participation to prevent open defecation. The assessment will include improvements needed in public and community toilet infrastructure and shall be shared with the Trichy Corporation to implement corrective measures to ensure public hygiene in around 260 slums in the city.

Trichy is one of four cities from India, and the only city from Tamil Nadu, to have been selected under CWIS in February 2019, a project involving multiple stakeholders including international agencies to evolve best sanitation practices.

CWIS working alongside Indian Institute of Human Settlements (IIHS) and Scope Trichy NGO has selected Anna Nagar, RMS Colony, in ward 39 for the first assessment exercise. The slum has a population of 500 and 100 households. Through participatory appraisals such as group discussion, transect walking and social mapping, Anna Nagar was studied by CWIS for two days since Wednesday.

“We encouraged the families in Anna Nagar slum to map their locality with Kolam powders for locating community toilet, vacant land and open defecation prone areas. Such participation will sensitise slum-dwellers to be on vigil against open defecation,” said Yohananthan S, senior associate (practice), IIHS.

Social mapping of Anna Nagar slum in front of Sellmuthu Mariamman temple has also revealed the need to equip houses with individual toilets using subsidy from the individual household latrine scheme. The field study covered the availability of water resources in the community toilet.

During the study, CWIS Trichy found out that septic tank (containment) in the community toilet in Anna Nagar is getting filled frequently. “Corrective measures are required in the septic tank or the soak pit of the community toilet. We will intimate the local body to overhaul the toilet’s infrastructure,” Yohananthan added.

CWIS sources said that such need assessment exercise will be gradually extended to all the notified and unnotified slums in the city in coming months to ensure public hygiene in slums.

Kanpur: Pronouncement of judgment in Behmai massacre case was once again postponed on Friday in view of work boycott by lawyers.

The special court has now listed the matter for January 30.

According to district government counsel Rajeev Porwal, hearing was adjourned in the case as advocates are not participating in court proceedings in protest against an order of district judiciary.

“Advocates have no chambers on the premises of Kanpur Dehat court. They sit in corridor or verandah of the court to perform legal work. Recently, the judge asked them to vacate the corridor and verandah after which the court staff seized chairs and tables of some advocates,” Porwal told TOI.

He said advocates were protesting against that decision since Thursday and were not allowing anyone to enter the courtroom.

Earlier on January 18, the court had postponed the matter to January 24 as the case diary was found missing. The judicial officer had sought explanation from the clerk concerned and had asked him to find the case diary and place it in the case file.

Prior to this, on January 6, the court had fixed January 18 for delivery of judgment and January 16 for submission of ruling by the defense.

Though the case was lodged against three dozen people, including bandit Phoolan Devi, hearing is presently being heard against four dacoits —Posa, Bheekha, Vishwanath alias Krishna Kumar alias Putani and Shyam Sundar. Four dacoits are absconding and remaining, including Phoolan Devi, have died or killed in police encounters.

On February 14, 1981, Phoolan Devi, with the help of four gangs led by Ram Autar, Mustaqueem, Ram Kesh and Lalloo, raided Behmai village to avenge alleged sexual violence perpetrated on her by men of Thakur caste who dominated the village and shot 20 people.

Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh STF on Friday registered three more FIRs related to Vyapam scam. Cases have been registered against three doctors of Gandhi Medical College Bhopal.

Accused have been identified as Shiv Singh, Pankaj Kumar and Sunil Sonkar. All three have been accused of using unfair means in the PMT-2009 and 2010. This agency has registered 13 cases related to the infamous scam so far.

Vyapam whistle-blowers say that STF should look into the larger conspiracy angle in this scam. Ashish Chaturvedi, claims no action has been taken so far on his complaint seeking police investigations into a missing laptop, which he says had considerable evidence against top political leaders.

Chaturvedi said this laptop belonged to accused Nitin Mohindra and was deliberately concealed by the then crime branch officials. They had lodged a formal complaint about this laptop with the Sanyogitaganj police.

“I am surprised as to why everyone is silent on this matter. STF should look into the laptop if they are serious about Vyapam scam,” he said. Madhya Pradesh STF had started investigations into the 1,200 pending Vyapam complaints that haven’t been taken up by the CBI, starting with notices to the whistle-blowers.

Chaturvedi and Indore-based whistle-blower Dr Anand Rai were summoned by the agency with documents relevant to around 150 complaints of the Vyapam ‘scam’. These were filed with the agency in the last four to five years.

Indore: Indore has scored maximum marks on national level in a climate rankings survey conducted by Union ministry of housing and urban affairs about a year ago. The survey showcases initiatives taken by Smart Cities to ensure sustainable development and a green future.

Results of this survey were made online on Friday. “Out of 1000, Indore has scored 570.55 marks on national level, while Thane and Surat scored 479.80 marks 447.20 marks respectively,” Indore Smart City Development Limited (ISCDL)’s chief executive officer Sandeep Soni told TOI. Soni said that government conducted this survey on different indicators of all 100 Smart Cities across country in January last year.

“The government collected data from different departments on basis of various indicators and the data was analyzed for about a year only after which this score-sheet has been released,” said Soni.

“This was for the first time when government has conducted this kind of a survey, but it has not given any rankings to avoid discouraging non-performing cities,” he claimed. This survey was conducted on indicators like energy and green buildings, urban planning, green cover and biodiversity, mobility and air, water resource management and waste management. Each of these indicators comprised marks ranging from 100 to 300.

Indore has been positioned among top-three cities in four of these indicators except water resource management.

“This survey is meant to make cities aware about climate resilience and climate change which would also help them understand where they stand in terms of climate impact,” officials said.

Asked about the issue, deputy CM Manish Sisodia said the protests were being organised with some demands and the home minister should talk to the protesters. “It is the job of the home minister to maintain law and order in Delhi. He should answer in case of any lapses. Unfortunately, he is busy trying to find Wi-Fi on a switched-off phone and searching for CCTV cameras. I feel he should talk to the protesters,” he added.

Sisodia’s remark stating that he stood with the protesters had triggered a controversy on Thursday following which BJP functionaries attacked him and the CM. Asked on a talk show about the absence of AAP functionaries at Shaheen Bagh, Sisodia had said he stood with the protesters, but it was beyond him to open the road closed due to the protests.

AAP has been opposing CAA from a distance and maintaining silence about Shaheen Bagh for a long time. However, Sisodia’s remarks backing the protests provided fodder to BJP, which called AAP an anti-Hindu party.

The court of chief judicial magistrate first class Bhupendra Arya had given last opportunity to be present before court to Soni by January 17. MIG police had booked Soni under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 120-B of Indian Penal Code for fraud, making fake documents and conspiracy on complaint of Ravindra Pandit in December last year.

The court had issued warrant for arrest of absconding accused under Section 73 of CrPC. But, when he couldn’t be arrested, police moved court with panchnama against absconding accused.

The court issued proclamation notice under Section 82 of IPC for Soni’s presence in the court on or before January 17. But as he failed, court on Friday issued order for attachment of his property at horizon studio apartment for his presence.

Soni had been on run since November 30, when a joint team of over 200 officers from police and six other departments conducted at the residence, hotel and bar, cafe and office and registered four cases against him under IT Act, immoral trafficking and Arms Act. Later, police booked Soni in over 56 cases including fraud, forgery of documents, human trafficking, arms act, rape case, abetment to suicide at over a dozen police stations of the city.

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Friday at a town hall that Union home minister Amit Shah must try to resolve the impasse at Shaheen Bhagh by holding talks with the protesters. About the AAP government’s stand on CAA , Kejriwal said, “We have expressed our opinions from time to time on different platforms and also in Parliament.”Asked about the issue, deputy CM Manish Sisodia said the protests were being organised with some demands and the home minister should talk to the protesters. “It is the job of the home minister to maintain law and order in Delhi. He should answer in case of any lapses. Unfortunately, he is busy trying to find Wi-Fi on a switched-off phone and searching for CCTV cameras. I feel he should talk to the protesters,” he added.Sisodia’s remark stating that he stood with the protesters had triggered a controversy on Thursday following which BJP functionaries attacked him and the CM. Asked on a talk show about the absence of AAP functionaries at Shaheen Bagh , Sisodia had said he stood with the protesters, but it was beyond him to open the road closed due to the protests.AAP has been opposing CAA from a distance and maintaining silence about Shaheen Bagh for a long time.

Mahatma Gandhi

NEW DELHI: A group of eminent citizens and activists has made a public call under the umbrella of ‘We the people of India’ to form human chains on January 30, the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi , to express solidarity with the nationwide protests against Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens .

Rajmohan Gandhi, grandson of Gandhi; Swaraj India chief Yogendra Yadav, social activist Medha Patkar and former chief election commissioner S Y Quraishi are among the people who have made the appeal for various activities on that day.

RTI activist Anjali Bhardwaj said people were coming out spontaneously to protest in public places. “Women-led protests are happening across India with 10 such protests taking place 24x7 in Delhi alone. ‘We the people of India’ is an open banner.... Anyone who shares our values can use this banner,” she said.

On January 30, human chains (Hum-Bharat Maala) will be formed from the afternoon at suitable venues, preferably with some association with Gandhi, said Bhardwaj. “The activity will end at 5.17pm, the exact time of Gandhiji’s martyrdom, by singing the national anthem,” she added.

Various individual activities such as day-long fasts and lighting of lamps/candles by families outside their houses have also been proposed under ‘Bharat Jodo’. The call has been endorsed by the working group members of All-India Coordination of over 100 protesting organisations across India. Some of the members are Jignesh Mewani, Kavita Krishnan, Umar Khalid and Yogendra Yadav.

187,['25/01/2020'],Residents plan march for opening Delhi's Kalindi Kunj road,"This story is from January 25, 2020

A group of residents met senior police officers and gave them a memorandum

NEW DELHI: Residents of Sarita Vihar are planning to carry out a protest march on February 2 from their colony to Shaheen Bagh to demand access to Kalindi Kunj road if police fail to convince the anti-CAA protesters to allow the right of way. A group of residents met senior police officers of the district and gave them a memorandum to open the stretch to traffic.

Road number 13A at Kalindi Kunj remains shut with protesters occupying both carriageways despite giving assurance that school buses and emergency vehicles would be allowed to pass. The road opposite the protest site — which was proposed to be opened for traffic at least for local residents, like what has been done near Jamia Millia Islamia — is blocked with street art.

On Friday, a group of residents met ACP Sarita Vihar Ajab Singh with a memorandum asking police to hold a dialogue with the protesters. “They must arrive at a solution by next week, otherwise we will hold a march from Sarita Vihar to Shaheen Bagh and hold the protesters accountable. It will be a non-political rally. As residents of Sarita Vihar and Jasola, we too have the right of way just like they have the right to protest,” said Gabbar Singh Chauhan, a resident of Sarita Vihar.

Ved Nagar, a social activist and a resident of Sarita Vihar, said that the decision to hold the march was taken after a court rejected a petition seeking shifting of the anti-CAA protest to another location.

The protesters claimed that they were still in the process of deciding on whether the road would be opened for commuters. In fact, the adjacent road was fortified after representatives of the protesters assured lieutenant governor Anil Baijal about opening the road to traffic.

Some of the protesters said that even if the barricades are removed, the street art, including a 40-feet metallic map of India, cannot be shifted without the help of a crane. “It would take a few days to dismantle the map since it has been welded and fixed with semi-permanent structures dug into the ground. We will not remove it until we arrive at a consensus,” said Asif, a resident of Shaheen Bagh, who was frisking people trying to enter through the barricades.

Locals said that after the meeting with the LG, the movement of two-wheelers and pedestrians was also blocked. “I was going home after picking up my son from school when I was stopped and asked to go through Madanpur Khadar. After much pleading, the protesters allowed me to go,” said a resident.

Sandeep Kumar, the member of a village panchayat, said when they met police for a resolution, the cops expressed their helplessness in dealing with the mess.

Indore: A portion of road measuring about 3 ft near Hukumchand Ghantaghar Square has started to cave-in posing threat to thousands of motorists those come from Geeta Bhawan Square. Officials seem to have no idea about the incident. Local shopkeepers of the area have raised a concern as the road remains busy most of the time with both two-wheeler and four-wheeler traffic.

“I noticed this cave-in three days ago and asked local traffic cop to place a barricade. The size of this pit is increasing day by day,” said a shopkeeper of the area.

This is for the second time when such an incident has occurred at the same site. In October 2019, a sewer chamber on the same spot had caved-in and IMC had to reconstruct the chamber, which was nearly 24ft deep and was constructed during Holkar era. This had affected vehicular movement of the area for about a week. Now, at least 3ft portion of the road at the same location has caved-in posing a threat to locals as well as commuters.

Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC)’s public works department officials had no idea about the incident until it was bought in their notice by TOI. “The cave-in seems to have occurred due to settlement of the road. A new chamber was constructed in the area, and the road was also reconstructed,” said IMC’s executive engineer NS Tomar.

“Instructions have been issued to restrict traffic, and repair the cave-in site,” he added.

Two members of the gang held the security guard captive for hours. Police station in charge Neeraj Kumar Meda said that incident happened around 2 am at Kasturba village branch of Bank of India.

The guard on duty Nand Kishore Yadav heard a sound behind the bank. He went there to check but was attacked by the gang members and became unconscious. They tied him with a rope and he remained there lying unconscious until dawn. As the sun began to rise, the thieves fled the spot, he said.

The miscreants began breaking the rear wall of the bank. They entered the bank and reached the strongroom which had Rs 50 lakh cash but failed to open it, he said.

Police found a two minute long CCTV footage of a miscreant carrying a screwdriver in his hand. The footage, however, is not clear. The thief was wearing a cap and had covered his face. “His identity couldn’t be ascertained yet. We have registered a case in the matter,” he said.

The statement of the security guard and other officials were recorded. In his statement, the guard said that he had seen two thieves, who attacked him. But he is clueless about rest of the details, he said.

Representative image

JAIPUR: A division bench of Rajasthan High Court on Friday issued notices to the state government for not giving compensation to acid attack victims in accordance with the scheme of National Legal Services Authority and not checking the sale of acids by shopkeepers without following rules.

Hearing a PIL advocating the need of framing rules and regulations to safeguard the rights and interests of acid victims and on the malpractice of selling acids without maintaining a register of buyers, the bench comprising Justice Sabina and Justice NS Dhaddha issued notices to the state government including chief secretary, secretary of department of personnel, principal secretary (home affairs), principal secretary of social justice and principal secretary of medical and health. Petitioner Shalini Sheoran, an advocate, in her petition stated that since the state government had not yet framed rules pursuant to the Poisons Act, 1919, no action has been taken to curb the sale of acids by shopkeepers without licenses.

“For selling poison, the shopkeeper should have the license and should also maintain a register of those purchasing it. Also no compensation has been given to acid attack victims,” she said.

She added that no posts are kept reserved nor been carried forward for acid attack survivors in terms of Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. “Acid attack victims should be treated as disabled and there should a separate reservation for them. Thus they are deprived of various government schemes,” she added.

“The posts for the acid attack victims need to be identified and also they are entitled to get free treatment in private hospitals and should also be made aware of it,” she added.

Bhupendrasinh Chudasama

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Friday completed hearings and reserved its order on a petition challenging the victory of state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama in the 2017 assembly elections from Dholka constituency.

Before he delivers his verdict, Justice Paresh Upadhyay asked all parties, including the Congress candidate and petitioner Ashwin Rathod and Chudasama, to supply their written submissions by February 10.

Rathod challenged Chudasama’s 327-vote victory arguing that the returning officer committed errors during the counting. He claimed that more than 400 ballot votes, were not counted and were invalidated by the returning officer, Dhaval Jani.

During the proceedings, Chudasama was rebuked by the court for his filing an affidavit in the Supreme Court in connection with this case and raising questions about the credibility of the court. The judge came down heavily on Chudasama for his lack of confidence in the judiciary, particularly since Chudasama himself is the Gujarat law minister. Another highlight of the case was the deposition of the returning officer, Jani, who admitted to various errors during counting of votes. The HC had noticed that the returning officer did not follow Election Commission of India (ECI) guidelines during the vote counting and the HC made adverse observations about the officer’s conduct. The state government had to withdraw the promotion it gave Jani because of the HC’s observations. The HC also ordered the government to take action against Jani for the alleged irregularities that came on to the court’s record.

195,['25/01/2020'],"4 controversial irri tenders worth Rs2,473cr cancelled","This story is from January 25, 2020

Nagpur: Yet another decision of the BJP regime has been reversed by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.

In the latest move, four controversial tenders worth Rs2,473 crore for building piped distribution network and lift irrigation system (LIS), under Jigaon dam project on Purna river in Buldhana district, have been cancelled. TOI had access to the cancellation order.

The tenders, issued in September 2019, were among the last decisions of the previous government. The move had drawn flak because the tenders for building distribution network and LIS, needed at a later stage, were issued even though the main head work of the dam remains to be built.

After the head work, land coming under submergence has to be acquired followed by resettlement of project affected persons (PAPs). Building distribution network and LIS comes at a much later stage, said sources. TOI had reported the matter on December 27, 2019.

The Contractors and Builders Association of Vidarbha had sent a complaint letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and water resources development (WRD) minister Jayant Patil alleging that the tenders were issued only to accommodate a group of contractors. When the fresh cost for building the dam was approved in August last year, the amount needed for the four tenders was especially included.

Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar was also under scanner for other tenders granted under this project during his tenure in the Congress-NCP government. He was later granted a clean chit in the case by anti-corruption bureau (ACB). The ACB inquiry continues against private contractors.

Pravin Mahajan, president of contractors’ association, said apart from Thackeray and Patil, he had written letters to the WRD secretary IS Chahal, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Girish Mahajan, WRD minister in previous government, too.

“It is not that the distribution network and LIS will not be needed, but the works need to be taken stage wise. At this stage, acquisition of majority of land coming under submergence remains to be done. After that the PAPs have to be rehabilitated. The question of distribution network and LIS comes later,” he said.

“The hurry in clearing the tender proposals has been apparent. In a single day, on September 3, 2019, the cases were cleared from the level of executive engineer, superintending engineer, and then by chief engineer. For clearing the papers, at least 1,000 pages need to be gone through first, which could curiously happen in one day in this case,” said Mahajan. The point has been mentioned in the complaint letter filed by him, he said.

Mahajan said the association has suggested that works should be split so that it is not blocked up if a single contractor gets a chunk of order. Instead of engineering procurement and contract (EPC) tenders, Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation should issue B1 type tenders in which the contractor has to only take up work implementation, having no say in design.

The Jigaon dam project was cleared in 1989, at a cost of Rs394 crore. In August 2019, the cost was hiked to Rs13,000 crore. This was the third hike. Though a state-level technical committee had only recommended hike up to over Rs11,000 crore, the state government okayed an estimate of Rs13,000 crore. This was done to accommodate the four tenders that have been cancelled now, said Mahajan.

Jaipur: In a major jolt to former IAS officer Ashok Singhvi and six other accused of multi-crore mining racket, the Rajasthan High Court on Friday dismissed 11 revision and criminal petitions.

The bench comprising Justice AK Gaur also gave a nod to the cognisance taken by the special court dealing with ED cases In these petitions, the accused including Singhvi challenged the order of the special court of ED cases dated January 21, 2019 in which it summoned them with non-bailable arrest warrants after taking cognizance of the Prevention of Money laundering Act. In the petitions, the accused had also pleaded to convert their non-bailable warrants into bailable ones. The accused maintained that there were no evidence against them for making the offence of money laundering, thus the lower court order against them is contrary to the law.

The defence said in this particular case, Singhvi had neither demanded nor taken money. “In a money laundering case, prosecution must bring substantial evidence that money has been taken by the accused and is been used in illegal activities,” said the defence.

On behalf of the ED, additional solicitor general RD Rastogi and advocate Anand Sharma said the court had taken cognisance against the accused on the complaint by the agency investigating money laundering. TNN

Indore: Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) on Friday conducted an anti-encroachment drive in Veer Sawarkar Market area and removed illegal construction from a three-storeyed building on busy MG Road area.

A team of IMC’s removal wing on Friday morning reached the area and started removing illegal construction from basement of a residential building located in front of Ganesh Cap Mart.

When the team reached the area and started the action, building owner and his relatives came out and started arguing with officials claiming that there was no violation in the construction.

This halted action for about half an hour and the drive could be resumed only after intervention of senior IMC officials.

“The building owner was found to be making constructions in the basement of the building for commercial use, while there was no permission obtained by him from IMC. The entire basement was illegal and we had to fill it,” IMC’s additional commissioner Shringar Shrivastava said.

He said that two teams along with an earth moving machine were pressed into service.

“The concerned building owner was issued a notice about two months ago with instructions to stop construction, but it did not stop. This left us with nothing but to take action,” he said.

On being asked if other buildings of the area also had the same violation, Shrivastava said that the action was taken on basis of a complaint. “Other buildings would also be checked and action would be taken accordingly,” he added.

During action, officials spotted other violations in the building and on basis of owner’s request, three days’ were given by officials to clear all illegal portions.

NEW DELHI: Journalist Deepak Chaurasia and a Doordarshan reporter and a cameraman were attacked and beaten up by a group of protesters at Shaheen Bagh when they were covering live programmes from the site on Friday afternoon.

A ruckus broke out when some protesters tried to stop the journalists from shooting at the venue. They even broke three cameras and confiscated another before allowing the journalists to leave. The videos of both the incidents have gone viral on social media.

A TOI photojournalist was also threatened when he tried to click photos of the men trying to stop a two-wheeler from crossing by the opposite lane.

Later, an FIR was registered at the Shaheen Bagh police station on Chaurasia’s complaint. Chaurasia told the cops that he had informed the protesters about his programme and had even made an announcement from the stage asking the protesters to stay away from the crew. “When we reached, some of the organisers even reached out to our crew and escorted us to the stage. They then introduced us to the crowd, following which the programme started,” Chaurasia said.

However, when Chaurasia started his show, a few men suddenly approached him from behind, placed their hands on the camera lens and asked him to leave. They then thrashed the cameramen, Vikas Rai, Kamal Kishore and Harish Sharma and snatched their equipment. “We were dragged out of the venue to a shop at a basement when someone stopped the protester. They kept threatening us and sought our cameras,” said Chaurasia.

The eyewitnesses said the others at the site tried to stop them, but the group kept thrashing the crew, who then ran into a CRPF van parked at a distance for protection. The crowd was finally dispersed after police intervention. A case under sections of assault, criminal intimidation, criminal conspiracy and robbery was registered. Police said that they have also received a complaint from the Doordarshan reporter and an FIR would be lodged.

NEW DELHI: Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari on Friday said that the strategic alliance with Janata Dal (United) and Loktantrik Janashakti Party (LJP) for the assembly elections has been done to woo Poorvanchali voters, who form over 30% of the vote bank.Tiwari said BJP has given tickets to 11 Poorvanchali candidates this time, up from five in the 2015 polls, which will pay dividends. He added that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s barbs on him and Poorvanchalis at least thrice in the last 4-5 months have angered the migrant population from Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh. As a result, the saffron party is likely to get “at least 95%” of their votes.With a larger representation, Tiwari said the community feels that they are respected in the saffron party. “The people of Poorvanchal have never been given tickets in such a large number by any party. They always had a feeling of being ignored during the ticket distribution process. This will definitely help us,” said Tiwari.There are more than 20 seats where Poorvanchali voters are in substantial numbers and their strategic voting may influence the poll outcome. While BJP’s oldest ally, Shiromani Akali Dal, has stayed away from the polls, JD(U) has got two seats — Burari and Sangam Vihar — and LJP the reserved constituency of Seemapuri. Both Burari and Sangam Vihar have a large population of migrants from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.The state BJP chief said that Poorvanchalis were feeling insulted by an alleged campaign run by AAP against him. “Kejriwal insulted Poorvanchalis thrice. First, he said that people from Bihar buy a Rs 500 (train) ticket and come to Delhi to get free treatment here, which increases the burden on the city. Then he said if NRC is implemented in Delhi, Manoj Tiwari (who is a Poorvanchali) will have to go,” Tiwari added.“NRC, if it is ever implemented, will be to identify illegal immigrants from other countries. Kejriwal’s statement was meant to show that all Poorvanchalis are illegal immigrants. He also made fun of Bhojpuri songs, something that made a small-town boy like me a popular face.

Bhopal: Despite strengthened security arrangements ahead of Republic Day, three looting cases were reported in the city on Thursday — all in a span of six hours. Cases of looting have seen a rise in the New Year — with as many as 13 incidents reported in January.

In the first incident, four unidentified accused on two bikes attacked a 23-year-old collection agent, who was on a two-wheeler, with a baseball bat. The accused robbed Rs 24,000 from the youth and fled. The visor of the victim’s helmet broke in the attack, and its shards injured his face. The youth’s hand was also fractured, said police.

Police said the victim, Kailash Lodhi (23), works as a collection agent at an automobile company. He told TOI that he was returning home on Thursday evening with the day’s cash collection in his pocket when the incident occurred. He said he reached Vivekanand Colony in Piplani around 6:30pm. As he reportedly stopped to urinate, four unidentified accused reached the spot on two bikes. They hit him on the helmet with a baseball bat and both his hands, before robbing him of the cash and fleeing. Lodhi immediately reached the police station to file a complaint. SHO Piplani, Rakesh Shrivastava, said the police have filed a case and recovered CCTV footage from the area, where they were spotted. Police have got some leads and the accused will be nabbed soon, he said.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the city in Hanumanganj, two bike-borne accused allegedly robbed the smartphone of a 34-year-old Gwalior-based sales executive, who was in Bhopal for work. When the victim, Ajay Sharma, resisted the attackers, the accused allegedly kicked him and fled. The youth was near Alpana Trisection on Hamidia Road at 10:30pm, when the incident took place.

A police personnel deployed at a nearby spot noted down the bike registration number and cops have tracked the attackers and they will be nabbed soon, said police. In another incident, two bike-borne accused allegedly snatched the mobile phone from a 36-year-old kiosk owner while he was walking home.

Investigation officer, SI Raghavendra Singh, said that the victim Naved Khan, 36, a resident of Islami Gate in Shahjehabanbad, in his complaint, stated he was walking home and reached Sindhi Colony Square around 11.45pm.

He was answering a call when two bikers reportedly came from behind and snatched his mobile.

204,['25/01/2020'],Memorials of language martyrs in neglect,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Trichy: While various political parties and Tamil organizations will be carrying out a rally today (Saturday) to commemorate the sacrifice of language martyrs against Hindi imposition in Tamil Nadu, there are no information boards at the memorial in the city to convey the significance of the historic anti-Hindi agitation that shaped the political course of Tamil Nadu in the late 1960s.

The memorials of language martyrs namely Keezhapaluvur Chinnasamy (1937-1964) and Viralimalai Shanmugam (1943-1965) near Uyyakondan canal in Thennur were installed to commemorate their sacrifice for the cause of Tamil language. Chinnasamy immolated self at Trichy on January 25, 1964, while Viralimalai Shanmugam killed self by consuming poison on February 25, 1965, both for a common cause, in protest against the Hindi imposition.

The memorial is filled with liquor bottles and litters due to lack of periodical maintenance except during the commemoration day. “Several representations have been made to the government to install information boards at the memorials but in vain. There is not even a proper shelter at the memorials,” N Rasa Ragunathan, central committee member, Tamil Kalai Ilakkiya Peravai.

Similarly, a granite stone installed at the Palakkarai bridge here on November 2006 naming the bridge after the two language martyrs Chinnasamy and Shanmugam is currently exploited to stick posters. Pro-Tamil groups that have been demanding the restoration of the granite stones claimed that Trichy Corporation and highways department have been blaming each other in maintaining the bridge. Trichy Corporation officials when contacted have agreed to look into the demand of installing information and signage boards at the memorial.

Sharad Baviskar, a professor at Centre for French and Francophone Studies, takes a class on French literature ... Read More

NEW DELHI: Even though the winter semester at Jawaharlal Nehru University commenced a little over 10 days ago, classes have yet to pick up steam. Most of these have been organised outside the classrooms. The backlog from the monsoon semester, marred by constant strikes and boycotts, has yet to be cleared.

While vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar has, in a series of statements, maintained that normalcy has returned to the campus, teachers allege that there is no clarity about the future. After the students secured an interim relief from Delhi high court over registration on Friday, there is some hope that the months of agitation may end soon.

JNUSU had given a call for the boycott of classes and end-semester exams in December in protest against the hostel fee hike effected after an Inter-Hall Administration meeting on October 28.

On January 16, Kumar stated at a press conference: “A great number of faculty members are actively working to make sure that academic interests of the students are addressed.” Teachers, however, disagree. The unofficial line of JNU Teachers’ Association has been to either refuse to conduct classes altogether or do it of their own accord after discussions with students.

On Friday, too, some classes were held in the open. Sharad Baviskar, a professor of Centre for French and Francophone Studies, took a class on French literature on the stairs of Language Laboratory. He told TOI that he was clearing the backlog from the previous semester.

Many classes for graduate, postgraduate and pre-PhD courses were taking place in the same manner, “but only after coordinating with the teachers and only to clear the backlog from the previous semester”, said Raj Kishor, a student at School of Languages.

Preeti Umrao, a student at School of Life Sciences, said even exams had started, but these were not being conducted online or via WhatsApp as desired by VC. “MSc and pre-PhD scholars are coordinating with the teachers and planning their own tests. In our school, we sought a week’s buffer to finish the syllabus from the previous semester. We are now waiting for JNUTA’s call to start the classes for the new session,” she said.

A student at School of Computer & Systems Sciences, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: “We have been asked to clear the exams and, then, start the classes for the next semester.”

Some students of management, engineering and Sanskrit, however, claimed that it had been business as usual all along and there was no backlog of classes.

BENGALURU: Indian Institute of Management-Bangalore ( IIMB ) will increase the fee for its flagship MBA programme for the upcoming academic year from Rs 21 lakh to Rs 23 lakh for domestic students. The batch size is expected to touch 505 this time.

The increase in intake is due to introduction of a course called MBA Business Analytics. Currently, there are 439 students in the PG programme. While the institute is yet to decide on the break up for both the courses, MBA (BA) is expected to have around 60 seats.

Students can opt for either MBA or MBA (BA) during the interview round. The new MBA (BA) programme aims to help students define problems, use analytical tools and techniques to identify patterns, gain insights and develop business strategies. “In the first year, the two programmes are significantly common,” said G Raghuram, director, IIMB.

The other reason for increase in intake is to accommodate the quota for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS). Apart from IIMB, even other IIMs have increased their batch size. IIM Indore, for instance, intends to increase it 540 from 450. However, the fee remains the same at Rs 16 lakh. At IIM-Udaipur, the intake will go up from 282 to 325. A fee increase is proposed and will be finalised only next week. IIM-Lucknow is also proposing a fee hike and higher intake.

Aurangabad: The civic body is yet to complete the detailed project report for the Rs 267 crore road project, which was supposed to be sent to the state government for approval.

The construction of 30 roads under Rs 100 crore road project has also not been completed.

The previous state government had announced the Rs 267 crore road project in January 2019, but it has not reached its first phase due to the ignorance of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation.

After the directive of the state government, the AMC is now identifying and inspecting the development plan (DP) roads in the city.

Around 100 city roads will be taken up under the project. Once the inspection is completed, the DPR will be sent to the state government.

The Public Works Department (PWD) will scrutinise the DRP for technical sanction. Once, the DPR gets the approval from the state administration, tendering will be done. It would take at least six months for the project to begin.

Citizens have to suffer daily due to the poor condition of roads.

Meanwhile, three years after the approval of Rs 100 crore for the cement concretisation of the roads by the state government, the AMC has not been able to complete the project. Of the 30 roads, 17 have been completed, construction of the nine are in process and four are stuck due to encroachments, electric poles on the road and other issues.

AMC executive engineer Hemant Kolhe said that the project will be completed before March. “The work has gained progress over the last two months. Issues like shifting of poles, utilities and encroachments are obstacles in the way of the construction,” Kolhe said.

When asked the quality of the project, Kolhe said that the project has been scrutinised by the Project Management Consultant and a third party inspected it so there is no question of poor quality.

Manoj Tiwari

NEW DELHI: Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari on Friday said that the strategic alliance with Janata Dal (United) and Loktantrik Janashakti Party (LJP) for the assembly elections has been done to woo Poorvanchali voters, who form over 30% of the vote bank.

Complete coverage on Delhi elections

Tiwari said BJP has given tickets to 11 Poorvanchali candidates this time, up from five in the 2015 polls, which will pay dividends. He added that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s barbs on him and Poorvanchalis at least thrice in the last 4-5 months have angered the migrant population from Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh. As a result, the saffron party is likely to get “at least 95%” of their votes.

With a larger representation, Tiwari said the community feels that they are respected in the saffron party. “The people of Poorvanchal have never been given tickets in such a large number by any party. They always had a feeling of being ignored during the ticket distribution process. This will definitely help us,” said Tiwari.

There are more than 20 seats where Poorvanchali voters are in substantial numbers and their strategic voting may influence the poll outcome. While BJP’s oldest ally, Shiromani Akali Dal, has stayed away from the polls, JD(U) has got two seats — Burari and Sangam Vihar — and LJP the reserved constituency of Seemapuri. Both Burari and Sangam Vihar have a large population of migrants from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.

The state BJP chief said that Poorvanchalis were feeling insulted by an alleged campaign run by AAP against him. “Kejriwal insulted Poorvanchalis thrice. First, he said that people from Bihar buy a Rs 500 (train) ticket and come to Delhi to get free treatment here, which increases the burden on the city. Then he said if NRC is implemented in Delhi, Manoj Tiwari (who is a Poorvanchali) will have to go,” Tiwari added.

“NRC, if it is ever implemented, will be to identify illegal immigrants from other countries. Kejriwal’s statement was meant to show that all Poorvanchalis are illegal immigrants. He also made fun of Bhojpuri songs, something that made a small-town boy like me a popular face. On December 8, Kejriwal himself will become a joke,” said Tiwari.

Nithyananda

AHMEDABAD: The petitioner who has sought custody of his two missing daughters from Nithyananda and his associates, asked the Gujarat high court on Friday to direct the ministry of external affairs to provide CCTV footage from the Indian high commission in Kingston, Jamaica.

The petitioner’s daughters swore their last affidavits at the Indian high commission in Kingston on January 8. A high commission attache (admin and DDO) M P Khar, was witness to the affirmation of the affidavits. The petitioner sought directions to the foreign ministry to get video footage and other details from the high commission, to know what had happened on January 8, when his daughters visited the office.

The petitioner filed another application in the high court, and said that the CCTV footage is required to know who accompanied them to the high commission, and whether the officer, Khar, ascertained the wish and free will of his two daughters.

The petitioner claimed that his younger daughter was in the Ahmedabad ashram and upon his filing a police complaint on November 1, 2019, was “smuggled” by Nithyananda and his associates from Ahmedabad to Kingston via Nepal, Mauritius, Equador, Trinidad, Virginia and Barbados.

The high court said it would hear the issue further on February 4.

BHOPAL/JABALPUR: In a rare instance, a single-judge bench of MP high court has issued contempt notice to an additional district & sessions judge (ADJ) of Sehora town in Jabalpur for non-compliance of its order.

The single-judge bench of Justice JP Gupta sought to know why ADJ Vikram Singh did not comply with an order issued by him and why contempt of court proceedings should not be undertaken against him. The case would now come up for hearing on February 4.

In a revision petition, Ashok Kumar Yadav , a retired employee of Gun Carriage Factory, Jabalpur, had prayed the court that he has been charged for abduction and murder of a child by Gosalpur police station and a chargesheet was presented in the court of ADJ, Sehora. The presiding judge RK Dinkar famed charges against him under same sections of the IPC.

Yadav had filed a revision petition against framing of charges by the court.

During hearing, the high court had asked the ADJ court to pass a ‘speaking order’ seeking evidences and charges framed against petitioner Ashok Yadav. However, Vikram Singh, the new ADJ judge at Sehora, framed charges against Yadav without passing a ‘speaking order’.

Following this, Yadav moved the MP high court again accusing the ADJ of contempt of court. In response, the court issued show-cause notice to ADJ, Sehora.

Jaipur: Safaris in Ranthambore National Park (RNP)’s zone-1 were shifted to another zone on Friday after a three-year-old tigress, Sultana, allegedly chased vehicles, including a forest department’s Gypsy, twice earlier in the day.

This is the third incidence of the tigress charging at tourist vehicle.

The RNP management issued an order — a copy of which is with TOI — closing safaris in the particular zone until further notice. Authorities are looking into the matter.

“On Friday, Sultana first charged at a forest department Gypsy which had ventured too close to her near Khariya Ki Talai. After a while, she furiously ran behind a canter as well,” said a source. As per norms, a vehicle should maintain a minimum distance of 50m from any wild animal.

Even as the forest department claimed that the closure was for wildlife management, sources cited the move as a precautionary measure since the same tigress had charged at an open top vehicle carrying tourists last month. A video of the incident on December 1, 2019, had gone viral on social media. It showed Sultana coming perilously close to the tourists before sprinting alongside their vehicle.

Sources said Sultana’s behaviour will be monitored and the zone shall remain closed for visitors till further orders. For now, the safaris scheduled at zone-1 will take place at zone-4. In October last year, Sultana had suffered a thorn injury and disappeared for a while before returning to zone-1 in December.

Trichy: The Airport Authority of India, Trichy, will provide funds to build a boxing ring at the Anna Stadium in Trichy under its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme. Airport director K Gunasekaran along with heads of various departments of the airport handed over a cheque of Rs 13.17 lakh to district collector S Sivarasu at the collector office here on Thursday to execute the project. The Public Works Department (PWD) will be responsible to build the facility, officials said.

“We have handed over a cheque of Rs 13.17 lakh to the district collector S Sivarasu to establish a boxing ring with shelter and to procure necessary accessories like glove and punching bags. So far, there is no such permanent facility at Anna Stadium. So, this boxing ring would be beneficial for students who aspire to become a boxer,” K Gunasekaran added.

When contacted, district sports officer K Prabhu told TOI that more than 50 students practise at Anna Stadium and the new facility would be useful for them. Trichy airport has already spent crores under the CSR programme, from construction of toilets at two government girls’ schools, ambulance for a primary health centre in Pudukottai and compound wall for a government school.

Gujarat high court

AHMEDABAD: A few days after public sector banks gave a two-day strike call for January 31 and February 1, several trade and industry associations in Gujarat came together to file a public interest litigation (PIL) in the high court against such repetitive strike calls given by bank employees and officers. The trade and industry bodies have cited severe difficulties in carrying out financial transactions in the wake of such strikes.

Bank employees have also called for another three-day strike from March 11 and have also threatened an indefinite strike from April 1 onwards if their demands over wage-revision and re-initiating recruitments in are not adhered to.

“The petition has been filed in the interest of consumers as well as trade and industry bodies because hampering of financial transactions due to frequent strike by bankers adversely impacts business operations from time to time. Payment commitments, issuing of letters of credit – everything gets delayed which impacts goodwill of traders and industrialists,” said Jayendra Tanna, president, Gujarat Trader Federation (GTF), which is one of the eight petitioners in the case. “Such illegal strikes would cause huge financial losses to the nation and strictest actions are proposed to be taken against the employees who support strikes,” states the petition. When contacted, Janak Rawal, general secretary, MGBEA, said, “Bank employees have so far gone on strike in public interest, to strengthen banks and economy. However, bankers have gone on strike for the first time for their wage revision which is pending since two years. We hope trade and industry supports us in our endeavour.” MGBEA estimates suggest that over the two-day strike on January 31 and February 1, transactions worth Rs 30,000 crore may be hampered.

Nagpur: After a prolonged wait of 144 days, the Reach III of Nagpur Metro (Sitabuldi to Lokmanya Nagar stretch) will be opened by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Union minister for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri and Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari on January 28 through video link.

Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS) had cleared the stretch on September 5, 2019. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was slated to open the line on September 7. However, his visit was cancelled due to heavy rainfall warning. Since then, MahaMetro was waiting for VIPs to open the line.

Thackeray was expected to inaugurate the line during winter session of the state legislature in December, but it was postponed due to unknown reasons.

Both former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and his successor Uddhav Thackeray are responsible for the delay, said a Metro official requesting anonymity. “After PM Modi’s visit to Nagpur was cancelled, he could have opened the line through video link, but CM Fadnavis wanted his physical presence at the function. Then Uddhav Thackeray first decided to inaugurate it in person, but later changed his plans and decided to do it through video link. This could have been done at least a month ago,” said the official.

On why MahaMetro waited for so long when PM and the CM were not coming to the city to open the Reach III, a spokesperson said, “We do not decide the date of opening. It was decided by the chief minister’s office. We received communication from Mumbai on Friday evening.”

Metro officials said that Thackeray and Puri would flag off the train from Subhash Nagar station at 10.45am through video link. Gadkari would be present at the station. State urban development minister Eknath Shinde, home minister Anil Deshmukh, guardian minister Nitin Raut, dairy development minister Sunil Kedar and mayor Sandip Joshi will also be present on the occasion.

Reach III is 11 km long and has 6 stations — Lokmanya Nagar, Vasudev Nagar, Subhash Nagar, Institution of Engineers, Jhansi Rani Square and Sitabuldi Interchange.

A Metro official said that many educational institutions and Hingna MIDC area were situated near Lokmanya Nagar station and they would get fast connectivity to Sitabuldi. “Vasudev Nagar station is also quite far from Sitabuldi and people living in that area will also benefit from the Metro,” he added.

Work on Reach III had started in December 2016. Trial run was held from Subhash Nagar to Sitabuldi on August 15, 2019. The CMRS inspection for the entire stretch was held on August 30, 2019. The commissioner issued the clearance certificate on September 5.

Trichy: The appointment of sanitary watchers by Trichy Corporation to prevent public littering and open urination along the banks of Uyyakondan canal, passing along Kulimikkarai road, has been yielding the desired results for residents of the civic body. The sanitary workers along with self-help groups have been surveying the spots prone to littering and have kept polluters at bay.

Falling under ward 50 of K Abishekapuram zone, Kulimikkarai road connecting Anna Nagar in Thennur with Alwarthope is frequently polluted by the public and commercial establishments. Recently, the stretch was cleaned by corporation workers and volunteers with Citizens For Uyyakondan (CFU) and the walls of the corporation’s micro compost centre was painted with awareness messages. However, as the littering continued, the sanitary workers have been given the duty to supervise the area during the hours when littering was rampant.

On Friday morning, as a couple of men were trying to pollute a cleaned vacant space on Kulimikkarai road, a sanitary worker, A Jayalakshmi, supervising the stretch drove them away with a warning. “Sanitary workers are cleaning the stretch every day but people are not cooperating. We were told to supervise the road to ensure cleanliness,” Jayalakshmi said. The corporation officials said that the practice would continue in the days to come. “Though we cannot cover all the stretches prone to littering, sanitary workers, equipped with safety gear and whistles, have been told to prevent open defecation and public littering in the area where they are deployed,” a corpoation official said.

Nokha MLA Bihari Lal with locusts at Assembly on Friday

JAIPUR: In a novel protest, a BJP legislator entered the Rajasthan assembly building with a gift-packed container full of locusts on Friday.

The unconventional protest was to highlight the Congress-led government’s alleged failure to contain the locust menace which played havoc with Rabi crops in western Rajasthan.

The dissent by opposition legislator and Nokha MLA Bihari Lal caught everyone’s attention. He entered the assembly building with the container on his head accompanied by woman legislator from Anupgarh Santosh who wore a banner of demands by locust-affected farmers on her body.

However, all were left stunned after he showed the gift packed container of locusts. The grasshoppers have been damaging the agricultural crops in western Rajasthan. “It’s a gift sent by the farmers of border districts of Bikaner, Ganganagar and Hanumangarh to the government, which failed to protect them,” he alleged.

Speaking to the media, he said, “Farmers have suffered the worst. However, the state government seems all focused on protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Compensation should be distributed fast as the farmers have suffered heavy losses due to locust attacks on their Rabi crops.”

Nokha MLA Bihari Lal said, “Compensation should be distributed fast as the farmers have suffered heavy losses due to locust attacks on their Rabi crops.”

Farmers in 11 out of 33 Rajasthan border districts have suffered huge losses in the locust attacks, described as the worst in the last three decades. These insects had entered the villages in western Rajasthan crossing the Indo-Pak border. He said the loss to farmers has been estimated at Rs 80,000 per hectare. They have also demanded aerial spray of pesticides on locust swarms.

Farmers have been beating vessels, lighting fires and playing loud music through the day and night to drive the insects away, but without much success. The government has still not fully succeeded in containing the menace, despite spraying of insecticides.

Trichy: Anti-vice squad (AVS) attached to Trichy city police busted a brothel racket and arrested two pimps and rescued two women in Trichy city on Thursday. The team led by inspector Uma Maheswari arrested A Karthika, 25 from Adhavathur Sandhai and her husband S Aravindhan, 37, from a house in Shanmuga Nagar on Vayalur road in Trichy .

Acting on a complaint from a 45-year-old man from Marudhandakurichi, the AVS team searched the house and confirmed that sex trafficking was taking place in at the house. The police rescued two women, aged 42 and 33, who were forced to prostitution by the couple who acted as pimps.

Police said the owner of the house had let the house on rent to the couple, unaware of their ploy to run brothel in it. The rescued women were manual labourers who were lured into the profession by offering money.

The police booked the couple under immoral traffic prevention (ITP) Act and produced them in court. The court remanded them in judicial custody. The rescued women were sent to a government home in Trichy for rehabilitation.

Bhopal: MP high court has issued notice to the Gwalior municipal commissioner seeking explanation over the termination of a computer operator of Gwalior Municipal Corporation who had alleged flaws in the performance audit of various cities during 2019 Swachh Survekshan and sought an inquiry by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). The officer has been asked to submit reasons with relevant documents by January 28.

He was not only terminated from service on charges of “conspiring against a government department” but it is alleged that a complaint was lodged against him with local police after which he was detained by crime branch sleuths and questioned for around eight hours. Sandeep Sharma, the computer operator, had then filed a petition challenging his termination.

Sharma’s termination order said he violated civil services rules by “misusing his official position” and “creating a confused relationship between state and the central government”. Sharma claims he has been targeted for speaking up against wrongdoings. Various associations in Gwalior have also protested against Sharma’s termination.

The termination order also accuses Sharma of moving court without the state government’s permission — which he did by submitting documents he was not authorised to access.

K Chandrasekhar Rao

HYDERABAD: Saturday’s outcome is going to be crucial for all political parties. The ruling TRS seems to be sitting pretty, confident of repeating its success show — having won all the elections held in the last five years. On the other hand, Congress and BJP are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping to turn a new leaf by upstaging TRS.

Interestingly, the election results are set to impact a possible change of guard in Congress and BJP state units. If the results turn out to be in favour of BJP, the party leadership is likely to retain K Laxman for another term. Whereas Telangana Congress president Uttam Kumar Reddy has already made his intentions clear of quitting the post after the results and a search for a new TPCC chief is already on.

However, the January 22 election was never taken lightly by the three contenders — TRS, Congress and BJP. The state had zilla parishad elections in May 2019.

TRS wants to prove its dominance and that there is no anti-incumbency wave in the state. Congress and BJP, which could not produce the desired results in assembly, local body elections and Huzurnagar bypoll, are keen to establish that people are angry with the ruling TRS and also emerge as a viable alternative to TRS.

TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao put ministers on notice and had even warned them that they would lose their berths in the cabinet if they fail to ensure party candidates’ win in their respective wards. He was equally forceful on party MLAs if they do not get the desired results.

TRS general secretary Palla Rajeshwara Reddy said the ruling party would set a new record by winning successive elections. “In the assembly polls, we received 46.87% of votes and secured 88 seats. Congress got 28.43% of votes and won 19 seats while BJP got only 6.98% of votes, he said.

Dehradun: To fix accountability of projects undertaken by Public Works Department engineers and lay more focus on performance, the body’s Annual Confidential Report (ACR) will undergo a change. The move comes after CM Trivendra Rawat issued orders in this regard to additional chief secretary Om Prakash, a communique said.

The new ACR would cover Principal Engineer, Chief Engineer (Headquarters), Chief Engineer (Zonal), Superintendent Engineer (Civil), and other engineers of the department. Presently, 80% weightage is given on performance assessment and the parameters of performance and achievement are filled by the officer concerned.

There is no provision which could help the reporting officer adjudge the actual performance of the engineer. The remaining 20% weightage is reserved for “Personal Attributes” and grading is done on a scale of 0 to 10.

However, the new Performance Appraisal Report has different categories and marks have been fixed for each performance parameter. Also, the reporting officer can alter the “Personal Attributes” marks under the new system, if he feels that the performance of the officer concerned isn’t qualitative.

The new performance report will also have 20% weightage reserved for “Personal Attributes”.

Bhopal: The anti-mafia campaign of the Kamal Nath government will continue, minister for law PC Sharma said on Friday. Speaking to reporters at the PCC office, the minister gave an account of all actions initiated and taken by the state government to control the alleged mafia and extortion rackets.

“On Republic Day, chief minister Kamal Nath will hand over possession of 600-800 plots to rightful owners,” Sharma said. “This is possible after the action against land and cooperatives mafia that has been undertaken by the government,” he claimed. In Bhopal 80 persons have been given possession of their land by the district collector after action against the co-operative mafia, he said.

“Madhya Pradesh was once regarded India’s cultural capital. But in 15 years of BJP rule, the state has become the centre of criminal and mafia activities,” PC Sharma alleged. “There are 11 types of mafia that have been identified including the drug mafia, land, extortion, liquor, adulteration, chit-fund, illegal colonizer, blackmail, mining, transport and cooperatives mafia. The Nath government has started demolishing all the mafia raj,” he said.

PC Sharma claimed that the government initiated action in 615 cases of land mafia, 694 involving liquor mafia, 150 adulteration, 65 cooperatives, 149 extortion cases and 1,053 vehicles involving the transport mafia. “Kamal Nath government has taken strict action against these and many culprits have been put behind bars,” the minister said.

He said the government is on the rampage against the mining mafia. “More than 1330 cases of illegal mining have been registered, 8294 cases of transport attached to illegal mining and 531 for storage have been registered. As many as 10155 cases have been registered for a mafia-free Madhya Pradesh,” he said.

“In the 15 years of BJP rule, an approximate Rs 15,000 crore was usurped from the state exchequer. Till 2018, the annual revenue from sand mining was a meagre Rs 223 crore. Kamal Nath government has stopped this robbery of sand and with a new sand mining policy the revenue now is Rs 1234 crore,” the minister said.

When Harish was hospitalised on two occasions — once when he fell ill and another time when he was hit by a motorcycle — Trivendra was among the first to visit him at the hospital. Not just that, but Trivendra also attended the mango party hosted by his predecessor and Harish returned the courtesy by visiting CM’s residence on the occasion of Holi.However, when it comes to taking potshots at each other, both have never backed out. In a recent incident, a video had gone viral where Harish Rawat is seen making chowmein in a shop with his supporters. To which, the CM said he would love to taste the chowmein but advised Harish to send some to Congress state chief Pritam Singh. The former CM and and Congress state chief reportedly share strained relations. In retaliation, Harish said, “I will definitely send chowmein to Pritam but will send double the quantity to Trivendra as he might like to share it with Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank and Ajay Bhatt.”Trivendra, in his statement, not only made fun but also used it to highlight the differences between Harish and Pritam Singh. “Unse kaho kuch hamare liye bhi bhej dein, hum bhi taste kar le ki kaisi bani hai...nahi to kam se kam Pritam Singh to khila dein (Ask him to send some to me so that I can taste and judge its quality, if not then he should at least send it to Pritam Singh.”The CM’s statement was an indirect swipe on the two senior Congress leaders who are said to be at loggerheads over some issues. Harish in a recent Facebook message has announced a three-month break from active politics and said that he will take a call on his future in March.Reacting quickly on the situation, Harish made a short Facebook video on Friday in which he thanked the CM for expressing desire to eat noodles prepared by him and also took a jibe. “I will send noodles made of Mandua and if possible momos also to Trivendra.

Minister K Pandiarajan (3rd from right) during a visit to Keeladi in Sivaganga district last year

CHENNAI: In an effort to explore the ancient links between their states and identify commonalities, the governments of Kerala and Tamil Nadu plan to undertake a joint study of the archaeological sites at Muziris near Kodungallur and Keeladi in Sivaganga district.

Kerala tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran and Tamil Nadu minister for Tamil official language and culture K Pandiarajan, echoed this idea after a meeting on Friday at the secretariat here.

Archaeologists involved in the excavation of Muziri had been frequenting Keeladi and vice versa for a long time. “The archaeological departments of the two states will soon carry out a joint study to look for commonalities,” said Surendran.

Surendran along with senior officials of the tourism department of that state met Pandiarajan, TN environment minister K C Karuppannan and officials of the Tamil Nadu pollution control board and Town and Country Planning to seek a ‘no objection’ certificate for the Kerala government to construct a Rs 15 crore guest house in Kanyakumari.

Pandiarajan said a massive excavation exercise was going on in Muziri and officials of the two states had decided to work together to compare the findings of Muziris and Keeladi. The joint study would help evolve a joint narrative of Tamil civilisation, he said.

“We are also planning to bring out a collaborative book on the rich history of Tamil civilisation. It will be done parallel to avoid delay in publishing the books on the excavation.”

T Udayachandran, commissioner of the TN archaeology department, said a team led by P J Cherian of the Kerala Council for Historical Research was doing a methodical excavation in Pattanam. “The best practices can be exchanged and it would shed more light on the Sangam era and the life of the Tamil people. The artefacts unearthed in Keeladi can also compared with the artefacts found in Muziris and better research can be carried out.”

The fifth phase of excavation was completed at Keeladi, and preliminary study is going on to take up the sixth phase, he said, adding that the report on the findings of the fourth phase would be out soon.

Pandiarajan said they had requested Kerala government to lay an approach road to the famous Kannagi temple in Idukki district, along the inter-state border, and to promote it as a tourism site.

Surendran said the issue would be soon sorted out and also stated that both the governments had been maintaining a cordial relationship.

HYDERABAD: In a clever strategy to outwit TRS, Congress is offering posts of municipal chairperson and deputy chairperson, mayor and deputy mayor to TRS rebels having winning prospects.

The strategy is aimed at stopping the TRS rebels from going back to the ruling party after it started cajoling them to win the top posts. Congress is issuing a whip to the party members to vote for the candidates nominated by the party for these posts, sources said.

Corporators and councillors will elect one among them as mayor and chairperson and their deputies as it is an indirect election for these posts. The State Election Commission has notified that indirect elections to mayors and chairpersons and their deputies will be held on January 27.

If election of mayor and chairperson is not possible on January 27, the indirect election will be completed the following day. Also, the election of deputy mayor and deputy chairperson shall be held only after the election of mayor and chairperson is completed, SEC sources said.

Congress is confident of winning a good number of wards and divisions in the urban local bodies in the districts of Medchal-Malkajgiri, Nalgonda, Bhuvanagiri-Yadadri, Sangareddy, Nagarkurnool, Rangareddy and Khammam.

TPCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy said it was an election between “Congress and TRS distributed cash, liquor and gifts.”

Congress legislature party leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka said the democratic institutions were being destroyed in order to allow only the rich to take part in politics and prevent the poor from entering politics.

Ex-CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan with BJP workers at the collectorate on Friday

Bhopal: The BJP on Friday held state-wide protests against Congress government’s alleged targeting of party workers under the ongoing drive against land mafia. BJP gheraoed collectorates across the state and registered their protest.

In Bhopal, the protest was led by former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. In Indore, state BJP president Rakesh Singh led the protest while former state president and MP Nand Kumar Singh Chouhan led the protest in Khandwa. Former ministers Narottam Mishra protested in Jabalpur and Bhupendra Singh led the protest in Chhatarpur.

Several BJP workers were reportedly arrested in Indore and other parts of the state during the protest.

Rakesh Singh said, “The government mafia is working in the name of action against land mafia. But BJP workers would not get afraid. Poor people and BJP workers are getting targeted in the drive.” He alleged there is atmosphere of fear in the state for past one year ever since Congress came in power.

“Congress is trying to target people and settle scores. To intimidate BJP workers, the Congress government is bulldozing their houses while properties of Congress leaders are spared. BJP workers would not get afraid and will fight till their last breath,” Singh added.

Former Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan and several BJP workers were arrested in front of district collectorate.

Former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said in his address outside Bhopal collectorate that the chief minister should clarify who is the mafia and how many of them have been targeted so far. He demanded government to make public the list of mafia. “BJP is against atrocities meted out to people in the name of anti-encroachment drives. By conducting campaigns like drive against mafia and shudh ke liye yuddh, the government is trying to divert people’s attention from its failure. It is like collecting sample from one shop and taking money from remaining shops. No one had thought that the government that came into power in the name of change would trouble people,” Chouhan said.

HYDERABAD: Twenty-seven years after he left Telangana in search of a job in Kuwait , a man from Nizamabad district died in that country on Thursday.

After he had left India in 1993, Chakali Bhoomaiah (65) never visited his native Lingapur village in Indalvai mandal . He died just when his son, Suresh (28), thought that he had traced his father after nearly two decades.

Bhoomaiah’s family came to know about his whereabouts from a video that was circulating. “On Wednesday night, I identified my father from the video. A group of persons spoke to him where he had mentioned the name of his village as Yellareddypalli, which is close to our village. After checking the name on the passport copy, we recognised him as my father,” Suresh told TOI.

Sources said Bhoomaiah stayed back in Kuwait and did not attempt to get back home even once. He could not return as he was cheated and did not have his passport, sources said.

In the video, NRIs from Telangana noticed his failing health and were seen telling him that they would like to sponsor his trip back home.

“The next morning after I saw the video, I called them up only to be informed that he had passed away,” Suresh said.

Getting the body of Bhoomaiah from Kuwait is a task now. The Indian embassy in Kuwait is in touch with the family.

“We were informed that my father was not even in possession of the passport,” Suresh said. Gulf Telangana Welfare and Cultural Association president Patkuri Basanth Reddy said he was in touch with some volunteers, who were trying to send the body to Nizamabad.

When Bhoomaiah left for Kuwait in 1993, his elder daughter Sunitha was four years and younger daughter Laxmi was three years. Suresh was one year old then. It was only once, in 2007, that Bhoomaiah had called up his family.

“He probably did not want to return as there were huge debts to be cleared,” Suresh said. Even when he was asked in the video by the group of Telangana volunteers if he would like to return home to see his family, Bhoomaiah evinced no interest.

Firoz Bakht Ahmed

HYDERABAD: Trouble erupted on Maulana Azad National Urdu University ( Manuu ) campus, on Friday evening, after a group of students gheraoed chancellor, Firoz Bakht Ahmed ’s vehicle, and shouted slogans against him, while he was leaving the premises. The chancellor had taken a police party with him to enter the campus as his own vice-chancellor had advised him against visiting the university.

In December, Ahmed issued an appeal urging Muslim community to maintain calm and assuring them that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) would not uproot them from India, where they have been living since time immemorial. “Since then, I have been threatened with dire consequences by students,” the chancellor told TOI.

Alleging that the students were instigated by Manuu vice-chancellor Mohammed Aslam Parvaiz , Ahmed said: “It was absolutely peaceful when I came in, earlier in the afternoon. It was only when I stepped out of my quarters to leave, did these students gather near the gate. It is certainly the handiwork of the V-C and registrar.”

The tussle between the two administrative heads of India’s only Urdu university has been going on for a long time now, with both accusing each other of fraudulent practices, on public platforms. In November last year, Parvaiz even tendered his resignation to the President attributing it to continuous harassment by Ahmed who claimed that the V-C decided to quit to avoid inquiry into his actions, including charges of sexual harassment.

When contacted, the V-C confirmed that he had asked the chancellor to stay away from the campus. “That is because I knew something like this could happen… Why did he unnecessarily need to come to the university and disturb the peace? Students have finally settled down and concentrating on their academics. There was no need for him to rake up the issue again,” said Parvaiz.

He said the Chancellor had to be escorted out through back door to avoid further trouble.

Trichy: Referring to incidents of violence against women and children, Trichy district SP Zia-ul Haque highlighted the role of educational institutions in creating better citizens. Speaking at the National Girl Child Day event at Jamal Mohamed College (JMC), he called for contribution from every section of the society to curb such incidents.

The event was organised by JMC gender champion club along with Bharathidasan University’s department of women studies. Speaking on the status and challenges faced by girls in India, he cited incidents of violence and stressed on the need for protecting girls. He said institutions like JMC have a vital role in imparting moral education to curb such incidents. He said that human development cannot be achieved without achieving gender equality and that declining sex ratio, early marriage and lack of equal opportunity is a major concern. He said a century ago, ‘Sati’ was an accepted norm, it is not only unaccepted today and is a crime. “In the same way, female feticide, child marriages and gender issues still exist despite measures to counter them. But appropriate changes will occur. The change therefore should come from households, from individuals,” he said. Speaking on prevailing gender discrimination in society, Manimekalai, director and head of department of women’s studies, said gender inequalities prevailing in society manifests into violence.

“Historical disadvantages witnessed by women for generations were not questioned rationally, which is a reason for gender inequality sustaining in the society ,” she said.TNN

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand government gave 307 smartphones to girl students on the occasion of National Girl Child Day here on Friday. Women and child welfare minister Rekha Arya distributed the smartphones to the girls who performed well in their Class X and Class XII board exams.

The event was attended by over 1,000 girl students, their parents, and teachers from all across the state.

Besides mobile phones, the girl studentsat Taj Chauraha were also given sanitary pads and other awareness material. “Smartphones will not just help these girls in studies but will also be a helpful tool for their security,” said Rekha Arya while speaking on the ocassion.

While some were excited to get the phone, others were critical of its utility. Speaking to TOI, some beneficiaries claimed that they already have a better smartphone than the one given by the state government. Some even said that they will gift the phone to their siblings.

Deeksha Pandey, who had come to Dehradun from Almora, claimed that she will give the new phone to her brother. Similarly, Neha Pant from Pithoragarh said that she will gift her old phone to her brother and will use the new one given by the government.

The girl students and their parents pointed out that without internet connectivity, smartphones alone won’t be of much help in studies. Some parents also expressed concern about excess usage of phone. “My daughter is a Class XI student. I give her a phone when she goes for her coaching class but I don’t think letting her keep a phone for the entire day is a good idea,” said Vinay Agarwal from Tehri, whose daughter had scored 97% marks in her Class X board exams.

She also sought action against district administration and police for ‘taking a Dalit girl’s murder case lightly.’“It took almost five days for police to include provisions of the SC/ST Act in the FIR while sections pertaining to rape are still missing. We demand action against police and the administration for the delay and the lapse,” Vidwaan said.Vidwaan, who handed over a relief cheque of Rs 4.12 lakh to the victim’s mother, also alleged that this money should have been handed over to the family along with ration of three months within 24 hours of the incident. Citing this, too, as a lapse, she added that the administration and police neglected the fact that the victim was the only earning member in the family on whom her elderly mother and teenage sister were dependent.“There has been no sensitivity displayed in the way investigation in such a heinous crime was conducted. I have read the panchnama report of the case in which it is clearly mentioned that blood stains were found in the victim’s undergarments and her private parts were mutilated too. The killer had burnt her face and half her body to hide her identity and still, police hasn’t included relevant sections pertaining to such brutality in the FIR,” she said.When contacted by TOI regarding the matter, Anuj Kumar, circle officer (sadar), who is also the investigating officer in the case, said, “There was some miscommunication due to which the police took three days to included provisions of the SC/ST Act. Also, we have told the SC Commission that the police has already sent samples to forensic lab and we will include relevant sections of the IPC including those pertaining to rape in the FIR after getting the report.”To recall, the girl’s body was found in a half-burnt state in Arcadia area of Dehradun on January 4 after which the family had blamed a neighbour for the act. Two days after the incident, the police arrested the accused Usman Qureshi and claimed that the victim and the accused were in love and the man killed her after he learnt of her getting engaged to another man.",dehradun,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/sc-commission-seeks-action-against-admin-police-in-doon-for-taking-dalit-girls-murder-case-lightly/articleshow/73592158.cms

Bhopal: Two ministers of the Kamal Nath government on Friday trained their guns on the BJP and former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Backwards and minorities welfare minister Arif Aqueel on Friday targeted Chouhan saying, “Sattar (70) chuhe khaakar billi haj ko chali (a hypocrite pretending to be holy).”

Aqueel was talking to reporters in Sehore on Friday and was asked about the former chief minister’s allegation that a minister of the Kamal Nath government has connections with sand mining in the Narmada.

“Chouhan does not have the right to accuse others of illegal sand mining,” Aqueel said. “A person whose family has thrived on sand mining does not have the authority to accuse others. Who does not know about dumpers? Every dumper had Chouhan Builders inscribed on it and RTO officials did not had the courage till now to stop these dumpers.”

About himself, the minister said, “I have told officials that if anyone involved in such activities takes my name then immediately seize his vehicle and take action against him.”

Minister for women and child welfare Imarti Devi also fired a salvo at the BJP. When reporters asked her for a reaction on the recent offensive remark by BJP former minister of state Badrilal Yadav for the district collector of Rajgarh, she said, “I don’t know what was said since I was not here for several days. But, we Congress persons are like elephants. We walk and dogs bark. Makes no difference for us.”

Asked about the BJP’s allegation of land grabbing by senior Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, the woman minister argued, “Everyone knows who is mafia and who isn’t. What is Scindiaji’s dearth in life that he should become mafia. What dearth has Kamal Nath that he should become mafia? Whether in Gwalior or anywhere else, see BJP leaders who were on bicycles and see where they have reached. They are called mafia. Parents of Scindia and Kamal Nath have left so much, they don’t need to be corrupt.”

242,['25/01/2020'],Reprieve for Fadnavis as CJM adjourns hearing till Feb 10,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Nagpur: In yet another reprieve for former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) here on Friday adjourned the hearing on summons issued to him in a case filed by lawyer Satish Uke.

Agreeing to Fadnavis’ counsel Uday Dable’s request for seeking extension, pending review petition in the Supreme Court, CJM Renuka Satav adjourned the hearing till February 10. Earlier, the leader of opposition in state assembly, twice skipped the hearings on December 4 and January 4 citing ‘official’ reasons.

The applicant, who was arguing in person, strongly opposed Dable’s request to adjourn the plea for the third time. Uke had claimed that Fadnavis allegedly suppressed information about two pending criminal cases while filing affidavit for nomination form during 2014 assembly polls. TOI has been following this case since first publishing it from November 14, 2014, when Uke had filed it in the JMFC.

When hearing started, Dable informed the court about Thursday’s review petition filed by the former CM in the apex court which consented to hear the case in an open court. “Application seeking oral hearing of review petitions in open court is/are allowed,” a bench comprising justices Arun Mishra, Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose held.

On October 1 last year, the top court ruled against Fadnavis clarifying that a candidate must disclose all criminal cases in which court has taken cognisance at the time of contesting election. The SC then remanded back the case to JMFC court for retrial. The trial court of judge SB Mehta had issued summons to the ex-CM as an accused and asked him to remain present on December 4 for seeking bail.

“Since SC judgment has no further appeal, the petitioner losing the case can only file a review petition for correction. As per rules, the review is taken by the same set of judges inside their chamber, but there are no arguments from either complainant or respondent’s side. If they reach consensus that the review needs to be heard, they refer the case to an open hearing, else they straightway reject the case in a minute,” Dable told TOI.

The South Nagpur MLA had contended before the top court that lower court verdict would have several repercussions and could be misused against the candidates. He apprehended that frivolous cases could be filed days before election is announced to harass the contestants. Therefore, he demanded that they should be asked to disclose only those criminal cases in which charges have been framed or charge sheet has been filed.

Trichy: Early this month, final year BSc Mathematics students of Periyar EVR College were in for a shock when their semester exam results were out. Out of the 80-odd students in the class, 35 had failed in Algebra paper. What’s more, most of the failed students had secured marks in single digit.

Since they had passed in the other five subjects, eleven of the failed students sought a scanned copy of their answer scripts from the controller of examination of the college.

The copies revealed that all of them had passed but were given less marks in the valuation. “We took the answer script copy to our teachers. Five of them valuated the copy and gave us over 30 marks which is the minimum passing mark out of 75,” said one of the students who was failed.

B Gayathri, head of the Mathematics department (in-charge), acknowledged that many of the students had indeed passed when the scanned copy of the answer script was valuated. Based on the scanned copy of the answer scripts, students applied for revaluation on the hope that they would pass. However, they were informed by the controller of examination that there is no change in their marks, said the student. The students accused the staff overseeing the valuation of having messed it up.

“And to silence them and cover up their mistakes, one of the staff members in the department even gave money to the students to apply for re-valuation,” said one of the students.

The students alleged that when they raised the matter with the principal, she along with other staff members asked them to reappear for the paper in the coming semester exam instead of speaking about the goof-up. When contacted, college principal I Julie said the valuation is done twice and if the difference between the two marks is more than 10, they go for a third valuation. She said the valuation was carried out by qualified staff from other colleges.

On students carrying out protest seeking transparent revaluation and highlighting the flaws in the valuation with evidence, she said students will have to reappear for the exam.

She denied threatening the students for raising the issue.

The students have now sought the intervention of the regional joint director of collegiate education (RDJCE) Trichy to probe the irregularities in the semester exam evaluation process.

Indore: Former Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan, Indore MP Shankar Lalwani and BJP state chief Rakesh Singh were among 357 leaders and party workers arrested in Indore on Friday after a protest rally against alleged political bias in the ongoing crackdown on mafia.

BJP has alleged that its leaders and workers are being targeted in the name of action against mafia.

On Friday, around 1,000 BJP protesters marched towards the collectorate and tried to remove barricades.

Indore mayor Malini Gaud and MLAs Ramesh Mendola, Akash Vijayvargiya and Mahendra Hardia were also at the forefront. They were arrested and taken to the district jail in police vans. Later, SDM Rakesh Sharma granted them bail on the promise that they would not breach peace in the next six months.

“Under Kamal Nathji’s leadership, a chaotic government is operating in Madhya Pradesh and people of the state are unhappy. If anyone is happy, it is Nath’s ministers and Congress MLAs as they are looting the people of Madhya Pradesh. In the name of mafia eradication, they (government) are involved in extortion,” alleged Singh, accusing the government of not taking action against illegal construction by Congress leaders.

“We will not tolerate this biased behaviour. We had already informed the administration of our plan to enter the collectorate, but they arrested us,” Singh said.

On Bhopal MP Pragya Thakur receiving a threat letter and BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya showing concern over his safety, following his claim that a Bangladeshi terrorist was keeping a watch on him, Singh said, “The Madhya Pradesh government should seriously investigate it.

248,['25/01/2020'],"Human dam not at cost of tigers, corridor: Govt","This story is from January 25, 2020

Nagpur: Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday sent a clear message to the irrigation department officials that the Human major dam, proposed 3.5km from the boundary of Tadoba, should not be at the cost of the tiger corridor and ecology.

He was addressing a high-level meeting called at the insistence of former forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, who is desperately pushing the project in its present form. The project would need 1,925 hectare forest land, leading to felling of over 1.51 lakh trees, destroying 6-7km functional corridor.

The four-member NTCA committee in its November 2014 site appraisal report had recommended three options if at all the project was to be taken up.

The recommendations included shifting the project 5km upstream from present site at Sirkada. The other two options were procuring private land and rehabilitating villages to restore structural corridor of 2-3km downstream, and convert it into forest by planting native species, or develop lift irrigation schemes, barrages, small dams etc instead of a major dam.

However, the irrigation department ruled out the other two options and insisted on Option II by pitching to develop 1km corridor by acquiring 200 hectare land. It was not ready to talk about the other two options. Sources said CM Thackeray was clear and expressed his intention to save forests and corridors, just like he stopped tree felling in Aarey forest in Mumbai. “I will allow projects but at the same time saving tigers will also be my priority,” he said.

Sources said since no solution was working out, some experts of the state wildlife board asked the CM why Option I was not being implemented? “If the dam is shifted 5km upstream, the project will generate 6 TMC water, 3 TMC less than what has been proposed. So, what is the harm? It will save tigers and corridor, and project will also come up,” said sources.

To this, Thackeray agreed and asked the irrigation department to come up with a fresh proposal. Sources said irrigation officials will now work out five separate proposals, with scenarios for the project shifting 5km to 1km upstream.

While making these proposals irrigation officials said they will have to get forest clearance afresh. To this, Thackeray is learnt to have said that Mungantiwar can expedite it with the BJP government at the Centre and state will play its role here.

Vikram Kapur

HYDERABAD: India needs a counter-narrative, promoting harmony across religions, to balance the hate that’s seeped into our society today, said Vikram Kapur , an author and associate professor of English at the Shiv Nadar University .

Referring to partition and how it continues to be used “as a way to sustain and perpetuate the narrative of hatred”, he said: “Apart from only talking about who killed who during that time (or the 1984 riots for that matter), we should also talk about who saved who...what we need is harmony as we are becoming a very fractious society.”

Kapur was speaking on the sidelines of the three-day Hyderabad Literary Festival that began in the city on Friday. Among other things, the author has researched and written extensively about the 1984 riots in his novels.

“Three generations have grown up after partition. Then why is it still brought up again and again, either in the political or intellectual discourse, as sort of raison d'être for the path that we are on?... If we start pushing people of a certain community against the wall, there will come a point when they will retaliate,” the author said, while discussing the recent string of anti-CAA and NRC protests across India.

Pessimistic about India’s future, in case the climate of hate continues, he added: “While it is heartening that the recent protests saw people across faiths and backgrounds, and not just Muslims, come out and speak up, it is too early to say what will come out of it. How long can it be sustained? Will it lead to any real change in the way things are? We still don’t know.”

VISAKHAPATNAM: With the port city all set to become the state’s executive capital, there are apprehensions over the shifting of fishing harbour from beach road to the city’s northern outskirts. Fishing associations have already written to the state fisheries department to desist from taking any such step.

“Over 53,000 people, from Vizianagaram district in the north to Payakaraopeta in the south, depend on this fishing harbour, which is strategically located. It should not be shifted,” said Arjilli Dasu, executive director of Fisherfolk Foundation, a community body for AP fishermen.

Many fishermen have settled down in Jaalaripeta neighbourhood along the harbour over the years and it would difficult for them to shift base with their families, he said. “We have written to the fishing department commissioner in Vijayawada voicing our apprehensions. We request the government not to shift the fishing harbour from its present location,” added Dasu.

The state government should act immediately against those who are involved in damaging the statues,” said Stalin. “Even when he was alive, he was successful after facing several hurdles. Thus, by damaging his statue, his contribution to society cannot be forgotten,” said Vaiko in a statement. Vaiko wanted the government to take action against those involved in the vandalism. CPI state secretary R Mutharasan, in a statement, condemned the damage to the statues and said a protest will be held on Saturday against the vandalism. “The protest will be held at Chepauk and the party’s youth wing, women’s wing and others will participate,” said Mutharasan. PMK founder S Ramadoss, in a statement, said if there is opposition to what Periyar said, they should be opposed only in the form of debates or policies. “In the last few months, there have been several such incidents of statues of Thiruvalluvar and Periyar being damaged.

254,['25/01/2020'],Hyderabad: Osmania University will now evaluate PhD thesis online,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Osmania University

HYDERABAD: The Osmania University (OU) will now evaluate PhD thesis submitted by research scholars from all departments online following an online evaluation system launched by examination branch on Friday.

The move comes nearly a year after the university piloted onscreen evaluation system for undergraduate and postgraduate courses. The new evaluation system launched by the examination branch will not only enable students to submit their final PhD thesis but will also help them keep track of its progress.

“After clearing their thesis through plagiarism software, the students will have to submit a soft-copy on the website. Evaluators will have access to the thesis being uploaded on the website through which they can commence evaluation,” said Prof Sriram Venkatesh, controller of examination, OU.

The university receives nearly 400 thesis on an average every year. The system is likely to speed up the evaluation process as evaluators would no longer have to physically check dozens of hard-copies. The website will address postage delay, reduce use of paper stationary and students visits to the examination branch for regular updates. While supervisors can concentrate on evaluation, scholars can plan career in advance during the process.

For the next six months, the university will provide both online and offline evaluation of PhD thesis before it completely shifts to the online version.

It may be recalled that in 2018, the examination branch had launched a similar PhD thesis online monitoring system which helped research scholars and supervisors know the status of thesis evaluation from time to time. “The monitoring system launched back then could not take off due to some technical errors. This time, we have integrated several processes such as selection of PhD thesis by supervisors, generation of final certificate etc.,” said Prof Venkatesh.

Visakhapatnam: Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) in the city are leading the charge in making Visakhapatnam do well in Swachh Survekshan 2020. Adjudged the third cleanest city in 2017, the city had slipped to the seventh position in 2018 and subsequently to the 23rd position in 2019.

The Andhra Pradesh Federation of RWAs (APFERWAS) joined the campaign on January 19 to spread awareness about submitting citizen’s feedback for SS2020, to improve the city’s chances this year. Members from all 130 RWAs from the city’s six zones gathered across major parks and rythu bazaars and distributed pamphlets explaining the procedure of submitting feedback.

There are four ways to submit feedback: giving a missed call to 1969, through the Swachhata app, through the Vote For Your City app or by logging in to www.swachhsurvekshan2020,org, informed representatives of APFERWAS.

The members also explained the manner in which the eight questions have to be answered, especially with regard to the ODF (Open Defecation Free) and GFC (Garbage Free City) status of the city. Speaking to TOI, vice-president of APFERWAS said, “Citizen’s feedback has high weightage and serves as a performance indicator in the overall ranking. Therefore, we have made it a point to sensitise people.”

“Waste segregation is also a major component in the survey. Hence, the RWAs have been striving to implement waste segregation in their respective wards,” Murthy added.

The APFERWAS president further said that while most colonies like JR Nagar and Kirlampudi layout are segregating wet and dry waste and preparing their own compost, there are some RWAs still which need to follow suit.

256,['25/01/2020'],Leopard knocked dead on NH7 outside Pench,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Nagpur: Death of an adult female leopard in road hit on NH-44 (NH-7) on Friday morning has once again raised the issue of curtailed mitigation structures by Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, under alleged political pressure.

The full-grown leopard was knocked dead by an unidentified speeding vehicle from Madhya Pradesh near Harnakund Nalla in Paoni range. The area is part of the unified control of Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR), Maharashtra.

This is the same spot near compartment number 582 in Palora beat of Paoni where a tiger was knocked down by the vehicle of a former BJP MLA from Ramtek on February 3, 2019. It is close to a minor bridge and mitigation structure number 6. This is the fourth accident in last 17 months involving big cats in the region.

On July 16, 2018, a full-grown leopard died in road hit while crossing the road outside Mansinghdeo Wildlife Sanctuary, now part of Pench. On December 16, 2018, another leopard died after it was hit by a vehicle near Deolapar, a few kilometres away from the spot where Friday’s leopard died. Similarly, on July 9, 2019, a tiger crossing the widened NH-7 had jumped the crash barrier to cross over to the other side.

One of the reasons greens blamed to such mishaps involving wild animals was curtailed mitigation measures. “It is true that some animals will die until they become familiar to underpasses. But the structure number 6 near Paoni, where the leopard was hit, was originally to be built 200 metres but it was curtailed to 65 metres. Height of the structure was also reduced from 7 metres to 5 metres,” said Udayan Patil, one of the petitioners in PIL on NH-7.

“The NHAI is also not paying heed to the demand for noise barriers at vulnerable spots. Secondly, height of 50-metre-long structure number 9 near Chorbahuli was to be 5 metres but it has been reduced to 3 metres. There is water logging and the issue has still not resolved. Many more such mishaps involving animals cannot be ruled out,” Patil cautioned.

On the contrary, WII tiger scientist Dr Bilal Habib, who prepared the mitigation report, said, “If you want 100% prevention of animal deaths then fencing is the option so that animal is diverted to cross the passes.”

“At low traffic, animals tend to cross but the time when the leopard was hit is the time when vehicles are in speed. In such cases, areas between crossing zones need to be fenced to avoid deaths,” said Habib.

Habib argued, “If the underpass would have been 200 metres and death would have occurred, still people would have said it should have been a 300 metres underpass.”

However, wildlife lover Sandeep Singh says, “Fencing is not the complete solution as it will block the corridors and block free movement of animals.”

Visakhapatnam: The hotel industry in the city is hoping for a boom in business once Vizag becomes the executive capital of the state.

Speaking to TOI, president of the Andhra Pradesh Hotel Association (APHA), T Satyanarayana said the floating population in the city is likely to increase once the capital shifts to Vizag. At present, the city has over 600 restaurants, but the number, including high-end hotels, will rise to accommodate the demands of a growing population, he said, adding that another 100 restaurants are expected to set up shop soon.

Dismissing rumours that prices at restaurants and hotels will see a sharp rise, Satyanarayana said a ten per cent increase is likely at most and competition among businesses would ensure that prices remain at a uniform level.

O Naresh Kumar, CEO of a city-based IT firm, said the state government should take steps to boost nightlife by increasing police patrolling and providing adequate public transport, along the lines of the Maharashtra government’s decision to allow shopping malls and restaurants to remain open round-the-clock. “We expect the executive capital to change the face of Vizag and attract investors,” Naresh Kumar said and added that a separate wing of the police for tourism, another cybercrime police station and a police station to deal with property-related cases are needed to make the city safer and investor-friendly.

A few hoteliers said the government had issued an order allowing licensed restaurants, hotels and eateries to remain open till midnight, extending closing hours from 10.30 pm, to ensure visitors arriving late at night face no inconvenience. The police, however, are closing businesses by 11 pm but hoteliers expect at least 30 per cent of restaurants to remain open round-the-clock once the capital shifts to Vizag, they said.

TRICHY: This 19-year-old youth from KK Nagar would not have imagined that he will be asked to regulate traffic in Trichy city on Friday for blatantly violating road rules by riding a bike drunk with four friends on the pillion seat at Kattur in 2018.

The youth was the cynosure of all those who crossed the traffic signal MGR statue roundabout from 9 am as he appeared on the road with the jersey of traffic police over his plain clothes. A few curious people who enquired with the policemen were told that it was indeed a punishment. “I was 17 years old then and was riding the bike drunk with my friends on the pillion. Our bike skidded, we fell on the road and were caught by the police for violating the traffic. I realize now the danger that rash and negligent riding poses for others,” said the boy at lunch break on the first day of his two-day traffic duty.

“As we got the order yesterday, he has been assigned the task of regulating traffic under the supervision of traffic police,” said assistant commissioner of police, traffic Arunachalam. Juvenile Justice Board (JJB), Trichy which passed the order a week ago termed the assignment a community service to make the boy realize his violation. Carrying out the trials of cases of juveniles in conflict with law, JJB headed by a chairperson and two members will forgive the juveniles after confirming their crime.

A former member of JJB, Trichy M Padmavathy, said the objective of JJB is to ensure that the juvenile in conflict with law is socially integrated and not singled out in the society. “Social integration of the juvenile in conflict with law should be paramount or the concept of the juvenile justice Act will fail if he/she is left without any measure of rehabilitation,” she said.

Chandrapur/Yavatmal: State minister for relief and rehabilitation and guardian minister of Chandrapur Vijay Wadettiwar on Friday directed setting up of a committee to review the liquor ban in Chandrapur district. Just a day earlier, water conservation minister and NCP state president Jayant Patil had supported NGO Swamini Daru Bandi Samiti’s demand for a ban on liquor in the farm suicide capital Yavatmal.

Chandrapur collector Kunal Khemnar will form a seven-member committee, including government and non-government members, by next week to review the liquor ban. Wadettiwar wanted the committee to evaluate the status and success prohibition, before the government takes a call on lifting prohibition.

“Formal directives with details of number of members, scope of committee and its timeline is expected in next couple of days,” Khemnar told TOI.

Sources close to Wadettiwar said the panel will have seven members and get a month to submit its report. The committee will analyse any improvement in health of citizens, and reduction in addiction after the ban. It will also scrutinize reports of rise in drug smuggling and addiction, including use of small children in this.

The BJP-led government had declared liquor ban in Chandrapur on April 1, 2015, following the initiative of then finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar. Now, over five years of ban, police have booked 37,214 offences in connection with liquor smuggling, sale and possession, and arrested 41,995 accused by the end of 2019. Illegal liquor worth Rs93.70 crores was seized and 8,024 vehicles confiscated for the smuggling. The total booty seized is worth Rs219 crore.

Meanwhile, on Thursday, Patil forwarded a memorandum submitted to him by the delegation of Swamini Daru Bandi Samiti of Yavatmal to excise minister Dilip Valse Patil. Patil was move the crying old tribal woman, Motibai Todsam of Ghatanji, who cried while asking the minister, “How long should I suffer and face the thrashing of my drunkard hubby?”

The Swamini Samiti had, during the ‘Hallabol’ padyatra of NCP by MP Supriya Sule, Jayant Patil and Dhananjay Munde, extracted a promise to ban liquor in Yavatmal if their party comes to power. On July 17, 2018, Jayant Patil had also raised the issue in the legislature and demanded a ban.

Patil has now again assured the Swamini activists he would support liquor ban in Yavatmal.

BJP state president Kakasaheb Danve too had, at the behest of then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, given a written assurance to Swamini Samiti to appoint a commission to study the liquor ban in Yavatmal. Nothing had come out of the assurance.

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has finalised three sites for housing projects under ‘the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). The civic body has submitted a proposal to the district collector seeking permission for acquiring the sites at Teesgaon, Brijwadi and Kanchanwadi.

“The sites shortlisted by the civic body will be used to raise affordable housing projects under the central governmen’s PMAY scheme. A 52-acre land in Teesgaon surrounded by hills and a water body has been finalised for the PMAY project,” said mayor Nandkumar Ghodele.

“We have submitted a proposed to the district collector for the acquisition of the land. The proposal is likely to get approved,” Ghodele said.

The municipal corporation has also identified a 22.5 acre land in Brijwadi and 2.5 acre land in Kanchanwadi for the housing projects. The proposal for land acquisition will soon be sent to the district collector for approval.

Meanwhile, land in Mitmita on the outskirts of the city and a site in Karodi on the Mumbai highway which were earlier considered for housing projects have been struck off.

Municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey had visited the said lands and assessed the sites for feasibility of the project.

The AMC is also seeking to acquire 72-acre in Mitmita for tiger and lion safari park. This will be in addition to the 123-acre that has already been earmarked for the safari park.

As many as 85,000 residents of the city had applied to the civic body seeking benefit of the Centre’s housing scheme.

However, the AMC found that only 52,000 applicants were eligible for the scheme. The beneficiaries will get affordable housing through different components of the PMAY.

In April 2019, the municipal corporation conducted a camp for 731 applicants who had applied for financial support of Rs 2.5 lakh under the PMAY for building a house.

The AMC is also responsible for building a township for applicants from economically weaker sections. The civic body will seek help of other agencies for the project. It is currently in the process of acquiring land for the same.

Aurangabad: Oncologists on Friday said changes in lifestyle, use of pesticide and exposure to radiation could not be ruled out as reasons for paediatric cancer.

Addressing a a workshop at the Government Cancer Hospital on Friday, the oncologists said cases of paediatric cancer have doubled in the developing countries over the past 10 years.

The paediatric oncology department of Government Cancer Hospital (GCH) held the workshop in association with NGO CanKids Kidscan, Aurangabad Academy of Paediatrics and Indian Academy of Paediatrics- Haematology Oncology Chapter.

Aditi Lingayat, organising secretary and head of the paediatric oncology department, GMCH Aurangabad, said the rise in the number of paediatric cancer patients could be attributed to the changes in lifestyle, use of pesticides and exposure to radiation.

The experts said hematolymphoid (blood and blood components) tumours and cancers of kidney, liver and brain were most common among children. “There is 70% cure in usual cases and the percentage goes up to 90 in the early stage of diagnosis,” said Farookh Aziz, an associate professor at GMCH.

TRICHY: For 16-year-old A Radhika, it was a dream-come-true when she secured the third place in her debut national event in road cycling at Pune on December 29. Born to daily wagers, the girl who studies in a government school in Trichy district, however, thanks her friend for lending his carbon wheels for the 65th national school games 2019-20 where the tough and better-off show their mettle.Though she had bagged several medals in state-level tournaments Radhika knew that her alloy wheels may not help at the national school games. Organized by School Games Federation of India for under-19 girls, the event sees participants from across the country with better road bikes.Radhika has been getting good support for her endeavour from elder brother A Muruganandam, 27, a mechanic. However, they could not afford a pair of carbon wheels worth Rs 50,000. “We managed to assemble her whole cycle for Rs 50,000 after much hardship. Getting a pair of wheels alone for that much money was simply unimaginable,” said Muruganandam. It was then that a friend offered the carbon wheels and he is overjoyed to see his sister making her national debut impressively.Her win has now given them hope and he expects her to keep the momentum in the upcoming events as well. Rajesh C, an international cyclist and Radhika’s coach for the last four years, said cycling is all about equipment.

Bareilly: The Bareilly Development Authority (BDA) has identified around 200 under-construction residential colonies being developed illegally within the city and its outskirts.

According to BDA records, nearly 230 residential colonies have come up in different parts of the city, of which, around 40 colonies are developed or being constructed under the BDA guidelines. BDA officials said that “warning” notices are being served to builders, following which, demolition of these unauthorised colonies will be initiated.

A recent survey stated that several residential colonies were developed against the development authority’s guidelines. BDA vice-chairperson Divya Mittal said, “Around 40 residential colonies, in areas such as Ramganga Nagar, Biharman Nagla, Transport Nagar, and other colonies registered in Real Estate Regulatory Act (RERA) are developed as per the rules while the rest have made serious violations. They are either developing the structure against the approved building plan, occupying government land such as using greenbelt area or setting up commercial development on layout passed under residential category and vice-versa.”

Unauthorised residential colonies have come up at Pilibhit Bypass road, Dohra road, Biharman Nagla, Kargaina-Budaun road, Jogi Navada, Lal Phatak road and Shahjahanpur road Chawni, among others. Mittal added, “Legal action will be initiated against all such unauthorised construction.”

The BDA VC further said, “An action plan is being prepared against unauthorised construction. Besides, we will apprise other government authorities such as municipal corporation, power department to mandatorily cross-verify the approved building plans ahead of giving water/electricity connections.”

In the past few days, the BDA has demolished three under-construction residential colonies in Bara Bypass, Izzatnagar and Bhojipura. Eleven under-construction shops being illegally developed on building layout plan approved by BDA under ‘residential category’ near Dohra road were also pulled down.

Aurangabad: The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) on Friday launched the party’s state-level women’s wing ahead of the civic elections likely to be held in April this year.

The unit will have women party workers from various sections of society, said party officials present at its launch ceremony at the Maulana Azad Research Centre here. MP Imtiaz Jaleel, who is also the state president of MIM, declared lawyer Asma Shaikh president of its women’s wing named after Razia Sultana.

A number of MIM women functionaries, including some corporators, attended the launch event. Addressing the event, Jaleel said women were leading various movements across the country, including the one at Shaheen Bagh. “We have had women corporators in the civic body, but there was a need for an organised unit. Our new wing will be instrumental in addressing the misconception that MIM is a party for only Muslims. If we want to contest the attempts to weaken the Constitution, we should come together forgetting caste and religions,” he said.

271,['25/01/2020'],Jagan’s mass contact programme Pallebata to commence from Feb 1,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Amaravati: Following in his father YS Rajasekhara Reddy’s footsteps, chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy is scheduled to start his village tours programme ‘ Pallebata ’ from February 1. The initiative is similar to the ‘Rachabanda’ programme started by YSR when he was CM of undivided AP.

Though Jagan has been addressing public meetings to announce the launch of welfare schemes, he has been out of mass contact since coming into power about seven months ago. Now that most of his government’s welfare programmes have been grounded, the CM feels the time is right to start his mass contact initiative, where he would get to interact with people directly and check if the welfare schemes were reaching the beneficiaries.

Interestingly, he will be touring the villages even while farmers continue their protests in Amaravati against the government’s decision to shift the capital. However, the YSRC believes the issue is confined to only 29 villages in the area and not in other parts of the state. In fact, Jagan is likely make a strong pitch on decentralisation of development during his mass contact programme.

The chief minister is also banking on the many welfare schemes launched by his government to make his standing among the people intact. Besides Raithu Bharosa for farmers, financial assistance to auto and taxi drivers, tailors, weavers and women from self-help groups, the government has disbursed nearly Rs 6,500 crore for Amma Vodi scheme. The process of identifying those who were left out of the scheme in the first phase is on, and the amount is likely to be remitted to the beneficiaries’ bank accounts in the first week of February.

The Arogya Sri scheme has been revamped through the addition of more diseases in the list and expansion of hospital chain to neighbouring states. The government’s initiative to renovate schools and hospitals has also gone down well with the people. Though there was some uproar over shortage of sand during the initial months of the government, the issue has now subsided after the government streamlined the supplies.

Sewage water in a house at Srinivasapuram in Pattinampakkam

CHENNAI: Residents of housing board tenements for economically weaker sections in Srinivasapuram , Pattinapakkam , face a hard time as sewage has entered their homes.

Toilets began flooding in at least six houses in a building on Wednesday night. The water mixed with raw sewage later entered the hall and kitchen. “We were sleeping on the floor when we realised that our room was filled with drainage water. It was disgusting and stinking,” said A Pushkala, a resident. Pushkala and her two daughters stayed up all night removing the water and cleaning their house. “Our house is a mess, but the water flow has not stopped,” she said Residents said last week their street was clogged with sewage. When they contacted local officials, they inspected the spot and said the pipes needed repair.

“We saw a few workers cleaning the drains, but now the same thing is happening inside our homes,” said A Suguna, another resident. Suguna lives in a one-room tenement with her four siblings, all aged over 35 and diagnosed with spinocerebellar degeneration, a rare genetic disorder often associated with poor coordination of eyes, hands and speech. Due to their condition, the four can’t walk and are confined within the house. “I have been trying to relocate them to a friend or a relative’s place, but everyone seems too busy to take them in,” said Suguna. She has now erected a small tent outside their home, where her brothers and sister can sleep. “There is only one bed in the house and due to the stench and sewage, mosquitoes are swarming everywhere. We sleep outside now,” she said. Some residents have moved their furniture to their friends’ homes to avoid damage and are using public toilets and having food from nearby stalls. They blame the local officials for ignoring their plight, despite repeated calls. “It’s been two days and we have been staying outside. Our house is not in a liveable condition, we hope the authorities repair sewage lines,” said Suguna.

A corporation engineer in the area said, “We suspect that something went wrong when the workers were clearing the blockage in the drains on the street. We will fix it.”

274,['25/01/2020'],Builder penalized for unfair trade practice,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Pune: The additional district consumer court here has directed the proprietor of a realty firm to refund amounts in the range of Rs6.70 lakh to Rs12.47 lakh with 18% per annum interest to four home buyers in a stalled housing project at Dongargaon in Haveli taluka.

In a recent order, the bench of the court president JV Deshmukh and members Shubhangi Dunakhe and Anil Jawalekar also directed Sumit Kumar Bhalotia, proprietor of Spark Realty, to pay Rs55,000 each to the four complainants towards compensation and legal costs. The court has given the proprietor a month from the date of receipt of the order to comply with the same, failing which an interest at 21% per annum will apply.

In January 2015, the complainants — Sameer P Deshmukh and Govind P Khatri from Akola, Prabhakar B Deshmukh from Buldhana and Vrishali V Deshpande from New Delhi — had booked flats in ‘Spark Urban Bliss’ housing project floated by Bhalotia’s firm. Deshmukh and Khatri paid Rs6.70 lakh each while Prabhakar Deshmukh paid Rs9.37 lakh and Deshpande paid Rs12.47 lakh towards part consideration, stamp duty and registration fees.

Lawyer Nilesh Bhandari, who represented the complainants, said, “An agreement to sale was registered between the builder and each of the four complainants. The builder had promised to deliver possession of the flats within 30 months from the date of agreement executed on January 6, 2015. However, the project never took off and the complainants started pursuing the builder for a refund. They approached the additional district consumer court when the builder failed to refund their money with interest.” Lawyer Mohnish Patekar also represented the complainants in the matter.

Along with their complaints, the home buyers had submitted all supporting receipts and documents showing their transaction with the builder and the same was not denied by the latter in his written version to the court. The builder had opposed the complaints on the grounds that the same were barred by limitation, but the court observed that there was a continuous cause of action owing to the builder’s failure to comply with the promise made in the agreement.

The bench held, “The complainants had paid the part consideration, though opponent (builder) agreed to deliver the possession of flat within 30 months from the date of execution of the agreement, opponent had not delivered possession to the complainants. Thus, there is a delay in giving possession of the flats. Therefore, complainants are entitled to receive the payment made by them.”

The bench further held, “Taking a huge amount from the complainants, not complying with the terms of the agreement and non-refund of the amount by the opponent are the reasons to conclude that the opponent is not only involved in unfair trade practice but caused harassment and mental agony to the complainants to which he is liable to pay compensation.”

PANAJI: The 15th finance commission , which concluded its three-day visit to the state on Friday, said that Goa has a long way to go to achieve its growth potential. Commission chairman N K Singh said that the state faces “huge challenges” when it comes to solid waste management, drainage and sanitation.Aside from addressing legacy issues, Goa also needs to find efficient ways of resource mobilization if it wants to fund its growth, Singh said in his brief remarks.“Goa’s growth potential has yet to be fully exploited, although Goa has achieved notable progress,” said Singh. “Has it reached or is it close to reaching its growth potential?”My reply would be no, because I think Goa has huge opportunities and we need to have a combination of measures which will help it achieve its growth potential.”Singh was speaking to reporters after the finance commission concluded all stakeholder meetings. The commission will now study the state government’s financial proposals and then decide on the quantum of grants that need to be devolved to Goa.The commission has already finalised the allocation for the first financial year (2021), but will be giving an award for five more years from 2021-2026. The report on the award of funds for 2021 is expected to be released soon after Parliament’s budget session. The report for five years will have to be presented by October 30.The Goa government has asked for funds for agriculture, solid waste management, disaster management, tourism and renewable energy. The commission agreed on the identified sectors but made certain additional observations.“You cannot get improved demographic management without social sector expenditure,” said Singh. “With regard to solid waste management, drainage, and sanitation, Goa has huge challenges which lie ahead, apart from the legacy issues that Goa has inherited. That is something the Goa government must focus on.”The finance commission said that the Goa government also needs to prioritise agricultural productivity, diversification of crops and pattern of agriculture in the state.The Goa government, Singh said, has asked for a special package to compensate for mining losses, the sluggishness in the growth of tourism, sanitation and improved solid waste management. Singh also admitted that Goa had sought for greater devolution of funds, seeking 50% in the share of central taxes against the present 42%. The chairman also agreed that Goa voiced a concern that the state was not being recognized and incentivised for having better human indices and demographic factors.“We will see how best we can balance need, equity and efficiency,” Singh said. “We recognize the role Goa can play in improving India’s overall economic growth, and we recognize that Goa has achieved notable success in several parameters.”",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73601661,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110726,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-growth-potential-yet-to-be-achieved-fin-commission/articleshow/73595493.cms

Chennai: Taking note of increasing incidents of anonymous defamatory and derogatory statements/videos being uploaded and circulated on social media , the Madras high court on Friday directed the Tamil Nadu Director-General of Police to apprise it on the mechanism available to tackle the issue.

Justice M Dhandapani also directed the DGP to file a comprehensive report on the action taken against such persons by January 29. The judge passed the interim order while hearing the bail application moved by A Maruthachalam of Coimbatore who was arrested for uploading a video denigrating a sitting judge of the high court. When the plea came up for hearing, the petitioner submitted that he had no role in uploading the video and claimed he had been falsely implicated in the case.

Noting that the contention of the petitioner was not satisfactory, Justice Dhandapani said, “In recent days, defamatory statements criticising persons holding constitutional posts and their families are being circulated by several persons without any evidence to substantiate their claims.”

To curb such illegal activities it would suffice to issue directions to the cybercrime branch of police to ascertain whether there was any mechanism available to nab such offenders, the judge said and directed the DGP to file the report.

277,['25/01/2020'],Rs 50-cr boost to increase capacity of Nigdi WTP,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Pimpri Chinchwad: The civic body has made a budgetary provision of Rs 50 crore for augmenting the capacity of the water treatment plant in Nigdi by 100 MLD, the work for which is expected to start before March 31.

The capacity boost aims at meeting the needs of the growing population in Pimpri Chinchwad and ensuring adequate water distribution in the areas reeling under low-pressure supply.

“There was no budgetary provision for the project in the current budget. With the allocation of Rs 50 crore now, we can invite bids for allotting the contract for the project,” Makrand Nikam, chief of the water supply department of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), said.

The provision was made in the budget after the general body of the PCMC recently approved a short-notice resolution in this regard.

Nikam said, “The PCMC lifts water from Pavana river at Ravet bund through the pumping station, which has 20 pumps.”

“Of these, 16 pumps will be replaced to increase their pumping capacity,” Nikam added

A senior civic official said the PCMC would pay additional charges for lifting another 100 MLD from Pavana river.

278,['25/01/2020'],Pune: Survey for underground metro in final stages,"This story is from January 25, 2020

The work on the underground tunnels has started

PUNE: The structural integrity audit of more than 1,600 buildings along the underground Metro alignment is in the home stretch.

Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) had embarked on the exercise six months ago, and officials said only 200 buildings were left to be studied. An official said they were speaking to the owners of these buildings in a bid to speed up the survey so that a report can be submitted to Pune Municipal Corporation .

“Our teams have finished the survey of most of the stretch between Budhwar Peth and Swargate. The owners of the 200 structures have raised some queries ... we are holding talks with them,” a MahaMetro official said.

Buildings that are within a 50m radius of the underground tunnel’s alignment come under the ambit of the survey, which includes a detailed inspection of the building’s overall state, the condition of each wall and cracks, if any. All these details are documented and photographed.

“During the inspections completed so far, the surveyors have identified four weak structures, all of them in the Kasba Peth area. We will be handing over a detailed report to the owners and also to PMC about these weak or vulnerable structures once the entire survey is completed. We have the option of rehabilitating the families in another location during the tunnelling work as a precautionary measure. MahaMetro will work on this along with PMC,” a senior MahaMetro official said.

The survey is a compulsory part of the underground tunnelling work. MahaMetro has already completed a similar survey on the Agriculture College-Budhwar Peth stretch, in which not a single structure was found to be dangerous.

The tunnel is being bored 20 metres below the ground level and officials said this minimizes the chances of any buildings being damaged. Two tunnel-boring machines have already been pressed into action and are drilling a tunnel through the layer of basaltic rock under Pune.

Representative image

BENGALURU: To put an end to the seat-blocking scam in medical colleges, the government is thinking of increasing penalty for candidates who reserve seats only to surrender them after the mop-up round.

Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences submitted a report to the medical education department recently, recommending the existing rules be changed.

“We want to bring in a rule that no seat can be surrendered after the mop-up round,” said Dr CN Ashwath Narayan , deputy chief minister and minister for medical education. The minister said he will place the report before the cabinet for approval.

Seats surrendered after the mop-up round are transferred to the management quota and sold at high prices. Penalty would be exempted in certain cases when the candidate would surrender a seat even after the mop-up round in case s/he got a seat in a better medical college.

However, the provision was misused by some candidates and colleges, leading to the infamous seat-blocking scam. The RGUHS report said students must be discouraged from surrendering seats and the penalty be increased to Rs 25 lakh from the existing Rs 5 lakh. Further, no medical college should admit a student after the cutoff date to avoid misuse.

Pune: The Maharashtra Sainik Welfare Board plans to shut down its pension cell in February over ‘unsatisfactory performance’ in the last three months.

The cell had resolved 1.16 lakh cases, mostly related to pensions of ex-servicemen since it was set up in January 2013 and get about Rs 8 crore in arrears for ex-servicemen’s families.

The board’s officiating director Laxminaryan Mishra told TOI, “The decision to close down was taken after an assessment of the number of pension matters processed and resolved over the last three months and other factors.”

“It is imperative for the director to understand the complexity in a single case. It is tedious and time-consuming and resolving one case requires significant efforts,” Group Captain (retired) SS Phatak, who is an in-charge of the cell, told TOI.

According to the cell’s records, of the 1.16 cases, 16,540 cases were of widows of ex-servicemen and war widows of the soldiers who died in wars and operations.

“In many cases, the basic information such as date of birth, spelling of the name and qualifying service of individual soldier are wrong. We have to first process the papers with the records office of the unit or regiment. We then need to take it up with the principal controller of defence accounts. On many occasions, we have to maintain long correspondence. One needs to understand each case is peculiar and hence the difficulty level,” Phatak added.

A record of each case is being maintained by the cell. “We do a periodic analysis of each case and follow it up with the authorities to resolve matters,” Phatak said.

Some cases like Kashibai Yadav (85), a WWII widow, are unique. She drew a pension of Rs 8,000. “The pension cell followed up our case with the government for more than a year. Now, my mother gets more than Rs 30,000 as pension. Besides, we got Rs 24 lakh in four decades of arrears. My mother could get what was due to her only because of the cell,” Pandit, her son, told TOI over phone from Solapur.

The cell also helped 72-year-old Chitra Samant, widow of Vir Chakra awardee Lieutenant Suresh Samant, get her pension dues after a few decades.

Amaravati: Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy has directed officials to accept fresh application for house sites across the state to cover all eligible beneficiaries . He particularly asked them to ensure that every eligible poor family gets a house plot by Ugadi festival.

“Officials should work overtime if required to achieve the goal as giving house sites to the poor is the government’s top priority. All 25 lakh people should get house sites by Ugadi,” the CM said during a review meeting to check the progress of identification of beneficiaries and land availability, on Friday.

He told officials not to take the Praja Sadhikara Survey (PSS) as benchmark to identify the beneficiaries, but carry out physical field-level verification. “The sites identified for the purpose should be congenial for living. The beneficiaries should be happy about the plots allotted to them. Site allotment should be made only after the beneficiary is satisfied. He should be able to grow plants on the plots. I request you to take enough care so that no one is left out,” the CM said.

He also asked officials to allot suitable alternative plots to those who were living on encroached lands, adding he would make surprise visits to villages from February 1 to review the implementation of the programme.

Madurai: Madras high court has directed a retired police official, against whom the Madurai idol wing sleuths have registered a case, to appear before the investigating officer on his plea for anticipatory bail. The prosecution said petitioner K Balasubramanian, 74, a resident of Madurai, was working as SI attached to Moolakaraipatti police station in Tirunelveli district and was entrusted with the investigation of various idol theft cases while on special duty between 1977-78. The prosecution said it had received a complaint from a person named R Dhanasekaran that Balasubramanian had trespassed into a place of worship and stolen an idol during this period.

Based on the complaint, a criminal case was registered against him under IPC section 457 (2) by the Madurai idol wing police. The petitioner said he had discharged his duty diligently as the investigating officer as a result of which 14 notorious criminals involved in idol theft were arrested. He had recovered the stolen idols which have been marked as material object in the concerned criminal courts and he had assisted the prosecution resulting in the conviction of all the accused. All these recovered idols were returned to the concerned temples. He said he had retired from service as inspector of police in 2005. It is unfortunate that the police are suspecting an honest officer for the incident which occurred 40 years ago based on the complaint of a person. He stated he is suffering from heart disease and other age-related ailments.

He is ready to cooperate with the investigation but if he is arrested it would result in loss of his reputation. Hence he moved the HC Madurai bench seeking anticipatory bail in the case registered against him. When the petition was heard on Friday, Justice G R Swaminathan directed the petitioner to appear before the investigating officer on Monday and cooperate with the inquiry. The case was adjourned to January 29 for further hearing. tnn

U V Bakre

PANAJI: After four years of being headless and six months of being non-functional, the Goa Human Rights Commission (GHRC) will soon be at full strength. The state government has cleared the file to appoint former high court judge U V Bakre as its new chairperson , with former district judges Pramod Kamat and Desmond D’Costa as its other members.

An official said the file has been moved to the governor for the constitution of the new commission. The only member of the commission, former judge A D Salkar, completed his term in July 2019.

Since then, the body has been non-functional.

But it had been headless since March 2016, when former Patna high court chief justice P K Misra retired. After the retirement, Salkar was appointed acting chairman.

However, whenever orders passed by Salkar reached the high court, it observed that the post could be only occupied by a retired chief justice of a high court or chief justice or judge of the Supreme Court.

A senior government officer said that later, the Centre permitted state governments to appoint a former high court judge as chairperson of the commission.

The commission had a single member since September 2018, when J A Keny expired. And after Salkar retired, the commission was rendered virtually defunct. It ceased to pass orders, issue noticed, conduct investigations and hold proceedings.

When functioning, the commission received an average of five complaints a week and hears up to 12 cases a day.

PUNE: The cold may return to most parts of Maharashtra at the start of February. But, north Madhya Maharashtra and central Konkan, including districts like Nashik, Jalgaon, border areas of north Pune district, may still see slightly warmer than normal winter nights, a fresh extended range forecast on Friday by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.Winter has a little more than a month left to recede from the country, but minimum temperatures have remained above normal levels during most days in north Madhya Maharashtra.The extended range forecast for the next two weeks seems to indicate that though minimum temperatures would be normal to below normal over vast regions of the country till February 6, north Madhya Maharashtra, central Konkan and parts of south India may not record a significant fall in minimum temperatures.The extended range forecast shows one patch (north Madhya Maharashtra, including parts of north Pune district) in Maharashtra that could still see slightly above normal minimum temperature till February 6 when the rest of the state may record below normal night temperatures. But forecasters say that beginning of February is still likely to register more instances of winter-like night temperatures than January.Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD Pune told TOI, “During the week January 31 to February 6, though the night minimum temperatures are likely to continue to remain below the normal to near normal over major parts of India, we foresee slightly above normal minimums in parts of north Madhya Maharashtra and a small portion of central Konkan during that period. Meanwhile, coastal, south interior Karnataka, Rayalaseema, south coastal Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, are likely to be markedly above normal during some of the days.”He said the penetration of northerly winds in many parts of the state, except Vidarbha has been short-lived this season hence Madhya Maharashtra did not experience the cold this winter.“There has not been a period this winter when the penetration of cold winds from the western Himalayan region has been continuous in Maharashtra, especially parts of north Madhya Maharashtra, Marathwada and areas of Konkan. These winds can penetrate only for a couple of days and then they are cut off due to the position of the anti-cyclone over central India, time to time over Rajasthan and other time due to presence of easterly/south-easterly winds over the state,” Kashyapi said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73608668,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-266386,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/northerlies-may-bring-chill-back-to-parts-of-state-in-early-february/articleshow/73595619.cms
287,['25/01/2020'],PMC plans to come up with yet another traffic education park,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Pune Municipal Corporation

PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) plans to launch yet another traffic education initiative at Indraprastha garden in Yerawada at a cost of Rs4 crore, even though its earlier attempts at setting up such facilities at Chittaranjan Watika in Model colony and at Sarasbaug have come a cropper.

Vijay Kumbhar of Surajya Sangharsha Samittee, a citizens’ group, who conducts the ‘RTI Katta’ programme at Chittaranjan Watika garden, said that he has hardly seen anyone use the facility developed for traffic education. “I have been conducting the programme for around five years now. But I have not seen anybody use the facility. Even the upkeep of the infrastructure is not good,” he pointed out.

Civic officials said various equipment will be installed at the Indraprastha garden to educate children on traffic rules. Police and experts will conduct training sessions on traffic rules.

A proposal regarding setting up the park has been tabled before the city improvement committee. The park will have models of roads, signals, intersections and bridges. Pathways will also be created for pedestrians and bicycle users.

Simulators for two-wheelers, three-wheelers and four-wheelers will be installed to provide driving lessons to citizens. The park will also have a play area and a jungle gym. As per the civic body’s plan, around 2.5 acres of land will be needed for the project.

Activists said that though such projects are useful, the civic administration should make sure that the existing projects are put to good use before starting new ones. “The civic administration should check the usability of the project and footfall before spending public money. The PMC had started traffic education projects at parks here earlier as well but most of them are unused. Efforts should be made to ensure that earlier projects are used by people rather than starting new ones,” said Kumbhar.

However, the PMC officials said that the concept of the existing traffic parks and the one being proposed at Yerawada is different. “The new park will have actual training facility for driving along with traffic awareness. Other parks are confined to creating basic awareness about the rules and signages. The project will become a reality once it receives clearance from the civic committees,” the official said.

CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Friday ordered notice to the state government on a public interest litigation moved by a lawyer seeking to extend Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) protection to the entire high court premises and other subordinate courts in the state.

Advocate R Y George Williams also wanted the court to direct the authorities to install CCTV cameras in all the courts across the state to ensure effective surveillance.

Admitting the plea, a division bench of Justices M Sathyanarayanan and R Hemalatha directed the authorities to file their response by March 4.

According to the petitioner, the high court premises alone was brought under CISF protection since November 16, 2015. However, protection is not provided to other courts on the premises, including family courts, small causes court and labour court. Citing a series of crimes committed both inside and outside the subordinate courts on the high court premises, the petitioner highlighted the need to extend CISF protection to the other courts as well.

N Chandrababu Naidu

AMARAVATI: TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu on Friday vowed to revive the legislative council if TDP wins the 2024 assembly elections in the state. He, however, added that the YSRC government is unlikely to succeed in its plans to abolish the council considering the current political scenario in the country.

Naidu’s promise is seen as an attempt to keep his flock together in the wake of the ruling party’s efforts to create unrest among council members. Alleging that the YSRC government is scuttling democratic process because chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy is worried about facing the wrath of people, Naidu said council chairman MA Shariff upheld constitutional rights and ethics in public life by sending the three capital cities and CRDA repeal Bills to the select committee.

“YSRC leaders made all attempts to lure council members but failed as TDP members remained loyal to the party and people. The fighting spirit of the people of Amaravati inspired our party members in the council to stay together to protect the capital city. Some ministers even tried to attack the council chairman for not bowing down to their diktats. Jagan is working like a dictator and demolishing all democratic systems. He is upset as he was unsuccessful in bulldozing council members,” said Naidu.

292,['25/01/2020'],Accident deaths continue to dip in Madurai district,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Madurai: The number of people killed in road accidents in Madurai district police limits has come down by about 15% last year compared to the previous year. While the number of fatalities has been coming down in the last few years, a drastic decrease was recorded in 2018 when the deaths came down by 182 compared to 2017. In 2019, the deaths have dropped by as much as 45% compared to 2016.

A total of 282 people were killed in accidents last year compared to 330 in 2018. Police say various efforts like visible policing at accident-prone timings, awareness measures and increase in registration of traffic violation cases have helped bring down the deaths.

Madurai district superintendent of police N Manivannan told TOI that they could have reduced road fatalities further in 2019 as they were maintaining a 20% difference till September. However, things went slightly out of hand during Diwali and gurupooja as they had to concentrate on duties like bandobust. “With the important jallikattu events in Madurai district over, we are back to routine. They will start concentrating again on accident reduction soon,” he said.

The total number of accidents too has come down from 1,777 in 2018 to 1,694 in 2019, which is close to 5%. There are six sub-divisions in Madurai district, each led by a deputy superintendent level police officer. Among the sub-divisions, Melur (41%) achieved a drastic reduction in deaths last year compared to 2018. It was followed by Samayanallur with 21% and Oomachikulam 13%. Peraiyur and Usilampatti have performed badly as the number of deaths has increased by 9%. Thirumangalam recorded 3% more road deaths compared to the previous year.

An official from Peraiyur sub-division said they too had maintained good reduction till September in 2019. However, as many as seven deaths were reported within in one week during Diwali holidays. “Most of the deaths were from accidents involving bikes,” he said. An official from Melur sub-division said that most of the road deaths were taking place on the Madurai-Trichy four-way. Identifying black spots and introducing barricades to slow down vehicle speed have helped reduce the incidents. Villagers residing alongside the four-way were also sensitized to be cautious while using the road, he said. Pedestrians were told to use torch light while crossing the busy four-way road early in the morning and night to alert speeding drivers, he added.

Madurai: Deaths in road accidents have come down to an extent in the city with 183 people losing their lives in 2019, compared to 217 in 2018. City police officers said that most of them, who lost their lives, were two-wheeler commuters and pedestrians.

Deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Madurai city, K Sugumaran told TOI that efforts such as introduction of medians at important junctions and signals, increased registration of traffic violation cases and introduction of new signals have helped to reduce deaths due to road accidents.

He said that due to constraint of space in the narrow city roads, they had opted to use barricades to create medians as concrete ones will occupy more space. The medians have helped to streamline traffic movement and brought in some order among commuters, Sugumaran said.

Registration of traffic violation cases under six heads (signal jumping, using cell phone while driving, carrying passengers in goods vehicles, over speeding, drink and drive and rash riding) and two heads (helmet and seat belt cases) has increased in 2019 compared to its previous years. While 2,200 drunk driving cases were recorded in 2018, its double were registered in 2019, deputy commissioner said.

Traffic officials said that efforts taken during the New Year eve celebration this year helped to make sure it was incident free.

PUNE: Sudhir Pandit , chairman, board of administrators, the Rupee Co-operative Bank , said that he had met the state co-operative commissioner and requested him to hasten the merger proposal with the MSC Bank .

The MSC Bank and Rupee Co-operative Bank submitted a joint proposal to the RBI last week. ""I urged the new co-operative commissioner, Anil Kawde, to expedite the merger proposal,"" Pandit told TOI.

In case of co-operative banks, the states have an equal say (if not more), alongside the RBI. He further added that the bank would be able to give 2% interest on deposits that have been stuck since February 2013 when the RBI placed it under directions over poor financial health.

""Interest rates are at the bank's discretion. All through the period when the bank was under directions, we have not been allowed to lend. Since we have not earned, where can we pay the (higher) interest from,"" Pandit said.

Once the merger is through, the MSC Bank has offered a minimum interest rate of 6.5% on deposits. As per the proposal, customers can withdraw money in a staggered manner.

Vijayawada: Officials of the Anti-Corruption Bureau ( ACB ) conducted simultaneous raids at the offices of 21 tehsildars (mandal revenue officer) in all 13 districts of the state on Friday.

According to officials, they found several irregularities while checking records. Unaccounted cash of Rs 4 lakh was also unearthed during the raids.

ACB officials said that they also found several Meeseva applications regarding various grievances being kept pending beyond the prescribed time limits given by tehsildars.

In some cases, it was found that the applications were rejected without any valid reason and no register was maintained in this regard. Officials also found that a large number of title deeds-cum-e-passbooks received and ready for distribution were kept pending with deputy tehsildars and village revenue officers (VRO).

Sources also said that their raids could corroborate the fact that many officials only tend to hand over documents after receiving their share of the bribe.

Further, mandatory registers such as the mutation register and inward register were not maintained. In some offices, private persons were engaged by the tehsildar to carry out official work.

At several places during the raids, officials said that the petitioners complained of being made to run from pillar to post by tehsildars to carry out official work.

298,['25/01/2020'],"TN Chamber seeks cut in I-T, GST rates in pre-budget memo","This story is from January 25, 2020

Madurai: Reduction in income tax (IT) and GST rates are among the key demands put forward by the Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TNCCI) in their pre-budget memorandum to the finance ministry. TNCCI president N Jegatheesan, senior president S Rethinavelu and secretary J Selvam submitted the memorandum to the ministry in New Delhi on Wednesday.

In a bid to stimulate the economy by increasing purchasing power of consumers, the chamber suggested changes in IT slabs and rates. Pointing out that IT exemption limit of Rs 2.5 lakh fixed six years back, they suggested increasing the same to Rs 5 lakh.

They also suggested 5% IT for income in the range of Rs Rs 5-10 lakh and 10% from Rs 10-25 lakh. Stating that maximum IT rate should be 25% for income of above Rs 25 lakh, they also sought a further deduction in corporate tax to 15% for all companies.

Regarding GST, they sought four rates at 5, 10, 15 and 20% in place of the existing slabs of 5, 12, 18 and 28%. They said that 20% should only be fixed for sin goods and super luxury cars, adding that the rest should be in the 5-15% categories. Maximum GST for services should only be 15%.

Environmental friendly bio-diesel industry, which uses used cooking oil as feedstock, should be encouraged by reduction of GST from 12% to 15%. Seeking exemption for paper bags, as it is widely used as a viable alternative to plastic covers, they also pressed for reduction of GST on lamp oil from 12% to 5%.

They also emphasised one rate of tax for all goods covered under the same chapter under HSN Code structure under GST to rule out confusion and ambiguity. They also sought withdrawal of state-level authorities for advance ruling to confirm rate of tax for commodities to clear confusion created by differing orders by different state authorities.

“The basic principle of GST that there should be no goods and services without input tax credit benefit is defeated by refusing to grant it for construction of immovable property and vehicles for business use,” they added.

299,['25/01/2020'],"Under present govt, Gandhi reduced to image of his glasses, says Tharoor","This story is from January 25, 2020

In comments that are likely to irk the ruling dispensation, Congress MP and author Shashi Tharoor said on Friday the idea of Mahatma Gandhi under the Modi government had been reduced to nothing more than the image of his glasses on the Swachh Bharat campaign, even as he referred the Mahatma as the “first significant martyr of the Hindu-Muslim divide.”

Speaking at the Jaipur Literature Festival, Tharoor was responding to questions about why the legacies of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru were under a “direct and unflinching attack”.

In a pointed reference to “PM Modi and the top echelons” of the ruling party, Tharoor alleged that the current “demonisation” of Gandhi and Nehru was happening because the RSS was fundamentally opposed to Nehru and Gandhi because they were against religion being the principal determinant of nationhood or identity.

“In the nationalist movement, the one big split every one knows about is the one that led to Partition. That split was not about ideology, but over a simple question about whether religion should be the determinant of nationhood. Those on the Muslim side who believed in it created Pakistan. And the vast majority on the Indian side, led by mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Nehru and many others, said religion does not determine our identity or nationhood. They wrote a constitution that embodied that,” Tharoor said.

The Thiruvananthapuram MP also alleged that it was the Hindutva movement, led by VD Savarkar and MS Golwalkar that rejected the Constitution, reiterating Congress’ oft-repeated charge that Savarkar was the “first advocate of the two-nation theory”, three years before the Muslim League passed a Pakistan resolution in Lahore in 1940.

“There could be nothing further from the vision of Gandhiji, who was a deep and profoundly believing Hindu but was influenced by the ethics, values and teachings of every other faith…Gandhi was killed by the RSS because he was believed to be putting the Muslim interest ahead of Hindu interest. That make Gandhi the first significant martyr to the Hindu-Muslim divide that the British had assiduously cultivated for a 100 years,” Tharoor said.

He also claimed that the RSS tradition “taught” its members all that was “wrong” about Gandhi. “Golwalkar would ask what this talk about Ahimsa was, arguing that every Hindu God was shown with a weapon. Gandhi was believed to fundamentally wrong about the value of non violence…No wonder Mahatma Gandhi has been reduced to his glasses. His ideas values, principles and his life have been tossed aside, but his glasses, because of the brand value of the Gandhi name, are the symbol of the Swachh Bharat campaign,” he said.

AURANGABAD: A man’s two-month-long search for his wife , who left home leaving behind a note saying she would end her life, ended in shock when he realised that she had eloped with a neighbour, her long-time admirer.

According to the police, the couple was married for past 16 years and has two children. About two months back, the woman left home, leaving behind a note indicating that she was headed to an undisclosed destination and would take the extreme step.

Her husband immediately rushed to the Jinsi police station and lodged a missing complaint. With his help, the police began looking for her. Around the same time, he noticed that one of his neighbours, a married man, who would otherwise meet him frequently, was also missing. He alerted the police about his observation and they tracked down both the missing people to another city.

Inspector Vyankatesh Kendre of Jinsi police station told TOI, “After returning, the woman was counselled but in vain. Even her husband was ready to accept her, but she did not budge. We have recorded her statement and closed the missing case.”

According to the police, the complainant and his wife had recently shifted to a new locality. One of their neighbours was a man, who had proposed to the woman 18 years back. The marriage proposal did not materialise then. The two allegedly rekindled their friendship and eloped.

“They are both adults. As per law, even the police cannot do much, when two consenting adults decide to live together,” said a policeman privy to the missing case.

There are hundreds of students sitting in protests against CAA and standing up for Hindu Muslim unity today. If Gandhiji was here, he would have been sitting with the students, said activist Ruchira Gupta as she opened a session on the Father of the Nation at the Jaipur Literature Festival on Friday.

Gupta, along with writer Makarand Paranjape, filmmaker Ramesh Sharma and historian Talat Ahmed were discussing the relevance of Gandhi in current times.

“Gandhi has remained incredibly influential particularly in relation with bringing about social change. Other leaders, including Marx, Lenin and Che Guevara have been tainted with their support of violence. But Gandhi stuck to his idea of non-violence,” said Ahmed, adding that his ideas find resonance in young people.

“Several movements across the world, including the extinction rebellion in the UK, have been inspired by the civil disobedience movement that Gandhi led. Even after 70 years of his death, he remains relevant,” she said. Paranjape, while agreeing with her in principle, added that Gandhi’s “afterlife is greater than his life.”

The panelists also deconstructed Gandhi’s life and assassination, obliquely touched upon the rise of right-wing fundamentalism in India, criticised attempts to “rewrite” history, and called out the whitewashing of certain groups, including the RSS.

Through the hour-long session, the panel discussed and debated, agreed at times, but also often differed in their opinions, especially when it came to contextualizing and placing Gandhi in the present political scenario. But they also concurred that Gandhi’s legacy would withstand the tests of time.

Responding to a question about how Gandhi would respond to Prime Minister Modi, Sharma said he would likely go on an “indefinite fast”. “Modi would join that fast,” quipped in Paranjape amid audience cheers, but Gupta was ready with a comeback. “The PM still has an option to join protestors at Shaheen Bagh,” she said, while referring to a neighbourhood in south-east Delhi, which has become the face of the protests against CAA and NRC, with women of all ages staging a 24*7 sit-in. But amid dissenting voices, which the panelists said Gandhi stood for, they also reached a consensus about what the young can back take from him.

“If the young had to learn one thing from Gandhi, it should be sustainability. They can learn how to keep movements alive by showing the world not just what they are standing for, but also what they are against,” said Gupta.

Aurangabad: The Maharashtra bandh called by the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) against the CAA-NRC and NPR received a considerable response in the Marathwada region on Friday.

The police had made adequate security arrangements and patrolling to maintain law and order during the bandh period.

In most of the areas, including Aurangabad city, the shopkeepers kept their shutters down in response to the VBA’s bandh call.

Video clips by VBA activists were quickly shared on social media platforms, resulting in the bandh being observed across the city.

Amit Bhuigal, an office-bearer of VBA in Aurangabad, said, “We pleaded with folded hands to everyone to support the bandh, as we had decided not to indulge in any kind of violence. The shop keepers at many places responded to our plea.”

However, some parts of the region reported minor incidents of stone pelting including in Aurangabad city, where a state transport bus became a target of the protesters. There were no injuries reported during the event.

VBA activists were seen shouting slogans, holding placards against NPR, NRC, and CAA. Led by Prakash Ambedkar and backed by over 35 social and trade unions, and 100 groups saw a successful bandh being implemented.

Adding further Bhuigal said that not only Muslims but also those belonging to reserved categories, be it Dalits or Hindus will be at the receiving end of the bill. “People are trying to show it is Muslim versus others but they are misleading Indians at large.”

Nanded reported that at least two different incidents of stone-pelting were reported, following which police swung into action and rounded up the suspects. In some places, police had to use force to disperse unwanted gatherings.

Even at places like Jalna, Parbhani, Hingoli, and Beed, attempts were made to galvanize a response to the bandh by making sit-in agitations, blocking roads and stopping the state transport services.

Things started returning to normalcy after VBA chief withdrew the bandh at about 4 pm. Senior police officers in the the region maintained that some of the incidents have been taken on record and those who have indulged in any kind of illegal activities, will face action?

This, however, was only the beginning of the ordeal for 173 passengers on board. Due to prolonged inspection, unavailability of crew members and dense fog, they could take to the sky only eight hours later in another aircraft.

Sources said while in the air, the Airbus A320 Neo aircraft received a ‘doors-not-secure’ warning, due to which pilots initiated a precautionary turnaround. Data from online flight tracker flightradar24 revealed the plane did multiple rounds in the air before landing.

On returning, passengers waited inside the aircraft for over six hours for inspection. They said the crew meant to operate the flight took leave, stating they had completed their duty hours. Fog, which caused airport operations to be suspended, also played spoiler. The aircraft is now under inspection at KIA. The passengers were accommodated in another plane, which departed for Phuket at 10.44am.

Earlier, after spending hours inside the aircraft under inspection, irked passengers stepped on to the runway on learning the crew had left. Some took to Twitter to air their grievances. “GoAir G8 41 A malfunctioning plane mid-air, followed by return to tarmac and changeover of plane, then changeover of pilot and crew, 8 hours on tarmac, badly managed communication with passengers, no extra care. Customer service is dead (sic),” tweeted @skatyal1, a passenger.

“@goairlinesindia thanks for ruining our trip. Aircraft on ground since past 6 hours. First it lands because of technical faults. Then der is delay in paperwork, then low visibility. Now when there is visibility, the whole crew is being replaced. Do u care abt our schedule? G8-41 (sic),” tweeted @hemalkanani09.

Many passengers were stranded at the Phuket airport as well, waiting for the incoming aircraft from Bengaluru to arrive.

“GoAir flight G8 041 from Bengaluru to Phuket with 173 passengers on board did a precautionary air turn back in the interest of safety due to a technical glitch...It landed safely at Bengaluru airport. The aircraft was changed and departed with the passengers for its destination at 10.44am,” a GoAir spokesperson said in a statement.

Box: Low visibility delays 77 flights

Dense fog and low visibility conditions near KIA disrupted operations of over 77 flights, while three others were diverted to the Chennai airport. Operations at KIA were temporarily suspended between 5.40 and 5.45am, during which 60 departures and 17 arrivals were delayed. The weather in Bengaluru impacted flight schedules at other airports to.

Tirupati: In a move to streamline administration at the Sri Venkateswara Bhakti Channel ( SVBC ), the TTD trust board has appointed additional executive officer AV Dharma Reddy as managing director of the channel.

Earlier this month, Tollywood actor Prudhvi Raj stepped down from chairmanship of SVBC after an audio clip in which he allegedly made sexual advances to a female employee at the channel surfaced.

In an attempt to control the damage caused by the leak and streamline administration, the TTD trust board appointed Dharma Reddy as the managing director of the channel.

Following his appointment as additional executive officer at Tirumala, Dharma Reddy had cracked the whip against the black marketing of seva and VIP break darshan tickets, irregularities in accommodation and prasadam at the temple town, as well as taken action against other corrupt practices.

Taking all this into account, the TTD trust board was learnt to have been inclined towards choosing him for the post of managing director at its devotional channel.

Bengaluru: Fraser Town turned into Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh of sorts, as hundreds of women sat on a 48-hour protest outside a mosque on Mosque Road on Friday demanding repeal of the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019.

The women-only protest began at 3pm on Thursday as a 24-hour campaign, but was extended by another 24 hours on Friday afternoon after necessary permissions were granted.

The spirited protest, organised by Hum Bharat ke Log, witnessed round-the-clock distribution of food, water and snacks. While children sat amid the crowds colouring and drawing, the women took turns to take to the stage and express their views on CAA.

Women of all age groups — starting with college students to centenarians — turned up for the stir.

“Being part of a democracy, all we can do is protest. Senior citizens, young mothers and college students aren’t only attending protests, but also sitting for such long hours. What kind of a government do we have that can’t address the concerns of of its citizens? Why won’t they revoke the law? Are they running an authoritarian government,” asked the women.

Among the protesters were several activists from AIDSO (All India Democratic Students Organisation). Sithara HM, district president of AIDSO, said, “This is something that the government is doing in order to divert the country’s attention from other pressing issues like unemployment and starvation.”

Tehmina Farial, a student, asked, “How can the government ask people to show documents when they themselves can’t produce Rafale documents? When there are more important issues in the country, why don’t they focus on those?”

Scores of young volunteers worked 24x7 to ensure the protest didn’t disrupt traffic in the area. Protesters were seen waving placards reading — ‘No CAA/NRC/NPR’, ‘I’m an Indian and India is my home’ and ‘We stand united against the governments decisions’. Some were spotted waving the national flag.

The government’s cold response appeared to rattle many. “The government has brought us to a situation where we are standing on the road fighting for our basic rights. We are fighting for space in our own home,” lamented one protester.

Representative image

NASHIK: The Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ), in the last three weeks, has snapped connections of over 200 water tax defaulters.

A civic official said that despite sending notices the defaulters did not clear their dues. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game has directed the water department to take strict action against tax defaulters for not clearing their dues.

Game has also directed all six divisional offices to snap around 50 connections of water tax defaulters every week in each division.

“The NMC has set a water tax collection target of Rs 64 crore for the current financial year. So far, we have collected around Rs 40 crore and are falling short of Rs 24 crore to achieve the target,” the official said.

“We have intensified our drive against water tax defaulters and are continuously taking action against them by snapping their connections. Connections are restored after the defaulters clear their dues,” he added.

Of the 200 water connections snapped, 70 are from Panchavati division, while the remaining 130 are from Satpur, Cidco, Nashik West, Nashik East and Nashik Road divisions.

In August and September last year, the NMC, for the first time, had initiated a drive against water tax defaulters by snapping over 2,500 water connections. Later, supply was resumed for those who cleared their dues.

“The drive was stopped because of the state assembly elections. But now we have again been started taking action against the defaulter for the past one-and-a-half month. There are a total of 1.96 lakh water connections in the city — including 1.88 lakh residential, 4,000 commercial and 4,000 non-commercial connections,” the official said.

Last month, the civic body also introduced amnesty scheme for property tax defaulters that will be into effect till February 10. Under this scheme, the penalty on property tax dues is to be waived if defaulters clear their tax dues.

The civic body has however received poor response as it has so far collected only Rs 15 crore through the amnesty scheme.

The NMC is now planning to create awareness about the amnesty scheme among residents across the six divisions. The civic body is in the process to hire autorickshaws for making announcements about the amnesty scheme via loudspeakers.

TimesView Including pourakarmikas in the Republic Day parade is a fitting tribute to the unsung foot soldiers who sully their hands to clean the city. However, the gesture also smacks of tokenism with BBMP intending to gain brownie points ahead of Swachh Survekshan. Instead of waking up at the 11th hour, it should have worked through the year to improve the city’s solid waste management system. As far as giving pourakarmikas their due is concerned, the agency would do well by heeding their long-standing demand for regularisation of services and timely payment of wages.

2.5k police personnel to keep watch on R-Day

BENGALURU: The 71st Republic Day parade at Manekshaw Parade Grounds on Sunday will feature a new troop. Thirty-one men and women who are on the front line of Bengaluru’s battle against garbage will participate in the march past .The first-ever initiative involving pourakarmikas in the R-Day fete is being driven by Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to spread the message of cleanliness under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. Addressing mediapersons on Friday, BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar said the pourakarmikas will carry placards to create awareness on a cleaner city. Twenty-seven women and four men will be part of the Swachh battalion.These pourakarmikas have been picked from various zones and trained for two days to march perfectly. Appu, the platoon commander of Swachata Yodharu BBMP, told TOI the opportunity has created a lot of excitement among the sanitation workers. “It’s a matter of pride for us to participate in the parade, that too in our uniforms. People will recognise us with our green coats amid the marching platoons,” he said.The initiative is also a part of BBMP’s effort to improve its standing in Swachh Survekshan — city rankings based on cleanliness — under the under the mission.The pourakarmikas will be part of a 34-unit 2,000-member contingent, including schoolkids, NCC cadets, scouts, CRPF and BSF personnel and the dog squad, participating in the fete. One armed force battalion from Goa will also take part like every year.The parade and cultural programme on January 26 will be inaugurated by governor Vajubhai Vala.To ensure the venue is sanitised, 75 police personnel have been keeping vigil at the ground for 15 days.

MADURAI: Doctors at the pediatric department of Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai safely removed a lithium button cell or watch battery without surgery from a two-year-old boy from A.Kombai village in Dindigul district after he had accidentally swallowed it on Thursday.

The child, A Aadheeswaran, the fourth child of his parents, A Alagarsamy and A Periyakandhi, on Wednesday, swallowed a button cell by accident when he found it while playing at his house with friends. It was the size of a one-rupee coin. His parents, who are woodcutters, were at work when the incident happened. “As one of the children in the group noticed that my son swallowed the battery, they immediately called us for help. We rushed him to the Dindigul Government Hospital as he was having breathing difficulties but then he was referred to GRH in Madurai for better facilities,” Alagarsamy told TOI.

An X-ray revealed that the coin-shaped battery that was roughly around 20 mm in diameter and around 2 mm in height was lodged vertically in the lower part of the boy’s oesophagus or food pipe. “A team of doctors from the pediatric department and the department of gastro-enterology performed a minimally invasive procedure on Thursday afternoon to remove the foreign body,” said GRH dean Dr J Sangumani.

The doctors said that an endoscopic tube was inserted through the boy’s mouth to remove the battery. There was no complications post the procedure and the boy could also breathe without any respiratory support, doctors added. However, he has been advised not to intake any liquid or solid food for a few days and is being given IV drips.

Workers dig up VIP Road for the proposed underpass at Lake Town

KOLKATA: The state public works department ( PWD ) has started the work of setting up two underpasses on VIP Road — one at Lake Town and the other at Dum Dum Park. These underpasses were planned to ease the movement of pedestrians at the two busy crossings.

Tenders for the work were floated in July last year while a detail survey of the locations was conducted by the officials to check the underground utilities. Both the underpasses will be constructed with the advanced box-jacking technique .

“No traffic restriction would be required on the road as the technique would create underground tunnels with minimal damage to the surface,” said an official. However, the service road off VIP Road may be blocked and a pedestrian traffic plan may be required during the work.

According to plans, the underpasses will be about 68-metre long with 6.5-metre width and 2.7-metre height. The construction cost of the two underpasses has been pegged at Rs 23 crore. The long-term plan behind the underpasses is to dismantle the old foot overbridge at Lake Town crossing for the proposed flyover from Dakshindari to Dum Dum Park. The PWD officials have already prepared a project report for the flyover plan and are waiting for approval from the state cabinet.

Aurangabad: MIM state president and Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel on Friday expressed displeasure at MNS chief Raj Thackeray’s “shut off the loudspeakers on masjids” comment on Thursday while introducing his party’s new flag consisting warrior king Shivaji Maharaj’s insignia.

“People turn up in large numbers for listening to his speeches, but these large gatherings do not turn in to votes,” Jaleel said.

He added that blaming Muslims would not give Raj the desired political mileage as gone are the days when people used to “readily fall prey to divisive politics”. Jaleel said, “People now are more concerned about constitutional rights, development, quality education, health facilities and transparency in the city.”

Jaleel also raised question over the timing of the MNS chief’s comment. “He has been in politics for long, but how come he has started facing issue with Azaan,” he said.

“Just before the assembly elections, the MNS chief had been opposing BJP and raising questions over PM Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and other BJP functionaries with his dialogue of ‘Lav re te video’. Now, in an attempt to cash in on the Hindu votes, the MNS chief has relaunched his party by raising questions on Muslims,” Jaleel added.

Raj on Thursday came out in support of CAA and asked local Muslims why they were protesting in favour of Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslims. Religion, he said, was a personal thing. Targeting Muslims, Raj said, “Keep your religion in your house. Shut off the loudspeakers on masjids. Our aarti does not trouble, why should namaz trouble others?”

316,['25/01/2020'],Capital shift leaves fate of expressway in limbo,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Amaravati: The decision of the state government to shift the capital out of Amaravati has raised concerns over the future of the proposed Amaravati-Anantapur expressway .

Notification for land acquistion for the project had been published in 2019 and the state government had agreed to bear 50 per cent of the cost of land acquisition and obtain statutory clearances for environment, forests and wildlife.

The project, which is a partnership between the central and state governments, proposes a greenfield expressway connecting Amaravati with the Rayalaseema region and was floated to accelerate industrial development and generate employment in drought-affected districts in the state. The route will also minimise travel time and was intended to have brought the Rayalaseema districts closer to Amaravati.

Senior state government officials are of the opinion that the Centre will raise queries about the project as it is yet to formally take off. “Although Amaravati will continue to be the legislative capital under the new scheme of things, vehicular movement may not be as dense as estimated in the draft plans,” said a senior official on condition of anonymity.

Local farmers, meanwhile, have already raised objections over the land acquisition process for the project. Farmers in some villages in Vinukonda and Chilakaluripet constituencies in Guntur district have filed written objections stating that with the shift of the executive capital to Visakhapatnam, there is no need for an expressway in the region.

Minister for energy, forest and environment Balineni Srinivasa Reddy said, “We will convince the Centre and go ahead with the project after readying the detailed project report (DPR).” The state government has already directed district collectors of Guntur, Prakasam, Kurnool, Kadapa and Anantapur to publish the draft notification for land acquisition by January 29 after completing a survey.

Sources said that the plan for the expressway is believed to have changed after the YSR Congress assumed power in the state. The final stretch of the expressway may now be connected with National Highway (NH)-16 between Guntur and Ongole, unlike in the original plan.

The expressway will stretch for a distance of 371 km and cut travel time between Amaravati and Anantapur by two hours. The project, however, has faced opposition from environmentalists and farmers in the past on account of the threat posed to agricultural land and potential damage to forest areas.

318,['25/01/2020'],Global warming: Why the choices we make are crucial to our survival,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Planet Earth, as we all know, is burning, drowning and choking its way to destruction. So, how do we save it? In the session, ‘Client Earth’, on day two of the Jaipur Literature Festival, the panelists attempted to find light amid the darkness, and squeeze some hope from an impossibly bleak situation.

David Wallace Wells, climate-change journalist whose ‘The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming’ can be seen as an elegy for the planet, stole the show with an impassioned plea to people and governments, to act and act fast. “The picture is weak across the world. We need to be doing much, much more, and more quickly and more universally,” he told a receptive audience.

“As a New Yorker, I didn’t perceive climate change as a threat but I was profoundly deluded. My life contains the entire story of the destruction of the planet,” added the 37-year-old. Because climate change, he continued, is not a legacy of our ancestors but the work of one generation – ours.

But, despite the prognostications of humankind hurtling towards extinction, it’s not all doom and gloom. Certainly, the experiences of environmental lawyer Martin Goodman (who co-wrote ‘Client Earth’ with James Thornton) show that grass-roots activism can be a force for good. “There is an evidence-based narrative of hope,” he shared, giving examples as far apart as Poland, where farmers came together to successfully oppose the building of coal-fired power plants, and in the African continent, where activists, armed with a knowledge of the laws, confidently argued with government officials.

Former environment minister Jairam Ramesh insisted that the ‘grow now, pay later’ model of economic progress can never be an option, simply because it is unsustainable in the Indian context – as demonstrated by the land and air pollution that blights cities and also rural areas. “Our veneration for nature has clashed with development; we’ve made the wrong choices not out of lack of awareness or sensitivity, but because of demographic challenges and because of development,” said Ramesh, explaining the dilemma that India faces.

The speakers also pointed out the sheer inequality of global warming, in that it adversely impacts those countries that contribute the least to it. The poorest, in other words. For all the pessimism that surrounds us, Wallace Wells stressed on the importance of being activated and engaged on the issue. “Because Planet Earth is the only home we have, and the only one we’ll know,” he reminded.

Coimbatore: The food safety department on Thursday confiscated a truck laden with five tonnes of tea grinding waste, which is often used to adulterate tea powder, in Mettupalayam.

The truck neither had the permit to ply in the state nor required documents for the consignment.

The owner of the truck and the person who procured the contaminant are being interrogated by the food safety department. However, the owner of the truck claimed that the tea waste was procured to produce manure.

Acting on a tip, officials of the food safety department on Thursday inspected the truck which was parked near Madheeswaran temple in Mettupalayam since Tuesday night.

“Five tonnes of tea waste, known to be used for to adulterate tea powder, were found in the truck,” an officer said.

The officials identified the owner of the truck as Arun Kumar, a resident of Thevanapudhur.

Kumar confessed that the powder was bought and procured from Assam by a person named Manikandan.

“Kumar claims that the tea waste was bought to manufacture farm manure. Since making manure is also a logical reason and way to use the waste, we are conducting further investigation,” food safety officer Aruchamy said.

While Manikandan and Arun Kumar were questioned, officials informed the revenue and transport departments about the truck. “Though the truck had Tamil Nadu registration number, the owner was not able to produce permit and fitness certificates of the vehicle. So, we alerted appropriate authorities,” Aruchamy said.

Officials believe that the seized tea waste was bought to be mixed with tea powder that comes in tonnes from Nilgiris. The adulterated tea dust is then packaged and sold to small bakeries and tea shops for a lesser cost than genuine tea powder.

MUMBAI/PUNE: Seven persons from Maharashtra who recently travelled to China and Hong Kong have been placed under observation amid the novel coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak that has so far claimed 26 lives and infected over 800 people in China and some other countries.Four are from Mumbai and three from Pune, both cities adding one person each to Thursday’s count of five. But, in good news, the health ministry tweeted late on Friday that two samples from Mumbai have tested negative for the virus.Earlier in the day, a 65-year-old Briton, who came from Hong Kong on January 10, was admitted to Kasturba Hospital in Chinchpokli, the designated isolation facility in Mumbai. A 31-year-old Nalasopara woman and a Kalyan man who had gone to China have been under watch since their hospitalisation on Thursday. BMC officials said throat swabs and blood samples of the Briton and two others quarantined on Thursday have been sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune.Two of the samples have tested negative for nCoV. “ICMR-NIV Pune has informed that 4 samples (2 from Mumbai, 1 each from B’luru & Hy’bad) have tested negative for nCoV. One of Mumbai patients has tested positive for rhinovirus, a routine common cold virus,” it tweeted.The fourth person under observation in Mumbai is a Jogeshwari resident, who hasn’t showed cold symptoms and is on a telephonic follow-up from home. State epidemiologist Dr Pradeep Awate said the three in Pune are asymptomatic as well.Colleagues of the UK national said he had returned to the city from Hong Kong after spending Christmas in the UK. On Friday, he went to the Asian Heart Institute with complaints of cold and sore throat, and the doctors referred him to Kasturba after learning he had been to Hong Kong. “Doctors at Kasturba insisted on admitting him and getting the tests done,” said a colleague, adding that the Briton shuttles between Mumbai and Hong Kong on work. The two from Nalasopara and Kalyan had travelled to China’s Foshan and Guangzhou cities, both about 1,000km away from Wuhan , the epicentre of the outbreak.Public health minister Rajesh Tope said the state government is taking all preventive steps. “As on Friday, 1,789 passengers travelling from China have been screened through thermal scanner at the international airport. No positive cases have been registered so far. There is no panic situation in Maharashtra.”Awate said naso-pharyngeal and lower respiratory tract swabs will be used for testing. “A naso-pharyngeal swab is used to sample secretions from the back of the nose and upper throat to help identify what pathogens are present and what could be causing symptoms or disease. But for more confirmatory report, lower respiratory tract swabs are preferred for the diagnosis of nCoV,” said Awate.Civic officials said while the patients may be allowed to go home after their reports arrive from NIV, they will continue to be under observation for at least 28 days. Since the coronavirus is new, a long watch is being implemented.Kasturba Hospital’s Ward 30, the city’s only public isolation facility, is humming with life since Thursday evening after two patients were admitted. Ward 30 comprises a room with six glass cubicles and four standalone rooms. A nurse on Friday said they have been provided with protective gear to be worn every time they enter the rooms to tend to the patients.The Britisher’s colleague said he was allowed to meet him after donning an N95 mask.

321,['25/01/2020'],Empower local communities to address climate change threat,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Despite the decibel level of the denialists, climate change is a reality that none of us can avoid. On day two of the Jaipur Literature Festival, the session, ‘Flood and Fury’, turned the spotlight on government complicity in the flooding that devastated a city (Chennai, 2015) and large parts of a state (Kerala, 2018).

“When I was the environment minister, I was confronted by the truth that sea levels were rising which, because of India’s long coastline, increased the probability of flooding,” explained Jairam Ramesh. “And we have seen an increase in the frequency of floods, which is a manifestation of climate change and global warming.”

Krupa Ge is not an environmentalist but the Chennai calamity changed everything for her. “I found myself asking a lot of questions but not getting the answers,” she told the audience. The state, Ge argued, was an active participant in the erosion of resources that contributed to Chennai being inundated.

“We’re all fighting extremes of weather because of climate change,” continued Ge, author of ‘Rivers Remember’, which probed the reasons behind the deluge, a traumatic memory for residents of the southern metropolis. “Climate change is a reality which we’re not addressing,” complained Viju B, the title of whose book, ‘Flood and Fury: Ecological Devastation in the Western Ghats’, unequivocally pinpoints the reason behind the disaster in Kerala.

Viju described how instances of moderate rainfall in Kerala have decreased, while cases of intense precipitation have increased. But it’s not just in Kerala; in Chennai, the population suffered because three months of rainfall fell in one night. The culprit? Climate change, again.

The sobering truth, however, is that very few places in India are immune to excessive rainfall. Ramesh said the annual problem of flooding in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar won’t be solved unless afforestation takes place in the upper catchment areas in Nepal, which have been stripped of their canopies. “Flood control in India can’t be successfully addressed unless you bring in Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan — because rivers don’t have political boundaries,” he insisted, adding, “The Indus river system is integrated and crucial to both India and Pakistan, but both countries don’t recognise its importance.”

What, then, is the solution? Besides formulating a policy for disaster management, the panel agreed that the key lies in empowering local communities and institutions, both rural and urban. Viju called for supporting the tribal populations, who are leading conservation efforts. “We should empower the gram sabhas and the local communities, and empower people closest to the land – that is the only way to counter the vested interests and lobbies,” he maintained.

Edited

Jaipur: “I am an accidental actress,” said model-turned-actress-turned-author Lisa Ray while speaking at a session at Jaipur Literature Festival on Friday.

Ray, a cancer survivor, said in her memoirs she had “broken her ribs and served her heart on a platter” after being diagnosed with this ailment.

Ray (47) was diagnosed in 2009 with multiple myeloma, a cancer of the white blood cells, which is considered incurable and fatal.

“I had suicidal thoughts, had a lot of self-flagellating thoughts, a lot of self-loathing. On the one hand I was experiencing the prime of my success and fame in India and privately I was going through the deepest, darkest tunnel that you can imagine. It was the darkest night of the soul,” she said on finding fame very early in life but not having the inner peace.

“There is no doubt that going through cancer has changed and transformed the trajectory of my life, and I am still processing that on some level. There has been a pre-cancer and post-cancer life,” she said.

“I have been in the glamour industry since I was 16. It was the darkest period of my life. I had suicidal thoughts, self-loathing and also bulimia. It was due to the fact that some part of me felt not worthy and unlovable. I could never live up to the image of myself. The more I shrunk, the more I was celebrated,” said Ray while interacting with Sanjoy Roy, the festival producer.

Speaking about the identity crisis in today’s scenario, Ray said, “I migrated from India to Canada and my identity was not just defined by blood, but also by movement as well as people’s perception. However, I managed to travel often. I don’t think migration is easy anymore. The borders created in our minds is creating issues for migration.”

Ray said most of her life she ‘ran away’ from situations which she could not handle after being diagnosed with cancer.

Vijayawada: Members of the passenger amenities committee ( PAC ) inspected Vijayawada railway station here on Friday morning. The committee checked the functioning of the 76 CCTV cameras in the railway station and inspected other security aspects at the station.

The committee also checked other amenities, such as food and book stalls, foot-over-bridges (FOB) and toilets and gathered feedback from passengers. In an interaction with the media, L Nagwani, one of the six members of the committee, explained that Vijayawada would have a high ranking among the 180 stations they had inspected across the country.

Nagwani added that some initiatives undertaken at the station—such as the fish pedicure stall on platform one—should be highlighted. The stall is part of the New Innovative Non-Fare Revenue Idea Scheme (NINFRIS), under which several initiatives have been coming up, including the health kiosk at the station.

The committee advised Vijayawada divisional railway manager P Srinivas to implement a passenger information system, similar to the one at Anakapalle railway station.

“The information system gives the passenger information as to where their coach will arrive without the need to be present on the platform,” Nagwani said. The team also suggested introducing battery-operated cars to help old or people with disabilities commute.

“There is also a need for a round-the-clock medical shop on platform one. Currently there is a medical store on platform six, of which many passengers are not aware. The shop is also not open throughout the day,” Nagwani said.

The committee also took note of the absence of baggage scanners and metal-detecting frames in the station and said a recommendation would be sent to the DRM.

The PAC also visited two other stations under Vijayawada railway division – Eluru and Tenali and expressed satisfaction on their functioning.

Painting a grim picture of the state of the democracy in India, diplomat-turned-politician Pavan Varma said on Friday idealism was dead and that politics was turning cynical. The JDU leader who has been at loggerheads with his party chief and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar over the party’s apparent support to the Centre on the CAA, however, steered clear of any references to his recent sparring and referred to a more general “unravelling” of the Indian democratic systems.

Varma argued that the central message of Hinduism, one which was derived from the three key texts — the Upanishad, the Bhagavad Gita and the Brahmaputra — was to engage in dialogue and to regard the whole world as one family, was under threat. Writer and literary critic Rakshanda Jalil attributed the atmosphere of “bigotry” to 1990s in the aftermath, she said, of BJP leader and former deputy PM LK Advani’s Rath Yatra.

Activist Harsh Mander, however, countered Varma and Jalil’s cynicism by saying that it was upto the people of the country — who had taken to the streets in protest against the controversial CAA — to ensure that the unfinished business of the freedom struggle now be completed.

“When those who want the country divided on religious grounds say that they are completing the unfinished business of partition, I say that it is we the people of India who have taken to the streets to complete the unfinished business of the freedom struggle — to keep India united,” he said. tnn

Representative image

PANAJI: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has given the green signal for the construction of a bridge over the Tiracol river, almost five years after work was stalled over the CRZ clearance granted for the project.

The tribunal has allowed the construction of the bridge connecting Tiracol to Keri provided the government follows recommendations of the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), Chennai.

“Having regard to the fact that Tiracol bridge may be a matter of public utility and the same can be constructed without any adverse damage to the environment, there is no justification to stop the same in absence of any illegality being shown,” the NGT stated in the case filed by the NGO, Goa Foundation .

“Accordingly, we dispose of this application with a direction that the construction of Tiracol bridge may proceed after taking all due precautions in accordance with law, particularly all the observations and recommendations of the NIOT,” the order further stated.

Goa Foundation had approached the NGT stating that the bridge was partly being erected on the Keri beach, in violation of the CRZ Notification which requires prior approval from the Union environment ministry and the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority.

Goa Foundation had stated that the construction, specially of pillar no. 6, was in a no-development zone and that no mitigation measures were taken against the possible adverse consequences on fishing.

Tiracol, which is a ward of the Keri village panchayat, is connected to the mainland only by ferry boat. In a peculiar situation, it residents are required to travel via Maharashtra if they seek to come to the mainland.

Visakhapatnam: Anakapalle MLA Gudivada Amarnath condemned the legislative council’s decision to refer the capital decentralisation bill to the select committee on Friday.

Amarnath, who is also the official spokesperson of YSRC asserted that this was only a temporary setback and would only delay the decentralisation process for two to three months.

Speaking to the media, Amarnath alleged that TDP has been indulging in ‘unethical and undemocratic practices’ to stall the passing of the bill in the legislative council. He reiterated that despite the delay, Vizag will become the executive capital. Lashing out at the TDP chief, he said, “Naidu was remote controlling (sic) the proceedings in the council, directing the chairman of the council to do his bidding. The chairman could have used his discretion instead of towing Naidu’s line.”

Amarnath further said that the day the bill was stalled in the council would be remembered as a black day in the history of the state as the council had gone against the will of the people and had undermined the basic principles of democracy. “ tnn

(With inputs from Mayukh Sengupta)

KOLKATA: Sheer stroke of luck , timely intervention by a plumber and extraordinary coordination among 100-odd residents of a housing complex on VIP Road saved the life of an 18-year-old girl, who accidentally toppled over the terrace parapet but remained hanging in the air for about an hour as her left leg got wedged in the grilles of the balcony below.Richa Gupta, a first-year college student and a chartered accountancy aspirant, was literally shaking at the end of the rescue operation, being lowered down with the help of protection harnesses. But she escaped with scratches and cuts on her left leg and was allowed to go home after being administered preliminary treatment at a local nursing home.The incident took place at VIP Enclave, a posh residential complex near Kaikhali, around 4pm on Thursday. Police said Gupta was speaking on mobile while strolling on the terrace. “The girl said she was resting against the cement parapet, when she suddenly felt dizzy and fell sick and somehow toppled over. But her fall was arrested as one of her legs got stuck in the iron grille of the balcony below the terrace,” said a senior officer at Bidhannagar Commissionerate.Shortly after she fell, it was a 24-year-old plumber who first spotted her. “I was washing my feet at a tap on the complex, when something suddenly fell on me. I looked up to find the girl hanging from the balcony, screaming for help. I raised an alarm and ran upstairs,” said Balaram Karmakar, a plumber employed at the residential complex. As Balaram knocked on the flat, from where Richa was hanging, the family and other neighbours immediately rushed to the balcony. They held on to her from inside and managed to strap her to the grilles with whatever they could.By then, a crowd had gathered below, watching the rescue operation with bated breath and prayers on their lips, hoping the girl would be saved.While some of the residents still fumbled about how to rescue Richa, Balaram and his father, Babu, chalked out a quick plan. The residents followed their instructions but before that, they called the local police station. “We went to the terrace and dropped a rope. Balaram climbed down to the ledge above the balcony and tied it to the girl. All the while, we held her tightly till more help arrived,” said Babu, also a plumber. Soon, some residents carried out mattresses and blankets from home and prepared a cushion platform on the ground below, in case the rope snapped and Richa fell. The cops came in with a safety harness, like the ones highrise glass-cleaners wear at work, and strapped Richa with it to the grille.Though the police had alerted the fire brigade, Babu had by then cut a portion of the iron grille. Though the gap, him and the other neighbours pulled Richa inside to safety. As she sat shaken, people splashed water on her face and fed her a little before carrying her to a local nursing home on a special chair. A doctor checked her and allowed her to go home after preliminary medication. TOI tried to speak to Richa and her mother but they were still too traumatised.“The girl is a bright student but she is on medication for an illness. Her father was murdered 10 years ago, and ever since she has been a patient of depression. We are not sure if it was an accident or she jumped by herself. But we are just thankful that she is alright,” said a neighbour, close to the family.For the residents, this was something that they had never witnessed earlier, “I still can’t believe what played out in the evening. We are thankful to our local heroes—the father-son plumber duo—and I boast of the extreme level of coordination shown by the residents of our complex in rescuing the girl,” said Ashok Jha, president of the residents’ association.In Video: On cam: Girl falls off, hangs from terrace ledge for 50 minutes, escapes alive",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73600471,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-501752,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/girl-falls-off-terrace-hangs-for-50-minutes-as-her-leg-gets-stuck/articleshow/73595697.cms

Nashik: The Metro and city bus services — two pet projects of former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis — face an uncertain future with the state government warning the civic body of the “grave financial consequences” it might face due to implementation of the twin ventures.

Following the request of urban development minister Eknath Shinde, Nashik guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal on Friday held a meeting in Mumbai with city mayor Satish Kulkarni, Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) standing committee chairman Uddhav Nimse and municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game.

“I am not against these projects. But the two projects will have serious financial implications for the NMC. The state government cannot take the responsibility if the two projects suffer financial losses. The state government has to spend huge amounts on the scheme to wave the farmers’ loan and Nagpur-Mumbai expressway project,” Bhujbal told TOI.

Following Fadnavis’s instructions, the NMC had decided to take over the city bus services from the ailing MSRTC and operate 400 buses through private operators in phases. In the first phase, 200 buses were to be deployed.

Similarly, the Nashik Metro project was announced by the former CM and MahaMetro finalized its DPR at over Rs2,000 crore. The erstwhile Fadnavis government had approved the DPR and sent it to the Centre for approval. The Union and state governments and NMC were the stakeholders of the project.

“On the Nashik Metro project, I told the NMC functionaries that a review of it should be done later to ascertain whether the mass transit system is at all need for the city. My feedback is that the similar projects in Nagpur and Mumbai are not that popular. Moreover, roads have to be dug up. This will cause much problems for the road users,” said Bhujbal.

On the city bus project, the district guardian minister said the presentation the NMC functionaries gave about the project revealed that the civic body would have to bear a loss of about Rs13,000 a day for operating one bus.

“The civic body has to create infrastructure such as bus depots and stands. This will mean an expenditure of around Rs80 crore. I have told them that unless they increase their revenue generation, it will be difficult for the NMC to sustain the bus project and also spend on sectors such as roads, water and hospitals,” Bhujbal said.

He said it would be virtually impossible for the government to financially support NMC on the bus project since the state has to spend on the farmers’ loan waiver, Samruddhi road project and implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission.

Nimse said, “We have told Bhujbal that the NMC has issued work orders for rolling out the 400 buses to the contractors. If the project is withdrawn, NMC has to pay the contractors 80% of the project cost for violation of the contract. If the state government is willing to provide this huge amount, NMC can roll back the city bus service.”

Kunming, Ghuangzao, Shanghai and Beijing are the most frequently visited by travellers from Kolkata; coronavirus cases have been reported from Shanghai and Beijing so far.“This will hit tourism hard since China is both a leisure and a business destination. It is close to India and is well connected by flights operated by several airlines. But already, more than 40% flyers have cancelled their journey,” said Joydeep Mukherjee of Meghdootam Travels. An estimated 4,500 people travel to China from Kolkata every week but the number could drop to 2,000 by next week, said Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi. “As of now, we are asking those who have booked with us to wait and watch. But it will not be fair to ask them to take a risk. So, we might advise them to stay away from China within the next few days,” said Punjabi, who also owns Ares Travels, which sends around 100 travellers to China every week. He added it would lead to a huge loss for the tourism sector since Southeast Asian countries, too, are likely to be affected next. “Cases have been reported from Thailand and Japan, apart from Saudi Arabia. Since it is difficult to check the spread, travel will be affected across the region,” said Mukherjee. There is no travel advisory for Southeast Asian countries so far.Four airlines fly to three destinations in China directly from Kolkata; while IndiGo and China Eastern Airlines run daily flights from Guanzhou and Kunming, Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon operate flights to and from Hong Kong. Airline officials pointed out that beside the coronavirus scare, there was another reason for the passenger slump: the lunar new year and spring festival in China are celebrated now, when most shops and stores shut for around two weeks.China Eastern Airlines and IndiGo officials confirmed a significant drop in passenger count . “The inbound flights are running full. But the outbound traffic has significantly been down,” said an airport official.But doctors welcomed the advisory. “The virus has spread to all corners of China and it can’t be prevented merely by screening flyers at airports. There could be scores of infected patients travelling to and from China with no symptoms and it could be dangerous,” said an infectious diseases expert.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73600697,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-517725,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/40-flyers-cancel-trips-to-china-amid-coronavirus-scare-more-may-follow/articleshow/73595709.cms

AURANGABAD: An assistant regional transport officer has been booked by city police for illegally registering five trucks that were stolen from Mizoram.

The matter was being investigated for the past seven days following which a case was registered by deputy regional transport officer Sanjay Maitrevar with Vedantnagar police station.

The transport officer, along with other suspects, has been booked on charges of cheating, criminal breach of trust, forgery and criminal conspiracy. In addition, several sections of Central Motor Vehicle Act have also been slapped against them.

Sources informed that the role of some officers from Mizoram is also being probed as the case papers strongly indicate the same. An officer privy to the probe said despite discrepancies in the make of the vehicle and the documents, the transport officer in Aurangabad went ahead and sanctioned transfer of the stolen vehicles .

“Five trucks were stolen from Mizoram in the year 2019 and their chassis, engine and registration numbers were tampered before being transferred at Aurangabad regional transport office (RTO),” a police officer said.

After learning about registration of stolen vehicles at Aurangabad RTO, crime branch of the city police unearthed the racket following which a departmental inquiry against the suspect assistant transport officer was initiated.

As per findings of the probe, the suspect officer, while heading the licensing section, exceeded his authority and went on to grant registration of these vehicles that had serious contradiction in the documents, engine and chassis numbers.

“In the internal probe, RTO officials have found that the suspect officer bypassed all laid down mandatory norms that are to be followed while transferring of vehicles from one state to another,” the officer said.

Crime branch inspector Madhukar Sawant said the suspect officer and people, who reportedly bought these vehicles, had turned up for questioning. “But soon after they learnt about registration of offence, the officer has gone underground,” he said.

Sources in the department suspect that the case is just a small portion of the larges inter-state vehicular theft racket allegedly being assisted by RTO official in more than one state.

CHENNAI: Taking note of increasing incidents of anonymous defamatory and derogatory statements/videos being uploaded and circulated on social media , the Madras high court on Friday directed the Tamil Nadu Director-General of Police to apprise it on the mechanism available to tackle the issue.

Justice M Dhandapani also directed the DGP to file a comprehensive report on the action taken against such persons by January 29.

The judge passed the interim order while hearing the bail application moved by A Maruthachalam of Coimbatore who was arrested for uploading a video denigrating a sitting judge of the high court.

When the plea came up for hearing, the petitioner submitted that he had no role in uploading the video and claimed he had been falsely implicated in the case.

Noting that the contention of the petitioner was not satisfactory, Justice Dhandapani said, “In recent days, defamatory statements criticising persons holding constitutional posts and their families are being circulated by several persons without any evidence to substantiate their claims.”

To curb such illegal activities it would suffice to issue directions to the cybercrime branch of police to ascertain whether there was any mechanism available to nab such offenders, the judge said and directed the DGP to file the report.

340,['25/01/2020'],CBI court orders Andhra Pradesh CM YS Jaganmohan Reddy to attend January 31 hearing,"This story is from January 25, 2020

YS Jaganmohan Reddy

HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy was directed by principal special judge BR Madhusudan Rao of CBI courts, Hyderabad, to be present before the court during the next hearing on January 31 in the quid pro quo case .

The judge said this on Friday while allowing a plea to dispense with Jagan’s presence for the day’s hearing as he was preoccupied with important meetings in Amaravati . However, the judge made it clear that the chief minister must appear before the court at the next hearing. In a separate order, the judge, who is also acting as a special judge for Enforcement Directorate cases, dismissed the plea of Jagan seeking permission of the court to allow a co-accused in ED cases to represent him in the ED court.

CBI had made Jagan accused No. 1 in 11 chargesheets it filed in the quid pro quo case where he was facing allegations of influencing his late father YS Rajasekhara Reddy in doling out public assets to select industrialists and businessmen when YSR was chief minister of unvided AP between 2004 and 2009.YSRC MP V Vijayasai Reddy, who was arrayed as accused No. 2 in all the chargesheets, however, appeared before the court on Friday.

Earlier, brushing aside the objections of IAS officer Manmohan Singh, who was made an accused in the Vanpic chargesheet in the quid pro quo case, the judge took into cognisance the role played by the accused officer in the case under section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act of 1988.

Manmohan’s counsel argued that since the state had refused to accord sanction to prosecute him, the Centre’s subsequent decision to grant a sanction order should not be taken into consideration. However, CBI counsel K Surender contended that the central government was the competent authority to accord sanction or reject it in respect of IAS officers since they are appointed by the Centre. “The state’s decision either way in such matters is inconsequential,” he argued.

The judge agreed with the CBI counsel’s argument and dismissed the plea of Manmohan. Now, the IAS officer will be tried under the provisions of PC Act too. Manmohan Singh was present in the court on Friday. The judge also dismissed the plea filed seeking removal of the names of Eswar Cements and Sajjala Diwakar Reddy from the accused list as the company is no more in existence. The company was merged with Dalmia Cements, which was made an accused in the Dalmia Cements chargesheet. Surender argued that criminal liability would remain with the original accused and it cannot be done away with because the company was merged with some other entity.

Vehicles parked on roads is a common sight in residential areas.

CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday directed the Chandigarh Police to tow away vehicles parked on roads in residential areas and banned the pasting of stickers on government and private vehicles , telling the traffic police to implement these orders within 72 hours in the Tricity.

The court observed all traffic-related problems would be solved if vehicles are parked at designated parking spaces outside houses and not on the roads. The court said the traffic police should take out all their cranes and tow away vehicles parked on roads in residential areas.

A special bench of Justice Rajiv Sharma and Justice Amol Rattan Singh made it clear that there is no restriction on pasting parking stickers on government and private vehicles, but stickers referring to the post of any officer, emblem, profession like Army, doctor or press, or department are banned.

Observing that everyone is equal on the road, the bench said how could someone write a post and department on vehicles. Mentioning that charity begins at home, Justice Rajiv Sharma gave directions to his staff to immediately remove a sticker mentioning high court judge from his government vehicle. Justice Rajiv Sharma had passed these directions in 2018 as well while he was posted at the Uttarakhand high court. The court said it is surprising that some people have even pasted stickers such as relative or neighbour of MLA or DC to showcase their supremacy over others.

The court also directed the UT administration to consider writing down names of martyrs on underpass connecting the Rose Garden in Sector 16 to Sector 17. The court observed the walls could be converted into war memorials by inscribing names of those who had laid down their life for the nation. The court directed DCs of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula to convene a meeting regarding installation and working of CCTV cameras in school buses.

Nashik: The district collector Suraj Mandhare has warned the revenue department field staff for their failure in cracking down on illegal mining being carried out in the district.

The move comes after three tractors were seized by the squad led-by district mining officer Anand Patil, where few offenders threatened the officials.

The DMO team was inspecting the mining sites in the Sayane area of Malegaon taluka on Thursday evening at the time of the incident.

“The officer led the squad and confiscated three tractors carrying minor minerals illegally from the quarries. As he was about to move on, some people came there and they picked up an argument with the officer. They threatened them and even pelted a stone. No one was injured in the incident,” collector said.

Mandhare further said that the first information report (FIR) was filed with the the concerned police station at Malegao. At the same time, a stern warning was issued to the field staff for its failure to plug in illegal quarrying in the district.

“At the time when the district administration is ready to resolve issues of the miners, they should come forth and take proper permissions which are delivered in a stipulated time. But it seems the people are not willing to pay taxes to the government. This cannot happen and hence I have warned the field officers to be strict against such miners,” the collector said.

The field staff has a primary responsibility to curb such practices. “The the district-level team is in the supervisory mode. If the local team is unable to stop the menace and if the district level teams find such cases in the same areas, the field officers will have to justify their failure in taking action against the illegal miners,” the officer said.

PANAJI: While the state’s garbage management is being closely monitored by the high court and the state government is assuring the court that it is collecting door-to-door garbage, multiple complaints are being filed at the Old Goa police station over trucks illegally and clandestinely dumping waste.

After villagers filed police complaints and police seized trucks dumping CCP’s waste at Carambolim ten days ago, locals on Friday were again forced to complain to police after alert villagers caught a truck driver red handed while dumping what is suspected to be waste from a five-star hotel.

Pornem Goemcho Nagrik Monch-Old Goa on Friday complained to police over the “continuous dumping of garbage” in Old Goa as well as the burning of garbage. The complaint filed by president of the association Ambar Amonkar stated that, on January 1, at 9.30am a truck was found “dumping garbage in the jurisdiction of the village panchayat of Carambolim and Old Goa near Healthway Hospital”.

“The panchayat of Old Goa has not given any permission for such activities,” the complaint stated.

Only ten days ago citizens of Old Goa and Carambolim filed complaints over CCP’s dumping of 50 truck loads of garbage at Carambolim in a private property, posing a threat to the heritage fortress wall that runs through the two villages.

The Goa Heritage Action Group and villagers of Carambolim and Old Goa on Monday appealed to the North Goa collector to put a stop to the “wonton desecration of our priceless heritage” as the historic heritage landmark fort wall on the Kadamba plateau area is being used as a garbage dumping place.

351,['25/01/2020'],Agra IG orders removal of unauthorized roadside eateries on Yamuna expressway,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Agra: After back-to-back robberies, Agra IG range has asked for the removal of all unauthorized roadside eateries on Yamuna expressway on Friday. However, it took 13 letters from Jaypee infratech - the private concessionaire operating the Yamuna expressway - and nine cases of robbery since 2019, to compel UP police to take action against such eateries along the 165-km-long route.

Agra IG range Satish Ganesh, who ordered SSPs of Agra, Hathras, Mathura, Aligarh and Noida to remove eateries along the expressway, said, “I have conducted extensive patrolling on the stretch and spotted all the areas which pose a security threat to commuters. I have asked local police to take appropriate action.”

According to private concessionaire, there are at least 25 roadside eateries in over 10 villages on both sides of the expressway which includes Awalkheda, Jrailiya, Barauta, Makrand, Lukhriya, Palkheda, Mirpur, Suraj, Kapur, Mirthana, Gadsauli and Aagai.

Here, truck drivers, private bus operators, private taxis and others often take a break from their journey - which is prohibited due to continuous fast movement of traffic. Sources claimed that unauthorized eateries are located at several milestones.

Speaking to TOI, Major (retired) Manish Singh, in-charge coordinator of Yamuna expressway (Mathura-Agra) section, said, “The robbers, we suspect, usually select their targets in these eateries. Most of the criminal activities recorded are also near these eateries. And they access the Yamuna expressway by cutting through the barbed wire. In a majority of such cases, shocked victims prefer to drive away, instead of waiting for police help. On several occasions, we wrote letters to local police stations - Naujheel, Mannt, Baldeo, Yamunapar, Surir and Mahavan - requesting them to take action against unauthorized eateries.”

According to private concessionaire in 2019, robberies were reported at some of the milestones between February and September. A majority of the targets were buses, trucks, taxi operators, tourists and bikers.

“They first throw sharp-edged wedge on the stretch and wait for tyres of vehicles to deflate, thereby forcing the victims to come out. The armed gang then suddenly appears to rob them,” Singh added.

Robberies were reported at milestone 75, Naujheel, in June and September last year. In June, a woman from Mauritius, along with her two Indian friends, heading to Agra to visit Taj Mahal were allegedly robbed at gunpoint, while in September, two trucks were robbed by a gang, who then fled in their sedan.

Notably, 12 sub-inspectors, 42 constables, a dozen of Japyee Infratech security personnel are posted on the stretch between Noida and Agra. They patrol in vehicles around the clock.

HYDERABAD: BJP national manifesto sub-committee and state executive member Karuna Gopal on Friday criticised IT and Industries minister KT Rama Rao for hard-selling Hyderabad in Davos and pitching for investments from pharma companies, when the pharma firms present in and around the city are polluting the lakes .

He said that the government’s apathy will push Hyderabad into ICU (intensive care unit) and turn it from ‘bhagya nagaram to durbhagya nagaram’ (city of fortunes to city of misfortunes).

Gopal, who is also the president of Futuristic Cities, expressed concerns over the increasing encroachment of lakes and ponds in Telangana .

Expressing concerns over the increasing encroachment of lakes and ponds in Telangana, she said that the state would soon face a situation like that in Jaisalmer if steps to check pollution and encroachments are not taken. “In Jaisalmer, an individual is given half a mug of water to take bath,” she said.

She added that the TRS government’s proposal to scrap GO 111, which prohibits any construction activity within 10-km radius of Osmansagar and Himayatsagar reservoirs, has resulted in rampant encroachment of the catchment areas of the two water bodies.

The bandh had no impact in the city, but in rural areas like Igatpuri, Manmad and Nandgaon, the markets remained closed. Also, no untoward incident was reported from any part of the district.

VBA president Prakash Ambedkar had called for the bandh on Friday appealing people to join the protest against CAA and National Register of Citizens (NRC), claiming that they were targeted at minorities and were anti-constitutional.

On Friday morning, several people gathered at Nashik Road and Nashik City areas appealing the people to join the bandh. At Nashik Road, a rally was organized, while in the city some people had gathered near the statue of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, raising slogans against the CAA and the NRC.

Life in few pockets of Igatpuri, Manmad and Nandgaon was affected for few hours owing to the bandh. As the shops, hotels and restaurants in main markets were closed in Manmad, people coming from outside the town had a tough time searching for eateries.

CHANDIGARH: Many parents celebrated and while others had to return disappointed as the city’s four most sought-after convent schools -- St Anne’s Convent School , Sector 32; Sacred Heart Convent School, Sector 26; St John’s, Sector 26; and Carmel Convent School , Sector 9, conducted draw of lots for admissions to entry-level classes on Friday.

At St John’s School, draw of lots was held for 95 seats out of a total 160 seats. At Carmel Convent School, 58 out of a total 120 seats, were decided through a draw.

At Sacred Heart School, draw of lots was held for 101 seats out of a total 160 seats and at St Anne’s, 87 seats out of a total 200 seats were decided through draw.

All the four schools witnessed a huge rush of parents. As the draw began, parents restlessly waited for their kids’ names to be announed. While the lucky ones celebrated with their kids, the ones whose wards couldn’t find a place had to leave broken-hearted.

Harpreet Singh, a city resident whose daughter got admission in Sacred Heart School, said, “I am very happy. We had tried in other schools but couldn’t get admission. We got lucky here.”

However, Harvinder Singh, another city resident, was not so lucky as his daughter’s name didn’t come in the draw.

“I am disappointed. But it’s all about luck. We will try in some other school in the city,” said Harvinder.

While schools offered more than half the seats through draw of lots, the rest of the seats are reserved for preferred categories, including wards of staff and alumni and siblings of already studying students.

While this year, these four schools offered 341 seats out of a total 640 seats, last year the schools had opened 320 seats out of a total 640 seats.

In 2018, 354 seats were offered through draw of lots and in 2017, 341 seats were offered through draw of lots.

Coimbatore: Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services department has formed a commando force to control forest fire across the state.

C Sylendra Babu, director of the department, said the force has a strength of 700 firemen, who would be given special training in handling forest fire.

He was in the city on Friday to inspect Coimbatore South fire station. Addressing the media, he said the department had received 25,400 fire and another 26,800 rescue calls last year. He said firemen had rescued 250 people from various natural calamities in the state.

Pointing out that the department has been working with the forest department to douse forest fire, he said, “Our firemen had put out the forest fire at Thuckalay in Kanyakumari district recently. To curb forest fire, we have formed commando forces. Initially, 700 firemen will be given special training in bringing forest fire under control.”

Sylendra Babu said the department had been focusing on western districts, where 140 firemen in the commando force were ready to beat forest fire.

He said they were conducting awareness campaign on fire safety for school students. “We have conducted 3,600 awareness campaigns in the state so far and taught the students what to do when an LPG cylinder catches fire.”

According to Sylendra Babu, there are 329 fire stations and two rescue stations in the state, with a manpower of 7,300. The rescue stations are in Hogenekal and Kotagiri.

The state government is, meanwhile, all set to open fire stations at Thondamuthur and Periyanaickenpalayam in the district. “The buildings and fire tenders are ready. We are waiting the government nod to open them,” he said.

Coimbatore South fire station covers more than 25-30km till Chadivayal. In the case of any fire incident in Poondi or surrounding areas, it would take more than 30-40 minutes for the fire tenders to reach the spot. Similarly, Periyanaickenpalayam area falls under Kavundampalayam fire station limits and it would take 30 minutes for firemen to reach there. “The two new fire stations would bring down the response time considerably.”

Also, a temperature drop is in the offing with the northwesterly winds getting stronger in Kolkata on Friday.

But the mercury will start rising from Tuesday as the western disturbance approaches. We expect clouds on Tuesday and a few rounds of drizzles in the latter half of the day. But the drizzles could be more steady on Wednesday as the city celebrates Saraswati Puja,” said Regional Meteorological Centre director G K Das. “The mercury will rise as clouds float in. But the day temperature will be low in the absence of sunlight. The northwesterly, however, will lose strength by then.”

With the northwesterly winds returning, the mercury is set to slide down. “But as we are in the second half of January, the northwesterly is unlikely to be stinging and won’t last beyond the weekend,” added Das.

CHANDIGARH: An Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) cell will soon be established at the PGI. The proposal approved by various committees within the institute has been finally sent to the governing body to be chaired by the Union minister of health and family welfare. Research is one of the mandates of the tertiary care centre.

“We would want to translate ideas into products which are affordable and accessible to all. That is why the IPR proposal has been sent to the governing body. This shall enable facilitation of patents, commercialization and other processes that are required for this translation,” said Prof Arvind Rajwanshi , dean academics, PGI.

The IPR already exists in Panjab University which is for the university researchers and scientists. “In the absence of such centre it gets tough for us to move forward. There is a huge patient rush and despite that when we try and find time for research, such processing without any assistance hampers the translation,” said a faculty.There are over 500 faculty and 1,200 resident doctors in the PGI. “But there are hardly any patents or products in the PGI. We have huge publications in high impact journals. These publications seldom turn into any product or technology,” said a faculty. The PGI has started focusing on research after it had a separate dean for research and academic activities. There are two incubation centres, one of which will soon start functioning.

“These incubation centres also have facilities for innovation and marketing of the product. Once there is a dedicated IPR cell, things will work at a faster pace,” said Prof Rajwanshi.

The aim of the IPR cell will be to provide protection of research and patented technology or idea. It will guide the scientists on how to obtain and sustain patents. It will work out on modalities on behalf of the PGI for commercialization of patented technologies.

BB Dikshit library, AIIMS. (Photo: https://www.aiims.edu)

NEW DELHI: After over three decades of its existence, the BB Dikshit library at AIIMS is being retrofitted with a lift to make it accessible for the disabled students . The hospital’s engineering division has started the work, a source said.

According to Dr Satender Singh, a disabled rights activist, the action follows years of follow up with the authorities that had initially suggested that the building was too old for such retrofitting. “Several areas in AIIMS are not disabled friendly, including the library, hostels and select areas of the new private ward. I have been highlighting this issue since 2013,” he said.

He added that the issue of lack of accessibility for disabled in medical colleges and hospitals across the country was also taken up with the Medical Council of India and National Human Rights Commission, among others.

The library came into existence in 1957. Originally, it was accommodated on the ground floor of the pre-clinical block, but in 1973, it was shifted to its current premises and was called Dr B B Dikshit Library — after the founder director of the institute. It consists of two floors with a carpet area of 27,000 sq feet and seating capacity of 300 persons.

“The books, journals and seating area are on the first floor. I found it difficult to access it but somehow managed. But many of my colleagues who were dependent on crutches never got to access the library,” said Dr Ish Kumar, former student of the institute, who suffers from post-polio paralysis. He added that installing a lift was a necessary action and similar steps should be taken to make the hostels and other areas disabled friendly.

In 2018, Resident Doctors’ Association of AIIMS had also written to the institute director over the issue of non-accessibility of library and hostels for Divyang residents.

Coimbatore: The city corporation on Friday bagged an award from the ministry of housing and urban affairs for conserving the urban environment by installing two solar power plants with a capacity of one megawatt each.

Corporation commissioner Sravan Kumar Jatavath received the award comprising a certificate and a cash prize of Rs5 lakh at a function that was held in Vishakhapatnam.

The award ceremony was organized by the ministry to recognize the excellence of cities that were selected for the smart city project in areas such as water management, good governance and conservation of urban environment, among others.

The city corporation had spent around Rs11 crore on the solar power plants. According to a source, the award also recognized the civic body’s plans to utilize the places that were once dump yards for setting up the solar power plants.

The first plant at Ukkadam, which was set up at a cost of R 5.5 crore, has 3,168 panels with a capacity of 320 watts each. Inaugurated in March last year, it today supplies electricity directly to the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation’s Ukkadam substation. The plant mainly helps the city corporation offset the electricity cost to operate the water pumping station at Velliangadu. According to the source, the plant helps the city corporation save around Rs7.91 lakh on electricity bills a month.

The work on installing the second solar power plant is underway at Kavundampalayam.

The civic body has also plans to create a study centre at Ukkadam solar power plant, where students could come and study more about renewable energy and benefits. “We want to create more awareness among students and motivate them to move towards renewable forms of energy either in their houses, places of work or business in the future,” the source said.

365,['25/01/2020'],State govt increases lease rate of civic properties,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Nashik: The lease rate for properties owned by of civic bodies across Maharashtra has been increased from 2.5% to 8% of the existing Ready Reckoner (RR) rates by the state government.

All civic bodies, including Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), have been directed to start levying the new lease rates. Moreover, the state government has also rejected the proposal sent by NMC to lease out its properties to social outfits and NGOs at 1% of the existing RR rate.

A civic official said that the NMC received the communique on this issue from the state government in the first week of January. “We will table a proposal in this regard during the upcoming general body meeting to be held next month for approval,” the official said, adding that the NMC will start levying new lease rates after getting approval from the general body.

There are over 2500 properties, including 1,900 commercial outlets and remaining 900 study halls, community halls, libraries, laughter clubs, gymnasiums that have been leased out to different parties by the NMC.

Few months ago there was a controversy after city-based educationist Ratan Luth had filed a PIL at the Bombay high court (HC) over misuse of NMC properties.

During a hearing in April last year, the HC had directed the civic administration to submit a status report on properties that were given to social institutes and NGOs at nominal rates on May 3.

However, the NMC failed to submit the report and was pulled up by the HC for not maintaining records of its properties. The court also directed municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game to remain present during the next hearing.

Following this, the NMC started taking action against properties being misused and sealed 382 of its 945 properties across six divisions. Later, all political parties had urged the civic chief to soften its stand against the properties which were being run for social cause.

The civic body then decided to relieve those properties that were being used directly by the public and also renew agreements of those properties being used by social outfits and NGOs at lease rate of 2.5% of the RR rate. Around 270 civic properties are still locked.

Last year, the general body had decided to levy only 1% of RR rates on properties given to social outfits for social cause. The resolution of the GBM was later sent to the state government for approval. The policy also includes a fine of 2% per month on the lease amount for delay in clearing dues.

Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), a global alliance financing and coordinating the development of vaccines against infectious diseases, will fund these “pioneering technologies” to speed up the development of vaccines against emerging threats like nCoV-2019, Gagandeep Kang, vice-chairperson of Cepi, told TOI here on Friday.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the new coronavirus an emergency for China with several deaths reported in the country, but stopped short of declaring it a global epidemic.Coronaviruses a family of viruses that can lead to respiratory illness including severe acute respiratory syndrome, are transmitted between animals and people, and can evolve into strains not previously identified in humans. On January 7, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of pneumonia in Wuhan (China), and additional cases have been detected in a growing number of countries, including Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, and US.US-based companies Inovio and Moderna, and Brisbane-based University of Queensland will leverage rapid response platforms (in separate programmes) already supported by Cepi as well as a new partnership, to advance vaccine candidates for coronavirus, into clinical testing as quickly as possible. “Our aspiration with these technologies is to bring a new pathogen from gene sequence to clinical testing in 16 weeks – which is significantly shorter than where we are now,” Richard Hatchett, CEO of Cepi, said.Cepi, launched at Davos in 2017 to develop vaccines to prevent epidemics, is also working on vaccines against Chikungunya, Ebola, MERS and Lassa viruses.Speaking on the sidelines of the Indian Society for Clinical Research conference here, Kang, who is also executive director, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (Department of Biotechnology), said the idea at Cepi is to be prepared for what may be the next outbreak, instead of being reactive.The organisation awarded Inovio a $9 million grant to develop a vaccine against the recently emerged strain of coronavirus. The initial funding will support Inovio’s preclinical and clinical development through Phase 1 human testing, according to a company statement. Further, Cepi will invest up to $10.6 million in University of Queensland to develop a “molecular clamp” vaccine platform, a transformative technology that enables targeted and rapid vaccine production against multiple viral pathogens, the release adds.Under the agreement, Cepi announced a new partnership with Moderna and US-based National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to manufacture an mRNA (messenger RNA) vaccine against 2019-nCoV.Also, Cepi invests in platform technologies that can be used for rapid vaccine and immunoprophylactic development against unknown pathogens (ie, Disease X). Till now, it has committed to investing over $456 million in vaccine and platform development, according to its website.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/development-of-coronavirus-vaccine-initiated-under-3-programmes/articleshow/73595874.cms

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ) has decided to rope in a private agency to demolish illegal structures which are more than one storied buildings.

The agency will engage its own machinery and manpower to demolish structures and remove the debris. The move was taken due to short of employees in the civic body.

The NMC is looking to establish a two-year contract with the contractor. “We are facing manpower crunch to conduct demolition drive against illegal encroachments in the city. It is very difficult when we have to demolish illegal structures on the first floor or multi-storied buildings,” said an NMC source.

After illegal structures, the NMC would be diverting their attention to illegal hoardings. “We would need manpower for the illegal hoardings drive. Most of the illegal hoardings are large with an iron skeleton,” said an official.

The civic body has already floated the tender and the agency is expected to be finalised within a month. “Further, there is also an issue of abandoned vehicles on the roads. It will also be the responsibility of the agency to lift these vehicles,” added the official.

The process has already started and the last date for filing the bid is February 7. The tenders will be then opened on the same day after 4.00 pm.

Last month, the civic body identified over 300 illegal hoardings, but it could remove only 200 illegal hoardings in the area. Around 100 illegal hoardings are yet to be removed by the civic administration which was put up on dividers, electric poles and traffic islands.

Out of the pending hoardings, many were a large and iron skeleton. Lack of equipment on the NMC part further delayed the process.

Also, the NMC had to temporarily stop the drive against illegal hoardings as most of the staff was busy in Swachh Survekshan 2020.

Namakkal: The National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC) has changed its price fixation pattern once again from daily basis to thrice a week. The change was implemented from Thursday onwards.

The NECC, the rate fixation committee for eggs, has been functioning from Namakkal district. The committee earlier fixed the price once in a week. This was practised for more than 40 years. Later, in July 1, 2017, the price of an egg was fixed for three times in a week.

The rate which will be fixed on Monday will be in effect for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. This pattern also was changed four months ago and changed to every day around 7 pm. The price was applicable until next evening 7 pm.

The poultry farmers across the state have accepted NECC’s thrice a week price fixation pattern. They had started opposing it after it got changed to everyday.

According to poultry farmers, the retailers usually buy eggs at least 30 paise from the NECC rate. It also urged the poultry farmers to sell their eggs on the NECC rate and asked them not to drop their products’ price.

“The retailers were badly affected in the everyday rate fixation pattern as they could not sell their eggs due to rate fluctuation,” S Balaji, one of the poultry farmers. Talking to TOI, he also said that, the retailers refused to buy the eggs without slashed rates.

One of the members of the rate fixation committee said that, the new rate fixation pattern will help regulate the egg trade industry in Namakkal as it is the main hub for egg production which produces about 4 crore eggs every day.

KOCHI: A liver transplant was performed in a city hospital on an eight-month-old baby , who weighed about 6kg. Normal weight of a healthy child would be 9 kg.

Rabeeh Noufal was not only underweight but also had underdeveloped lungs and suffered from recurrent infections.

In 2019, the child was brought to VPS Lakeshore hospital with jaundice, the bilirubin level 42 times the normal. He also suffered from a rare condition called biliary atresia for which he had undergone a unsuccessful surgery earlier.

A team of doctors led by Dr Abhishek Yadav evaluated him and decided that the only possible option was liver transplantation . “Liver transplantation in the baby was very risky as the child had low weight and was extremely malnourished, had underdeveloped lungs and suffered from recurrent infections,” said Dr Abhishek.

The major challenge was to find a piece of liver to fit inside the child’s small belly and rid the child of the ventilator support after a 14-hour surgery. So first, a very small part from the left side of the father’s liver was removed and transplanted into the baby. “The second problem was much trickier as the child needed a long time to gain strength to breathe on its own after the transplantation due to his underdeveloped lungs. It was unthinkable to put the child on ventilator for so long,” said Dr Abhishek.

So after the transplant, they created an artificial passage to the child’s wind pipe by tracheostomy, to enable the child to breath easily. The child is now fine and back home.

AHMEDABAD: City crime branch on Saturday arrested four men — Sanju Sharma, 46, of Jalod in UP, Bhupesh Yadav, 28, of Morena, MP, Jiten Bhogiram Kori , 38, of Madhya Pradesh and Umesh Patel , 30, of Odhav — for allegedly robbing a jeweller of Rs 3,51,000 cash and jewellery worth Rs 6 lakh in Odhav on January 8.

Senior superintendent of police Deepan Bhadran, said that a team lead by inspector J N Chavda was deployed to crack the case.

“After scanning through several mobile numbers, a few numbers were shortlisted and through technical surveillance and human intelligence, we learned that the perpetrators were from other states. We also learned that they were in Gwalior, MP,” Bhadran said.

ACP crime branch B V Gohil said they immediately contacted Gwalior police and learned that the accused were from a gang from Morena and Ambaha districts.

“We also learned that some members of the gang were in Gujarat,” added Gohil. Investigators said they got a tip-off, that the gang members involved in the Odhav armed robbery are presently in Gujarat. “We learned that they had pistols and country-made weapons and were near the Odhav fire station, with the robbed jewellery,” said a crime branch official.

A team lead by inspector J N Chavda was dispatched to the spot and the accused were nabbed. “We recovered one pistol, two country-made handguns and 24 rounds some of 7.65mm calibre, one magazine, three mobile phones and one motorcycle,” said a crime branch source.

CM Pramod Sawant

PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant and state officials were left squirming in their seats on Friday when the 15th Finance Commission questioned the laxity shown by the government in constituting the state finance commission.

After the commission, which is headed by N K Singh, raised the query, Sawant assured the panel that the state finance commission would be set up within 30-45 days.

“We did bring to the notice of the state government that (concerning) the constitution of the state finance commission, which is a mandatory requirement, Goa needs to give it some degree of attention and priority,” said Singh. The commission briefed reporters after meeting all stakeholders.

The finance commission was in the state for a three-day visit, and over the past two days, it met representatives of local government bodies, industry bodies and political parties. Panchayats and urban local bodies, in their closed door meeting with the commission, informed the commission that grants were not reaching them.

“Strengthening the third tier of government was one of the issues that came up,” said Singh. According to Singh, the first report of the state finance commission has been under examination for 19 years, the second report has yet to receive final approval, and the third report has not been filed even though the time to do so has already lapsed.

“In line with their directions, we are appointing the state finance commission as early as possible and as per their recommendations, urban local bodies and panchayats which don’t get performance grants will receive the funds,” said Sawant after meeting the commission.

Panchayats and municipal bodies struggle for funds, and if funds are granted by the finance commission, the money rarely reaches the end user in time, said officials of local governing bodies. Release of funds is often stalled as panchayats and municipal bodies fail to submit utilisation certificates or performance reports on time.

“More robust functioning of the third tier of government through the state finance commission is a priority which I think deserves all our support,” said Singh.

386,['25/01/2020'],56% schoolchildren have unhealthy BMI in Chennai,"Representative image

CHENNAI: About 56% of schoolchildren surveyed in the city have an unhealthy body-mass index (BMI). The national survey aimed at understanding the overall health and fitness levels of children in schools .The survey assessed the children on fitness parameters such as body mass index, aerobic and anaerobic capacity (musculoskeletal force that does not require oxygen), flexibility, core, upper and lower body strength. Sportz Village, an organisation that trains schools students in various sport, covered more than 1.4 lakh children between 7 and 17 years from 364 schools across 250 cities and towns.Although more boys in Chennai had a better body mass index, upper body strength and flexibility, girls outdid the boys in lower body strength and aerobic capacity. While 49% boys were found to have a healthy BMI compared to 46% girls, aerobic capacity of girls was 41% compared to 23% in boys. They were equal in anaerobic capacity (66%) and abdominal strength (84%).At the national level, the survey found that every other child had an unhealthy BMI. An almost equal number did not have adequate lower body strength. The survey also found a gap between students of government and private schools. Children in private schools had better BMI (47%) compared to children in government schools (35%), besides parameters such as upper and lower body and abdominal strength. Students who went to state-run schools had better flexibility, aerobic and anaerobic capacity.“Poor fitness is a cause for concern. They need more physical activity,” said Saumil Majmudar, CEO, Sportz Village. This requires structured in-school physical education programmes that are age-appropriate and inclusive, he said.Weekly physical education periods, according to the survey, were crucial. Children with more than two physical education periods per week had significantly higher aerobic capacity. “Most children don’t eat healthy; they exercise little. Getting them to the play field not only makes them fit but also relaxes them,” said S Satish, a physical education teacher at a private school. “Many kids who adopt sport try to practise it after school hours even they are not serious about the game,” he said.Lower student-teacher ratio allows a teacher to manage the physical education class better. “Individual attention is not lost even in group games. We will be able to correct their body postures, enhance endurance, build strength and minimise injuries,” said R Dhananjay, who trains students in badminton.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73603380,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-113769,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/56-schoolchildren-have-unhealthy-bmi-in-chennai/articleshow/73594604.cms

KOCHI: The state-level monitoring committee (SLMC) on environment appointed by the National Green Tribunal ( NGT ) has asked Maradu municipality to take steps to prevent cement-mixed water from the four sites, where the buildings were demolished, flow directly into nearby water bodies.

“Following the use of sprinklers, it was found that the water containing cement was flowing to the water body, which could affect the fish spawning in the area. Hence, we have issued instructions to take steps to prevent the direct flow of the water into the water body,” said Justice (retd) A V Ramakrishna Pillai .

Either they should take steps to prevent the water directly reaching the water body or store the water in a tank and treat it before releasing it into the lake, he said.

Maradu municipality secretary Muhammed Arif Khan and sub-collector Snehil Kumar Singh were present at the meeting held in Thiruvananthapuram on Friday. SLMC appreciated both for carrying out demolition of the buildings successfully. It has asked the secretary to ensure debris is removed in a time-bound manner following construction and demolition waste management rules strictly and immediately.

SLMC asked the secretary to ensure that barricades are erected around the sites. It also said that debris should be removed in covered vehicles and sought periodical reports from pollution control board regarding the progress of debris removal. PCB chief engineer P Biju has been entrusted with the task of supervising the debris removal and submitting report to the SLMC.

Though the secretary told the committee that municipality council would raise objection regarding issues related to debris, the SLMC said secretary is the authority in ensuring the C and D rules in the local body. “If the council raises objection, it should be intimated to the state government,” SLMC told Khan.

Meanwhile, the local body is likely to witness another election to the post of chairperson soon as current chairperson T H Nadeera will be resigning from the post by this month-end. She will be replaced by Moly James from Kattithara division.

When the current governing body assumed office in 2015, Ajitha Nandakumar was the chairperson. Later, Divya Anil Kumar and Suneela Siby became chairpersons.

Vice-chairman Boban Nedumparambil is also likely to resign with Jinson Peter from Ayurveda Hospital division his likely replacement.

CHENNAI: This is a sports meet with a difference, where there are no losers and every participant goes back home with a medal. The Alina–MCDS 10th Unified Sports Meet which will be held on Saturday aims to sensitise children on the challenges faced by the disabled.

“Montfort Community Development Society (MCDS) has four community-based rehabilitation centres for special children and youth with a total strength of 95 students,” says Bro Mathew Alexander , project director , MCDS.

In unified sports, mainstream students are partnered with children with disability so that they learn to help each other and work as a team. They participate in sports events and the combined score of both children is taken.

“Unified Sports Day was started in 2005 by late Bro Patrick , founding director of MCDS and Bro George Vazhayil, founding principal of Montfort Matriculation Higher Secondary School, St Thomas Mount, with the technical support of Dr M S Nagarajan, Special Olympics International,” says Alexander, adding the school was established as an inclusive school. “It now has 180 special children,” he says.

About 500 students and youth are expected to participate in the event this year. “Around 70 people from our centres will be participating. We have also invited other organisations working in the field,” says Alexander.

Each special athlete will be paired with student to participate in events such as running, relay, shot put, obstacle race etc. “The event will be held from 8:30am to 2pm and each pair will spend the whole time together. The Unified Partners in fact will bring an extra lunch packet that day, which they will share with their partner, the special athlete as a fellowship lunch at the end of the sports meet,” says Alexander. “There are no losers, every participant will be given a medal.” The highlight this year is an Olympic torch run. “It will start from St Thomas Mount, where the torch will be lit and brought to the venue. About 40 special athletes and their unified partners will participate in the run,” says Alexander.

Mangaluru: A 35-year-old woman sustained severe burns after she was attacked by her brother-in-law with acid that is used to make rubber sheets , at Kodimbala , Kadaba taluk in Dakshina Kananda.

The victim, Swapna , a widow and mother of three daughters, is being treated at Wenlock Hospital, Mangaluru, and her condition is stable, said police.

A row over not paying bank loans resulted in the attack, according to police. The accused is Jayananda, 55, a resident of Kodimbala.

The incident took place on Thursday evening, when Jayananda, an agricultarist, came to the victim’s house and started abusing her in foul language over not paying a bank loan . In the melee, he opened a bottle of acid used for making rubber sheets, and threw it inside the house. The acid fell on Swapna and her daughter, who has sustained minor burns.

Police said that Swapna has received burns on her face, while her daughter has minor injuries on her legs and hands.

Ravi Kumar, the victim’s husband, had taken a loan of Rs 5 lakh against his land, at a cooperative bank, and died in October 2018.

The loan was taken to build a new house and purchase a water pumpset. He died after paying two instalments of the loan.

Accused got bank notices

After his death, Swapna was unable to repay the remaining amount of the loan, and all the bank notices were addressed to accused Jayananda. Swapna eked out a livelihood through the agriculture land which was given to her by her father-in-law.

A case has been registered at Kadaba police station under Indian Penal Code sections 447, 504, 506 and 326A (acid attack) on Friday evening, against the accused.

Meerut: In a major breakthrough, two men have been arrested for allegedly posing as policemen, hounding unassuming traders carrying costly jewellery by planting drugs in their bags and decamping with their cash and gold.

According to police sources, the two have been identified as residents of Farukhhabad -- Nisar Hussain and Suhail Afridi. They were arrested by Meerut police on a tip-off. Gold jewellery weighing 100 grams, Rs 5 lakh in cash and 500 grams of narcotics were seized from them.

According to Ajay Sahani, SSP, “The two persons arrested are from Farukkhabad and claim to be of Iranian origin. Their modus operandi was simple. They would don policemen’s uniforms and surround an unsuspecting target. One of the thugs would engage the latter in a conversation while the other would plant drug packets inside his bag. This would unsettle the victim and soon enough, after taking him to a secluded spot, he would be robbed.”

A similar incident had taken place in October last year when local jeweller Suresh Chand Rastogi was robbed near the railway station after he was told by “men in khakhi” to undergo a search. Later, his valuables were taken away. Several other incidents had taken place earlier.

“A case has been registered under IPC section 379 (theft), 420 (cheating) and relevant sections of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substance (NDPS) Act against the duo,” said station in charge, Delhi Gate thana, Ravinder Singh. Meanwhile, SSP Sahani has issued a letter to SSP Farukkhabad to verify the documents of the duo arrested.

KOLKATA: One evening, while returning home from work at Howrah, railwayman Tapas Bagchi received an SOS from a staffer at Bally station. A girl child was found loitering on the station premises but was unable to say where she lived. Bagchi, who had already embarked on a mission by then to rescue homeless children from stations, got off the local train at Bally and found the girl in distress. There was nobody to take charge of her so late in the evening. Finally, Bagchi took her to his Konnagar home where he lives with his wife and daughter.

Nearly 12 years later, on Tuesday, Bagchi chanced upon a boy scavenging for food at Howrah station. He didn’t look like a vagabond but was clearly very hungry. Bagchi took him aside and offered him food. The teenager opened up gradually and narrated that he is a Class XI student from Durg in Chhattisgarh.

“His name is Ghanshyam Singh and he lost his father a few years ago. He stays in a hostel and studies. He scored nearly 88% marks in his Class X examination. He seems to have got frustrated due to something and boarded a train from Durg. For the next few days, he survived on food given him by people and whatever he could find in dustbins. He was too shy to tell people of his predicament till I approached him,” Bagchi said.

This time, Bagchi did not have to take Ghanshyam home to Konnagar. Bagchi and his friends had come together several years ago to form an organisation named ‘Oistic’. It provides relief to children from poor backgrounds and pavement dwellers in particular. With all his savings, Bagchi purchased a property in Serampore and handed it over to ‘Oistic’ a few years ago. That is now home for six kids. Ghanshyam was provided fresh clothes and put up at this home while his family was contacted.

“His family responded immediately. His mother assured that her brother would reach Howrah on Wednesday with all necessary documents to take his charge. This brings back memories of the girl I took home over a decade ago. She was from Mumbai and stayed with us for four days. Now, she is training to be an air-hostess. We are also very proud of our ‘Oistic’ Home. One of the inmates, Arpit Nath, stood first in his Class VII exams this year,” Bagchi added.

On Wednesday Ghanshyam was handed over to his uncle Virendra Thakur at Howrah station in the presence of Pallavi Goswami , senior rail official.

393,['25/01/2020'],EBCs to get Rs 10 lakh aid to start businesses schemes: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Nitish Kumar

PATNA: The state government has launched a new entrepreneurship scheme for the extremely backward classes (EBCs), under which those eligible will be provided an assistance of Rs 10 lakh to set up small businesses.

Chief minister Nitish Kumar launched the ambitious scheme on Friday for the EBCs, who account for nearly 30% of the state’s population, with an eye on the state election scheduled to be held later this year.

“The “Mukhya Mantri Ati Pichhda Varg Udyami Yojana ’ will provide a financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh to any eligible member of EBC communities for setting up a small enterprise,” Nitish said, adding, “Of the total assistance, Rs 5 lakh will be provided as subsidy and the rest Rs 5 lakh as interest-free loan.”

The CM was addressing a programme organized to commemorate the birth anniversary of socialist leader and former Bihar CM Karpoori Thakur, a prominent EBC leader. Nitish also pointed out that sections of the Muslim community also come under the EBC category and “they will also benefit from the new scheme”. The event was organized by JD(U)’s EBC cell at Sri Krishna Memorial Hall here.

Nitish said the scheme is on the lines of the Mukhya Mantri SC/ST Udyami Yojana, which was implemented in the state two years ago. He added that the state government would provide training to the selected applicants before providing the assistance.

“Only yesterday, I discussed the nitty-gritty of the new scheme with the state’s industries minister Shyam Rajak and he has agreed to do carry out the required exercise,” he said with Rajak on the dais with him.

In Bihar, around 130 castes are listed under the state government’s EBC category. Of them, 36 castes, including Ansari, Julaha, Momin, Dhunia, Chirihaar, Bakkho, Rangrej, Madar among others, are from the Muslim community.

Rajak told TOI that the new scheme would come into force from the current financial year after getting a formal approval from the state cabinet. “As announced by the CM, all facilities of the Mukhya Mantri SC/ST Udyami Yojana will be provided to EBCs under the new scheme. The department has listed altogether 101 projects under the SC/ST scheme and members of EBC community can choose any project from the list,” Rajak said.

“The industries department has prepared a proposal for the new scheme. It will soon be sent to the cabinet secretariat for putting up at the next cabinet meeting,” an industries department official said.

Political analysts say it could prove to be a “game changer” during the assembly election as the EBCs form around 30% of votes in Bihar. “The new scheme will bring unprecedented socio-economic change among the members of EBCs because majority of castes under this category are either artisans or having traditional entrepreneurship. The assistance of Rs 10 lakh will lead to their economic uplift,” Arvind Kumar Nishad, an EBC leader told TOI.

<p>CM Naveen Patnaik <br></p>

CUTTACK: In a departure from tradition, chief minister Naveen Patnaik won’t unfurl the tricolour on Republic Day in Cuttack. Instead, he will be the guest of honour at a state government function in Bhubaneswar where governor Ganeshi Lal will unfurl the national flag. In Naveen’s absence, finance minister Niranjan Pujari will unfurl the tricolour in Cuttack.

The tradition of the chief minister unfurling the flag in Cuttack has been decades old. But this time the state intends to follow the Centre in hosting the Republic Day parade. Bhubaneswar will see a parade on Mahatma Gandhi Road where a total of 48 contingents will take part. This year, one of the contingents will be headed by a lady commandant.

With a day to go the celebrations, security has been beefed up across the twin cities of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar. “A total of 45 platoons of police force have been deployed in the twin cities to maintain law and order and take care of traffic movement,” police commissioner Sudhansu Sarangi said.

Represenative image

NEW DELHI: A 24-year-old man allegedly committed suicide at one of the rooms of Vivanta by Taj hotel in Lutyens’ Delhi by consuming medicines .

Family members of Karan Chandra told cops that he was suffering from depression due to discord between his parents, who had separated. A suicide note was found beside him when the hotel staffers found his body on Friday. Police said that it seemed that he had committed suicide at least two days before as the body had started decomposing.

The incident was reported on Friday, when the housekeeping staff alerted the hotel management about Chandra, who was not responding to their calls. He had taken a third floor room on rent on January 19 and was staying there since then. On January 20, he had put a ‘do not disturb’ tag on his door.

Since he had booked the hotel room for five days, the hotel authorities started enquiring about him on January 24. According to hotel officials, Chandra was a platinum member of the hotel.

“A call was received at 4.10pm on Friday, about a guest who was not responding despite repeated knocks. Foul smell was also coming out from the room, which was locked from inside. The door of the room was opened with the help of hotel staff and Chandra, a resident of Malviya Nagar, was found in a sleeping posture,” deputy commissioner of police, New Delhi, Eish Singhal said.

Cops also recovered a suicide note and some medicines from the room. In the note the Chandra had written down the lyrics of ‘In the end’, a famous song by an American rock band Linkin Park. The note read ‘In the end, it doesn’t even matter’.

“A crime team inspected the room. The body bore no injury marks and was handed over to family members after post-mortem,” added Singhal.

397,['25/01/2020'],"Onion price rises to Rs 80/kg yet again, traders blame short supply","This story is from January 25, 2020

Kolkata: The sudden drop in supply pushed up the onion price to the Rs 80/kg level on Friday. Traders blamed the transition from new crop to the mature lot in Nashik and Bellary — country’s foremost onion producers — for the inconsitent supply, which dropped to eight-nine trucks from the usual 25 to Koley Market.

“This is quite a drastic rise. Even on Thursday, onion price remained at Rs 50-Rs 55/kg. Traders could not give us satisfactory reason behind the abrupt jump in onion price,” said Amiya Gupta, a resident of Behala, who was shocked at the inexplicable rise of onion price.

The spike, market experts said, was temporary and supply would normalise the moment harvesting of mature crop was complete. So far, city markets have received new onion crop, which is highly perishable. The mature crop, which is being harvested now, is less perishable and can be stored for some time. Thus, the mature crop is to stabilise the market.

However, wholesalers alleged that selling onion at Rs 80/kg is unfair. The wholesale onion price on Friday stood at Rs 2,000-Rs 2,200/40kg bag, which translates to Rs 50-Rs 55/kg. “Even if a retailer sells them at Rs 60-Rs 65/kg, there will be a handsome profit,” said Kamal De, president of the West Bengal Vegetable Vendors’ Association and member of the chief minister’s task force on market prices. “But retailers have developed the habit of selling a small amount, keeping a higher margin of profit,” he added.

Significantly, onion price skyrocketed to Rs 150/kg last month. Since then, onion price had gradually dropped to Rs 50/kg.

Meanwhile, after a gap of two weeks, the agri-marketing department has planned to resume sale of onion once again through the network of nearly 1,000 ration shops. This time, onion will be sold at Rs 44/kg. “We hope that the price will come down soon. Moreover, our enforcement wing will be visiting the markets to see whether there is any malpractice,” said an agri-marketing department officer.

According to department sources, there is no dearth of onion in stock. The government is keeping a close watch on the stock and supply and wants the price to stabilise so that ups and downs of onion price do not hit the consumers card.

403,['25/01/2020'],Kerala governor to summon all files on anti-CAA suit,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With the government making no move to withdraw the suit from the Supreme Court over the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) even after governor Arif Mohammad Khan taking serious exception to the government’s decision citing the rules of business, the governor is learnt to have decided to pursue the matter legally.

It is reliably learnt that the governor would soon summon all files that were originated and circulated in the government departments concerned for deciding to approach the Supreme Court against the Citizenship Amendment Act. The suit filed by the state government in SC a few days ago was given number by the SC registry on Friday.

Governor Khan has taken a strong exception to the government’s move as he was kept out of the loop, against the norms set in rules of business.

As per the rule 36 (a) of the rules of business, the chief minister shall “cause to be furnished to the governor such papers, records or information relating to the administration of affairs of the state and proposals for legislation as the governor may call for”. This would mean that the government is bound to submit the files before the governor if he asks for it, and 36 (b) says that, “if the governor so requires, submit for the consideration of the council any matter on which a decision has been taken by a minister but which has not been considered by the council”.

According to the rule 34 (4), cases which affect the relations of the state government with the government of India, any other state government, the Supreme Court or the high court, should be submitted by the chief minister to the governor prior to making a move. The governor had repeatedly quoted this clause to prove that the government’s move was not legal.

The government had deputed chief secretary Tom Jose to give an explanation before the governor regarding the matter that it was done to allay the concerns of the people of the state, but the governor had refused to buy the argument. He had clearly said that he will consider the matter to be closed only if the illegal action is reversed.

It is no reliably learnt that the governor has taken up the matter seriously and has decided to explore the possible legal actions in the matter. In his last visit to New Delhi, the governor had met legal and Constitutional experts and discussed the further course of action with them, sources said.

404,['25/01/2020'],"After NGT rap, Centre asks UP to take ‘necessary step’ towards notifying Hastinapur a sanctuary","This story is from January 25, 2020

Meerut: Over a month after National Green Tribunal (NGT) issued contempt notices to the Centre and to the UP government for not notifying Hastinapur wildlife area as a protected sanctuary despite its order, the Union ministry has asked the state to take “necessary steps” as directed by the green body.

Union ministry of environment and forest (MoEF), in a letter to the state government, has now “requested” it to “take necessary action as per NGT and also update the ministry about the same.” The letter, accessed by the TOI, was issued by Rakesh Kumar Jagenia, DIG, Wildlife, MoEF. It has been addressed to UP’s principal secretary (Forest) and to state’s chief wildlife warden.

The letter also encloses the copies of NGT's May 2019 order as well as contempt-cum-execution notice issued on December 18, 2019 for non-implementation of its earlier order in which the Tribunal had given six months to respondents to notify Hastinapur under Wildlife Protection Act.

The Hastinapur wildlife area is commonly referred to as a sanctuary. But, with the lack of proper government notification on it, the area does not enjoy the protection needed to check poaching and various other threats to the wildlife. Human habitation and construction activities are not allowed in the protected area. If implemented, the move will weed out several industrial zones, luxury resorts and even Bijnor DM’s official bungalow posing threat to flora and fauna of the UP’s largest forest region.

In 1986, the government had issued a primary notification declaring Hastinapur forest area a sanctuary. However, no final government order notifying the 2,073 square-km area a protected zone has come from the government since then.

Irked over it, the NGT had last year asked the forest department to explain to it the reason behind over 30 years of delay in proclaiming Hastinapur wildlife area as a protected sanctuary. It gave six months to follow the order. Then, on December 18 last year, the NGT issued contempt notices to Union Ministry of Environment and Forest, UP government and others over non-implementation of its earlier order.

The Tribunal was responding to a plea filed by Centre for Wildlife and Environmental Litigation (CWEL) through its secretary Bhanu Bansal.

According to Bansal, “On May 31, NGT had directed the MoEF and to the UP government to issue notification under Wildlife Protection Act within six months. It was meant to protect and conserve biological diversity, environment and wildlife of the area.

“However, even after the expiry of six months, situation on ground remained the same. Then the Tribunal issued contempt-cum-execution notice to Union ministry, UP government and others for non-implementation of its earlier order,"" he said.

The Hastinapur wildlife area is commonly referred to as a sanctuary and is spread around five districts-- Bijnor, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Amroha and Hapur. But, due to lack of proper government notification on it, the area does not enjoy the protection needed to check poaching and various other threats to the wildlife.

The petitioner had 15 respondents in the case, including MoEF, UP government, National Board of Wildlife, National Biodiversity Authority, Forest Conservator UP, DFOs of districts within which sanctuary falls, etc.

File photo of lawyers on strike in Sambalpur

SAMBALPUR: The Odisha State Bar Council’s (OSBC)s recommendation to the Bar Council of India (BCI) advocating disciplinary action against office bearers of 17 bar associations of western Odisha has brought agitating lawyers from the region closer.

The Balangir bar association and the central action committee (CAC), comprising the bars of several western Odisha districts, have decided to bury their differences over the place where the place where the high court bench should come up.

For years, Balangir bar association has been pressing for a high court bench in the district even as others questioned the rigidity.

This led to differences between the two groups of lawyers. But Thursday’s Balangir meeting, which was attended by 23 bar associations across western Odisha, signalled a thaw in the rivalry.

“It is a fight for the right of lawyers. The direction of the Supreme Court is beyond its administrative jurisdiction. We are united to fight against the injustice against the lawyers of western Odisha,” said Pradeep Bohidar, chairperson of the action committee of Sambalpur bar association.

The demand for the establishment of a high court bench in western Odisha dates back to more than five decades. However, the lawyers in the region were making the demands separately. But in 2006, as many as 37 bar associations of western Odisha, including that of Sambalpur and Balangir, organised a meeting in Bargarh and the central action committee of all Western Odisha Bar Associations was formed.

The lawyers continued the agitation under the leadership of the CAC demanding the establishment of the high court bench anywhere in western Odisha. In 2007, the lawyers gheraoed the assembly over their demand. Subsequently, chief minister Naveen Patnaik called on a delegation of CAC and later recommended the establishment of HC benches in Berhampur and Sambalpur.

But the choice of Sambalpur did not go down well with Balangir bar association and it parted ways from the CACthe same year. Since then the Balangir bar association has been pressing for the establishment of the HC bench in the district separately.

But the OSBC move has changed the entire dynamics brought rival groups together after more than a decade.

406,['25/01/2020'],NHAI to start piling work for flyover,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: When the national highway authority of India (NHAI) gave letter of appointment to contractor Rameshwar Dayal & Son-Cherian Varkey Construction Company ( RDS-CVCC ) in April 6, 2019, it was bound to hand over encumbrance-free land within three months for the construction of Kazhakoottam flyover . However, so far the NHAI was not been able to fulfil their promise.

Now, as the district administration has agreed to divert traffic in 400m-stretch in the 1.12km Kazhakoottam junction to CSI mission hospital side, the contractor will be able to start piling work.

The district administration has given sanction for traffic diversion on the stretch from February 1 to March 30. The vehicles to Kollam side will be diverted through the market road during this time. This will enable the contractor to start the work on the stretch. NHAI has sought 6 months to complete construction of around 7-8 piers in the portion.

Though NHAI had approach the police and district administration for a traffic diversion in the entire 1.12km stretch for the flyover construction, permission was not granted. The authorities cited lack of service roads as a major reason to deny traffic diversion.

Meanwhile, the local traders have approached the high court and secured an interim stay demanding compensation for displacement. They argued that not just land owners, the traders who will be displaced too are eligible for compensation under the land acquisition act. Sources in NHAI said that they were ready to provide compensation if there is a 100% displacement. “However, only a portion of the builings are razed for widening. The shops can function in the remaining portion of the buildings,” sources said.

The deadline for completion of Kazhakoottam flyover is April 2021. With NHAI losing several months due to delay in land acquisition, there are concerns of timely completion of the project.

The work of the flyover on the Kazhakoottam-Technopark side is on track as NHAI has begun placing girders. Traffic in this portion is diverted through the service road.

The 2.71km Kazhakoottam flyover is a standalone project and is not part of the Kazhakoottam-Karode national highway widening. Union minister for road transport and highway Nitin Gadkari had approved the flyover during the inauguration of Kazhakoottam-Mukkola NH widening work. The flyover was suggested to bypass the traffic congestion in Kazhakoottam and Technopark area.

Nagpur: With searches carried out in different parts of the country, the directorate general of GST intelligence (DGGSTI) has unearthed cases of fake invoices worth over Rs 10,000 crore in the current fiscal.

The main purpose of the DGGSTI raids was to probe fraudulent claims of input tax credit (ITC), leading to GST evasion. However, tax sleuths have also found that in 35% of the cases, fakes invoices were issued to fudge up the turnover with no GST evasion. This has helped many firms to avail bank loans for which they may not have been eligible in the normal course given their actual financials.

In a sizeable number of invoices, no ITC was availed through the fake invoices but it either led to avoiding income tax on the basis of recording fraudulent purchases in the books or at the other end it helped in bloating the turnover. Fakes invoices were used as a mode to route unaccounted funds too.

The DGGSTI is now taking up the job to sensitize the income tax department and even banks about such cases. There have been cases where firms with poor financials have been able to get huge loans on the basis of fake entries and have later turned NPAs, said A K Pandey, special secretary to the ministry of finance and member of Central Board of Indirect Tax and Customs (CBIC). He was in the city for an official visit.

He said a system of directly issuing invoices through the GST-network (GSTN) is being worked out too. There are chances that it may be implemented in a few months as the fine tuning of the plan is under way.

With this, the sale and purchase invoices of a business having a turnover above a certain limit may have to be directly generated through the system. This will ensure easier matching of the purchases and sales of the opposite parties, he said.

Huge mismatches have also been found in the GST liability calculated by an assessee in the GSTR1 returns and the amount paid through the GSTR3B format.

GSTR 1 is a record of sales and GSTR3B is a summary return on the basis of which a final liability is discharged. At times, low sales, compared to that mentioned in GSTR1, is shown in GSTR3B by the same assessee.

Cases of mismatch over Rs 40 crore may be handed over to the DGGSTI which is a specialized investigation wing whose officers have all India jurisdiction. The rest of the cases will be taken up by the respective commissionerates, he said.

Hard work: Night classes being held at a school in Karkala taluk

Mangaluru: Eight schools in Karkala taluk of Udupi district, including four government schools, have introduced night classes to help slow learners appearing for SSLC exams this academic year. The three-hour classes are held between 6pm and 9pm.

Speaking to TOI, Karkala Block Education Officer (BEO) G S Shashidhar said that classes are being conducted in four government, three aided and an unaided school in the taluk. The School Development and Monitoring Committee (SDMC), local organisations and associations have extended support to this programme.

“Parents have to give their consent in writing before sending their children for night classes and have to take the responsibility to pick and drop them to and from school. The programme will focus on slow learners who are also taught basic relaxation techniques and how to attain pass marks. Children who are unable to study at home too can join in. At the open-air theatre of Uppala Higher Primary School, students from five nearby schools attend night classes,” Shashidhar explained.

Venkataramana Kalkura, SSLC nodal officer, has inspired many schools to launch similar projects. At this venue, three girls from Karnataka Public School, Muniyalu, too, attend classes. Uppala Friends Cricketers are sponsoring snacks for students every day, he added.

No classes in interior areas

Narayana Shenoy, maths teacher and president of Karkala Taluk High School Assistant Teachers Association, has been motivating and encouraging teachers. “About 20 students attend these classes in each school and SDMC members including presidents, or local body members and officials from the education department visit schools regularly,” said BEO Shashidhar who has come forward to sponsor a week’s snacks at a school.

However, night classes depend on the local conditions. They are not held in interior areas which is surrounded by forests. Parents and students of Hermunde and Kervashe had requested for night classes, but due to the presence of wild animals in the area, they had to turn down the request. Schools in the town area conduct classes between 7and 10pm. This programme is part of Mission 100 Karkala, aimed at securing 100 per cent results in the SSLC exams.

PANAJI: Barely a month after recommencing production, Zuari Agro Chemicals Ltd (ZACL) has shut down its NPK plant due to lack of ammonia and phosphoric acid, said company officials.

Officials said that both the NPK plants of ZACL are shut, though the urea fertilizer plant remains operational.

Zuari Agro Chemicals Ltd restarted one of its NPK plants at Zuarinagar in December last year, and resumed production of fertilizers after the Centre’s department of fertilizers released subsidy amounts.

“Zuari Agro Chemicals Ltd has announced that the NPK - a plant of the company has been shut down due to non-availability of raw material,” the company said in an official statement.

ZACL’s NPK plants need ammonia and phosphoric acid to prepare NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) fertilizers. The fertilizers are used to increase crop productivity.

The company stopped operations of its urea and ammonia plant on July 4 last year after a leakage was reported in the ammonia plant. Later the NPK-B plant was shut down from April 27 except for a five-day period in September, due to lack of funds to purchase raw material and natural gas.

ZACL was forced to shut down its plants in 2019 because of non-availability of natural gas, owing to non-payment of dues to Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL). Delay in release of subsidies from the department of fertilizers (DoF) in earlier quarters led to a shortage of funds with the fertilizer manufacturer, which in turn led to delay in payments to suppliers.

412,['25/01/2020'],"Odisha: To facilitate industries, government speeds up land acquisition","This story is from January 25, 2020

Representative image

BHUBANESWAR: The state government has fast-tracked land acquisition for major industrial and infrastructure projects. In the past one month, it has initiated the process of acquiring land for two mega projects.

While the government has assigned Odisha Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (Idco) to acquire around 3,320 acres for a petrochemicals complex to be set up by Haldia Petrochemicals Limited in Balasore, it gave the nod to Bhadrak district administration to acquire 274 acres for a commercial airstrip by Dhamra Port Company Limited in Dhamra. It would be the first airstrip in north Odisha, sources said.

Land hurdle was one of the reasons for the delay in implementation of the 25-year-old Khurda Road-Balangir railway line. But now this has been expedited with continuous follow-up by authorities from the state and Centre. Also, land acquisition for the heritage corridor project around the Jagannath Temple in Puri was completed in a record four months.

“Some of the recent policy decisions like land bank scheme and pro-activeness at the top level of administration are some of the reason as to why land acquisition is on fast-track. Besides expediting the acquisition process, the state government should also ensure expeditious registration of land in favour of the industrial house. The registration process is quite slow in Odisha,” opined Ramesh Mohapatra, president of Utkal Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

Posco and ArcelorMittal had earlier pulled out of their Odisha projects attributing inordinate delay in land acquisition. To overcome such hurdles, Idco has come up with the land bank scheme to create a ready-to-use land of around 1.3 lakh acres for industrial purpose. Of this, around 70,000 acres have already been brought under Idco’s possession. Land acquired for South Korean steel giant Posco was brought under the land bank after the company pulled out of the project.

“As the acquired land was kept under the land bank, the state government managed to allocate around 2,900 acres to JSW Steel for an integrated steel project. The land transfer process is at an advanced stage. The public hearing process has passed off peacefully for the JSW project,” said a senior industries department official.

“The idea behind land bank is to provide ready-to-use land to investors. Because of land bank, investors, especially small and medium industries, are getting land without much hassle. They can acquire land by completing the formalities and paying the premium,” industries minister Dibya Shankar Mishra said.

Land bank scheme apart, the state government has been creating sector-specific clusters like Infovalley near Bhubaneswar, food processing park in Khurda, Deras sea food park in Khurda, petroleum chemicals and petrochemicals investment region (PCPIR) in Paradip, national investment manufacturing zone (NIMZ) in Kalingnagar and an aluminium park in Angul to facilitate downstream industries.

413,['25/01/2020'],SSKM steps in after row over transgender patient,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Kolkata: A 27-year-old transgender, who is undergoing treatment at the state-run SSKM Hospital, had to be shifted to a cabin from the general ward for woman after patients raised objections. The humiliation faced by Sankari Mondal (name changed to protect her identity) has raised concern among activists, who felt it’s time hospitals had a separate ward for transgender patients.

Born an intersex variation (genitals of both sex), the primary schoolteacher from Maheshtala was admitted to the hospital on Thursday for a sex reassignment surgery, which would transform her to a woman. Since Mondal, a graduate, is referred as a ‘female’ in all her official documents, she was initially admitted to the endocrinology department’s female ward, where she would undergo a series of hormonal test before the surgery.

“On Friday morning, I found some cash missing from my wallet. When I brought the matter to the notice of nursing staff and the ayahs in the ward, they, along with other patients, started misbehaving with me,” narrated the patient. Some patients later complained to the hospital authority saying they were feeling unsafe with a ‘male’ staying in their ward. Hospital officials then reportedly told her to take a discharge and come back when a cabin is arranged for her.

“I felt let down by the system. But I put my foot down and got in touch with Ranjita Sinha, who is a member of the West Bengal Transgender Board,” Sankari told TOI.

Sinha then approached cops from the Bhowanipore police station and urged them to take necessary action so that the patient was not denied her right to medical care.

“Each time someone from the transgender community needs hospitalisation, this issue crops up. I wish the women and child department under which the transgender board functions raise awareness in hospitals. Government hospitals in many states already have a separate ward for people from the community. Why can’t we have the same here?” asked Sinha.

Officials at the hospital said they had to walk a tight rope, keeping in mind the ‘inconvenience’ other patients were facing. Finally, Mondal was shifted to a cabin in the cardiology department after MSVP Raghunath Misra’s intervention.

PANAJI: The 15th Finance Commission has asked Goa to collate data on foreign tourist arrivals, including the time spent by them in the state, chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Friday.

The suggestion was made after the state government asked it for funds to improve Goa’s tourism infrastructure.

“The commission chairman has asked us to collate data on how many foreign tourists come to Goa and to see how many days they spend in Goa,” Sawant said.

“Once we prepare the data, it will be useful when we ask for funds for tourism infrastructure.”

While trying to convince the commission of the need for funds for the state’s tourism sector, Goa government officials pointed out that foreign tourists contribute to the country’s foreign exchange earnings.

“I have already asked the tourism secretary to prepare the data for the same. In comparison with other parts of the country, (foreigners) definitely spend more time in Goa. We have not used our natural resources for tourism. There is scope for hinterland tourism,” the chief minister said.

PANAJI: A team of doctors from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) visited the crime scene where Finnish national Felix Dahl , 22, was found dead in Canacona on January 28, 2015 before giving its second opinion on postmortem report to the central bureau of investigation (CBI).

The probe agency had sought the second opinion from the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, AIIMS on the postmortem.

The 3-member team came to Goa on Tuesday and visited the spot on Wednesday.

CBI had provided relevant documents, including photos, of the case to the AIIMS doctors . “Doctors have assured to give their second opinion within two months,” sources said.

The first postmortem was conducted at Hospicio hospital at Margao . Last year, the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), Delhi had reconstructed the crime scene. CFSL will soon submit its report to the CBI, stating whether Dahl’s death was a homicide, a murder or an accident. “We are waiting for the report,” sources said.

The CBI investigation had revealed that Dahl was assaulted and it resulted into his death. To reconfirm their investigation, CBI had asked CFSL to reconstruct the crime scene.

In July 2018, the high court had transferred the case to the CBI in the ‘interest of justice’, while castigating Goa police for its failure to examine the case in a fair and impartial manner.

The deceased’s mother Minna Pirhonen had filed a petition seeking transfer of the case to central probe agency doubting the findings of the Canacona police

Image used for representational purpose only

KOCHI: No school that requires recognition from the state government under Right to Education (RTE) Act has the right to impart religious instruction of one religion alone, the high court has held. The court also said the government’s approval is required even for teaching religious pluralism.

Justice A Muhamed Mustaque gave the ruling on a plea by Hidaya Educational and Charitable Trust of Thiruvananthapuram challenging government’s decision to close down the school as it promotes exclusive religious instruction.

In the judgment, the court said, “Exclusivism or preference of one religion over others by State or public functionaries or private bodies, while discharging public functions, strikes at the very root of the fundamental values of our Constitution , namely, secularism. It negates neutrality, promotes discrimination and denies equal treatment. Private schools which are required to have recognition from State must not promote one religion over others. The exclusive promotion of a particular religion by private educational institutions defies the secular character of the Constitution...”

Differentiating between the right of a person or a group and that of a group discharging public function, the judgment said, “An individual or a group or a denomination have the freedom to express and to promote and practice their religion. That freedom is not available to a private body while discharging a public function. In a pluralist society like India, which accepts secularism as the basic norm in governing secular activities including education, there cannot be any difficulty in imparting religious instruction or study based on religious pluralism. What is prohibited is exclusivism.”

Rights of minorities under the Constitution do not allow them to dilute the secular nature of education, the court said. Pointing out that RTE Act mandates that the curriculum and evaluation procedure should be as laid down by the state government, the court said, “In such circumstances, no school which is required to have recognition shall impart any religious instruction or religious study without permission from the State Government.”

421,['25/01/2020'],"Compensation, no charges likely for Smart City PAPs","This story is from January 25, 2020

Nagpur: Hundreds of project-affected-persons (PAPs) of Smart City Project are likely to get compensation for the entire or part of the land proposed to be acquired for the project. Also, they are likely to get exemption from paying high Town Planning Scheme (TPS) charges. But the move is likely to hamper the project if the compensation is not paid by the state or central government.

Supriya Thul, the state government appointed arbitrator, has recently completed hearing the PAPs of Smart City Project. After the 10-month-long process, the arbitrator has tabled findings and recommendations before the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) for finalizing TPS. This will form the basis for development of the Smart City Project in Pardi , Punapur , Bharatwada and Bhandewadi in East Nagpur.

In the draft TPS prepared in 2018, Smart City Project special purpose vehicle Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) had approved flats to compensate for houses to be acquired completely for roads. NSSCDCL proposed to take over 40% of total plot area of over 30% land owners. Also, NSSCDCL proposed to recover regularization charges of Rs56 per sq ft from unauthorized plots and buildings. The SPV also proposed to levy hefty TPS charges on all plot owners, including those giving 40% of total plot area. Apart from all these, NSSCDCL proposed to recover charges for giving additional floor space index (FSI) and other benefits to plot owners.

NSSCDCL’s move created havoc among PAPs, and politicians, including BJP MLA from East Nagpur Krishna Khopde, corporators and activists of Congress and Sena registered their strong opposition.

Thul’s recommendations stress the need to give compensation to land owners for acquiring 40% of their total plot area as per Land Acquisition Act 2013. Also, the arbitrator recommended not to recover TPS charges from plots with construction, since they will not get any additional benefits from the project as their plots already have constructions. The arbitrator also felt no need to recover regularization charges from plots regularized by Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) earlier. Also, the arbitrator recommended no reservation on regularized plots.

Now, NMC general body will take a decision on arbitrator’s recommendations and submit it to the state government for final approval of TPS. If the general body approves arbitrator’s recommendations as it is, the opposition to the project is likely to end.

BJP city president and corporator Pravin Datke told TOI all PAPs will get proper compensation. “Also, hefty TPS charges will not be recovered from people residing in Smart City Project area. People are in favour of the project and only need is to resolve their problems. It is a good project and will be implemented successfully. After consulting Khopde and our other leaders, necessary decisions will be taken in general body next month,” he said.

But the project will be left hanging unless and until state or central government provide the additional funds required to implement Thul’s formula. Covering an area of 1,730 acre, estimated cost of the project is Rs3,303 crore. NSSCDCL will get only Rs876 crore from centre, state and NIT. NSSCDCL had expected remaining cost of Rs2,427 crore from land to be acquired from PAPs free of cost, TPS charges, regularization fees and FSI benefits.

Now, the state or centre will have to provide Rs2,427 crore as NMC cannot bear it due to its cash-strapped condition. In case of any setback from state and centre, the project will not happen at all.

Datke said NMC office bearers under their leaders Union minister Nitin Gadkari and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis will ensure funds from the government.

Kolhapur: Four centres in the city will provide Shivbhojan Thali at Rs 10 per plate from January 26. The centres will be inaugurated by district guardian minister Satej Patil.

The district administration had received 30 proposals for providing Shivbhojan Thali, of which four have been finalised. The centre operator has been asked to ensure that they provide ample sitting area to accommodate 150 people and at the same time ensure quality food.

A team from the food and drugs administration (FDA) will conduct random inspections at these four centres to assess the quality of raw materials, dishes prepared, sanitation and other cleanliness measures.

District collector Daulat Desai said, “All the arrangements are in place. The food will be served between 12pm to 2 pm. We have provided aequate training to the staff at these centres.”

Kolhapur: Minister of state for home Satej Patil on Friday said if Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray has inputs regarding conspiracy being hatched against the country then he should provide those inputs to director general of police for speedy action.

Raj is going to hold a rally at Mumbai in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) on February 9. While speaking to party cadres in Mumbai on Thursday, Raj alleged that he has some information that in some of the mohallas (Muslim-dominated localities) conspiracy is being hatched against India.

“I am not going to provide the entire inputs I am having. I just say that in some mohallas serious conspiracy is going on. I will meet home minister Amit Shah and chief minister to take action against them,” Raj had said.

Responding to the allegation made by the MNS chief, Patil said, “We receive such inputs several times. If Raj is having some inputs he should share it with the director general of police so that precautionary measures can be taken and swift action is initiated. As per his conspiracy allegations, I think it was part of his political speech. He has changed his views after Lok Sabha and state elections. I won’t talk on this but, if there is any input let him share it with police.”

Raj in his speech had said that there are many areas in the state capital where police cannot enter. He also added that a large number of Muslim infiltrators have entered the big cities and they need to be thrown out of the country.

NEW DELHI: Cold winds swept through the city on Friday with the minimum temperature settling at 8.2 degrees Celsius — one notch above the normal — while the maximum touched 21.1 degrees, normal for this time of the season. The wind, however, improved the air quality in the city. At 151, the AQI on Friday was in the moderate category, a major improvement from Thursday’s 211 in the ‘poor’ zone.

Track the pollution level in your city

“Wind speed as fast as 20-22km/hour was witnessed during the day along with spells of gusty wind up to 35-36km/hour. There was mist in the morning and visibility was up to1,300m,” a MeT official said.

Saturday is likely to see mainly clear sky with moderate fog in the morning. The maximum and minimum temperatures will be around 20 and 6 degrees Celsius, respectively, while the wind speed will decrease significantly to below 10km/hour, the official added. On Sunday, moderate fog is expected in the early hours, while a few pockets may also see dense fog from 5.30 to 9.30am, he said.

CPCB’s central control room data showed Delhi NCR’s average PM2.5 level to be 65.7 micrograms per cubic metre at 7pm on Friday. The average PM10 level at the same time was marginally above the safe standards at 136.6 micrograms. The ‘emergency’ benchmark for these pollutants under GRAP is, respectively, 300 and 500 micrograms per cubic metre while the safe standards are 60 and 100 micrograms per cubic metre.

According to a SAFAR report, high surface winds are likely to continue for the next 24 hours, following which it will dip to moderate levels. “The high ventilation helped flush out the pollutants and improve the AQI. However, marginal deterioration in AQI is likely by Saturday night, but it will remain in the ‘moderate’ category. The AQI is likely to deteriorate to ‘poor’ category by Sunday,” it added.

An AQI between 0-50 is considered ‘good’, 51-100 ‘satisfactory’, 101-200 ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is classified as ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is classified as ‘very poor’ and between 401 and 500 is ‘severe’ on CPCB’s index.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Members of an alleged land mafia used an earthmover to kill Kattakkada resident Sangeeth (37) after an altercation early on Friday morning. Kattakkada police took Vijin (29) from Kulathummel into custody in connection with the case.

Police said that a probe had begun to track down the remaining four members of the gang that attempted to mine and smuggle the red earth from Sangeeth’s home at Kanchiravila early on Friday. Sangeeth, a non-resident Indian who recently settled in Kattakkada, had started a poultry farm near his home.

Neighbours, who rushed to the spot, on hearing the altercation saw Sangeeth lying on the ground, struggling to breathe. Though they rushed him to a nearby hospital, he died. His relatives alleged that Kattakkada police did not arrive on time though Sangeeth had informed them about the unauthorized entry by the gang on his property.

Kattakada station house officer inspector Bijukumar D said the accused had previously worked as contract workers of forest department and Sangeeth had made an agreement that allowed mining of red earth from his property.

“The contract expired long ago but as the accused men knew the source of red earth, they arrived with a JCB late on Thursday night and attempted to mine earth. Sangeeth was not at home when they came. Soon, his wife informed him about the unauthorized entry by the gang. He reached there and confronted the gang. As Sangeeth tried to block the earthmover, he was hit by the front part of the vehicle. He sustained injuries on his head and chest that proved fatal,” said Bijukumar.

Police took Vijin into custody as they suspect that he was the one who operated the earthmover.

Tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran told reporters that the government will take up the case seriously.

“It is very unfortunate that a landowner who questioned unauthorized entry on his land was murdered in such a brutal way. Stringent action will be taken against the mafia groups who engage in such heinous activities. It is high time that such groups were brought under control,” he said.

Kattakkada MLA I B Sathish also sought an inquiry to know if the police were vigilant and tried to reach the spot quickly.

Sangeeth’s body, kept at the medical college hospital mortuary after autopsy, will be handed over to relatives on Saturday.

The cremation is scheduled on Saturday as Sangeeth’s mother and sister who are settled in the Gulf are on their way home. Sangeeth leaves behind his wife Sangeetha, son Sreehari and daughter Sangeerthana.

Vellore: A bull of a farmer that took part in a bull race held at Kothakottai near Vaniyambadi in Tirupattur district died after falling into a 60-ft-deep farm well on Wednesday.

On the occasion of the recent pongal festival, bull race in which native breeds took part was conducted in various parts of the integrated Vellore district, including Vellore, Tirupattur and Ranipet districts.

On Wednesday, a bull race was organised at fives places, including in Nimmiyampattu, Kothakottai and Kothur in Tirupattur district, Melmaayil near Gudiyattam and Ariyoor in Vellore district.

A senior police officer said that at the bull race held at Kothakottai, as many as 178 bulls took part.

R Raman, 25, of Chinnapallikuppam in Ambur brought his bull to the race. The animal which was let loose in the arena, on seeing the crowd became terrified and could not be stopped at the finish line by the owner.

The panicked bull entered a farm land located about 500 metres away from the finish line and accidentally fell into the well belonging to Chinnasamy, a farmer of Kothakottai. The incident happened around 11am.

On information, a team of fire tenders from the Vaniyambadi fire station reached the spot and began the rescue operation, along with police personnel.

The rescue team tied a rope around the body of the bull and lifted it out of the well.

Police sources said the bull had sustained severe injuries in the fall and died. Vaniyambadi deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Balakrishnan and Vaniyambadi taluk inspector Mangayarkarasi reached the spot and held an inquiry.

Following the incident, bull owners and bull race enthusiasts urged the district administration and event organizers to ensure the safety of the animals to avert further tragedies.

Vijayaraj, 48, a bull race enthusiast, said that bull race was being conducted in villages near Vellore and Tirupattur districts for more than a century.

“When there was a ban on holding bull race by the state government, we were among those who participated in a protest against it. Though we are happy that the government has been providing permission to conduct the bull race without creating much hassles to the organizers, they should form a team to ensure the safety of the bulls participating in the race and to spectators,” he said.

Kolhapur: The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited ( MSEDCL ) has terminated power supply to five industrial units in Ichalkaranji and surrounding areas following the directives of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB).

MPCB officials said that the decision was taken after these units failed to comply with the MPCB’s industrial sewage treatment norms, resulting in pollution of the Panchganga river.

Sachin Akiwate, deputy executive engineer, Ichalkaranji rural unit of the MSEDCL, told TOI that these type of actions are regularly taken every year.

“When these industrial units discharge untreated water into the river, it causes pollution affecting water bodies and fishes in it. There have been several instances when one could see dead fishes floating on water or a pile near the river bank. These units are issued frequent notices and, despite that, when they fail to comply, terminating their power supply is the only option,” he said.

He added that such industrial units, especially textiles, have to take clearance from the MPCB with all the required compliance. Once the MPCB gives nod, power supply can be restored.

Akiwate said that such actions have been initiated in the past as well.

According to district administration officials, collector Daulat Desai had visited river bank villages in the Hatkanagale and Shirol taluka last week and had instructed MPCB officials to initiate action against errant industrial units. MPCB officials conducted a survey of a few industrial unitsin the said areas and observed that some units failed to comply with the sewage treatment compliance.

Ichalkaranji has been a major textile hub in the country and sends ready cloth to Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, West Bengal, and Karnataka.

The industries here engage in looms, yarning, sizing as well as processing. Since the first textile unit was set up in Ichalkaranji in 1904, the town has thrived on the booming cotton trade that caters to the needs of major national and international brands.

437,['25/01/2020'],"On 27 routes, Aapli Bus earns under Rs1k per day","This story is from January 25, 2020

Nagpur: The Aapli Bus has everything an urban commuter might need from regular interval service and five exclusive electric buses for women only and affordable fares. Yet, it does not have enough takers on 27 routes, revealed a survey carried out by Aapli Bus programme manager Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS).

“These routes generate less than Rs1,000 per day,” DIMTS report submitted to transport committee chairman Narendra Borkar stated.

Following Borkar’s directives, DIMTS recently carried out a study of crew duty-wise earning on 115 routes. During analysis of duty-wise earning on these routes, it came to fore that 27 routes earn less than Rs1,000 per day, whereas the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) spends a minimum of Rs10,000 per day per bus, Borkar told TOI.

“Even during morning and evening peak hours, it is common to find more than half the seats empty on all these routes. After the evening rush hour, the number of passengers drops to 10. At night, it is merely 5-7 commuters,” said Borkar.

The bus service between Medical Square and Lalganj-Raut Nagar generates lowest revenue of Rs60 per day. The highest revenue on this route was Rs271. The service from Sitabuldi to Ayachit Mandir via Railway Station also evoked poor response. The revenue generated on this route hovers around Rs310.

The lowest revenue-generating routes include Sitabuldi to Defence Gate number 1 and 3, Sitabuldi to CRPF, Maharajbagh to Shanti Nagar and Panchsheel Nagar to Bhagwan Nagar.

But the major reason for commuters not using the service is that most prefer using private vehicles. “The culture of using public transport is yet to develop in the city,” admitted Borkar.

Of these 27 routes, 11 are mostly used by school or college going students. “So we could not stop the service on those routes,” he said. “I have directed DIMTS to shut Aapli Bus service on other routes with poor commuter response,” he said.

At present around 1.50 lakh passengers commute in 370 Aapli Buses plying on 115 different routes. The monthly expenditure of the NMC to provide city bus services to citizens is around Rs13 crore, while it earns only Rs5 crore from it.

Official sources said the revenue loss has gone up by Rs6.5 crore per month to Rs7 crore and had incurred a loss of Rs84 crore per annum. “The NMC is incurring losses in running Aapli Bus service, but that does not mean we will stop the services,” Borkar said and added that NMC’s transport department need to be serious to curb losses and increase revenue of the Aapli Buses.

438,['25/01/2020'],Cane official’s sting unearths cane weighing fraud via remote control,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Bijnor: A sting operation conducted by officials of the state sugarcane department disguised in farmer’s clothes, has unearthed a cane weighing scam operated via remote control at the collection centre of Barkatpur sugar mill. Farmers, already bitter over delayed payment, are livid they are being cheated during the weighing.

With crushing season at full swing, thousands of tonnes of harvested crop get weighed at various authorised collection centres and move to the mills. The sting was conducted at the Narayanpur centre, where the weighing clerk used a remote control to under-calculate farmer’s produce on the weighing scale.

According to district cane officer Yashpal Singh, “The clerk would switch on the remote and the machine would underreport the weight to the tune of 100-150 kg, which means every weighing exercise would lead to a loss of Rs 325-500 for a farmer.” There have been recurring disputes at collection centres, where farmers have claimed under-weighing of their produce.

Singh continued, “Some farmers had complained about the doctored weighing machines at sugarcane purchasing centers. We conducted the sting to check the veracity of the complaints filed by the farmers.

Our team reached the Narayanpur centre on Friday morning. They parked their car around 100m away from the centre. One team member, Vikal Bharti, wearing the kurta pyjama and flip-flops that farmers usually wear, stood close to the weighing machine, acting as if he was a curious passerby. He noticed that the clerk posted at the centre would put his hand in his pocket again and again while weighing a loaded tractor trolley. Suspecting his actions, Bharti held him and asked him to reveal what he had in his pocket, but he refused. We sensed there was something amiss and rushed to unearth the secret by force, and recovered a remote control unit from his pocket. We have seized the remote and the indicator into which he had tapped clandestinely.”

Singh continued, “The clerk, Mahendra Singh, used to switch the remote on and off while weighing sugarcane, to under-report the weight of the produce. The device was activated by the remote, cheating the farmers. This centre is owned by Barkatpur sugar mill. Farmers claim the clerk was earlier cheating them at the rate of 50kg per cart. Once he got the remote system, he began underreporting by 100-150kg per cart.”

“The clerk’s license will be suspended and strict action will be taken against him. We have also asked the mill authorities for an explanation. Perhaps, this is the first case of cheating via remote control in the state,” Singh claimed.

According to sources, there are over 800 purchasing centers in Bijnor district linked to nine sugar mills. All centres have electronic weighing machines.

Digambar Singh, state president of BKU’s youth wing, said, “We had filed several complaints against mills and demanded a fair probe. If cane department conducts such stings, more such malpractices will surface.”

440,['25/01/2020'],"Rain, AP water have Red Hills brimming","This story is from January 25, 2020

Chennai: The city’s water managers are relieved. The level of water at the reservoir at Red Hills is 88% of its capacity, while the level at three other lakes is half the capacity. Metrowater executive director T Prabhu Shankar said the 6,064 million cubic feet (mcft) of water in the four reservoirs is enough to supply the city’s residents for the next six months without difficulty.

On Thursday, the Poondi reservoir had 1,497 mcft of water against the capacity of 3,231 mcft, Red Hills had 2,890 mcft against the capacity of 3,300 mcft, Chembarambakkam 1,605mcft against the capacity of 3,645 mcft, while Cholavaram, the smallest reservoir, had just 72 mcft against the capacity of 1,081 mcft. The current situation, Prabhu Shankar said, was a great improvement on the situation during the same period last year when the combined storage in the four reservoirs was just 1,112 mcft, mainly due to a failure of the northeast monsoon which accounts for about 60% of the city’s annual rainfall.

Water from the Krishna river in Andhra Pradesh flows from Poondi reservoir into both Red Hills and Chembarambakkam through open canals, Prabhu Shankar said, adding that the combined storage level in the reservoirs at Srisailam, Somasila and Kandaleru in Andhra Pradesh from where water is released to Tamil Nadu under Telugu Ganga agreement, is 252 thousand million cubic feet (tmcft) of water. “They [Andhra Pradesh] are releasing water regularly. Even on Wednesday, about 400 cusecs of water was realised at zero point,” he said. The Tamil Nadu government had asked for 8 tmcft from Andhra Pradesh which has, however, released only 4.25 tmcft so far, a Metrowater official said. “With reservoirs in that state having good storage levels, we hope they will release at least another 3 tmcft,” he said.

The rain last year had helped improve the groundwater table in many areas of the city where water levels are measured from shallow observatory open wells by Metrowater, said the official.

Asked if Metrowater had any plans to increase piped water supply to residents in the core city areas, the official said there was no such plan now. The next step would be to provide water connections in added areas and the work is on in full swing.

AGRA: Over 100 staffers of Aligarh Muslim University ( AMU ) have appealed to the protesting students to appear for examinations which have been rescheduled twice. The pending examinations are scheduled to start from Monday.

Initially, the examinations were scheduled after the university opened following extended winter vacations due to the December 15 violence that erupted on the campus. However, it was postponed due to continuous protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) by students who also demanded the vice-chancellor and registrar to resign from their posts as they failed to protect students on the ill-fated day.

“We the members of CWC project, CIC/GPS surveyors and non-teaching staff appeal to the students to save their future by appearing for the exams and not let vested interests damage the image of AMU,” coordinator, GIS/GPS Work of Waqf Board Properties, ‘Qaumi Waqf Board Taraqqiati Scheme’, Interdisciplinary Department of Remote Sensing and GIS Applications, Prof Shadab Khurshid said.

Representative image

MADURAI: Madras high court has ordered notice on a plea moved by the Fisheries University Teachers Association against the vice-chancellor (VC) and registrar of Tamil Nadu Dr J Jayalalithaa Fisheries University, Nagapattinam, for mismanagement in administration.

In her petition, the Tuticorin-based association’s general secretary R Jeyashakila stated that VC S Felix and registrar A Srinivasan were involved in total mismanagement of administration, student admissions, staff recruitment and financial misappropriation at the university. She stated that the main objective of establishing the university was the development of fisheries and research in fisheries sciences. The university has affiliated colleges at Tuticorin , Ponneri, Nagapattinam and Thalanayeru.

Jeyashakila said the VC started nine self-financial colleges offering 10 different degree courses within two and a half years, without the approval of the government which was mandatory under the Tamil Nadu Fisheries University Act. Under the Act, no new college imparting education in fisheries science can be established as a constituent or affiliated college of the university. She stated that by starting these self-financing colleges, the VC had diverted a huge sum of money from the university corpus fund and other government funds due to which the regular degree programmes are deprived of sufficient funds.

She further said that there were malpractices in the recruitment process as the VC and registrar had created new university officer posts. The VC had also issued 83 transfer orders in the two and a half years without following procedures. Since the VC would retire on April 21, it was necessary to initiate an inquiry against him and the registrar in this regard. She stated that she had also submitted representations to the authorities concerned, but no actions were taken so far.

Hence the petitioner moved HC Madurai bench seeking inquiry against the VC and registrar under the provisions of the Act. When the petition was heard on Friday, Justice M S Ramesh ordered notice to the VC and registrar of the university and adjourned the case to a further date for hearing.

Kolhapur: The corporators questioned the spending on the high rise tanks constructed by the KMC as the water scarcity continues to hamper the citizens of Shahupuri and Market Yard area.

The tank at both places was constructed two and three years respectively but both tanks are yet to receive any water since the construction. In the total of 12 tanks are constructed as part of the project-Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation. Some corporators in the standing committee meeting held on Friday claimed many of the water tanks do not fill.

“Till when these high rise tanks will remain empty? What is the use of these tanks? Why the water supply system not upgraded to ensure these tanks are filled and water is supplied at adequate pressure to the localities?. The citizens are suffering from inadequate supply every day,” said Puja Naiknaware, corporator from Shahupuri area

Vijay Suryawanshi, Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) corporator said, “The water supply cannot be normalised with the current situation. The systemic changes need to be carried out. For the last three years, the high rise tanks are not filled to their full capacity which leads to inadequate supply to the area.”

Responding to the issue, the water supply officials in the meeting claimed that the high rise tanks cannot be filled with the old system in place. “At present the tanks cannot be filled properly. Once the water supply through the direct pipeline project starts then only these tanks will be filled to their full capacity. Meanwhile, we have undertaken several measures such as changing the timings of the supply to ensure each locality gets adequate water,” said the official in the meeting.

Senior corporator claims fraud

Senior corporator Bhupal Shete alleged that the hours for which the heavy machinery used at the dumping site has been inflated to gain the monetary benefit. He said that while the machineries are used for six hours, the staff records 12 hours in the register for which the bills of Rs 14,000 is released for a day’s work.

Chairman Sharangdhar Deshmukh said claimed that even after the opening of the basement parking of a hospital from Rajarampuri, the visitors are not allowed to park their vehicles in the basement. He sought the photographs of the current situation and if the staff finds that the vehicles are still parked on the road, the hospital should be sealed.

Representative image

AGRA: After back-to-back robberies, Agra IG range has asked for the removal of all unauthorized roadside eateries on Yamuna expressway on Friday. However, it took 13 letters from Jaypee infratech - the private concessionaire operating the Yamuna expressway - and nine cases of robbery since 2019, to compel UP police to take action against such eateries along the 165-km-long route.

Agra IG range Satish Ganesh, who ordered SSPs of Agra, Hathras , Mathura , Aligarh and Noida to remove eateries along the expressway, said, “I have conducted extensive patrolling on the stretch and spotted all the areas which pose a security threat to commuters. I have asked local police to take appropriate action.”

According to private concessionaire, there are at least 25 roadside eateries in over 10 villages on both sides of the expressway which includes Awalkheda, Jrailiya, Barauta, Makrand, Lukhriya, Palkheda, Mirpur, Suraj, Kapur, Mirthana, Gadsauli and Aagai.

Here, truck drivers, private bus operators, private taxis and others often take a break from their journey - which is prohibited due to continuous fast movement of traffic. Importantly, sources claimed that unauthorized eateries are located at milestones ‘61.750’, ‘68.100’, ‘72.500’, ‘73’, ‘75.100’, ‘75.500’, ‘75.600’, ‘77.800’, ‘92.400’, ‘92.750’, ‘107.800’, ‘107.900’, ‘108.100’, ‘113.200’, ‘118’, ‘118.800’, ‘130.400’, ‘130.700’, ‘131.600’, ‘133.160’, ‘133.170’, ‘133.500’, ‘133.780’, ‘134.160’ and ‘134.440’.

Speaking to TOI, Major (retired) Manish Singh, in-charge coordinator of Yamuna expressway (Mathura-Agra) section, said, “The robbers, we suspect, usually select their targets in these eateries. Most of the criminal activities recorded are also near these eateries. And they access the Yamuna expressway by cutting through the barbed wire. In a majority of such cases, shocked victims prefer to drive away, instead of waiting for police help. On several occasions, we wrote letters to local police stations - Naujheel, Mannt, Baldeo, Yamunapar, Surir and Mahavan - requesting them to take action against unauthorized eateries.”

According to private concessionaire in 2019, robberies were reported at milestones ‘65’, ‘75’, ‘84.100’, ‘75.600’, ‘116.500’ and ‘102’ between February and September. A majority of the targets were buses, trucks, taxi operators, tourists and bikers.

“They first throw sharp-edged wedge on the stretch and wait for tyres of vehicles to deflate, thereby forcing the victims to come out. The armed gang then suddenly appears to rob them,” Singh added.

Robberies were reported at milestone ‘75’, Naujheel, in June and September last year. In June, a woman from Mauritius, along with her two Indian friends, heading to Agra to visit Taj Mahal were allegedly robbed at gunpoint, while in September, two trucks were robbed by a gang, who then fled in their sedan.

Notably, 12 sub-inspectors, 42 constables, a dozen of Japyee Infratech security personnel are posted on the stretch between Noida and Agra. They patrol in vehicles around the clock.

But, do you know the exact reason why Republic Day is celebrated on January 26 and not any other day?Here is a little history behind the same...January 26 was chosen for a specific reason as it was a significant event in India's struggle to gain freedom from British rule. On January 26, 1930, Congress passed the Poorna Swaraj resolution or the Declaration of Independence.Though India gained freedom from the British rule after a long struggle on August 15, 1947. Sadly, as valued as this freedom was, it did not come along with democracy or gave people the right to choose their own elected Government. Since India didn't have an official Constitution then, our country was a constitutional monarchy under the rule of King George VI even after Independence. It was finally after two and half years later on January 26, 1950, when the Indian Constitution came into effect thus making India one of the biggest democracies in the world. It was on this day when India was declared as a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic.The committee worked tirelessly for many months and submitted their first draft of the Constitution on November 4, 1947, to the Constituent Assembly. It took exactly 2 years, 11 months and 18 days to finally adopt the Constitution with the necessary amendments.When the Constitution of India was adopted on 26th November 1949, many considered it necessary to celebrate the document on a day associated with national pride. Poorna Swaraj Day was considered to be the best available option and henceforth, came into being celebrated as Republic Day.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73583031,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-95019/73583031.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/events/happy-republic-day-2020-do-you-know-why-republic-day-is-celebrated-on-january-26/articleshow/73583031.cms

Nagpur: If you see the map of the world, especially from the perspective of India, the longest border India shares with any neighbouring country is that of Tibet. India and Tibet have a very important and significant relationship, said Prof Anand Kumar. He was speaking at a lecture organized at Lohiya Adhyayan Kendra on ‘Tibet Mukti Andolan’ on Thursday evening.

He said, “Tibet today is a very important centre for Buddhism. The introduction of Buddhism in Tibet was done by Indians only.”

Kumar, who is a popular sociologist in Delhi, then stated, “It is commonly known that a Tibetan king had once sent some people to the famous university of Nalanda to develop a Tibetan language and a script. That language is still spoken in Tibet today as its official language.”

Kumar then pointed out that there are three main aspects which tie India to Tibet. “The first aspect is that of culture and religion. The second relation is of security. Tibet is a gate to India for the world. So there is a lot of army deployment in that region.”

“The third relation pertains to use of natural resources,” said Kumar. “Many rivers emerge from Tibet which supply water to the country. Since China has occupied Tibet, they have exploited the region very selfishly which has resulted in melting glaciers and reduction in water level.”

According to Kumar, Tibet is the heart of the Himalayas. “It is the home of Dalai Lama and an important centre for Mahayana Buddhism. This particular sect of Buddhism is spread to Ladakh, Sikkim, Bhutan and as far as Mongolia from Tibet making it an important cultural region.”

Speaking about China’s colonization of Tibet, Kumar said, “In Tibet, today children are being forced to learn Chinese in schools along with Marxist and Communist ideologies. Dalai Lama wants Tibet to be a free country but does not want to become enemies with China. The Dalai Lama wants Tibet to be a zone of peace nestled in the Himalayas.”

He stated that it is very unfortunate that when colonization in the world was ending and countries were rebelling against the tyranny of colonisers like France, England, Portugal etc, China’s colonization of Tibet was just beginning.

449,['25/01/2020'],Kalapani: Nepal pushes for talks for third time,"This story is from January 25, 2020

NEW DELHI: Nepal continues to apply pressure on India for talks on the Kalapani territorial dispute which flared up last year after India’s new political map, following the reorganisation of J&K, showed the region as belonging to India. It has, for the third time, proposed talks between the foreign secretaries on the issue, official sources said.

It had twice earlier proposed dates for dialogue on Kalapani, most recently on January 15. India was perhaps constrained by the fact that foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale is retiring this month but Nepal is hoping that with his successor Harsh Vardhan Shringla taking charge next week, India will finally agree to having a dialogue on Kalapani.

The Nepal government continues to maintain that Kalapani, located at the India-Nepal-China trijunction, is a part of Nepal and allowing the issue to fester will not help bilateral ties. Nepal foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali was quoted as saying in Kathmandu on Friday that if India could resolve its boundary issues with Bangladesh, it could certainly do the same with Nepal.

Gyawali went on to say that the issue needed to be settled “so that no unresolved baggage can be the obstacle for cordial relations between Nepal and India’’.

“Nepal’s current boundary was demarcated, fixed by the Sugauli Treaty of 1816 and the consecutive complementary treaties of December 1816, 1860 and 1875. There are three other agreements which are related to the treaty which categorically say that Nepal’s western border is demarcated by the Kali river… so in the historical evidence (sic), documents and maps that Kali, in Nepal we call it Mahakali river, is the western boundary river of Nepal,” Gyawali said.

“So, Nepal wants to settle this unresolved or pending issue according to the Sugauli Treaty and other correspondence at that time, historical maps and evidence. I do believe that both the countries have strong political stability, leaders are visionary and they have good personal contacts as well and commitment to resolve pending issues through diplomatic process,"" he added.

Significantly, the Nepal foreign minister said Nepal was not just ready but also “very, very eager’’ to have the next Saarc summit. Nepal is well aware that India is unlikely to yield to any call for an early Saarc summit because of its strained ties with Pakistan over the issue of cross-border terrorism. The summit, which was to be held in Pakistan in 2016, was delayed as India refused to participate because of the involvement of terrorists from across LoC in the Uri attack which left 19 Indian soldiers dead.

450,['25/01/2020'],40% of girls aged 15-18 not attending school: Report,"This story is from January 25, 2020

NEW DELHI: Ten years after the Right to Education (RTE) Act came into being, nearly 40% of adolescent girls in the age group of 15-18 years are not attending school while 30% of girls from poorest families have never set foot in a classroom, according to status report.

According to the report by Right to Education Forum and Centre for Budget Policy Studies with support of the World Bank and UNICEF , poor compliance of RTE —12.7% across India— has been primarily due to the downward trend in financing school education which has come down from 4.14% in 2014-15 to 3.40% in 2019-20.

RTE Act of 2019 mandates compulsory education for children between the age of 6-14 years under Article 21A of the Constitution.

The report also cited that education and empowerment index are directly related to per-child expenditure. Kerala tops the index with a spending of Rs 11,574 per child per year with Bihar at the bottom with a spending of just Rs 2,869. Himachal Pradesh , with a spending of Rs 17,921 per child per year, features second among 17 large states.

The report released on the occasion of International Day of Education and National Girl Child Day on Friday stated that while Sustainable Development Goals seek to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls, India is home to millions of ‘out-of-school’ children, with girls accounting for a substantial chunk. Raising concerns over the fact that girls are twice less likely as boys to receive at least four years of schooling, 30% of girls from the economically disadvantaged groups have never set foot inside a classroom. The literacy rate of women in India is only at 65%.

According to Ambarish Rai, national convenor, RTE Forum, with over 60 million children lacking education in India, insufficient funding for school education has been the bottleneck in achieving benefits under the RTE Act “which is an important tool for universalisation of elementary education”. “The status of girls’ education in the country is a matter of grave concern,” he said.

As per the report, studies have shown strong correlation between public investment in education and child development and empowerment. The report said each additional year of schooling raises earning by 8%-10% (with larger increase for women), meaning that education not only helps to grow the economy but also fight poverty.

Among the 17 states cited in the report, 11 states whose EEI has been 0.5 or more are those which spent Rs 6,000 or more per child annually.

Highlighting the fact that states alone cannot deal with the need for higher public expenditure to meet education goals laid out in the National Education Policy, the report raised concern over excessive dependence on education cess.

“Cess is an emergency and variable source of government funding meant to aid and cushion expenditure sources from tax revenue/ budgetary support. Since 2015, with the decline of budgetary support for education expenditure, cess funded 70% of the total education expenditure. This means that the emergency cess has become a regular way of funding,” it said.

NEW DELHI: Throwing their weight behind the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Population Register and the National Register of Citizens , over 150 prominent citizens have written to President Ram Nath Kovind seeking action against “forces” resorting to violence in the name of CAA.

These citizens want the government to take steps to “protect democratic institutions” and the letter has been endorsed by former judges, civil servants, armed forces officers, academics and doctors. It was submitted to the President after a delegation met him on Friday.

“We strongly feel that there is also an external dimension to the disturbances being created. We, therefore, request the government to look into this matter with all seriousness and safeguard the democratic institutions of the country and take stern action against such forces,” they said.

The list of signatories includes 72 bureaucrats , including former defence secretary Yogendra Narain , former chief secretaries of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Kerala, Manipur and Puducherry among others. Fifty-six armed forces officers, including former deputy chief of Army Gurmeet Singh, also signed the letter.

Angeline Rachel

COIMBATORE: A student from Tamil Nadu pursuing a PG course in Canada ’s York University was stabbed by a suspected stalker on her way back home from the institute on Thursday. She was admitted to an intensive care facility and is believed to be critical. The suspect has been arrested.

Canadian authorities who contacted the parents of Angeline Rachel, 23, from Coonoor in Nilgiris, have advised them to come to Canada immediately. The parents are waiting for their visas and are likely to leave on Saturday. Foreign minister S Jaishankar has asked MEA officials to help with the family’s visa request.

Rachel, who was pursuing a one-year course in masters in supply chain management, was staying in an apartment near the university. She is scheduled to complete the course in April.

“My daughter was an outstanding student. She did her schooling in Coonoor and completed her UG at Christ University, Bengaluru. She was working for three years before she got selected for the PG programme,” said her father Albert Rajkumar. “She was very active on social media and a student who seemed like an Indian would often disturb her on social media. I spoke to my daughter on Thursday morning (IST) and she was fine. But later that night, we got a call from Canadian authorities saying that she was stabbed by an unidentified man who looked like an Indian,” Rajkumar said.

“The suspect has been arrested by the Canadian police,” he added.

454,['25/01/2020'],Getting smarter: Vizag bags two awards at Smart Cities conference,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The city has won two significant awards at the 3rd Apex Conference of Smart Cities. Represented by the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC), Visakhapatnam got an award in the ‘recognition of performance’ category as well as under the ‘innovative idea’ category for its 2MW floating solar plant on Mudasarlova reservoir.

M Vinay Kumar, superintending engineer, GVMC ( smart city ) said that the civic body has proposed projects worth Rs 1,050 crore. “Projects worth Rs 278 crore have already been completed while projects worth Rs 450 crore are under various phases of execution,” he said.

The 2 MW floating solar power project, which was set up with about Rs 13.4 crore on Mudasarlova, has been saving nearly Rs 2.3 crore on electricity bills annually. According to the GVMC officials, the solar floating power projects reduce demand for land and make use of the unutilised surface area of the reservoir. The solar panels will also help in reducing water evaporation from the reservoir to an extent, they informed.

Meanwhile, at a time when the state government is set on branching out capital powers among three cities of Andhra Pradesh instead of the incumbent capital Amaravati , the latter has received an award under the ‘recognition of performance’ category.

Amaravati ranked first among all 100 smart cities in spending the funds released by the Union government under the Smart Cities Mission. However, the overall rank of the city witnessed a decline, as it slipped from the 10th place in February 2019 to the 19th place in January 2020.

Speaking to TOI on the sidelines of the conference, P Lakshmi Narasimhan, commissioner of Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority said that the Amaravati Smart and Sustainable City Corporation Limited had proposed various projects worth Rs 2,050 crore.

Seven different awards have been conferred upon smart cities under seven themes. Besides these seven awards, the best performers from winning cities of each round of the Smart Cities Mission challenge walked away with ‘recognition of performance’ awards.

These cities include Visakhapatnam and Ahmedabad from among round-1 cities, Vadodara, Ranchi and Kanpur from among round-2 cities, Sagar, Amaravati and Rajkot from among round-3 cities and Erode from among round-4 cities.

Visakhapatnam: The Smart Cities Mission (SCM) is just the beginning of what Indian cities are going to be, said Durga Shanker Mishra, secretary, ministry of housing and urban affairs. Mishra was speaking at the two-day 3rd Apex Conference of Smart Cities being held in Visakhapatnam.

Speaking to the media, Mishra said, “We think of smart cities as lighthouses. If you ask me why only 100 smart cities, I can say that you cannot have so many laboratories. These 100 laboratories are going to come up with new models, things, initiatives which can be replicated in other cities.”

“The SCM has witnessed tremendous progress in implementation of projects in the last one and half years. There has been a 223% growth in the number of projects tendered, 285% growth in projects grounded and 387% growth in number of projects completed,” he added.

Mishra further said that works of 45 integrated command and control centres have already been completed and have been made operational under SCM.

“32 more ICCCs are at various stages of implementation. 155 smart road projects have been completed and 395 smart road projects are at the tender/implementation stage. Similarly, the smart solar, smart water and vibrant public spaces projects are heading towards progressive paths,” said Mishra.

The secretary of ministry of housing and urban affairs also discussed the way SCM has progressed over the years. He said that the first apex conference was organised in Bhopal in May, 2018 to give a boost to implementation of smart city projects, peer-to-peer learning which was followed by the second conference in New Delhi in February, 2019.

Visakhapatnam: In what comes as a major win for the Port City’s road safety situation, official data have shown that nearly 90% two-wheeler riders in the city are wearing helmets. Both the road transport authority (RTA) and the city traffic police have attributed this positive development to effective policing.

Speaking to TOI, GC Raja Ratnam, deputy transport commissioner, RTA said, “We have registered 90% helmet usage among two-wheeler riders in the city. This has been possible with the collective efforts of all stakeholders and public support.”

He further said, “Our intention has never been to just collect fines. We have sought to inculcate the practice of wearing helmets as safety gear to prevent road mishaps.”

M Ramesh Kumar (ADCP, traffic) said that traffic cops no longer stop people violating the helmet rule. Instead, the cops take pictures of those violating the rule, he said.

Nearly 530 traffic cops are engaged in regulating traffic in the city daily. Of these, 300 cops check to see if people are wearing helmets and take pictures of those violating the rule.

“We send around 2,000 challans to rule violators with a penalty of Rs 135 per violation. The efforts have helped us get desired results,” Kumar told TOI.

A campaign focussed on making people wear helmets was launched in October 2019. Since then, the police have been conducting vigorous checks and are imposing penalties.

A significant number of such drives were conducted at Siripuram Junction, Jagadamba Centre, Gajuwaka, Kancharapalem, Hanumanthwaka Junction and RK Beach among other places.

The wearing of helmets while riding two-wheelers is mandatory as per Section 129 of the Motor Vehicles Act. The helmets must conform to the quality standards set by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).

457,['25/01/2020'],Tata lays claim on safest car-maker tag,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Kolkata: Tata Motors has claimed that it has the safest range of passenger cars with four products in its portfolio receiving high safety certification by Global New Car Assessment Programme (Global NCAP), a UK-based foundation that tests the level of protection for passengers in the event of a crash.

After its compact SUV Nexon and recently launched premium hatch Altroz received 5-star, the highest safety rating for adult occupant protection, two more cars — hatch Tiago and sedan Tigor — have achieved 4-star rating. This makes Tata Motors the only Indian manufacturer with four cars with high NCAP rating in its portfolio. Mahindra & Mahindra has two cars that have high safety rating: compact SUV XUV 300 that received 5-star and MPV Marazzo that was given 4-star rating.

Global NCAP had launched #SaferCarsForIndia Campaign in 2014 with the aim of promoting safer vehicles in the country. Between 2014 and 2020, Global NCAP has completed more than 37 safety assessments that have led to safety improvements of Indian cars.

Tata Motors vice-president (global design) Pratap Bose said the company was confident full-size premium SUV Harrier and the future line of products, including Gravitas, the seven-seater SUV, small SUV codenamed H2X and the sedan on the Alpha-ARC platform would achieve high safety rating from Global NCAP. Tata Motors is the only Indian car manufacturer with a crash test facility.

“We are committed to make not just stylish cars that are great to drive and ride but also the safest cars. When we upgraded the Tiago and Tigor from BS IV to BS VI, we also enhanced the safety features, including pedestrian protection features, to make the cars safer for both occupants and pedestrians,” said Bose.

Sources said efforts were underway to make the safety upgrade in all passengers cars that would continue in the portfolio, including MPV Hexa. Manufacture of Harrier, Hexa, Safari Storme and compact sedan Zest have been suspended since last month-end as the company makes the switch to comply with BS VI emission norms. The company is yet to take a call on introduction of a BS VI Zest that is popular in the commercial vehicle segment.

In fact, the company has decided not to introduce diesel variants of Tiago and Tigor as it feels the premium that one has to pay for a BS VI diesel vehicle will not make sense given the narrowing of the petrol-diesel price gap. “We will continue with diesel for premium and large vehicles with higher engine displacement for the high torque it delivers,” he said.

Three years ago, seven out of 10 cars that Tata Motors sold were diesel variants. Now, seven of them are petrol. “Going ahead, a number of cars in the portfolio will also have electric variants,” said Bose. Both the Alpha and Omega platforms are ready for electric.

Comedy of errors: Uday K Patta, youth president of Vizag Development Council tweeted the image on the left of ... Read More

Visakhapatnam: A cheetah turned into a tiger overnight. And then it had to be turned into a cheetah again by the city’s civic body.

Towards the end of the year, the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( GVMC ) was busy revamping the Beach Road in preparation for Visakha Utsav. In course of the attempt, a cheetah’s statue got painted with black and yellow stripes of a Royal Bengal Tiger.

Locals were irked at this transformation. Their familiar cheetah statue was donning the skin of the tiger.

Consequently, a complaint was lodged with the GVMC, asking them to fix the mess.

One such irked resident was Uday Kiran Patta. Speaking to TOI, Patta said, “The cheetah statue has been there for the last 10-12 years. It was ridiculous. The shape of the statue is slim like a cheetah’s body and in no way looks like a tiger.”

TOI asked civic body officials what made them turn the cheetah into a tiger. Officials said that the colours on the statue had faded when they went to repaint it. They assumed that statue was that of a tiger and re-painted it with black and yellow stripes by mistake.

“But once we received the complaint on our Twitter handle on January 9, we immediately decided to take action. However, it took a few days to repaint the statue because of the Sankranti holidays,” said a GVMC official.

Once the statue was fixed and the leopard cheetah, Patta, who is the youth president of Vizag Development Council re-tweeted his earlier tweet and thanked municipal commissioner G Srijana for the restoration.

VISAKHAPATNAM: The Navy sailors involved in the alleged espionage case provided vital information like movement of warships and submarines to Pakistan’s ISI, according to National Investigation Agency (NIA) sources.

A 47-year-old woman from Mumbai, identified as Sheikh Shahista, was the key conduit in sending money to the accused through hawala channel, the sources added.

It may be recalled that NIA had taken custody of 13 persons for five days with the permission of the court. The 13 include the 10 sailors, a hawala operator from Mumbai identified as Sayyed, alias Masoom Ali, besides the woman. The five days of custody ended on Thursday.

During their interrogation, NIA sleuths found that the arrested sailors had passed on important information about the movement of naval warships and submarines.

The woman, who reportedly runs a garments business, used to receive money through hawala operator Sayyed, who in turn handed it over to the accused sailors. The woman, who reportedly hails from Pakistan, has been illegally staying in Mumbai for many years. The sailors were arrested on Dec 20 last year. Three of them are from the Eastern Naval Command in Visakhapatnam .

Dharwad: Against a backdrop of unrelenting opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act across the country, advocate Anup Deshpande sought to offer a contrarian perspective on the controversial law on Thursday. “CAA has been introduced in order to accord citizenship to those who have been fleeing due to religious persecution from Pakistan , Afghanistan and Bangladesh. There are no provisions in the law that needs to make people think that their Indian citizenship is in peril,” said Deshpande.

The advocate, participating in a symposium organised by the Gandhi Peace Foundation on CAA , lashed out at those opposing the Act. Dubbing critics of the Act ‘ pseudo-secularists ’, Deshpande said, “These are people acting out of ulterior motives and creating confusion about the objectives of the CAA. Gullible citizens are being incited to protest against the Centre . Those opposing the Act are either ignorant of its provisions or deliberately indulging in a campaign of misinformation to further their ends.”

Quoting Mahatma Gandhi on the subject, Desphande said that the former too had expressed a wish to accord citizenship to those willing to come to India. “He had wanted such people to enjoy a decent, dignified life here. After Partition, Pakistan declared itself as an Islamic Republic, and members belonging to minority communities such as Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Parsis were subjected to persecution. The BJP-led NDA government is doing what the previous Congress-led governments failed to by providing justice to these people,” said the advocate.

‘No rules yet on NRC’

Deshpande pointed out that the central government was yet to frame rules or guidelines for the implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC), and urged people not to fear such a prospect. “The NRC was rolled out in Assam, but will not be implemented across the country. The government will not ask citizens to furnish documents to prove their citizenship, but rumours are being spread to create confusion among the public,” he added.

Siddangouda Patil, however, sought to contradict the observations made by Deshpande. “Those coming to India from neighbouring countries are not fleeing due to religious persecution, but running away because of gross violations of human rights. They are not infiltrators. People coming to India in search of better prospects are being projected as infiltrators. There have already been reports of tents of such people in Bengaluru being demolished. They are now unemployed, and have no roof over their heads, and being left to starve,” said Patil.

He urged the government to step up efforts to identify the real infiltrators. “They are the ones who must be sent to detention centres,” said Patil, questioning the haste with which the CAA was passed in mere three days without a careful consideration of its alignment with the values of the Constitution.

“Had this Act been discussed in the public domain, we would not have witnessed such public outcry against it,” he said.

Dharwad: The weeklong spiritual, literary and cultural programmes preceding the Rathotsava at the century-old Murugha Mutt in Dharwad will commence from Sunday.

The present pontiff Sri Mallikarjun Swamiji who took over the reins in January 2010 under controversial circumstances has continued the works initiated by the founders. Apart from continuing the traditional and religious activities, he has laid emphasis on publication of books that propagate spiritualism and Basava’s philosophy.

The annual fair of Murugha Mutt is unique in the sense that apart from religious ceremonies there are events to create awareness about social and cultural issues and to promote literature and art. “In a way it is an event that promotes social and communal harmony,” said Mallikarjun Swamiji..

The celebrations began on January 21 with the lecture series on the life of Sharanas. The main functions will commence on January 26 with hoisting of the ‘Shatsthala’ flag and books release. The Mrutyunjaya-Mahant Award will be presented to business tycoon Vijay Sankeshwar on January 29. The car festival (rathotsava) will be held on January 30. Several pontiffs from various mutts in the region, political leaders, litterateurs, achievers will participate in the five-day celebrations.

Visakhapatnam: SpiceJet has agreed to start operating an exclusive cargo flight from Chennai to Kolkata via Visakhapatnam, informed members of the Andhra Pradesh Air Travellers’ Association (APATA). The cargo flight is expected to carry 20 tonnes weight daily. It is expected to start operation from February 2020, subject to approvals.

APATA has been pursuing exclusive cargo flights from Visakhapatnam for quite some time. In this regard, Vizag MP MVV Satyanarayana also spoke to various airlines for cargo flights from Visakhapatnam, given the enormous scope of exports from Vizag.

On the other hand, air cargo rates (Air India) have reduced. When the issue was brought to the notice of APATA that cargo rates of Air India in Visakhapatnam were lower than in Hyderabad, the association took up the issue with Daggubati Purandeswari, independent director of Air India Ltd.

She reportedly met the Air India CMD on Thursday and impressed upon them to reduce the rates.

463,['25/01/2020'],Belagavi traffic police mulling over proposal to make a stretch of Fort Entry Road one way,"This story is from January 25, 2020

Belagavi: The road passing through the Belagavi Fort is among the thoroughfares in the city that is particularly nightmarish for traffic police to monitor vehicular movement on, and in a bid to ease congestion there, they are contemplating turning the stretch into a one way at the fort’s entrance.

Traffic police started thinking along these lines after the defence wing in the city withdrew the traffic controller inside the fort. The land where the the fort is located belongs to the Indian military. The decision to do away with a traffic controller at the fort was taken following objections raised by the public. Consequently, traffic on this busy stretch has not been monitored for nearly a year.

Residents who use the road regularly are understandably frustrated with the traffic pile-up that has become painfully common on the thoroughfare. Ashok Chanaragi, one of the regular users, said, “The road has become a mess. There is no order to entry and exit to and from the road respectively. Motorists just come from everywhere, leading to congestion,” he said.

Chandaragi said that defence personnel who monitored traffic on the road ensured that vehicular movement was hassle-free. “There are more than 100 houses, government offices, a church, a temple and the office of the Ramakrishna Mission inside the fort, and the number of people using the road is always high. The deputy commissioner must take cognisance of the problem and appoint a traffic controller at the earliest,” he added.

Belagavi city police commissioner BS Lokeshkumar admitted to traffic police mulling over a proposal to turn the road leading to the entry of the fort into a one-way. “We are examining the viability of turning a 150m-stretch of the road into a one-way. But traffic will be allowed in both directions at the other end. We think this will ease traffic movement. If implemented, motorists will not be able to exit the fort from the entrance, rather move out from the exit gate itself.” Lokeshkumar said.

Traffic police are also considering deploying a cop outside the main entrance of the fort, where vehicles are allowed in both the directions. Lokeshkumar attributed the persisting problem to the unwillingness of the defence personnel to cooperate with them in solving it.

An official with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said that complaints from a section of the people, including residents and regular visitors to the fort, they had been compelled to remove the traffic controller at one of the entrances to the structure. “Someone has to shoulder the responsibility to manage traffic movement. The MoD is willing to deploy a traffic controller at the entrance even now, but the Belagavi police commissioner will have to make a formal request to that effect,” the official told TOI.

Belagavi: Exhorting farmers to adopt organic methods of agriculture, deputy chief minister Laxman Savadi on Friday emphasised the role of ryots in creating a healthy society.

Savadi, who flagged off the ‘Millet Walk’ here on Friday, said that the state government was trying to convince farmers to increasingly take to organic modes of cultivation. Millet Walk is being held as a curtain raiser for the two-day Millet Mela beginning from Saturday.

Savadi, Karnataka agriculture minister, rued the excessive reliance of farmers on pesticides and chemical fertilisers, which he pointed out was detrimental to their future, besides having an adverse impact on the health of those who consumed their crops. “The use of fertilisers have also resulted in markedly reducing the fertility of the soil, and the land grows less arable as a result with each passing year,” the deputy CM said.

Dubbing organic farming a ‘healthy practice’, he said, “The need of the hour is to make more farmers aware of the benefits of organic cultivation, besides encouraging them to take up growing of millets . Increased consumption of organic food helps people stay healthy.”

Savadi called on farmers and residents of Belagavi to ensure the success of the Millet Mela.

The action won applause from Worli MLA Aaditya Thackeray.

MUMBAI: Declaring war on the city-wide eyesore of dangling overhead utility wires, over 1.2km of unauthorised cables were removed by civic authorities from trees, poles, monorail pillars and every other conceivable perch in a special drive over the last fortnight in Lower Parel, Worli , and Haji Ali areas.

Teams from G South ward visited Pandurang Budhkar Marg, Dr Annie Besant Road, Senapati Bapat Marg and N M Joshi Marg with an electrician to cut off cables. BMC plans to carry on the drive.

The action immediately won accolades from local MLA and minister Aaditya Thackeray. ""Most important for all our cities across Maharashtra. Illegal overhead wires and cables to be removed,"" he tweeted.

The BMC rule book clearly states that overhead cables are illegal and should be laid underground after obtaining the required permissions. The action came after civic authorities had repeatedly asked service providers over the past few months to take the cables underground. Sharad Ughade, assistant municipal commissioner of G South ward said overhead cables are permitted only as an emergency arrangement. ""In all other cases, permission should be taken to lay cables underground,"" he said.

Civic officials said the dangling overhead cables are a threat to oversize motor vehicles as well as flying birds but are preferred over trenching as it involves no road excavation and reinstatement.

466,['25/01/2020'],3 documentaries critical of govt snubbed for film fest?,"MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday called for records pertaining to the selection process of three documentaries at the Mumbai International Film Festival (MIFF) after a petition alleged that the three were rejected as they are critical of the Centre. The festival is to be held from January 28 to February 3.The petition by awarding-winning documentary filmmakers Anand Patwardhan and Pankaj Kumar, urged the high court to direct MIFF, the Films Division of India, and the I&B ministry to screen their documentaries.The petition states that Patwardhan’s film Vivek (also titled Reason) covers the murders of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar, Communist leader Govind Pansare , Kannada writer MM Kalburgi and journalist Gauri Lankesh , investigating the connection of these crimes to sectarian outfits. It states that it also looks at the violent attacks on Muslims and Dalits in the name of cow protection, caste-based discrimination that led to the suicide of student leader Rohith Vemula at Hyderabad University, and “numerous other outbursts of violence… connecting them to present an overview of the turmoil that India is presently witnessing”.Pankaj Kumar’s Janani’s Juliet follows the story of a Puducherry theatre group, which disturbed by a spate of honour killings, sets out to introspect the implications of caste, class and gender. His other entry, Two Flags, chronicles the life and politics of Puducherry.Senior advocate Mihir Desai, for the duo, said in court, “We don’t know if they were viewed and rejected or not viewed at all. Out of the three films, two were shortlisted for the Oscars… According to me, they have been rejected because they are critical of the ruling dispensation.” Additional solicitor general Anil Singh and advocate Advait Sethna, representing the Films Division and the I&B ministry, said the filmmakers had agreed to abide by festival regulations and participated in the selection process till the results were out. “Now, at the fag end, when the film is not selected, you file a petition challenging the regulations,” said Singh.The bench, of Justices Satyaranjan Dharmadhikari and Riyaz Chagla, referred to Patwardhan’s earlier challenges to “arbitrary restrictions” on his films and ensuing landmark judgments. The judges remarked that Patwardhan’s works were kept away even during non-BJP governments. “He is apprehensive because of the content. (That) the content (will not be) allowed to be exhibited at all,” said Justice Dharmadhikari.To a court query, Singh replied, “We have viewed all the films for their presentation, treatment, technology and overall impact.” The judges said selection process records of the three films in question must be produced on Monday. “If the selection committee has seen them, we’ll accept it. We are not going to curtail anybody’s freedom to select,” said Justice Dharmadhikari. “Some are lucky on occasion, others are not so lucky.

Representative image

MUMBAI: A Ukrainian national, Nataliya Yesauenko (34), approached the Bombay high court to challenge 'repeated' short-term visas issued to her and argued that she was eligible for a long-term five-year visa as she has been in India since seven years.

On Friday, she argued in person that she had applied for the extension in time and questioned a Rs 5,000 penalty for 'overstaying' by a couple of months.

A bench of Justice S C Dharmadhikari and Justice Riyaz Chagla asked the Centre to issue the visa at regular visa fees and not impose the penalty.

The high court will pass orders on January 27.

The Centre's counsel, Sandesh Patil and DP Singh, argued that Yesauenko has 'violated' the spouse visa condition by having worked in the 2016 film 'Mohenjo Daro' as she is prohibited from taking up work or doing business on this visa.

The government's affidavit also said that ""she continues to work in contravention of the Foreigners Act with utter disrespect for the law of the land"" and she ""keeps changing"" her residence. But Yesauenko claimed that they had showed no proof that she was working in India.

The HC bench said, ""We will ensure right now that you are not thrown out of India. They (Foreigners Regional Registration Officers) are giving you a three-month visa and within that time, they will consider your application for the five-year visa."" Yesauenko insisted that she would not pay the penalty since she had applied in time last June, but Patil said the visa application was considered filed when she submitted all documents, two months later, hence the additional amount. But she argued that they wanted to 'extort' documents and money from her.

In her petition, Yesauenko had said that she had come to India in July 2013 on a tourist visa, and in November, it was converted for a year to a Spouse 'X' category visa after she ""converted to Hindu religion...and got married"" in August 2013.

MUMBAI: The city economic offences wing (EOW) has arrested a family of three, including a development officer attached to the Borivili branch of a prominent insurance firm, his wife - a clerk in the same branch - and their son, for duping dozens of investors after promising to double their money in 90 days.

The fraud amount, currently estimated at Rs 12 crore, is likely to go up to Rs 50 crore, said police.

Those arrested include Sanjay Rasal, 55, Reshma, 49, and Yash, 24.

Sanju Pandit, an insurance agent, had lodged a complaint with the MHB police in November 2019 stating he had lost Rs 46 lakh in a Ponzi scheme run by the Rasals. He said Rasal convinced him to invest in a scheme floated by Keshneel Enterprises.

He assured investors double returns within 90 days and said his son was a director and proprietor of the firm. ""Initially, the complainant invested a small amount and he got double returns within 90 days. He again invested and, gradually, more insurance agents joined the scheme,"" added an officer.

Rasal stopped paying the investors in July 2018.

Shah claims Delhi’s water quality poorest in country

NEW DELHI: Pledging to make Delhi the world’s best capital if BJP wins the assembly polls, Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday said BJP would spend Rs 1 lakh crore to improve the city’s civic infrastructure if voted to office.At Shiv Vihar in Mustafabad constituency, Shah said, “Modi has done so much for Delhi... but we can’t improve your roads or construct parks in unauthorised colonies or schools or set up dispensaries, as these projects can be implemented by the state government and need around Rs 1 lakh crore. Modi government aims to spend this money for Delhi. If we win the election, all efforts will be made to improve the quality of air and reduce pollution.”Speaking at a rally in Mustafabad, Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday highlighted the need to overhaul roads and improve the quality of water and condition of schools in the city. “While coming to Mustafabad, it was difficult to find a road between the potholes,” he said sarcastically.Shah questioned AAP government’s plan to clean up the Yamuna. “It is still dirty. We aim to develop the riverfront and arrange for permanent ghats so that the people of Mustafabad and neighbouring constituencies don’t have to go for makeshift arrangements every year during Chhath Puja,” he said.On city government’s free power and water schemes, he said: “People are getting bills of Rs 5,000-Rs 6,000 despite the scheme promising free power till 200 units. Kejriwal government claims to supply water in all colonies, but its quality is the poorest in the country.”Shah accused the Kejriwal government of not implementing various Central schemes, fearing it will earn praise for PM Narendra Modi.He said under Ayushman Bharat scheme, people can get health treatment up to Rs 5 lakh, but the city government doesn’t want Delhiites to get its benefits. “We introduced 112 schemes for public welfare, especially for the poor, including Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna. But Delhiites are not getting their benefits due to the adamant attitude of the state government. We promise to provide two-room-set houses in place of jhuggis and implement Ayushman Bharat scheme and PM Awas Yojana in Delhi after winning the elections,” said Shah.He said Modi government had provided ownership rights to 50 lakh residents of 1,731 unauthorised colonies in Delhi, something that neither Congress nor AAP could do.“In fact, they were dilly dallying... After winning Lok Sabha elections, we took the responsibility and started the process of giving ownership rights to people in the unauthorised colonies. Over 70,000 people have already applied for registry,” he added.Shah addressed backto-back meetings in Karawal Nagar and Mustafabad.“This fight is between those (Kejriwal government) who do not fulfil their promises and those (BJP) who do more than they promise,” Shah said. “They promised to construct colleges and schools, bring in 5,000 DTC buses and install 15 lakh CCTV cameras, but I couldn’t find any camera on the roads here. AAP claims to have improved the education system but their results in Class IX show something else,” said Shah.Attacking AAP and Congress over CAA, Shah said a third of people in Delhi were refugees from Pakistan and Delhiites accepted them like brothers. “They (AAP and Congress) started inciting Muslims and instigating riots in Delhi. They are still saying — we support Shaheen Bagh. Congress leaders visit Shaheen Bagh regularly,” he said.Shah highlighted Modi government’s achievements in abrogation of Article 370 and securing a positive Supreme Court judgment for constructing Ram temple in Ayodhya in four months.”For 500 years, all Indians wanted a Ram temple in Ayodhya. But whenever the case came up for hearing, Rahul Baba and his lawyer, Kapil Sibal, obstructed it. Now a towering, grand Ram temple will be constructed in Ayodhya in four months.”Shah accused Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi of backing the “Tukde Tukde gang”. “We have sent such people behind bars.

MUMBAI: BMC plans to be the main sponsor of the 11th World Wilderness Congress to be held in Jaipur from March 19-26, and spend nearly Rs 4.4 crore to showcase Mumbai's flora and fauna, along with the wildlife at the civic-run Byculla zoo, a decision that has run into criticism from the opposition. Objecting to the plan, opposition leaders said ""showcasing the city's wilderness is not BMC's primary duty"".

On January 22, the BMC had tabled the sponsorship proposal at the standing committee meet, along with a plan to display the exhibition at Byculla zoo after the Jaipur meet. The proposal was not taken up for discussion; it is expected to be tabled again next week. ""Through the exhibition...delegates from across the country will get to know that Mumbai is not a concrete jungle, but has greenery, including a national park. This is very rare for a mega metropolis,"" said a civic official.

Opposition party leader Ravi Raja of Congress said the money could instead be used for development works in the city. ""This is a waste of taxpayers' money for an event that is not taking place in the city,"" he said. NCP leader Rakhi Jadhav said showcasing Mumbai's wildlife is not BMC's core competency. ""They would have to hire an event management firm... which means additional expense. We plan to oppose the plan when tabled next week."" SP leader Rais Shaikh said he too was ""not in favour of the sponsorship plan"".

AMARAVATI: The decision of the AP government to shift the capital out of Amaravati has raised concerns over the future of the proposed Amaravati-Anantapur expressway . Notification for land acquistion for the project had been published in 2019 and the state government had agreed to bear 50 per cent of the cost of land acquisition and obtain statutory clearances for environment, forests and wildlife.The project, which is a partnership between the central and state governments, proposes a greenfield expressway connecting Amaravati with the Rayalaseema region and was floated to accelerate industrial development and generate employment in drought-affected districts in the state. The route will also minimise travel time and was intended to have brought the Rayalaseema districts closer to Amaravati. Senior state government officials are of the opinion that the Centre will raise queries about the project as it is yet to formally take off. ""Although Amaravati will continue to be the legislative capital under the new scheme of things, vehicular movement may not be as dense as estimated in the draft plans,"" said a senior official on condition of anonymity. Local farmers, meanwhile, have already raised objections over the land acquisition process for the project.Minister for energy, forest and environment Balineni Srinivasa Reddy said, ""We will convince the Centre and go ahead with the project after readying the detailed project report (DPR)."" The state government has already directed district collectors of Guntur, Prakasam, Kurnool, Kadapa and Anantapur to publish the draft notification for land acquisition by January 29 after completing a survey.Sources said the plan for the expressway is believed to have changed after YSR Congress assumed power in the state.

Police cover the statue of Periyar E V Ramasamy at Kaliyapettai near Salavakkam in Kancheepuram district

CHENNAI: Miscreants early on Friday vandalised a statue of Dravidian stalwart and social reformer Periyar E V Ramasamy at Kaliyapettai near Salavakkam in Kancheepuram district .

The right hand of the statue was found broken and there were minor cracks on the head, police said.

The incident came to light around 6.15am when a resident found the statue damaged. The defaced portions have been covered. A huge posse of policemen has been deployed at the spot. Senior police officers visited the scene and carried out a detailed investigation.

Villagers, who gathered at the scene, alleged that fans of actor Rajinikanth could be behind the incident. Some of them condemned the daring act. However, police pacified the villagers, promising action against those responsible.

Local functionaries of Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi lodged a complaint with the Salavakkam police following the incident. Police are examining CCTV camera footage in the locality and further investigations are on to trace the culprits.

The 4-ft tall statue was installed by local residents in 1988 and was inaugurated by Dravidar Kazhagam leaders.

The incident has come in the wake of organisations gearing to hold protests against Rajinikanth for his recent speech regarding the antisuperstition rally attended by Periyar in Salem in 1971. Security was also stepped up at the actor’s residence in Poes Garden here to prevent untoward incidents. Police personnel have been deployed near some other statues in Kancheepuram district.

Meanwhile, DGP J K Tripathy warned that police will take strict action against antisocial elements who vandalise statues of Periyar or those of other leaders in the state.

Pt Jasraj

KOLKATA: The lemon-yellow-flecked rays of the winter sun streams in like an uninvited guest, bathing the silver strands of his hair in an iridescent chiaroscuro. His weathered face glows with the golden stripes cast by the lazy morning sun. Slowly, he takes a sip of his coffee, bites into a multigrain bread toast, lifts his head and smiles, saying: “Jai Ho!”

A lot changes with age. More so, when one is knocking 90. The lists of don’ts increase, almost exponentially. Yet, what makes Pt Jasraj uniquely different from his peers is his ability to perform as perhaps the oldest globetrotting musician of the world. Few can fathom how he still manages to travel across continents, reach a concert venue way before time, sit upright for more than an hour, remember the bandishes, sing in tune and keep listeners transfixed.

Searching for his elixir, he insists, is an exercise in futility. One has to first understand his approach towards art to fathom how he has been doing it all from the age of 22, when he gave his first public concert at the darbar of King Tribhuvan Bir Bikram Shah of Nepal. As remuneration, he had received 5,000 mohurs — an amount that was more than what he could count then.

Those days of receiving mohurs have vanished. Today, acknowledgement comes in the form of a minor planet (Panditjasraj, which whirls between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter) being named after him. It is numbered 300128 — a nod to the day he was born, January 28, 1930.

That recognition is extra special, since a minor planet has also been named after Rabindranath Tagore. “Well, Gurudev will always remain where he is. But a recognition that associates me with him makes me happy,” he smiles.

Ask him what his dreams are now made of, and he gives a dismissive smile. “I have started getting what I had never dreamt of. That’s why I have given up on dreaming.” So, how would he want to be remembered 100 years from now? “Honestly, I don’t want to dwell on that. If people remember, it’s fine. If they don’t, that’s fine as well,” he says, in a detached way.

But he loves talking about how performing on stage is akin to a game of hockey. “There are days when I can understand that I am singing well and there is very good coordination with my students, which the audience is receiving well. We are a part of a team playing a game of hockey. I catch something and then pass it on to someone, who dribbles with it and then we will score a goal,” he says, eyes twinkling with childlike innocence.

However, describing how he feels while walking from the greenroom to the stage is difficult. “Sometimes, I can’t even recognise known people and they get puzzled. The mind is then in automatic gear,” he says, eating a slice of ripe papaya.

Some four or five times, the walk back from the stage to the greenroom had become a meditative experience. On those occasions, he completed his performance and left the stage without saying anything. Once inside the greenroom, he either went completely silent or started to weep.

Has he ever experienced that in Kolkata? “No,” he says. “The listeners’ love is so overwhelming that one can’t cross over and be aloof.” But Kolkata, he insists, has given him a lot. Memories of doing 14 hours of riyaaz during his stay in the city as a 20-year-old, the encouragement that he received from Som Tiwari (he addressed her as Ammaji) who was a disciple of his ‘bade bhaisaab’ (Pt Maniram) and the camaraderie with Dr Mukund Lath are fresh in mind. Back then, he used to play the tabla but good friend Ujjwal Roy would say he shouldn’t, as that would not help him grow as a vocalist. “They protected me and were like a banyan tree,” he recalls.

Then, there are memories of attending nightlong concerts, standing on tramlines.

On one occasion, he remembers 10,000 people had gathered outside Basusree to get a glimpse of Pt Ravi Shankar. “The last performer had taken more time, leaving only 45 minutes for Dada (Pt Ravi Shankar). Once over, the crowd wanted to catch a glimpse of him, but the organiser suggested he leave through the backdoor. However, Motilal Ranga and I, who were there with him in the greenroom, suggested that he go down,” he recalls.

His eyes still glisten when he remembers how Ranga had picked Shankar up and placed him on his head. “Dada sat in the lotus pose and soon he was transported from one person’s head to that of another while moving in front of Basusree in a circle,” he remembers, adding, “I do not think any artiste will experience this ever again. Recently, I had a similar experience in Rajkoth, where some 11,000 people waited outside with 2,000 inside the theatre. Their love was palpable and I sang for some two-and-a-half hours.”

It is evident that he has perfected the art of keeping the audience engrossed without diluting the purity of form. “Those who dilute on purpose will go the wrong way. But if deviations happen spontaneously, there are chances of something good emerging out of it,” he says.

Does he like listening to music himself? “Yes, I listen to everyone across the board,” he says, emphasising on Lata Mangeshkar. “She is the only lady whose songs are sung by four generations.”

Does he see any rationale behind sticking to time-based ragas when one is performing indoors? “There is something in the air during an hour which goes with the raga. When we record ragas inside the studio, we do not follow timings. It’s not that much of a great experience for the performer. But the listener derives a lot of pleasure if the same raga is played, keeping the timing in mind.”

Dissecting such experiences to find the reasons no longer interests him. Staring at the sliver of light peeping through the window, he wants to talk about the deeply spiritual process of transmission of music. “Many say that my face changes when I start singing. I don’t know about that, but one thing is certain. I neither sing, nor do you listen. It is the Almighty who sings and listens. Only the Supreme Power is aware of how and in which form the sound travels from the microphone to the audience.”

Half-closing his eyes, he talks about the strange experience on good performance days, when people come backstage and say: ‘Aaj kya ho gaya Panditji?’ Then, there have been days of overwhelming response from the audience when, in reality, he has struggled to hunt for a sur to be woven into raga. Reclining his head a little while bathing in the mellow light, he softly starts to hum a bandish and then pauses. “That’s when I realise that it is neither me who is singing nor the audience that is listening. We are mere instruments doing what the Almighty wants done,” he says.

KOLKATA: None of them are star-kids. Yet, the sound of their music has already travelled far and wide.

He has already performed in 18 countries and has represented India at the United Nations Congress 2012 (Bahrain), where he performed in front of the then UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and His Excellency the King of Bahrain. “I also conceived a new form of recital called Dhrupad Sarod, where the sarod is accompanied by a pakhawaj. I have presented this recital in front of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Debanjan says.Why we should watch out for himHe is one of the most promising torchbearers of the Maihar gharana. He has got good talim and his music is a beautiful blend of both technical brilliance and aesthetic appeal. He is very good with laya and maintains a good balance between melody and rhythm. The fact that he took up music as a career despite being a qualified engineer also shows his seriousness and passion for our music — Pt Tejendra Narayan Majumdar | sarod playerAyan Sengupta | sitar playerAge | 29Gharana | Senia MaiharDisciple of | Pt Partha Chatterjee,Pt Ajoy ChakrabortyAbout him | An ITC Sangeet Research Academy musician scholar, Ayan has been pursuing music from the age of eight. In 2003, he won the Government of India’s junior scholarship. “I started learning from my grandfather, Subimal Sengupta, and have also received lessons from Pt Manilal Nag and Pt Kushal Das,” Ayan says. Described as a sensitive, serious and hardworking musician, Ayan has also performed at various concerts in India, the UK and Bangladesh. He has also been a part of a television show, where he was a part of a band by sitarist Purbayan Chatterjee.Why we should watch out for himAyan has tremendous potential to grow into a responsible sitar player if he continues with his present thought process, his riyaaz and the assimilation of all the repertoire he has acquired so far while exploring further depths of Indian music, including sitar music. I like his maturity, which is seen through his thehrao (poise). At a time when plenty of compromises are being done by youngsters to achieve quick popularity, Ayan stands out because of his seriousness and restraint. People with such qualities last longer in the music scene — Pt Nayan Ghosh | sitaristHe shows great promise.

In 2001, he went to Australia to play at the Woodford Folk Festival. Last year, he performed in Paris at a tribute concert to legends Pandit Ravi Shankar and Phillip Glass. “The concert had six Indian musicians along with Anoushka Shankar and the Orchestre de Chamber de Paris. Together, we presented all the compositions from Panditji and Phillip Glass’s world famous album titled Passages,” said Pratik, who has also been invited to perform at the forthcoming centenary concert for Panditji in the UK and the US.Why we should watch out for himAmong young sarod players, I like his sense of aesthetics.

Subsequently, he joined Shrutinandan and then ITC Sangeet Research Academy as a junior scholar. A rare talent, Anubhab’s YouTube video has received more than 2 lakh views. Curiously enough, many have even misidentified him as Pt Bhimsein Joshi’s grandson. “I am a student of Mathurapur High School and will write my HS exams this year. My guruji insists I maintain my individuality. That’s what I try to do,” Anubhab says.Why we should watch out for himMusically, Anubhab is extremely gifted. He doesn’t have the mind-set of learning music to become famous. I would want him to shape up as a unique musician.

479,['25/01/2020'],"Immigrants entering B’desh up, but it’s no exodus: BSF","This story is from January 25, 2020

Kolkata: The number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants trying to leave India through the porous land border has increased substantially but does not amount to an “exodus-like situation”, Border Security Force has said.

BSF troops along the 913-km south Bengal frontier apprehended 268 Bangladeshi nationals — nearly 90% of them going back to Bangladesh from India — in the first 23 days of 2020, BSF inspector-general (South Bengal Frontier) Y B Khurania said in Kolkata on Friday. Most of them used the international border in North 24 Parganas’ Ghojadanga, he added.

Prodded by journalists whether this rise could be attributed to the CAA, Khurania said that might be the case. “We believe that it is because of our increased vigil that fewer people from Bangladesh are trying to enter India illegally. Most of those without valid documents apprehended by us near the border were on their way out. But there seems to be no exodus-like situation. We apprehended 1,677 Bangladeshis without valid papers in 2018 (or a daily average of 4.5) and 2,194 in 2019 (or a daily average of 6) and most of them were India-bound. But, in 2020, we have already apprehended 268 Bangladeshis and 90% of them were returning to Bangladesh,” Khurania said. This amounts to almost 12 people daily.

Officials said the figures pertained to the south Bengal frontier (about a fourth of the total length of the India-Bangladesh border). Fewer people may have tried to cross over to India from Bangladesh illegally, fearing detection by agencies after the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, they said, adding that was when the outward movement started.

Both Khurania and BSF deputy inspector-general (South Bengal Frontier) S S Guleria stressed that eastern border was much more difficult to manage than the west. Nearly 60% of the border remains unfenced and there are few floodlights. BSF efforts have brought down cattle-smuggling by nearly 95% but criminals have turned their attention to narcotics and use women and schoolchildren.

“We have tried to fence the border with our own resources at some places. And, at 20 locations where borderline or zero-line villages exist, we have proposed a single-row fence that will take up less space and cannot be cut. However, this fencing will have to be within 150 metres of the border. We have taken up the matter with the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) and joint inspections have been held at two locations. BGB is yet to give its consent after which work can start. We are raising awareness on prohibitory orders under Section 144 that is in place along the border,” Khurania added.
